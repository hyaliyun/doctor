An umbrella review of the available literature is needed to provide an integrated overview of current knowledge and contribute to more robust theoretical explanations of team performance. METHODS: The Web of Science (all databases), PubMed, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), Scopus, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched for relevant publications prior to 19 February 2021. Appraisal of the methodological quality of included articles was undertaken using the tool for Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2). Twenty-four studies were reviewed that met the following criteria: (1) contained relevant data from match analyses in team ball sports; (2) were defined as systematic reviews or/and meta-analyses; and (3) were written in the English language. RESULTS: The overall methodological quality of the 24 included reviews, obtained through the AMSTAR-2, revealed very low confidence ratings (Critically Low, n = 12) for the results of most systematic reviews of match analyses in team ball sports. Additionally, the results showed that research is focused mainly on four levels of analysis: (1) dyadic (microlevel); (2) individual (molecular level; predominant); (3) group (mesolevel), and (4) team dynamics (macrolevel). These levels of analysis included tactical, technical, physical, and psychosocial variables. Team performance was contextualized at two levels, with reference to: (1) match context (e.g. match status, match location, match period, quality of opposition) and (2) sociodemographic and environmental constraints (sex, age groups, competitive level, altitude, temperature, pitch surface). CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of methods for match analysis in team ball sports indicates that: (1) an individual-level performance analysis was predominant; (2) the focus on intermediate levels of analysis, observing performance in dyadic and group interactions, has received less attention from researchers; (3) neglected areas of research include psychosocial aspects of team sports and womens performance; and (4) analyses of match contexts need greater depth.

Several scientific societies have highlighted the need for dedicated paths to deliver better and faster care to improve outcomes. Nevertheless, data depicting the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on ACS in Italy are still poor. To perform a propensity weighted analysis on a multicentre Italian registry involving patients with ACS managed before vs. during COVID-19 pandemic, taking into account baseline patients characteristics, clinical presentation, procedural aspects, and in-hospital outcomes (death, bleeding, stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, mechanical complication, and arrhythmic complication). METHODS AND RESULTS: We included all consecutive patients who have suffered from ACS during two periods before (March/April 2018, March/April 2019) vs. the period of COVID-19 pandemic (March/April 2020). A generalized boosted non-parsimonious regression was used to estimate the propensity scores of having an ACS in 2020 (year of COVID-19) vs. 2018/2019 using an average treatment effect and balancing for all baseline confounders. We included 2851 patients admitted to hospital with ACS in 17 Italian centres: 1079 (37.8%) during 2018, 1056 (37.0%) in 2019, and 716 (25.1%) during the first COVID-19 wave of 2020. Seventy (2.5%) patients had a positive swab for SARS-CoV-2 at admission. During 2020 there were higher time-to-emergency-call (P = 0.028) and less diagnosis of unstable angina (P = 0.029) and MINOCA (P = 0.004); none of the admission symptoms differ significantly across the years (P > 0.05) except for fever that was more prevalent in 2020 (P < 0.001). Patients suffering from ACS had lower admission EF (P = 0.006). After PS weighting, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed age (P < 0.001), night admission (P = 0.017), cardiocirculatory arrest before cath-lab (P = 0.041), worst Killip class (P = 0.039), admission EF (P = 0.026), and need for left-ventricle mechanical support (P = 0.011) as independent predictors of in-hospital death. After propensity weighted analysis none of the in-hospital outcomes differed significantly across the years of investigation (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 pandemic in Italy the characteristics and management of ACS was slightly different than the past. However, the rates of hard, in-hospital outcomes (e.g. deaths) are almost similar to the past, suggesting appropriate care and well-organized emergency-paths for ACS.","output":"692 Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on in-hospital outcomes for patients with acute coronary syndrome: a propensity-weighted, multicentre study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intensity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a horrible ongoing human disaster with high morbidity and mortality rates.

The present study investigated the utility of absolute changes in volume (delta) or regional, segmentation-based subtractions for detecting disease progression in longitudinal MRI follow-ups. METHODS 165 high resolution 3-Tesla MRIs of 30 GB patients (23m, mean age 60.2y) were retrospectively included in this single center study. Contrast enhancement (CV) and tumor-related signal alterations in FLAIR images (FV) were semi-automatically segmented. Delta volume (dCV, dFV) and regional subtractions (sCV, sFV) were calculated. Disease progression was classified for every follow-up according to histopathologic results, decisions of the local multidisciplinary CNS tumor board and a consensus rating of the neuro-radiologic report. RESULTS A generalized logistic mixed model for disease progression (yes / no) with dCV, dFV, sCV and sFV as input variables revealed that only dCV was significantly associated with prediction of disease progression (P = .005). Delta volume had a better accuracy than regional, segmentation-based subtractions (79% versus 72%) and a higher area under the curve by trend in ROC curves (.83 versus .75). CONCLUSION Absolute volume changes of the contrast enhancing tumor part were the most accurate volumetric determinant to detect progressive disease in assessment of GB and outweighed FLAIR changes as well as regional, segmentation-based image subtractions.

METHODS In particular, we compared the binding of two used antimalarial drugs (i.e. chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) which showed some potential clinical effects in COVID-19 patients, using as positive control tree antiviral recognized compounds, ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir. RESULTS Our results showed that hydroxychloroquine but not chloroquine exhibited a significant binding activity to the main protease similar to that possessed by protease inhibitors tested for other viral infections. CONCLUSION Our data suggest that hydroxychloroquine may exert additional direct antiviral activity compared to chloroquine.

Desktops, laptops, and tablets are essential tools for communication and project management. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers have transitioned to work from home (WFH) to sustain public health emergency guidelines, and it is anticipated that many WFH jobs will be maintained post-pandemic. The transition to WFH occurred rapidly without time to establish ideal workstations. Ergonomic assessments that were typically performed in person needed to be performed using virtual technology. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this review is (1) to describe the components of a computer workstation evaluation; (2) to offer suggestions for identifying computer workstation problems that may be contributing to the client's musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and symptoms; (3) to provide suggestions that may improve the safety and comfort at the computer workstation, and (4) to suggest a method of completing the workstation analysis virtually, without onsite in-person evaluation. METHODS AND RESULTS: There is a paucity of peer-reviewed literature regarding computer workstation evaluations to be performed in person, let alone using a virtual method. The components of computer workstation evaluations have been recommended by regulatory agencies that survey injuries in the workplace. Prior to 2020, these evaluations were done in person at the office workstation. Modifications in data collection were needed to transition the analysis to a reliable virtual format.

Our aim was to analyze the incidence of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for traumatic injuries during this period. METHODS: Any visit with an ICD-10 discharge diagnosis code of burn, fracture, traumatic wound, or sprain/bruise contusion was recorded within the 2 weeks before (weeks 10 and 11) and during the confinement (weeks 12 and 19). The visits with the same ICD-10 discharge diagnosis code during similar weeks of the previous 2 years were also included. For each of those visits, the number of hospitalizations was counted. RESULTS: The number of recorded visits between week 10 and 19 in 2018, 2019, and 2020 was, respectively, 2657, 2625, and 1106 children. The average number of visits per day during the confinement (135) was significantly different from the average number of visits per day during the same weeks in 2018 and 2019 (388 vs. 399, P<0.0001). The average number of visits per day was significantly lower during confinement compared with 2018/2019 for three categories of diagnoses (P<0.0001) but not for burns (1.7 vs. 1.8, P=0.23). The average number of hospitalizations per day was significantly lower during the confinement than during 2018/2019 (1.61.3 vs. 2.61.8, P<0.0001).

ADP-ribosylation is a PTM, which occurs in two flavours: modification of a target with multiple ADP-ribose moieties (poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation or PARylation) or with only one unit (MARylation), which are added by the different enzymes of the PARP family (also known as the ARTD family). PARylation has been relatively well-studied, particularly in the DNA damage response. This has resulted in the development of PARP inhibitors such as olaparib, which are increasingly employed in cancer chemotherapeutic approaches. Despite the fact that the majority of PARP enzymes catalyse MARylation, MARylation is not as well understood as PARylation. MARylation is a dynamic process: the enzymes reversing intracellular MARylation of acidic amino acids (MACROD1, MACROD2, and TARG1) were discovered in 2013. Since then, however, little information has been published about their physiological function. MACROD1, MACROD2, and TARG1 have a macrodomain harbouring the catalytic site, but no other domains have been identified. Despite the lack of information regarding their cellular roles, there are a number of studies linking them to cancer. However, some of these publications oppose each other, some rely on poorly-characterised antibodies, or on aberrant localisation of overexpressed rather than native protein. In this review, we critically assess the available literature on a role for the hydrolases in cancer and find that, currently, there is limited evidence for a role for MACROD1, MACROD2, or TARG1 in tumorigenesis.","output":"The Controversial Roles of ADP-Ribosyl Hydrolases MACROD1, MACROD2 and TARG1 in Carcinogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Across two studies with over 1,600 U.S. adults recruited online, we present evidence that people share false claims about COVID-19 partly because they simply fail to think sufficiently about whether or not content is accurate when deciding what to share.

A number of potential future adjunctive strategies including extracorporeal CO(2) removal, partial neuromuscular blockade, and neuromuscular stimulation are also discussed. While clinical trials to confirm the benefit of these approaches are awaited, clinicians should become familiar with assessing and managing patients respiratory effort, based on existing physiological principles.

Similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) unequivocally expressed on all vital human organs, particularly on nasal/oral respiratory tract, gastrointestinal organs, innate immune cells, heart, brain and urogenital cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Activation of T2Rs by bitter agonists restores vital functions to these organs via activation of large conductance, Ca2+-dependent potassium (K+) channels (BKca), and inducible nitric oxide synthase. T2R activation in the gustatory system can act as the first defence mechanism, primarily preventing or mitigating SARS-CoV-2 entry to the respiratory tract. Moreover, T2R activation is crucial for the improved vasodilation accompanied by the attenuation of systemic inflammation; hyper-innate immune responses; gastrointestinal disorders; defective neurological functions; acute kidney injury; and impotency witnessed in severe SARS-CoV-2 cases.

The study aimed to assess the role of information sources, education level, and phone internet connectivity in influencing COVID-19 knowledge among the rural market vendors; and the relationship existing between knowledge, attitude, and practices among them. Methods: The study was a descriptive cross-sectional study among rural market vendors (n = 248) in southwestern Uganda. Information was collected using a questionnaire and descriptively presented as frequency and percentages. Results: The study showed that the majority of the rural market vendors had sufficient information regarding COVID-19 with the majority being female individuals and have attained a secondary level of education, The general percentage score for knowledge, attitude, and practices were (75.57, 82.6, and 76.50% respectively). There was a positive correlation between attitude and practices (r = 0.17, p = 0.007), as well as their knowledge with practices (r = 0.29, p < 0.001). The majority of the people in the population did not have their phones connected to the internet (OR = 1.96, 95%CI: 1.16C3.31, P = 0.01). The majority of people received their information regarding COVID-19 from one source (radio) (OR = 1.55). Conclusion: Where and how the rural market vendors get their information and education level are vital in breaking COVID 19 infection circle in line with WHO guidelines. Therefore, sources of information and education level played a key role in molding their knowledge and practices. However, the level of knowledge on COVID 19 among our respondents was not linked with phone internet connectivity.","output":"Community Drivers Affecting Adherence to WHO Guidelines Against COVID-19 Amongst Rural Ugandan Market Vendors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that emergency departments (EDs) need to reorganize their operations rapidly.

Reports of using laparoscopic splenorraphy for spleen salvage were fewer and mainly limited to lower grades of injuries. No study has focused on the role of laparoscopic splenorraphy in the treatment of patients with high grades of splenic injuries. METHODS Medical records of 15 patients with high grades of splenic injuries that required an operation for failed nonoperative management were retrospectively reviewed. They underwent a new technique of sandwich repair laparoscopically for spleen salvage by 3 surgeons who had adequate training in laparoscopy for trauma. Preoperative parameters, sandwich repair technique, perioperative parameters, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Fourteen of the 15 (93.3%) patients underwent the technique successfully with 1 patient converting to laparotomy. The median (interquartile range) time to reach hemostasis was 30.0 (26.0-40.0) minutes, and the median overall operation time was 135.0 (120.0-165.0) minutes. Median blood loss amount was 1300.0 (750.0-2300.0) mL. The median length of hospital stay was 8.0 (7.0-11.0) days, and the intensive care unit stay was 2.0 (0.0-4.0) days. No mortality was noted. No rebleeding, total splenic infarction, or intra-abdominal abscess was noted during 3-month follow-up after the operation.

We propose novel methods that overcome this barrier: our methods are of second order, and they are guaranteed to preserve positivity. Our methods apply to a large class of differential equations that have a special graph Laplacian structure, which we elucidate. The equations need be neither linear nor autonomous and the graph Laplacian need not be symmetric.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the systems have been expanded to enable monitoring of infections with SARS-CoV?2. Three systems are presented: GrippeWeb, the primary care sentinel Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza with its electronic reporting module SEED(ARE), and the ICD-10-based hospital sentinel ICOSARI. With these systems, ARIs can be monitored at the population, outpatient, and inpatient levels. In combination with the monitoring of mortality, these systems provide important information on the frequency of different stages of disease severity in the population. In order to expand the systems to SARS-CoV?2, only a few adjustments were needed. As the case definitions for ARIs were preserved, historical baselines of the systems can still be used for comparison. All systems are structured in such a way that stable and established reference values are available for calculating weekly proportions and rates. This is an important addition to the mandatory reporting system of infectious diseases in Germany, which depends on the particular testing strategy, the number of tests performed, and on specific case definitions, which are adapted as required.

The gut microbiota of patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICU) undergoes many alterations because of critical illness, antibiotics, and other ICU-specific medications. It is then characterized by lower richness and diversity, and dominated by opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile and multidrug-resistant bacteria. These alterations are associated with an increased risk of infectious complications or death.

Correcting the microbiota disturbances to avoid their consequences is now possible. Fecal microbiota transplantation is recommended in recurrent C. difficile infections and microbiota-protecting treatments such as antibiotic inactivators are currently being developed.

METHODS Of 98 consecutive patients who underwent LTG for gastric cancer in our department between August 2002 and December 2010, 94 patients underwent esophagojejunostomy with a linear stapling device. After October 2007, we modified the esophagojejunostomy; ie, the most recent 57 patients underwent transection of the esophagus in the ventrodorsal direction and insertion of a linear stapler from the anterior wall of the Roux limb to the posterior wall so as to make an inverted T-shaped anastomosis. We evaluated the results in these 57 patients (recent group) and compared them with the results in the earlier 37 patients (early group). RESULTS The mean operative time in the recent group was 368 to 94.6 min, and the mean estimated blood loss was 57 to 33 g; both were comparable with those in the early group.

This behavior is difficult to model analytically and is most often modeled numerically. Such networks form an important part of the structure of society, including transportation networks. As society fights to control the COVID-19 pandemic, an important question is to choose the optimum balance between the full opening of transport networks and the control of epidemic spread. In this paper we investigate how recent advances in analyzing network structure using information theory could inform decisions regarding the opening of such networks. By virtue of the richness of data available we focus upon the worldwide airline network, but these methods are in principle applicable to any transport network. We are able to demonstrate that it is possible to substantially open the airline network and have some degree of control on the spread of the virus.","output":"Balancing Capacity and Epidemic Spread in the Global Airline Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Few previous studies have investigated the association between the severity of an infectious disease and the length of incubation period.

RESULTS We estimated the incubation period of severe acute respiratory syndrome based on a subset of patients with available data on exposure periods and a separate subset of patients in a putative common source outbreak, and we found associations between shorter incubation period and greater severity in both groups after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that patients with a shorter incubation period went on to have more severe disease.

The presence and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human feces and its passage into the water bodies are significant public health challenges. Hence, the hot issue of WBE of SARS-CoV-2 in the coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a matter of utmost importance (e.g., SARS-CoV-1). The present review discusses the background, state of the art, actual status, and prospects of WBE, as well as the detection and quantification protocols of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. The SARS-CoV-2 detection studies have been performed in different water matrixes such as influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants, suburban pumping stations, hospital wastewater, and sewer networks around the globe except for Antarctica. The findings revealed that all WBE studies were in accordance with clinical and epidemiological data, which correlates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) with the number of new daily positive cases officially reported. This last was confirmed via Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) testing which unfortunately is not suitable for real-time surveillance. In addition, WBE concept may act as a faster protocol to alert the public health authorities to take administrative orders (possible re-emerging infections) due to the impracticality of testing all citizens in a short time with limited diagnostic facilities.

Plants accumulate Se and thus represent a major source of Se to consumers. Agronomic biofortification intends to enrich crops with Se in order to secure its adequate supply by people. Scope: The goal of this review is to report the present knowledge of the distribution and processes of Se in soil and at the plant-soil interface, and of Se behaviour inside the plant in terms of biofortification. It aims to unravel the Se metabolic pathways that affect the nutritional value of edible plant products, various Se biofortification strategies in challenging environments, as well as the impact of Se-enriched food on human health. Conclusions: Agronomic biofortification and breeding are prevalent strategies for battling Se deficiency. Future research addresses nanosized Se biofortification, crop enrichment with multiple micronutrients, microbial-integrated agronomic biofortification, and optimization of Se biofortification in adverse conditions. Biofortified food of superior nutritional quality may be created, enriched with healthy Se-compounds, as well as several other valuable phytochemicals.

Since the 1950s, all types of JEV vaccines including inactivated, recombinant and live attenuated ones have been licensed. As an example of an extremely successful endeavour, the time is ripe for reviewing the development of JEV vaccines and probing the reasons behind their uniform success. RECENT FINDINGS: Vaccines against JEV have come a long way since the first licensing in the mid-1950s of the mouse brain-grown-inactivated virus preparations, to the present day live-attenuated virus vaccines. A survey of the various inactivated and live vaccines developed against JEV provides a striking insight into the impressive safety and efficacy of all the vaccines available to prevent encephalitis from JEV. This review juxtaposes studies to understand naturally acquired immunity against JEV that have mostly been published post-2000, compares these with those elicited by vaccines and highlights the paucity of data on cell-mediated immune responses elicited by JEV vaccines. SUMMARY: This article not only seeks to make available the immense salient literature on this endeavour in one collection, but also queries the basis for the remarkable success of JEV vaccines, not least of which may be the ease of protecting against encephalitis caused by JEV. To conclude, the true test of the ingenuity of those dedicated to the pursuit of viral vaccines would be success against viral diseases such as HIV-AIDS and dengue that pose a far greater challenge to scientists.","output":"Japanese Encephalitis Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY: We surveyed primary care physicians in Malaysia for their knowledge, attitude and practice in screening and managing osteoporosis. We found a low level of screening and active management of osteoporosis in the primary care setting despite positive attitudes towards them. We advocate for the active management of osteoporosis at the primary care level. INTRODUCTION: Prevention of osteoporotic fracture is important in primary healthcare for healthy ageing. Little is known about the knowledge, attitude, practice and barriers in the screening and managing osteoporosis among primary care doctors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study, using an online pre-tested questionnaire after face and content validation, was conducted for primary care doctors from 1 June to 30 July 2021 across Malaysia. Pearsons chi-square test and logistic regression were employed. RESULTS: A total of 350 primary care doctors in Malaysia, consisting of 113 (32.3%) family medicine specialists (FMS) and 237 (67.7%) medical officers, participated in this study. The mean  SD score of osteoporosis knowledge was 50.46  15.09 with minimum and maximum values of 0 and 83.64%, respectively. One hundred and ten (31.4%) respondents achieved a satisfactory overall knowledge score of  60%, 156 (44.6%) were confident in advising patients for initiation of anti-osteoporotic medication, and 243 (69.4%) perceived that bisphosphonate should be made available in health clinics. Only 97 (27.7%) practised osteoporosis screening. Inaccessibility of bone mineral densitometry (BMD) (90.6%), inadequate knowledge (87.7%) and inaccessibility of pharmacotherapy (87.1%) are perceived modifiable barriers to osteoporosis screening and management. Factors associated with a satisfactory knowledge of osteoporosis are designation as a family medicine specialist (AOR 3.034, p = 0.002), attendance at an osteoporosis management update course (AOR 2.095, p = 0.034) and the practice of osteoporosis screening for the elderly (AOR 2.767, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Given the insufficient knowledge and low level of osteoporosis screening, there is a need for a national structured health programme to address the knowledge gap, increase screening practices and enhance accessibility to BMD and anti-osteoporosis medication in primary care.","output":"Screening and management of osteoporosis: a survey of knowledge, attitude and practice among primary care physicians in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Bioinformatics is becoming an essential tool for the majority of biological and biomedical researchers. Although bioinformatics data is exploited by academic and industrial researchers, limited focus is on teaching this area to undergraduates, postgraduates and senior scientists.

Some universities do provide courses on a variety of bioinformatics resources and tools, a few also provide biocuration projects, during which students submit data to annotation resources. Methods: To assess the usefulness and enjoyability of annotation projects a survey was sent to University College London (UCL) students who have undertaken Gene Ontology biocuration projects. Results: Analysis of survey responses suggest that these projects provide students with an opportunity not only to learn about bioinformatics resources but also to improve their literature analysis, presentation and writing skills. Conclusion: Biocuration student projects provide valuable annotations as well as enabling students to develop a variety of skills relevant to their future careers.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of SNPs on TMPRSS2 function and structure. In silico tools such as Ensembl, Gtex, ExPASY 2, GEPIA, CCLE, KEGG and GO were engaged to characterize TMPRSS2 and its expression profile. The functional effects of SNPs were analyzed by PolyPhen-2, PROVEN, SNAP2, SIFT and HSF. Also, Phyre2, GOR IV and PSIPRED were used to predict the secondary structure of TMPRSS2. Moreover, post-translational modification (PTM) and secretory properties were analyzed through Modpredand Phobius, respectively. Finally, miRNA profiles were investigated by PolymiRTS and miRSNPs. Out of 11,184 retrieved SNPs from dbSNP, 92 showed a different frequency between Asians and other populations. Only 21 SNPs affected the function and structure of TMPRSS2 by influencing the protein folding, PTM, splicing and miRNA function. Particularly, rs12329760 may create a de novo pocket protein. rs875393 can create a donor site, silencer and broken enhancer motifs. rs12627374 affects a wide spectrum of miRNAs profile.

METHODS We used data from Ontario, Canada's Case and Contact Management database, merged to a provincial vaccination dataset (COVaxON) to create a time-matched cohort of individuals who were hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccinated individuals were matched to up to five unvaccinated individuals based on test date. Risk of ICU admission and death were evaluated using conditional logistic regression. Unmatched exploratory analyses were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity in vaccine effects. RESULTS In 20,064 individuals (3,353 vaccinated and 16,711 unvaccinated) hospitalized with infection due to SARS-CoV-2 between January 1st, 2021 and January 5th, 2022, vaccination with 1, 2, or 3 doses significantly reduced the risk of ICU admission and death.

These changes can affect the training that gastroenterology trainees undergo, especially endoscopy since these are aerosol-generating procedures. The aim of this survey was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on gastroenterology training across the European countries. METHODOLOGY: A questionnaire was set up whereby the different elements of training were analysed. The questionnaire (online) was distributed among trainees through the National Representatives of the European Board of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. RESULTS: In total, 86 trainees (females: 55%; mean age: 32.5 years [SD 4.57 years]; mean training duration of 2.68 years [SD 1.63]) from 22 different countries were recruited. From the cohort, 10.5% were considered as vulnerable for acquiring COVID-19. During their job, 4.7% acquired the infection and 26.7% were placed in quarantine. Most trainees noted that their various aspects of gastroenterology training were moderately or severely affected during the initial height of the pandemic: clinical gastroenterology training (67.4%), outpatients (75.5%), didactic teaching (88.3%), multidisciplinary team meetings (65.2%) and endoscopy training (75.6%). Later, when the number of COVID-19-related infections decreased across Europe, the above modalities returned to normal for <50% of the trainees. CONCLUSION: This European-wide survey has demonstrated that gastroenterology training has been severely impacted during both the initial height of the pandemic and afterwards. Furthermore, the psychological impact on trainees, in terms of training quality, duration and exposure to COVID-19, is unknown.

Methods At first, demographic, clinical, laboratory measurement data, and outcomes for 26 COVID 19 infected children of less than 12 years of age, admitted to King Abdallah Hospital, Bisha, Saudi Arabia, were retrieved from the electronic medical records for the observational retrospective study. Later, electronic and manual database searches were carried out for pediatric severe COVID 19 related articles. The relevant data from 20 eligible studies and the present retrospective study were analyzed to assess the association of demographic characteristics and comorbidities with COVID-19 severity. Results In the retrospective study, 5 (19%) of the children presented with severe symptoms admitted to PICU, 18 (69%) presented with cough, 5 (19%) with diarrhea, 7 (27%) with underlying comorbidities, 4 (15%) with respiratory illnesses, 3 (12%) with cardiovascular diseases and 2 (8%) were obese. None of the patient characteristics showed any significant association with COVID-19 severity. Of the 21 studies selected for meta-analyses, 14 studies were included in the analysis of the association between any comorbidity and disease severity, resulting in OR: 2.69, 95%CI: 1.38, 5.26, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between cardiovascular comorbidities and disease severity 14 studies were included giving OR: 4.06, 95%CI: 1.86 , 8.87, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between respiratory comorbidity and disease severity 15 studies were included giving OR: 2.05, 95%CI: 1.54 , 2.74, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between obesity and disease severity 10 studies were included, giving OR: 2.48, 95%CI: 1.16 , 5.32, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between age <10 years old and diseases severity, 16 studies were included, giving OR: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.65, 0.97, P < 0.05, and for analysis of the association between female gender and disease severity, 19 studies were included, giving OR: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.59, 1.18, P > 0.05. Conclusion It can be concluded that COVID-19 pediatric patients with underlying comorbidities, being cardiovascular, respiratory, or obesity, are at high risk of developing severe illness, and young age has a protective role against the disease severity.","output":"Clinical Determinants and Predictors for Prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 Infected Pediatric Patients in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study assessed the impact of flipped classrooms on physician assistant (PA) students' performance and opinions. METHODS Students completed quizzes and an opinion survey in Genetics, Human Pathophysiology (HPP), Clinical Medicine (CM) (n = 105) and Physical Exam (PE) (n = 98) courses. RESULTS In Genetics and PE, the quiz scores were significantly higher for flipped classrooms (Genetics 95.00  6.56; PE 83.09  11.47) compared to the traditional lectures (Genetics 90.00  10.53; PE 55.43  16.66). In HPP, students performed better with traditional lectures (86.54  8.82) compared to the flipped classrooms (75.12  8.54). In CM, students' gain score was significantly higher for flipped classrooms (37.85  16.73) than for traditional lectures (20.97  15.55). The opinion surveys showed that the students surveyed preferred traditional lectures over flipped classrooms in Genetics (4.58  0.46 vs. 2.29  0.71) and HPP (4.14  0.35 vs. 2.09  0.53).

REVIEW METHODS: References for this review were identified by searches within PubMed without any date restrictions. The search terms used were coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) clinical manifestation, COVID\\\\19 epidemiology, neurologic findings in COVID\\\\19, headache in COVID\\\\19, neurologic manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), and headache in SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. RESULTS: Headache is one of the most common neurologic complaints in patients with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. While the pathophysiological connection between headache and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 is unclear, inflammatory mechanisms may play a key role. One of the mechanisms cited in the literature of migraine and other headache disorders is the activation of nociceptive sensory neurons by cytokines and chemokines. A similar mechanism has been reported in SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 with the release of cytokines and chemokines by macrophages throughout the course of infection. Other mechanisms for headache in SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 include (1) viral neuroinvasion as seen with viral encephalitis; (2) hypoxemia due to the well\\\\described pulmonary manifestations of the disease; and (3) thrombosis secondary to COVID\\\\19 induced hypercoagulable states. CONCLUSION: According to the Centers for Disease Control, common symptoms of human coronavirus include fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, and headache. In the case of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, there are limited reports about headaches, one of the most common clinical manifestations. There are currently no studies that focus specifically on headache among patients with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection.","output":"Headache in Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Examine how interventional pain physicians navigated the early phase of reopening practices during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: In June/July 2020, Spine Intervention Society members were queried about practice demographics, perception of COVID-19 prevalence, financial impact, and implementation of new tools and procedures when re-opening practices. RESULTS: Of the 2,295 members approached, 195 (8%) completed the survey. A majority (71%) reported using risk stratification tools and changing scheduling patterns. Nearly 70% performed initial assessments via telehealth and 87% for follow-up encounters. More than 80% performed symptom/temperature checks upon in-person clinic/facility entrance, and 63% screened patients via phone. Most (58%) did not test patients for COVID-19 for office visits, while 38% tested only if symptomatic. For epidural injections, intra-articular injections, and radiofrequency neurotomy procedures, 43% reported not testing patients, while 36% tested patients only if symptomatic. Most (70%) required patients to wear a mask upon entering the clinic/facility. For nonprocedure encounters, respondents used surgical masks (85%), gloves (35%), face shields/goggles (24%), N95 respirators (15%), and gowns (6%). Some (66%) discussed unique COVID-19 risks/complications and 26% provided written information. Most did not make changes to steroid dosage (67%) or peri-procedural anticoagulation management (97%). The vast majority (81%) estimated that COVID-19 will have a moderate-severe financial impact on their practice. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has dramatically affected interventional pain practices with regard to telehealth, in-clinic precautions, screening/testing protocols, and patient counseling.

Such data can guide service improvement, especially when connecting the public health community to the latest research during such incidents. Four U.S. public health outbreaks were used to measure DOCLINEs capacity to support information seeking behaviors: requests during the Summer 2019 measles outbreak;the Fall 2019 e-cigarette lung injury event;the 2018C2019 influenza season;and early stages of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. NLM Medical Subject Headings were used to identify related requests. A team of NLM librarians analyzed these for trends in request volume, geographic and institution type, and content. While the number of PHE-related requests did not make up a large percentage of the total placed, there were identifiable increases during the selected periods. These originated from a variety of geographic locations, with some noticeable intersection with outbreak areas. Hospitals initiated the most requests. This investigation provides evidence that DOCLINE data can be used to drive system development and that a targeted ILL system with rapid turnaround times is an especially valuable library resource during PHEs.

This is particularly true for caregivers of patients with head and neck, esophageal, anal, rectal, and lung cancers, who are often receiving combined-modality treatment and may have tracheostomy tubes, gastrostomy tubes, or colostomies/ileostomies. This study aims to evaluate a simulation-based nursing intervention to provide information, support, and training to caregivers during radiation therapy. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial will include a sample of 180 patients and their family caregivers. Caregivers assigned to the control group will receive usual care and an informational booklet from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Those in the intervention group will receive usual care, the NCI booklet, and three meetings with a nurse interventionist during radiation treatment followed by a booster call two weeks posttreatment. Intervention sessions focus on themes consistent with the trajectory of radiation therapy: the patient experience/needs, the caregiver experience and dyad communication, and transition to survivorship. Outcomes are measured at baseline, end of treatment (T2), and 4 (T3) and 20 (T4) weeks posttreatment, with the primary outcome being caregiver anxiety at T4. DISCUSSION: This trial is innovative in its use of simulation in a psychoeducational intervention for family caregivers. The intervention is administered at point-of-care and aimed at feasibility for integration into clinical practice. Patient quality of life and healthcare utilization measures will assess how providing support and training to the caregiver may impact patient outcomes.

In severe cases, the virus acts through a surge of immune modulators causing multi-organ damage and failure. The hypothesis that new onset HFrEF contributing to higher mortality and morbidity in patients with COVID-19 has yet to be tested. Methods We extracted transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reports of all COVID-19 patients (confirmed by serology) from 4 hospitals within the Steward Healthcare System done between 3/22-4/24 of patients with no known heart failure who developed signs and symptoms of clinical heart failure that prompted imaging with TTE and found to have HFrEF (EF 40%). Age and gender matched patients with COVID19 with normal ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormalities formed the control arm. Results We identified 171 patients with TTE done between 3/22-4/24. Of these, 30 patients developed new onset heart failure during their hospitalization with an EF  40%. Two thirds of the patients with HFrEF (66.7%) required hospitalization more than 7 days versus 33.3% in patients with normal EF. More than half of the heart failure patient cohort (53%) required ICU level of care compared to 40% in patients with normal EF. During their stay in the ICU, 58% of the patients with EF < 40 % required intubation and mechanical ventilation as opposed to 37% in patients with normal EF, and 53% required vasopressor support to maintain adequate mean arterial pressures (MAPs) > 65, compared to 43% in the group with EF > 60% . In-hospital mortality was 63% in the HFrEF group and 43% in patients with normal EF. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 who developed HFrEF during hospitalization had worse outcomes and a higher mortality when compared to COVID-19 patients with normal EF.","output":"Clinical Implications of Myocardial Involvement with Covid 19: A Case Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to evaluate impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on merchant ship activities and corresponding atmospheric pollutant emissions in Shanghai port waters.

The epidemic could result in longer ship turnaround times because of more operation time for berthing and anchoring activities. Ship emission comparison results reveal that the cargo ship emissions are significantly reduced while container ships and tankers produce a slightly decreased emissions resulting by strict COVID-19 quarantine measures. In addition, the unit ship emission intensity is greatly reduced for ships which are under the normal cruising status while berthing and anchoring operations are associated with increased ship emissions.

Multiple healthcare datasets were linked to ascertain all SARS-CoV-2 testing, vaccination, hospitalization, and mortality data for all patients treated with KRT in Scotland, from the start of the pandemic over a period of 20 months. Descriptive statistics, survival analyses, and vaccine effectiveness were calculated. Results: As of 19th September 2021, 93% (n=5281) of the established KRT population in Scotland had received two doses of an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Over the study period, there were 814 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (15.1% of the KRT population). Vaccine effectiveness against infection and hospitalization was 33% (95% CI 0-52) and 38% (95% CI 0-57) respectively. 9.2% of fully vaccinated individuals died within 28 days of a SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test (7% dialysis patients and 10% kidney transplant recipients).

An emerging body of research demonstrates that playing Pokmon Go can lead to improvements in physical activity and psychosocial well-being; however, whether Pokmon Go reduces self-harm incidence at the population-level is still questionable. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to quantify how the launch of Pokmon Go in Hong Kong affected the incidence of self-harm using a quasi-experimental design. METHODS An interrupted time-series design with Poisson segmented regression adjusted for time and seasonality trends was used on data from 2012 to 2018 to detect any changes in the number of accident and emergency attendances due to self-harm, after Pokmon Go was launched. The findings were validated using a baseline control period and using other intentional injuries and minor noninjuries as control outcomes. We also assessed intervention effects by age group. RESULTS From January 1, 2012 to July 31, 2018, there were 13,463 accident and emergency attendances due to self-harm in Hong Kong. During the period after launching Pokmon Go, self-harm attendances dropped by 34% (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.66, 95% CI 0.61-0.73). When analyzed by age group, a reduction in self-harm incidence was only apparent in adults (18 to 24 years of age: adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.78, P=.02; 25 to 39 years of age: adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.75, P<.001; 40 years of age and older: adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.57, P<.001).

The purpose of this study is to develop and design an automated carotid plaque characterization and classification system into binary classes, namely symptomatic and asymptomatic types via the deep learning (DL) framework implemented on a supercomputer. We hypothesize that on ultrasound images, symptomatic carotid plaques have (a) a low grayscale median because of a histologically large lipid core and relatively little collagen and calcium, and (b) a higher chaotic (heterogeneous) grayscale distribution due to the composition. The methodology consisted of building a DL model of Artificial Intelligence (called Atheromatic 2.0, AtheroPoint, CA, USA) that used a classic convolution neural network consisting of 13 layers and implemented on a supercomputer. The DL model used a cross-validation protocol for estimating the classification accuracy (ACC) and area-under-the-curve (AUC). A sample of 346 carotid ultrasound-based delineated plaques were used (196 symptomatic and 150 asymptomatic, mean age 69.9  7.8 years, with 39% females). This was augmented using geometric transformation yielding 2312 plaques (1191 symptomatic and 1120 asymptomatic plaques). K10 (90% training and 10% testing) cross-validation DL protocol was implemented and showed an (i) accuracy and (ii) AUC without and with augmentation of 86.17%, 0.86 (p-value < 0.0001), and 89.7%, 0.91 (p-value < 0.0001), respectively. The DL characterization system consisted of validation of the two hypotheses: (a) mean feature strength (MFS) and (b) Mandelbrot's fractal dimension (FD) for measuring chaotic behavior. We demonstrated that both MFS and FD were higher in symptomatic plaques compared to asymptomatic plaques by 64.15  0.73% (p-value < 0.0001) and 6  0.13% (p-value < 0.0001), respectively.

Whilst the significant release of metal-enriched drainage has been documented during this event, the fate of these elements in receiving systems is still largely unknown. Here we investigate the spatial distribution, chemical partitioning, and potential bioavailability of S, Fe, Mn, Al, trace metals (V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Pb) and rare earth elements in the surficial sediments of Lake Albert, South Australia; a system that received prolonged (2007-2011) acidic drainage during the Millennium Drought. The highest concentrations of all metals (Enrichment Factors ranging from 1.06-1.97) were observed in the sediments closest to shorelines where sulfidic material were oxidised, generating metal-enriched acidic drainage. Localised enrichment indicates metals have not been completely redistributed across the system following their initial deposition by physical (wind-driven resuspension) or chemical (diagenetic and redox changes) processes. Based on selective extraction data, these metals are likely partitioned as discrete sulfides (Pb) or are with organic material (V, Cr, Cu, Pb, REEs), Fe monosulfides (V, Co, Ni), or pyrite (Co, Ni, Pb). Lake-wide enrichment of trace metals Cr (mean concentration 57 ppm), Ni (39 ppm), Cu (36 ppm), and Pb (24 ppm) relative to other Lower Murray River sites is also evident, suggesting that metal contamination associated with acidic drainage is not restricted to near-source sites. Importantly, the mobilisation, transport, and accumulation of metals is controlled by sediment transport pathways and system hydrology and will thus function differently under varying states of geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic modification. Our study shows that extreme drought is recorded as a lasting geochemical signature in estuarine sediments, demonstrating that metal and rare earth element geochemistry provides insights into the distribution and behaviour of contaminants mobilised into dynamic, anthropogenically altered estuaries.","output":"Geochemical signatures of acidic drainage recorded in estuarine sediments after an extreme drought"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sialic acid reduced and stabilized gold nanoparticles (d = 20.1  1.8 nm) were synthesized by a simple one-pot, green method without chemically modifying sialic acid for colorimetric detection of influenza virus.

The cleavage and release of membrane proteins has been shown to modulate various cellular processes and disease pathologies. Numerous studies revealed that cell membrane molecules of diverse functional groups are subjected to proteolytic cleavage, and the released soluble form of proteins may modulate various signaling processes. Therefore, in addition to the secreted protein markers that undergo secretion through the secretory pathway, the shed membrane proteins may comprise an additional resource of noninvasive and accessible biomarkers. In this context, identifying the membrane-bound proteins that will be shed has become important in the discovery of clinically noninvasive biomarkers. Nevertheless, a data repository for biological and clinical researchers to review the shedding information, which is experimentally validated, for membrane-bound protein shed markers is still lacking. RESULTS: In this study, the database SheddomeDB was developed to integrate publicly available data of the shed membrane proteins. A comprehensive literature survey was performed to collect the membrane proteins that were verified to be cleaved or released in the supernatant by immunological-based validation experiments. From 436 studies on shedding, 401 validated shed membrane proteins were included, among which 199 shed membrane proteins have not been annotated or validated yet by existing cleavage databases. SheddomeDB attempted to provide a comprehensive shedding report, including the regulation of shedding machinery and the related function or diseases involved in the shedding events. In addition, our published tool ShedP was embedded into SheddomeDB to support researchers for predicting the shedding event on unknown or unrecorded membrane proteins. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, SheddomeDB is the first database for the identification of experimentally validated shed membrane proteins and currently may provide the most number of membrane proteins for reviewing the shedding information. The database included membrane-bound shed markers associated with numerous cellular processes and diseases, and some of these markers are potential novel markers because they are not annotated or validated yet in other databases.

To validate the current system of crowd management in the station, this paper examines the rail passenger flow in the concourse of the Birmingham New Street railway station and the passenger interactions and queueing phenomena associated with it, mainly at the ticket machines, offices and gates, prior to and during the implementation of COVID-19 measures. The passenger behaviour in the concourse of the station was simulated using the SIMUL8 event-based simulation modelling package. Three different scenarios were modelled to analyse the changes and impacts from pre-COVID-19 and within the COVID-19 context. The results revealed that passenger behaviour in railway stations is changing due to COVID-19. Specifically, passengers are more likely to buy tickets using their smartphones or online prior to or whilst entering the station so that they can go through the station concourse with minimal queuing times and avoid contact with a facility of common use at the station, whereas those without tickets are more likely to be in a queue to buy their tickets in the station. For pre-COVID, the results showed that even with a reduced number of ticket machines, overcrowding inside the station was unlikely to occur, as 80% of all passengers in the simulation completed service within a 15-minute time frame. However, during implementation of COVID-19 measures, as the number of passengers using the station dropped significantly and more passengers bought their tickets using their smartphones and/or online, queueing times were also shorter, and thus passengers spent less time in the system. The simulation results were in accordance with the expected practice; hence the effectiveness of the simulation model was verified. Overall, as a result of this study, the following suggestions to improve crowd management in a railway passenger station concourse are proposed: encourage passengers to purchase tickets on their smartphones, remove ticket gates and replace them with sensors, and provide a one-way passenger flow system in the main concourse of the station.","output":"Analysis of Rail Passenger Flow in a Rail Station Concourse Prior to and During the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Event-Based Simulation Models and Scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The US opioid crisis came in three waves - prescription opioids, heroin, and illicitly manufactured fentanyls - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resulting in the deaths of nearly 500,000 people from 1996 to 2019. In 2009, drug overdose deaths exceeded those involving automobiles. Opioid overdose deaths contributed to the decrease in life expectancy for Americans from 78.8 to 78.5 during 2014 to 2017. The overprescribing of a schedule II prescription opioid was escalated by pharmaceutical companies promoting a growing belief that pain was an undertreated condition. In 2012, the number of opioid prescriptions peaked at 255 million and deaths exceeded 11,000 per year. The typical prescription opioid abuser was white, male, and 45-55 years of age. The hardest-hit states were in Appalachia and the Northeast. When an abuse-resistant formulation was introduced for OxyContin, the most prevalent prescription opioid, users turned to heroin. From the early 1980s, a new pizza delivery style of Mexican trafficking in black tar heroin infiltrated many of the same states hit hardest by prescription opioids. Heroin overdose deaths reached 14,495 in 2017. As heroin abuse increased in states supplied with black tar heroin, fentanyl-contaminated white powder heroin began to appear in the Northeast. Fentanyl was quickly followed by fentanyl analogs. While heroin deaths continued to escalate through 2017, they were soon overshadowed by fentanyl overdose deaths. Finally, prescription opioid and heroin overdose deaths started to decline in 2017, though fentanyl deaths continued to increase. In late 2019, it appeared that restrictions on transportation and travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in decreased availability of illicit drugs, but by 2020 drug abuse had escalated in many countries. Globally, heroin was the primary opioid of abuse and only a few countries - including Canada, Germany, Austria, and Belgium - have experienced a significant increase in prescription opioids. However, illicitly manufactured fentanyls are a growing problem in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.","output":"The Opioid Crisis: Prevalence and Markets of Opioids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reactive arthritis (ReA) is typically preceded by sexually transmitted disease or gastrointestinal infection.

Following a stochastic point process modelling approach, a Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to represent the COVID-19 spread dynamics. First, we examined various expected performances (theoretical properties) of the simulation model assuming a number of arbitrarily defined scenarios. Simulation studies were then performed on the real COVID-19 data reported (over the period of 1 March to 1 May) for Australia and United Kingdom (UK). Given the initial number of COVID-19 infection active cases were around 10 for both countries, the model estimated that the number of active cases would peak around 29 March in Australia (&#8776; 1,700 cases) and around 22 April in UK (&#8776; 22,860 cases); ultimately the total confirmed cases could sum to 6,790 for Australia in about 75 days and 206,480 for UK in about 105 days. The results of the estimated COVID-19 reproduction numbers were consistent with what was reported in the literature.

The mechanisms of direct SARS-CoV-2 cardiomyocyte infection include viral invasion via ACE2-Spike glycoprotein-binding. In DM patients, the impact of glycation of ACE2 on cardiomyocyte invasion by SARS-CoV-2 can be of high importance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cardiomyocytes from heart autopsy of DM cases compared to Non-DM; to investigate the role of DM in SARS-COV-2 entry in cardiomyocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated consecutive autopsy cases, deceased for COVID-19, from Italy between Apr 30, 2020 and Jan 18, 2021. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 in cardiomyocytes, expression of ACE2 (total and glycosylated form), and transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2) protein. In order to study the role of diabetes on cardiomyocyte alterations, independently of COVID-19, we investigated ACE2, glycosylated ACE2, and TMPRSS2 proteins in cardiomyocytes from DM and Non-DM explanted-hearts. Finally, to investigate the effects of DM on ACE2 protein modification, an in vitro glycation study of recombinant human ACE2 (hACE2) was performed to evaluate the effects on binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The authors included cardiac tissue from 97 autopsies. DM was diagnosed in 37 patients (38%). Fourth-seven out of 97 autopsies (48%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiomyocytes. Thirty out of 37 DM autopsy cases (81%) and 17 out of 60 Non-DM autopsy cases (28%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiomyocytes. Total ACE2, glycosylated ACE2, and TMPRSS2 protein expressions were higher in cardiomyocytes from autopsied and explanted hearts of DM than Non-DM. In vitro exposure of monomeric hACE2 to 120 mM glucose for 12 days led to non-enzymatic glycation of four lysine residues in the neck domain affecting the protein oligomerization. CONCLUSIONS: The upregulation of ACE2 expression (total and glycosylated forms) in DM cardiomyocytes, along with non-enzymatic glycation, could increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection in DM patients by favouring the cellular entry of SARS-CoV2.

OBJECTIVE This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the US features of MAGI patients with active symptoms compared to patients without sexual, voiding, and ejaculatory dysfunction. MATERIALS/METHODS To achieve this aim, an analysis of the prevalence of MAGI US criteria was carried out on a very large series of over 500 patients diagnosed with MAGI classified according to the different symptom profile evaluated through a dedicated questionnaire (previously conceived and published by our group) arbitrarily named \\"structured interview about MAGI\\" (SI-MAGI) for sexual, voiding, and ejaculatory disorders reported by these patients. RESULTS The results of this study revealed that US criteria most frequently detected in patients with severe urinary symptoms were the presence of areas of high echogenicity (almost exclusively in the periurethral prostatic zone) together with the presence of single or multiple areas of acinar ectasia of the prostate. The presence of seminal vesicles with polycyclic areas within the glandular lumen separated by hyperechoic septa represented US criterion most frequently detected in patients with severe spontaneous or post-ejaculate pain. Finally, US criterion most frequently detected in patients with severe sexual dysfunction was the dilation of the periprostatic venous plexus, suggesting the hypothesis of a possible alternative therapeutic approach. CONCLUSION The data of the present study suggest that symptoms may associate with US signs in patients with MAGI. Also, specific US signs may associate with specific symptoms. Further studies are needed to understand whether patients with specific US signs may in turn benefit from a personalized therapeutic choice.","output":"Ultrasound aspects of symptomatic versus asymptomatic forms of male accessory gland inflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methylene blue (MB) has been used in the textile industry since it was first extracted by the German chemist Heinrich Caro.

Recently, the utilization of MB as a safe photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) has received attention. Recent findings demonstrate that photoactivated MB exhibits not only anticancer activity but also antibacterial activity both in vitro and in vivo. However, due to the hydrophilic nature of MB, it is difficult to create MB-embedded nano- or microparticles capable of increasing the clinical efficacy of the PDT. This review aims to summarize fabrication techniques for MB-embedded nano and microparticles and to provide both in vitro and in vivo examples of MB-mediated PDT, thereby offering a future perspective on improving this promising clinical treatment modality. We also address examples of MB-mediated PDT in both cancer and infection treatments.

The benefit of machine learning, as an essential aspect of artificial intelligence, on past epidemics offers a new line to tackle the novel Coronavirus outbreak. Accurate short-term forecasting of COVID-19 spread plays an essential role in improving the management of the overcrowding problem in hospitals and enables appropriate optimization of the available resources (i.e., materials and staff).This paper presents a comparative study of machine learning methods for COVID-19 transmission forecasting. We investigated the performances of deep learning methods, including the hybrid convolutional neural networks-Long short-term memory (LSTM-CNN), the hybrid gated recurrent unit-convolutional neural networks (GAN-GRU), GAN, CNN, LSTM, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), as well as baseline machine learning methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR). The employment of hybrid models (i.e., LSTM-CNN and GAN-GRU) is expected to eventually improve the forecasting accuracy of COVID-19 future trends. The performance of the investigated deep learning and machine learning models was tested using confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases time-series data from seven impacted countries: Brazil, France, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. The results reveal that hybrid deep learning models can efficiently forecast COVID-19 cases. Also, results confirmed the superior performance of deep learning models compared to the two considered baseline machine learning models.

In 2012, the cattle industry decided that more information was needed on risk factors for mortality in both veal herds and herds of origin to enable implementation of risk mitigating measures. Routinely collected data were available from seven different data sources and contained information from 2.4 million white veal calves that were fattened in the period between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2014. Survival analysis techniques (Kaplan-Meier), multilevel Poisson and multilevel Logistic regression models were applied to analyse the data. Two different models were assembled in which risk factors for veal calf mortality in respectively veal herds and herds of origin were identified. Univariable and multivariable regression techniques were used to detect risk factors significantly associated with mortality of veal calves during the fattening period. During the study period, the mean mortality was 4.9% per production cycle. The probability to die was highest during the first weeks after arrival in the veal herds and declined thereafter. Important risk factors included a veal herds with a higher use of antimicrobials, hair colour as proxy for breed, certain countries of origin, veal herd management with a limited amount of supplied feed and a not having an all-in / all-out system. A higher body weight at arrival in the veal herd was associated with lower mortality as well as veal calves that were fed an above median amount of milk, roughage and concentrates. From the calves that were fattened during the study period, observations of 1.1 million calves originated from the Netherlands and were available to study risk factors for veal calf mortality associated with the herd of origin. Important risk factors included purchase, herds with high mortality rates in the quarter in which the calf was born, fast growth in herd size, high cattle replacement rates and a higher antibiotic use in the quarter of birth. Calves that originated from herds that were certified BVD-free, Salmonella-unsuspected or Paratuberculosis-unsuspected, had a lower odds to die during the subsequent fattening period in a veal herd.

In response, UGME and PGME programs have recently begun to explore resilience-based interventions. As these interventions are in their infancy, little is known about their efficacy in promoting trainee resilience. This systematic review aims to synthesize the available research evidence on the efficacy of resilience curricula in UGME and PGME. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of the literature using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Educational Resources Information Centre (ERIC), and Education Source from their inception to June 2020. Studies reporting the effect of resilience curricula in UGME and PGME settings were included. A qualitative analysis of the available studies was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I Tool. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen were single-arm studies, 6 quasi-experiments, and 2 RCTs. Thirty-eight percent (8/21; n = 598) were implemented in UGME, while 62 % (13/21, n = 778) were in PGME. There was significant heterogeneity in the duration, delivery, and curricular topics and only two studies implemented the same training model. Similarly, there was considerable variation in curricula outcome measures, with the majority reporting modest improvement in resilience, while three studies reported worsening of resilience upon completion of training. Overall assessment of risk of bias was moderate and only few curricula were previously validated by other research groups. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that resilience curricula may be of benefit to medical trainees. Resilience training is an emerging area of medical education that merits further investigation. Additional research is needed to construct optimal methods to foster resilience in medical education.

METHODS: In this retrospective study we analyzed data from patients seen at three EDs and tested for COVID-19 between April 6 through May 4, 2020. The primary outcome was the test positivity rate by race and ethnicity, and the secondary outcome was 30 day in-hospital mortality. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations with COVID-19 test positivity. RESULTS: There were 526 patients tested for COVID-19, of whom 95 (18.1%) tested positive. The mean age of patients tested was 54.2 years, 54.7% were male, and 76.1% had at least one medical comorbidity. Black patients accounted for 40.7% of those tested but 16.8% of the positive tests, and Latinx patients accounted for 26.4% of those tested but 58.9% of the positive tests. The test positivity rate among Latinx patients was 40.3% (56/139) compared with 10.1% (39/387) among non-Latinx patients (p < 0.001). Latinx ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 test positivity (adjusted odds ratio 9.6, 95% confidence interval: 3.5-26.0).

This aim of this study is to identify risk factors related to mortality in patients admitted to the hospital with COVID Pneumonia and to compare baseline characteristics and outcomes of different racial groups. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of patients 18 years and older who were admitted to an academic medical center between March to May of 2020. Categorical variables were reported as counts and percentages, using Chi Square or Exact Fischer test. Continuous variables were reported in means and standard deviation using Student T test. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: 190 patients were included in the study, 157 (82.63%) were African American (AA). AA patients had significantly higher weight, BMI and creatinine on admission. Prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was significantly higher in AA patients while the prevalence of atrial fibrillation was higher in non-AA patients. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between non-AA and AA groups (27.27% VS 20.38%, p=0.38). Factors that were associated with all-cause mortality included underlying CVA (OR=2.84, p<0.01, CI (1.3, 6.22)), thrombocytopenia (OR=0.99, p<0.01, CI (0.98, 0.99)), acute kidney injury (OR=2.95, p<0.01, CI (1.45, 6)), elevated alkaline phosphatase (OR=1.006, p=0.035, CI (1.0004, 1.01)), elevated D dimer (OR=1.0003, p<0.01, CI (1.00008, 1.0006)), elevated CRP (OR=1.1, p<0.01, CI (1.04, 1.16)), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR=11.17, p<0.01, CI (4.9, 25.46)), intubation (OR=22.56, p<0.01, CI (9.49, 53.66)), vasopressor requirement (OR=14.77, p<0.01, CI (6.36, 34.3)) and use of hydroxychloroquine (OR=25.37, p<0.01, CI (2.96, 217.55)). Multi-variable logistic regression was used to control for confounding and race was not associated with mortality (OR=0.25, p=0.21, CI (0.03,2.19)). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID pneumonia, organ dysfunction and the use of Hydroxychloroquine were factors associated with increased mortality. Despite significant differences in baseline weight, BMI, prevalence of AF and CKD among AA and non-AA patients, there was no significant difference in mortality between the 2 groups.

This study aims to collate and analyse funding for the Ebola epidemic and Zika outbreak between 2014 and 2019 in order to understand the shortcomings in funding reporting and suggest improvements. METHODS: Data were collected via a literature review and analysis of financial reporting databases, including both amounts donated and received. Funding information from three financial databases was analysed: Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation's Development Assistance for Health database, the Georgetown Infectious Disease Atlas and the United Nations Financial Tracking Service. A systematic literature search strategy was devised and applied to seven databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, HMIC, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and EconLit. Funding information was extracted from articles meeting the eligibility criteria and measures were taken to avoid double counting. Funding was collated, then amounts and purposes were compared within, and between, data sources. RESULTS: Large differences between funding reported by different data sources, and variations in format and methodology, made it difficult to arrive at precise estimates of funding amounts and purpose. Total disbursements reported by the databases ranged from $2.5 to $3.2 billion for Ebola and $150-$180 million for Zika. Total funding reported in the literature is greater than reported in databases, suggesting that databases may either miss funding, or that literature sources overreport. Databases and literature disagreed on the main purpose of funding for socioeconomic recovery versus outbreak response. One of the few consistent findings across data sources and diseases is that the USA was the largest donor. CONCLUSION: Implementation of several recommendations would enable more effective mapping and deployment of outbreak funding for response activities relating to COVID-19 and future epidemics.","output":"A systematic examination of international funding flows for Ebola virus and Zika virus outbreaks 2014-2019: donors, recipients and funding purposes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection by the new corona virus strain SARS-CoV-2 and its related syndrome COVID-19 has been associated with more than two million deaths worldwide. Patients of higher age and with preexisting chronic health conditions are at an increased risk of fatal disease outcome. However, detailed information on causes of death and the contribution of pre-existing health conditions to death yet is missing, which can be reliably established by autopsy only. We performed full body autopsies on 26 patients that had died after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 at the Charit University Hospital Berlin, Germany, or at associated teaching hospitals. We systematically evaluated causes of death and pre-existing health conditions. Additionally, clinical records and death certificates were evaluated. We report findings on causes of death and comorbidities of 26 decedents that had clinically presented with severe COVID-19. We found that septic shock and multi organ failure was the most common immediate cause of death, often due to suppurative pulmonary infection. Respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar damage presented as immediate cause of death in fewer cases. Several comorbidities, such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and obesity were present in the vast majority of patients. Our findings reveal that causes of death were directly related to COVID-19 in the majority of decedents, while they appear not to be an immediate result of preexisting health conditions and comorbidities. We therefore suggest that the majority of patients had died of COVID-19 with only contributory implications of preexisting health conditions to the mechanism of death.","output":"Causes of death and comorbidities in hospitalized patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID\\\\19 pandemic constitutes a threat to the population worldwide with over 21 million infected people.

SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were quantified using ELISA. Moreover, global characteristics of lymphocyte subpopulations were compared between patient groups and uninfected controls.RESULTSDespite severe lymphopenia affecting all major lymphocyte subpopulations, patients with severe disease mounted significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells as compared with convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells dominated over CD8+ T cells and closely correlated with the number of plasmablasts and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG levels.

DESIGN Intervention study: before-after trial with 3-month follow-up evaluation. SETTING Outpatient clinic within a tertiary care academic health science center. PARTICIPANTS Adults (N=9) with chronic (>12 mo) dysphagia after unsuccessful prior therapies. Subjects were identified from among patients referred to an outpatient dysphagia clinic. Subjects had dysphagia secondary to prior treatment for head/neck cancer or from neurologic injury. All subjects demonstrated clinical and fluoroscopic evidence of oropharyngeal dysphagia. No subject withdrew during the course of this study. INTERVENTIONS All subjects completed 3 weeks of an intensive, exercise-based dysphagia therapy. Therapy was conducted daily for 1h/d, with additional activities completed by subjects each night between therapy sessions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes were clinical and functional change in swallowing performance with maintenance at 3 months after intervention. Secondary, exploratory outcomes included physiological change in swallow performance measured by hyolaryngeal elevation, lingual-palatal and pharyngeal manometric pressure, and surface electromyographic amplitude. RESULTS Clinical and functional swallowing performances improved significantly and were maintained at the 3-month follow-up examination.

Methods: Responding to the crisis, the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) developed an e-learning course to support healthcare worker well-being and resilience. A self-paced, asynchronous learning model was used as the training intervention. Each module included practical, skill-building activities. An outcome evaluation was conducted to determine if completing the course improved healthcare worker knowledge of and confidence in the learning outcomes of the course, their use of resilience-building behaviours, their resilience, and their well-being. A secondary objective was to explore if there were any associations between behaviours, resilience, and well-being. Participants completed pre- and post-course questionnaires to measure knowledge of and confidence in the learning outcomes, y, frequency of self-reported resilience-building behaviours, and levels of resilience (CD-RISC) and well-being (WHO-5). Results were analysed in STATA using paired T-tests, univariate and multivariate linear regression models. Results: Participants (n = 474; 77.6% female; 55.7% primary care) exhibited significant increases in knowledge, confidence, resilience-building behaviour, resilience, and well-being scores. Statistically significant improvements in the frequency of resilience-building behaviours led to significant improvements in resilience (0.25 points; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.43) and well-being (0.21 points; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.36). Increasing changes in well-being scores had a positive effect on change in resilience scores ( = 0.20; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.29), and vice versa ( = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.41). Conclusion: A healthcare worker e-learning course can build knowledge and skills that may prompt changes in resilience-building behaviours and improvements in well-being and resilience scores. The findings suggest that e-learning courses may improve more than competency-based outcomes alone but further research is warranted to further explore these relationships.","output":"Improving Healthcare Worker Resilience and Well-Being During COVID-19 Using a Self-Directed E-Learning Intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown is essential for containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

While the most severe of these cases require renal replacement therapy (RRT), little is known about their clinical course. METHODS: We describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the ICU with AKI requiring RRT at an academic medical center in New York City and followed patients for outcomes of death and renal recovery using time-to-event analyses. RESULTS: Our cohort of 115 patients represented 23% of all ICU admissions at our center, with a peak prevalence of 29%. Patients were followed for a median of 29 days (2542 total patient-RRT-days; median 54 days for survivors). Mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use were common (99% and 84%, respectively), and the median Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA) score was 14. By the end of follow-up 51% died, 41% recovered kidney function (84% of survivors), and 8% still needed RRT (survival probability at 60 days: 0.46 [95% CI: 0.36-0.56])).

Issues about whether healthcare resources can accommodate extended shared decision-making processes are yet to be resolved. COVID-19 has now stepped into this arena of uncertainty, adding more complexity. U.K. public health responses to the pandemic raise important questions about professional standards regarding how the obtaining and recording of consent might change or be maintained in such emergency conditions, particularly in settings where equipment, medicines, and appropriately trained or specialized staff are in short supply. Such conditions have important implications for the professional capacity and knowledge available to discuss the risks and benefits of and alternatives to proposed treatment with patients. The governments drive to expedite the recruitment to wards of medical students nearing the end of their studies, as well as inviting retired practitioners back into practice, raises questions about the ability of such healthcare providers to engage fully in shared decision-making. This article explores whether the legal duty on healthcare practitioners to disclose the material risks of a proposed medical treatment to a patient should be upheld during pandemic conditions or whether the pre-eminence of patient autonomy should be partly sacrificed in such exceptional circumstances.

METHODS: The total population was divided into five age groups (0-17, 18-29, 30-59, 60-74, and 75 years). Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was used to estimate the transmission rate of each age group. Mathematical model simulation was conducted until December 31, 2021, by establishing various strategies for vaccination and social distancing without considering variants. RESULTS: MLE results revealed that the group aged 0-17 years had a lower risk of transmission than other age groups, and the older age group had relatively high risks of infection. If 70% of the population will be vaccinated by the end of 2021, then simulations showed that even if social distancing was eased, the effective reproductive number would remain below 1 near August if it was not at the level of the third re-spreading period. However, if social distancing was eased and it reached the level of the re-spreading period, the effective reproductive number could be below 1 at the end of 2021.

The detection of Covid-19 positive cases is an important step to fight the pandemic and save human lives. The polymerase chain reaction test is the most used method to detect Covid-19 positive cases. Various molecular methods and serological methods have also been explored to detect Covid-19 positive cases. Machine learning algorithms have been applied to various kinds of datasets to predict Covid-19 positive cases. The machine learning algorithms were applied on a Covid-19 dataset based on commonly taken laboratory tests to predict Covid-19 positive cases. These types of datasets are easy to collect. The paper investigates the application of decision tree ensembles which are accurate and robust to the selection of parameters. As there is an imbalance between the number of positive cases and the number of negative cases, decision tree ensembles developed for imbalanced datasets are applied. F-measure, precision, recall, area under the precision-recall curve, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve are used to compare different decision tree ensembles. Different performance measures suggest that decision tree ensembles developed for imbalanced datasets perform better.

We explored the potential benefits of the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administered orally in high doses (600 mg every 8 h), added to standard of care in COVID-19 patients by using the free text information contained in their electronic health records (EHRs). Out of 19,208 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized, we studied 2071 (10.8%) users of oral NAC at high doses. COVID-19 patients treated with NAC were older, predominantly male, and with more comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and COPD when compared with those not on NAC (all p < 0.05). Despite greater baseline risk, use of NAC in COVID-19 patients was associated with significantly lower mortality (OR 0.56; 95%CI 0.47C0.67), a finding that remained significant in a multivariate analysis adjusting by baseline characteristics and concomitant use of corticosteroids. There were no significant differences with the use of NAC on the mean duration of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit or use of invasive mechanical ventilation.

Due to the deceiving nature of fake news, applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the news content alone is insufficient.

The proper usage of this information, however, introduces three chronic difficulties: 1) multi-level social context information is hard to be used without information loss, 2) temporal information is hard to be used along with multi-level social context information, 3) news representation with multi-level social context and temporal information is hard to be learned in an end-to-end manner. To overcome all three difficulties, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, Hetero-SCAN. We use Meta-Path to extract meaningful multi-level social context information without loss. Meta-Path, a composite relation connecting two node types, is proposed to capture the semantics in the heterogeneous graph. We then propose Meta-Path instance encoding and aggregation methods to capture the temporal information of user engagement and produce news representation end-to-end.

Dynamic features were revealed through time-lapse video recording and aspects of macrophage function were assessed. The two cell forms were shown to be different pre-mitotic stages of a single cell type. The cell cycle for these cells involved an initial large, flat, quiescent cell which retracted to yield a slightly rounded form with numerous processes. This latter form lost processes and developed profuse filopodia as it became very rounded just prior to division; both resulting daughter cells then regained the initial large flat appearance. These cells possessed several properties of macrophages, including phagocytosis, nucleoside diphosphatase enzyme, and CR3 receptors. These properties were transient, expressed just before and after mitosis, but subsequently down-regulated in the flat daughter cells. Because of this feature, it was difficult to determine the exact size of this cell population; however, the observed rate of proliferation suggests it may be substantial. It is suggested that these cells correspond to non-microglial macrophages of brain tissue and, because of their significant down-regulation, they may be difficult to detect.

METHODS: Infant falls while feeding was selected as the fall mechanism to demonstrate the approach being taken to develop this intervention. In phase 1, the Behaviour Change Wheel was used as a theoretical framework supported by a literature review to define intervention components that were then implemented as a mobile app. In phase 2, after the person-based approach, user testing through think-aloud interviews and comprehension assessments were used to refine the content and implementation of the intervention. RESULTS: The target behaviors identified in phase 1 were adequate rest for the newborns mother and safe feeding practices defined as prepare, position, and place. From behavioral determinants and the Behaviour Change Wheel, the behavior change functions selected to achieve these target behaviors were psychological capability, social opportunity, and reflective motivation. The selected behavior change techniques aligned with these functions were providing information on health consequences, using a credible source, instruction on performing each behavior, and social support. The defined intervention was implemented in a draft Android app. In phase 2, 4 rounds of user testing were required to achieve the predefined target comprehension level. The results from the think-aloud interviews were used to refine the intervention content and app features.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey composed of 16 questions, prepared using Google forms and distributed through students' E-learning platforms. The survey explored factors affecting students' preference for remote E-exams, methods for course assessment/evaluation, factors related to students exam dishonesty/misconduct during remote E-exams and measures that can be considered to reduce this behavior. Data were analyzed using descriptive, cross tabulation and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: Among 730 students, approximately only one third preferred remote E-exams. This was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with academic major, efforts/time for remote E-exam preparation, questions appropriateness with study material, and academic achievements (students Grade Point Average (GPA), curriculum objectives). Combining both exams and quizzes was the most preferred method of assessment (30%), while submission of reports or short written assignments was the least preferred ones.

OBJECTIVE: Based on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence data derived from a statewide random sample (as opposed to relying on reported case counts), we determine the infection-hospitalization ratio (IHR), defined as the percentage of infected individuals who are hospitalized, for various demographic groups in Indiana. Furthermore, for comparison, we show the extent to which case-based hospitalization ratios, compared with the IHR, overestimate the probability of hospitalization by demographic group. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of statewide prevalence data from Indiana, COVID-19 hospitalization data extracted from a statewide health information exchange, and all reported COVID-19 cases to the state health department. SETTING: State of Indiana as of April 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic-stratified IHRs and case-hospitalization ratios. RESULTS: The overall IHR was 2.1% and varied more by age than by race or sex. Infection-hospitalization ratio estimates ranged from 0.4% for those younger than 40 years to 9.2% for those older than 60 years. Hospitalization rates based on case counts overestimated the IHR by a factor of 10, but this overestimation differed by demographic groups, especially age.

We hypothesise that optimising sleep position in infants with CP may improve airway patency and offer a low-cost, high-impact intervention to prevent the negative impacts of OSA. Because cleft centres give inconsistent advice about sleep position: some recommend back-lying and others side-lying, we will compare these in a randomised controlled trial. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The aim is to determine the clinical effectiveness of side-lying as compared with back-lying sleep positioning in terms of reducing oxygen desaturation resulting from OSA in 244 infants aged 3C5 weeks of age, diagnosed with an isolated CP in/by UK cleft centres. Primary outcome is the 4% Oxygen Desaturation Index measured using pulse oximetry during sleep. RESEARCH PLAN: 1. Multicentre randomised controlled trial of side-lying compared with back-lying sleep positioning in reducing oxygen desaturation resulting from OSA in infants with CP at one month of age. 2. Internal pilot questionnaire-based study to support parents and clinicians regarding study participation, seeking to identify and address any barriers to recruitment. Monitoring data from the internal pilot will be used in the final analysis. 3. Co-development of new UK recommendations with Cleft Lip and Palate Association (CLAPA) regarding sleep position for infants with CP. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has received the favourable opinion of the West Midlands-South Birmingham Research Ethics Committee. Study results will be published on affiliated webpages and in peer-reviewed publications and conference contributions.

One way to assess the relationship between signals from different brain regions is to measure their phase synchronization (PS) across time. There are several ways to perform such analyses, and we compare methods that utilize a PS metric together with a sliding window, referred to here as windowed phase synchronization (WPS), with those that directly measure the instantaneous phase synchronization (IPS). In particular, IPS has recently gained popularity as it offers single time-point resolution of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. In this paper, we discuss the underlying assumptions required for performing PS analyses and emphasize the importance of band-pass filtering the data to obtain valid results. Further, we contrast this approach with the use of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to achieve similar goals. We review various methods for evaluating PS and introduce a new approach within the IPS framework denoted the cosine of the relative phase (CRP). We contrast methods through a series of simulations and application to rs-fMRI data. Our results indicate that CRP outperforms other tested methods and overcomes issues related to undetected temporal transitions from positive to negative associations common in IPS analysis. Further, in contrast to phase coherence, CRP unfolds the distribution of PS measures, which benefits subsequent clustering of PS matrices into recurring brain states.","output":"Evaluating phase synchronization methods in fMRI: a comparison study and new approaches."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections are a common cause of acute myocarditis.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize ventilatory (V(E)) responses to exercise following warm-up walking in individuals with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) during constant work rate (CWR) exercise. Secondarily, to investigate V(E) and tidal volume (V(T)) variability, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) before and after overground locomotor training (OLT). SETTING: Research laboratory. METHODS: A 6-min CWR walking bout at preferred pace was used as a warm-up followed by 6 min of rest and a second 6-min CWR bout at above preferred walking pace. The second CWR bout was analyzed. Breath-by-breath ventilatory data were examined using a curvilinear least squares fitting procedure with a mono-exponential model. V(E) and V(T) variability was calculated as the difference between the observed and predicted values and RPE was taken every 2 min. RESULTS: Participants (n = 3, C4CC5) achieved a hyperpneic response to exercise in V(E) and V(T). OLT resulted in faster ventilatory kinetics and reductions of 24 and 29% for V(E) and V(T) variability, respectively. A 30% reduction in RPE was concurrent with the reductions in ventilatory variability. CONCLUSIONS: OLT may improve ventilatory control during CWR in patients with cervical motor-iSCI. These data suggest that in some participants with iSCI, ventilation may influence RPE during walking. Future research should investigate mechanisms of ventilatory variability and its implications in walking performance in patients with iSCI.","output":"Effect of overground locomotor training on ventilatory kinetics and rate of perceived exertion in persons with cervical motor-incomplete spinal cord injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery is one of the most effective treatments for patients with severe and complex obesity. Lifestyle modifications in diet and exercise habits have long been important adjunct to the long-term success after bariatric surgery. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the postoperative bariatric patient is not well understood. We sought to evaluate the impact the COVID-19 pandemic on postoperative weight loss at 1 year in a bariatric cohort. METHODS: All patients who underwent bariatric surgery from January 1, 2020, to March 12, 2020, were included. Patients who underwent bariatric surgery during the same period of the two preceding years (2018 and 2019) were included as control groups. Primary end point was %EBMIL at 1 year. A telephone survey was administered to all patients from 2020 to assess for their perception on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on weight loss. RESULTS: A total of 596 patients were included: 181 from 2020, 199 from 2019, and 216 from 2018. The response rate was 97% and 53.4% of patients reported that the lockdown affected their ability to lose weight. The %EBMIL at 1 year was 64.1%, 63.7%, and 68.1% for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. There was no difference in weight loss at 1 year (p = 0.77) despite a decrease in exercise activity in those who had surgery just before the pandemic.

Methodology This study was conducted from March to July 2020 in the COVID-19 unit of a tertiary care hospital in Karachi. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), one group received the intervention [50 mg/kg/day of intravenous (IV) VC] along with the standard therapy, and the other group received standard therapy only. Data such as age, gender, vitals, and biochemical values as well as outcomes including the number of days required for treatment, hospital stay, need for ventilation, and mortality were compared between the two groups and recorded using a self-structured questionnaire. Results COVID-19 patients who received IV VC became symptom-free earlier (7.1  1.8 vs. 9.6  2.1 days, p-value: <0.0001) and spent fewer days in the hospital (8.1  1.8 vs. 10.7  2.2 days, p-value: <0.0001) compared to those who received standard therapy only. However, there was no significant difference in the need for mechanical ventilation (p-value: 0.406) and mortality (p-value: 0.31) between the two groups.

However, while the One Health approach gains increasing momentum, its practical application meets hindrances. This paper investigates the environmental pillar of the One Health approach, using two case studies to highlight the integration of environmental considerations. The first case study pertains to the Danish monitoring and surveillance programme for antimicrobial resistance, DANMAP. The second case illustrates the occurrence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in milk in dairy-producing ruminants in Italian regions. Method: A scientific literature search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science to locate articles informing the two cases. Grey literature was gathered to describe the cases as well as their contexts. Results: 19 articles and 10 reports were reviewed and informed the two cases. The cases show how the environmental component influences the apparent impacts for human and animal health. The DANMAP highlights the two approaches One Health and farm to fork. The literature provides information on the comprehensiveness of the DANMAP, but highlights some shortcomings in terms of environmental considerations. The AFM1 case, the milk metabolite of the carcinogenic mycotoxin aflatoxin B1, shows that dairy products are heavily impacted by changes of the climate as well as by economic drivers. Conclusions: The two cases show that environmental conditions directly influence the onset and diffusion of hazardous factors. Climate change, treatment of soils, water and standards in slaughterhouses as well as farms can have a great impact on the health of animals, humans and the environment.

We demonstrate that mobile-phone use during illness differs measurably from routine behavior: Diagnosed individuals exhibit less movement than normal (1.1 to 1.4 fewer unique tower locations; [Formula: see text]), on average, in the 2 to 4 d around diagnosis and place fewer calls (2.3 to 3.3 fewer calls; [Formula: see text]) while spending longer on the phone (41- to 66-s average increase; [Formula: see text]) than usual on the day following diagnosis. The results suggest that anonymously linked CDRs and health data may be sufficiently granular to augment epidemic surveillance efforts and that infectious disease-modeling efforts lacking explicit behavior-change mechanisms need to be revisited.","output":"Cell-phone traces reveal infection-associated behavioral change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La actual pandemia por la COVID-19 est ocasionado serias amenazas para la salud pblica a nivel mundial, especialmente para los grupos de poblacin ms vulnerables Los casos ms graves de la enfermedad han sido primeramente atendidos por los profesionales de urgencias y emergencias, los cuales han tenido que tomar decisiones en contextos altamente complejos donde la priorizacin en la asignacin de los recursos sanitarios disponibles les ha generado situaciones ticamente conflictivas El objetivo del presente artculo es analizar la importancia de implantar la PDA en los servicios de urgencias y emergencias como herramienta de consulta en la resolucin de los problemas ticos surgidos durante la pandemia por COVID-19, concretamente, en la atencin al paciente crnico complejo o con enfermedad crnica avanzada The events of the present CoVID-19 pandemic are causing serious threats to Public Health worldwide, specifically at the most vulnerable population groups Emergency professionals have served as the first responders for the most serious cases of this disease At the same time, they have made decisions in highly complex contexts where the prioritization of allocated care resources has generated ethically conflictive situations The aim of this article is to analyze the importance of implementing the ACP as a tool in the emergency services to solve ethical problems that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the care of complex chronic patients or those with advanced chronic disease L&#039;actual pandmia per la COVID-19 est ocasionat serioses amenaces a la salut pblica a nivell mundial, especialment als grups de poblaci ms vulnerables Els casos ms greus de la malaltia han estat primerament atesos pels professionals d&#039;urgncies I emergncies, els quals han hagut de prendre decisions en contextos altament complexos on la prioritzaci en l&#039;assignaci dels recursos sanitaris disponibles els ha generat situacions ticament conflictives L&#039;objectiu d&#039;aquest article va ser analitzar la importncia d&#039;implantar la PDA en els serveis d&#039;urgncies I emergncies com a eina de consulta a la resoluci dels problemes tics sorgits durant la pandmia per COVID-19, concretament, en l&#039;atenci al pacient crnic complex o amb malaltia crnica avan?ada","output":"La planificacin de decisiones anticipadas como estrategia preventiva de conflictos ticos en urgencias y emergencias durante y despus de la COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to solve the problems of high energy consumption and low current efficiency in electrochemical oxidation (EO) degradation under the traditional constant output process (COP), a gradient output process (GOP) of current density is proposed in this paper.

We evaluated model performance using simulated communities, computing out-of-sample predictive accuracy and parameter recovery across different input sample sizes. We applied our method to a diverse empirical community, allowing us to disentangle the direct role of environmental gradients on species' intrinsic growth rates from indirect effects via competitive interactions. We also identified a few neighbouring species from the diverse community that had non-generic interactions with our focal species.

Regulatory sandboxes allow developers, in cooperation with an agency, to conduct limited tests of new technologies in real-world settings for the purpose of generating and sharing information about them. Thus far, however, regulatory sandboxesas named appear almost exclusively in the context of financial technologies, or FinTech. Whether regulatory sandboxes, in fact, exist elsewhere in administrative law would be a significant finding for both regulators and scholars;it would blunt criticisms that agencies are slow to respond to new technologies, provide regulators with an additional tool for governing new technologies, and suggest that lessons learned from current regulatory sandboxes are applicable elsewhere. This Article is the first to explore this broader view of regulatory sandboxes and develop a synoptic theory of them. To do so, it uses one of the most radical programs to introduce new technologies in US history: the US Food and Drug Administrations (FDAs) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) program for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. EUAslike regulatory sandboxes but in stark contrast to typical FDA approval processesfocus on real-world deployment as a means for information gathering. EUAs are also technologically flexible and crafted with close input from the developer, among other features. Generalizing FDAs experience with EUAs also provides lessons about the intersection of regulatory sandboxes with public trust in the agency, political interference, and the maintenance of regulatory standards. At the same time, FDAs COVIDC19 EUAs are exceptional in two senses: they touch upon the public health, widely considered to be exceptional subject matter in administrative law;and arose in the context of unprecedented global pandemic. Nonetheless, FDAs experience with EUAs suggest regulatory sandboxes may be an underexplored and undertheorized feature of administrative governance of new technologies. Future work in the area should assess whether regulatory sandboxes exist under the rubric identified here, which technologies they regulate, and how those sandboxes operate.","output":"Regulatory Sandboxes and the Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Ecuador, the net energy contribution of biofuels is unknown or unnoticed. To address this issue, we determined the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) for bioethanol and biodiesel. The selection of raw materials relied on their productive capacity, export and import records, and historical yields. Consequently, the scope included three raw materials for ethanol (sugar cane, corn, and forest residues) and four for biodiesel (African palm, pinion, bovine fat, and swine fat). Using a method based on the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of each biofuel, we assessed the entire production chain through statistical processing of primary and secondary information. Then we calculated the calorific values in the laboratory, compared energy inputs/outputs, and finally obtained the energetic returns. EROIs for bioethanol were: 1.797 for sugarcane, 1.040 for corn, and 0.739 for wood. The results for biodiesel were: 3.052 for African palm, 2.743 for pinion, 2.187 for bovine fat, and 2.891 for swine fat. These values suggest feasibility only for sugarcane in the case of ethanol. In contrast, biodiesel has better prospects because all the feedstocks analyzed had EROIs higher than two. Nevertheless, biodiesel is not available for trading in Ecuador because energy policy has overlooked systems based on higher energy return. Future studies should consider more comprehensive variables such as climate change, land use, and water management.","output":"Energy Return on Investment (EROI) and Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of biofuels in Ecuador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has become a global health problem.

RESULTS: Most patients were kidney recipients (61.9%), males (68.8%), with median age of 57 years. The majority was on tacrolimus (73.5%) and mycophenolate (65.8%). Mortality was 18.8%, but an equal proportion was still hospitalized at last follow up. Immune suppressive therapy was withheld in 77.2% of patients, either partially or completely. Tacrolimus was continued in 50%. One third of survivors that continued immunosuppressants were on dual therapy plus steroids. None of those who continued immunosuppressants developed critical COVID-19 disease.

Methods The epidemiology of GBS cases reported via the UK National Immunoglobulin Database were studied from 2016-2019 and compared to cases reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the cohort study, members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society reported all cases of GBS during the pandemic. The clinical features, investigation findings and outcomes of COVID-19 (definite or probable) and non-COVID-19 associated GBS cases were compared. Results The UK GBS incidence from 2016-2019 was 1.65-1.88 per 100,000 people per year. GBS and COVID-19 incidence varied between regions and did not correlate (r = 0.06, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.63, p=0.86). GBS incidence fell between March and May 2020 compared to the same months of 2016-2019. Forty-seven GBS cases were included in the cohort study (13 definite, 12 probable COVID-19 and 22 non-COVID-19).

It is interesting to identify the characteristic and potential role of 3' polyadenylation of Wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), which has been reported to contain two genomic RNAs with 3' poly(A) tails and caused severe disease on wheat in East Asia region. METHODS: 3' RACE was used to identify sequences of the 3 end in WYMV RNAs from naturally infected wheat by WYMV. In vitro translation assay was performed to analyze effect of UTRs of WYMV with or without 3polyadenylation on translation. In vitro replication mediated by WYMV NIb protein were performed to evaluate effect of variable polyadenylation on replication. RESULTS: Variable polyadenylation in WYMV RNAs was identified via 3 RACE. WYMV RNAs in naturally infected wheat in China simultaneously present with regions of long, short, or no adenylation at the 3' ends. The effects of variable polyadenylation on translation and replication of WYMV RNAs were evaluated. 5UTR and 3UTR of WYMV RNA1 or RNA2 synergistically enhanced the translation of the firefly luciferase (Fluc) gene in in vitro WGE system, whereas additional adenylates had an oppositive effect on this enhancement on translation mediated by UTRs of WYMV. Additional adenylates remarkably inhibited the synthesis of complementary strand from viral genome RNA during the in vitro replication mediated by WYMV NIb protein. CONCLUSIONS: 3' end of WYMV RNAs present variable polyadenylation even no polyadenylation. 3' polyadenylation have opposite effect on translation mediated by UTRs of WYMV RNA1 or RNA2. 3' polyadenylation have negative effect on minus-strand synthesis of WYMV RNA in vitro.

METHODS REVASCAT randomized 206 patients with anterior circulation proximal arterial occlusion stroke to Solitaire thrombectomy or best medical treatment alone. Patients with established dementia were excluded from enrollment. Cognitive function was assessed in person with Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B at 3 months and 1 year after randomization by an investigator masked to treatment allocation. Test completion within 5 minutes, time of completion (seconds), and number of errors were recorded. RESULTS From November 2012 to December 2014, 206 patients were enrolled in REVASCAT. TMT was assessed in 82 of 84 patients undergoing thrombectomy and 86 of 87 control patients alive at 3 months and in 71 of 79 patients undergoing thrombectomy and 72 of 78 control patients alive at 1 year. Rates of timely TMT-A completion were similar in both treatment arms, although patients undergoing thrombectomy required less time for TMT-A completion and had higher rates of error-free TMT-A performance. Thrombectomy was also associated with a higher probability of timely TMT-B completion (adjusted odds ratio 3.17, 95% confidence interval 1.51-6.66 at 3 months; and adjusted ratio 3.66, 95% confidence interval 1.60-8.35 at 1 year) and shorter time for TMT-B completion. Differences in TMT completion times between treatment arms were significant in patients with good functional outcome but not in those who were functionally dependent (modified Rankin Scale score >2).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether allergic diseases are a risk factor for hospitalization in COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a study including 107 pediatric patients after COVID-19 recovery. ISAAC Phase 3 questionnaires were distributed together with a detailed history of environmental factors and an allergic evaluation including skin prick tests, specific IgE tests, and spirometry. We investigated the prevalence of allergic diseases and evaluated the factors associated with hospitalization in COVID-19. RESULTS: Sixty-one (57%) patients were hospitalized and 46 (43%) patients were followed closely in the outpatient clinic. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR ), recurrent wheezing, atopic dermatitis (AD), and asthma was 10.3%, 5.5%, 4.7%, and 3.7%, respectively, within the whole study population. While having asthma  AR, AD, and passive tobacco exposure were not found to be related to hospitalization due to COVID-19, having a pet at home was found to be decreased risk of hospitalization (OR: 0.191, 95% CI: 0.047-0.779, p = 0.021).

The present meta-analysis was performed to evaluate chest CT findings in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: All research steps were taken according to the MOOSE protocol and the final report was based on PRISMA guidelines. Each stage of the study was conducted by two independent authors. We searched the Web of Science, Ovid, Science Direct, Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, CINAHL and Google scholar databases. The search was conducted on March 20, 2020. Grey literature was searched at medrxiv website. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. The adapted Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the risk of bias. We registered this review at PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42019127858). Results: Finally, 40 eligible studies with 4,183 patients with COVID-19 were used for meta-analysis. The rate of positive chest CT scan in patients with COVID-19 was 94.5% (95%CI: 91.7-96.3). Bilateral lung involvement, pure ground-glass opacity (GGO), mixed (GGO pulse consolidation or reticular), consolidation, reticular, and presence of nodule findings in chest CT scan of COVID-19 pneumonia patients were respectively estimated to be 79.1% (95% CI: 70.8-85.5), 64.9% (95%CI: 54.1-74.4), 49.2% (95%CI: 35.7-62.8), 30.3% (95%CI: 19.6-43.6), 17.0% (95%CI: 3.9-50.9) and 16.6% (95%CI: 13.6-20.2). The distribution of lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was peripheral (70.0% [95%CI: 57.8-79.9]), central (3.9% [95%CI: 1.4-10.6]), and peripheral and central (31.1% [95%CI: 19.5-45.8]). The most common pulmonary lobes involved were right lower lobe (86.5% [95%CI: 57.7-96.8]) and left lower lobe (81.0% [95%CI: 50.5-94.7]).

DESIGN: A systematic review and realist review were conducted. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO were searched (systematic review). PubMed, pre-prints and grey literature were also searched (realist review). The databases were searched from inception until October 2020. STUDY SELECTION: There were no restrictions on the study design. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For the systematic review, toilet paper hoarding was the main outcome, and pathological use of toilet paper was the secondary outcome. For the realist review, the context-mechanisms-outcome (CMO) scheme included the COVID-19 pandemic (context), four proposed mechanisms, and one outcome (toilet paper hoarding). The four potential mechanisms were (1) gastrointestinal mechanisms of COVID-19 (e.g. diarrhoea), (2) social cognitive biases, (3) stress-related factors (mental illnesses, personality traits) and (4) cultural aspects (e.g. differences between countries). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: All studies of human populations were considered (including general population studies and clinical studies of patients suffering from mental health problems). RESULTS: The systematic review identified 14 studies (eight studies for the main outcome, six studies for the secondary outcome). Three surveys identified the role of the COVID-19 threat in toilet paper hoarding in the general population. One study pointed to an association between a personality trait (conscientiousness) and toilet paper buying and stockpiling as well as an additional significant indirect effect of emotionality through the perceived threat of COVID-19 on toilet paper buying and stockpiling. Six case reports of pathological use of toilet paper were also identified, although none of them were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The realist review suggested that of all the mechanisms, social cognitive biases and a bandwagon effect were potential contributors to toilet paper hoarding in the general population. The stressful situation (COVID-19 pandemic) and some personality traits (conscientiousness) were found to be associated with toilet paper hoarding. Cultural differences were also identified, with relatively substantial effects of toilet paper hoarding in several Asian regions (Australia, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a worldwide increase in toilet paper hoarding. Social media and social cognitive biases are major contributors and might explain some differences in toilet paper hoarding between countries. Other mental health-related factors, such as the stressful situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, fear of contagion, or particular personality traits (conscientiousness), are likely to be involved.

Variables about preoperation, intraoperation and postoperation were collected. AKI was diagnosed using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. RESULTS: Among 383 critically ill patients undergoing emergency surgery, 151 (39.4%) patients developed postoperative AKI. Postoperative reoperation, postoperative Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, and postoperative serum lactic acid (LAC) were independent risk factors for postoperative AKI, with the adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) of 1.854 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.091C3.152), 1.059 (95%CI, 1.018C1.102), and 1.239 (95%CI, 1.047C1.467), respectively.

We aimed to understand the interaction between these diseases by profiling COVID-19 gene expression signatures on RNA-sequencing data from TB-infected individuals. Methods: We performed a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis by querying PubMed and pre-print servers to derive eligible COVID-19 gene expression signatures from human whole blood (WB), PBMCs or BALF studies. A WB influenza dataset served as a control respiratory disease signature. Three large TB RNA-seq datasets, comprising multiple cohorts from the UK and Africa and consisting of TB patients across the disease spectrum, were chosen to profile these signatures. Putative \\"COVID-19 risk scores\\" were generated for each sample in the TB datasets using the TBSignatureProfiler package. Risk was stratified by time to TB diagnosis in progressors and contacts of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. An integrative analysis between TB and COVID-19 single-cell RNA-seq data was performed and a population-level meta-analysis was conducted to identify shared gene ontologies between the diseases and their relative enrichment in COVID-19 disease severity states. Results: 35 COVID-19 gene signatures from nine eligible studies comprising 98 samples were profiled on TB RNA-seq data from 1181 samples from 853 individuals. 25 signatures had significantly higher COVID-19 risk in active TB (ATB) compared with latent TB infection (p <0005), 13 of which were validated in two independent datasets. FCN1 - and SPP1 -expressing macrophages enriched in BALF during severe COVID-19 were identified in circulation during ATB. Shared perturbed ontologies included antigen presentation, epigenetic regulation, platelet activation, and ROS/RNS production were enriched with increasing COVID-19 severity. Finally, we demonstrate that the overlapping transcriptional responses may complicate development of blood-based diagnostic signatures of co-infection. Interpretation: Our results identify shared dysregulation of immune responses in COVID-19 and TB as a dual risk posed by co-infection to COVID-19 severity and TB disease progression. These individuals should be followed up for TB in the months subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","output":"Systematic evaluation of transcriptomic disease risk and diagnostic biomarker overlap between COVID-19 and tuberculosis: a patient-level meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The worldwide pandemic involving the novel respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) has forced healthcare systems to delay elective operations, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, to conserve resources. This study provides a structured analysis of the decision to delay AAA repair and quantify the potential for harm. METHODS: A decision tree was constructed modeling immediate repair of AAA relative to an initial non-operative (delayed repair) approach. Risk of COVID-19 contraction and mortality, aneurysm rupture, and operative mortality were considered. A deterministic sensitivity analysis for a range of patient ages (50 to >80), probability of COVID-19 infection (0.01%-30%), aneurysm size (5.5->7cm), and time horizons (3-9 months) was performed. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted for three representative ages (60, 70, 80). Analyses were conducted for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open surgical repair (OSR). RESULTS: Patients with aneurysms 7cm or greater demonstrated a higher probability of survival when treated with immediate EVAR or OSR, compared to delayed repair, for patients under 80 years of age. When considering EVAR for aneurysms 5.5-6.9cm, immediate repair had a higher probability of survival except in settings with high probability of COVID-19 infection (10-30%) and advanced age (70-85+ years). A non-operative strategy maximized the probability of survival as patient age or operative risk increased. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that patients with large aneurysms (>7cm) faced a 5.4-7.7% absolute increase in the probability of mortality with a delay of repair of 3 months. Young patients (60-70 years) with 6-6.9cm aneurysms demonstrated an elevated risk of mortality (1.5-1.9%) with a delay of 3 months. Those with 5-5.9cm aneurysms demonstrated an increased survival with immediate repair in young patients (60), however this was small in magnitude (0.2-0.8%). The potential for harm increased as length of surgical delay increased. For elderly patients requiring OSR, in the context of endemic COVID-19, delay of repair improves probability of survival. CONCLUSION: The decision to delay operative repair of AAA should consider both patient age and local COVID-19 prevalence in addition to aneurysm size. EVAR should be considered when possible due to a reduced risk of harm and lower resource utilization.","output":"Reassessing the operative threshold for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in the context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many post-mortem studies addressing the cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 provided valuable information but were limited by their small sample size.

Sleep disturbance during hospitalization is especially problematic as sleep is associated with both physical and psychological well-being. Poorer sleep has been found to impact recovery outcomes in a number of patient populations including mild traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, and most recently, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The current analyses examined pilot data from a novel brief modularized sleep intervention implemented with older adult Veterans living on a subacute rehabilitation unit. METHODS: Participants were screened for sleep problems upon admission to the unit. Veterans who screened positive were invited to participate in the sleep intervention. Components of the intervention were selected based on screener responses and included group sleep hygiene psychoeducation, environmental accommodations (e.g. ear plugs, eye mask, soothing music), and CPAP use education. Measures completed at pre- and post- intervention assessed sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), global health functioning (PROMIS Global Health Scale), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9). Pre- and post- scores were compared using paired sample t-tests. Two samples t-tests compared change scores in PHQ-9 between groups. RESULTS: A total of 33 Veterans were included in the analyses (Mage = 69.6, 3 female, intervention group n = 21). Participants showed a trend toward decreased PHQ-9 scores following the intervention (t(16) = 1.58, p = 0.100). There were no significant effects of the intervention on sleep quality or global health. Compared to the non-intervention group, the intervention group showed greater decrease in PHQ-9 scores at the time of post-intervention (t(25) = .828, p = .025). CONCLUSION: Preliminary data suggests that a brief modularized sleep intervention may benefit depressive symptoms for older adults during hospitalization. Additional research is needed to better understand the impact of a brief intervention on self-reported sleep quality during the hospitalization period.

By using several experimental approaches, we investigated the potential association between SARS-CoV-2 IgGs recognizing the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) targeting S, and COVID-19 severity. Patients and Methods: This unicenter, retrospective, observational study included 51 hospitalized patients (24 at the intensive care unit; ICU). A total of 93 sera from these patients collected at different time points from the onset of symptoms were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgGs were quantitated by ELISA and NtAb50 titers were measured in a GFP reporter-based pseudotyped virus platform. Demographic and clinical data, complete blood counts, as well as serum levels of ferritin, Dimer-D, C reactive protein (CRP), lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were retrieved from clinical charts. Results: The overall correlation between levels of both antibody measurements was good (Rho=0.79; P=0<0.001).

Meanwhile, a negative relationship is observed between Covid-19 and the ischaemic heart disease;however, the estimated coefficients for this relationship are very low and close to zero;hence further investigation, including assessment from a different perspective, is necessary for validation. In conclusion, the model suggests that the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables are nonstationary.

Digital mental health tools such as apps could provide an option for accessible perinatal mental health screening and assessment. However, there is a lack of information regarding the availability and features of perinatal app options. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the current state of diagnostic and screening apps for perinatal mental health available on the Google Play Store (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS) and to review their features following the mHealth Index and Navigation Database framework. METHODS: Following a scoping review approach, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store were systematically searched to identify perinatal mental health assessment apps. A total of 14 apps that met the inclusion criteria were downloaded and reviewed in a standardized manner using the mHealth Index and Navigation Database framework. The framework comprised 107 questions, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of app origin, functionality, engagement features, security, and clinical use. RESULTS: Most apps were developed by for-profit companies (n=10), followed by private individuals (n=2) and trusted health care companies (n=2). Out of the 14 apps, 3 were available only on Android devices, 4 were available only on iOS devices, and 7 were available on both platforms. Approximately one-third of the apps (n=5) had been updated within the last 180 days. A total of 12 apps offered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in its original version or in rephrased versions. Engagement, input, and output features included reminder notifications, connections to therapists, and free writing features. A total of 6 apps offered psychoeducational information and references. Privacy policies were available for 11 of the 14 apps, with a median Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level of 12.3. One app claimed to be compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and 2 apps claimed to be compliant with General Data Protection Regulation. Of the apps that could be accessed in full (n=10), all appeared to fulfill the claims stated in their description. Only 1 app referenced a relevant peer-reviewed study. All the apps provided a warning for use, highlighting that the mental health assessment result should not be interpreted as a diagnosis or as a substitute for medical care. Only 3 apps allowed users to export or email their mental health test results. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that there are opportunities to improve perinatal mental health assessment apps. To this end, we recommend focusing on the development and validation of more comprehensive assessment tools, ensuring data protection and safety features are adequate for the intended app use, and improving data sharing features between users and health care professionals for timely support.","output":"mHealth Solutions for Perinatal Mental Health: Scoping Review and Appraisal Following the mHealth Index and Navigation Database Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gridded management system is officially highlighted as playing a key role in Chinas combat against COVID-19.

Burnout may substantially hinder the well-being and morale of healthcare providers, challenging our efforts at disease containment. This study investigated the relationship between perceived COVID-19 stigma and burnout symptoms among physicians and nurses. We further aimed to identify potential factors that may moderate this relationship, including profession, clinical contact with COVID-19 patients, and prior experience with 2003 SARS-CoV-1. METHODS: We used a web-based, structured survey from March 12th to 29th, 2020 to collect cross-sectional, self-reported data. Participants were provided with a link to the survey which took them on average 5-8 minutes. Survey consisted of demographic characteristics, clinical experiences, perceived COVID-19 related stigma, and burnout symptoms. Linear regression with bootstrapping techniques was adopted to test the relations between stigma and burnout, as well as other potential moderators, while adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: Of the 1421 consented respondents, 357 identified as physicians while 1064 identified as nurses. Participants reported some levels of stigma, and noticeable burnout symptoms. Burnout symptoms were positively correlated with COVID-19 stigma, profession, and currently care for confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients. The interaction between stigma and profession (Stigma  Nurses) but no other interaction terms reached the significance level, suggesting that the slope for nurses was flatter than the slope for physicians.

We evaluated efficacy of UPA in pts who had an inadequate response (IR), loss of response, or intolerance to biologic therapies (Bio-IR) or were non-Bio-IR. Methods: U-ACHIEVE and U-ACCOMPLISH, multicentre, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled trials, randomized pts with moderately to severely active UC to UPA 45 mg QD or PBO for 8 weeks (wks). Randomization was stratified by status of previous biologic failure, ie an inadequate response (IR), loss of response, or intolerance to biologic therapies (Bio-IR or bio-failure) vs non-Bio-IR (nonbio-IR or non-bio-failure), baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), and baseline adapted Mayo score (7 or>7). Efficacy endpoints included primary endpoint of clinical remission (adaptedMayo score) at Wk 8 and ranked secondary endpoints of clinical response (partial adapted Mayo score at Wk 2 and adapted Mayo score at Wk 8), endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopic subscore 0 or 1), endoscopic remission (Mayo endoscopic subscore 0) and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement at Wk 8 (HEMI;endoscopic subscore 1 and Geboes score 3.1). Results using non-responder imputation incorporating multiple imputation for missing data due to COVID-19 are reported. Results: In both studies, approximately half the pts were Bio-IR (Table 1). In both Bio-IR and non-Bio-IR pts, significantly higher proportion of pts receiving UPA achieved primary endpoint of clinical remission versus PBO;the magnitude of clinical remission at Wk 8 was greater in non-Bio-IR pts (UPA, 35% vs PBO, 9%;treatment difference [95% CI]: 26.0% [16.0, 36.1]) versus Bio-IR (UPA, 18% vs PBO, 0%;17.5% [11.4, 23.6]) in U-ACHIEVE and non-Bio-IR (UPA, 38% vs PBO, 6%;31.6% [22.8, 40.5]) versus Bio-IR (UPA, 30% vs PBO, 2%;27.1% [19.6, 34.7];Table 1) in U-ACCOMPLISH.

To control outbreaks, many prisons in the USA restricted in-person activities, which are now resuming even as viral variants proliferate. This study aims to use mathematical modelling to assess the risks and harms of COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons under a range of policies, including resumption of activities. METHODS: We obtained daily resident-level data for all California state prisons from Jan 1, 2020, to May 15, 2021, describing prison layouts, housing status, sociodemographic and health characteristics, participation in activities, and COVID-19 testing, infection, and vaccination status. We developed a transmission-dynamic stochastic microsimulation parameterised by the California data and published literature. After an initial infection is introduced to a prison, the model evaluates the effect of various policy scenarios on infections and hospitalisations over 200 days. Scenarios vary by vaccine coverage, baseline immunity (0%, 25%, or 50%), resumption of activities, and use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that reduce transmission by 75%. We simulated five prison types that differ by residential layout and demographics, and estimated outcomes with and without repeated infection introductions over the 200 days. FINDINGS: If a viral variant is introduced into a prison that has resumed pre-2020 contact levels, has moderate vaccine coverage (ranging from 36% to 76% among residents, dependent on age, with 40% coverage for staff), and has no baseline immunity, 23C74% of residents are expected to be infected over 200 days. High vaccination coverage (90%) coupled with NPIs reduces cumulative infections to 2C54%. Even in prisons with low room occupancies (ie, no more than two occupants) and low levels of cumulative infections (ie, <10%), hospitalisation risks are substantial when these prisons house medically vulnerable populations. Risks of large outbreaks (>20% of residents infected) are substantially higher if infections are repeatedly introduced. INTERPRETATION: Balancing benefits of resuming activities against risks of outbreaks presents challenging trade-offs. After achieving high vaccine coverage, prisons with mostly one-to-two-person cells that have higher baseline immunity from previous outbreaks can resume in-person activities with low risk of a widespread new outbreak, provided they maintain widespread NPIs, continue testing, and take measures to protect the medically vulnerable.

This study examined the media accounts during that period by analysing the representation of death-related constructs in Corriere della Sera, the most widely read newspaper in Italy. A textual and thematic analysis of articles published between period A (epidemic: 23 January-22 February 2020) and period B (pandemic: 23 February-31 March 2020) was conducted using Nvivo-11. A total of 141 articles comprising 48,524 words were collected. The most utilised words and meanings linked to COVID-19 were computed. In the rank distribution, 'China' and 'virus' were the terms most frequently used in both periods. The terms 'death' and 'dead' were completely absent in period A and appeared in the 535th position in period B. The term 'dead' was used primarily to indicate the number of deceased. From a Terror Management Theory perspective, it is possible that the minimal reference to death-related issues was a reflection of death denial and a manifestation of efforts to deny death to manage terror. These findings highlight the ambiguities and ambivalence surrounding any issue pertaining to death; on the one side, undue alarmism may provoke exaggerated reactions, such as moral panic, while on the other denial-based messages that minimise references to mortality may reduce safe behaviour during a pandemic.","output":"Journalistic Denial of Death during the Very First Traumatic Period of the Italian COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Socioeconomic and ethnic background have been discussed as possible risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infections in children. Improved knowledge could lead way to tailored prevention strategies and help to improve infection control. Methods: Observational population-based cohort study in children (6mo. - 18 ys.) scheduled for legally required preventive examination and their parents in a metropolitan region in Germany. Primary endpoint was the SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate during study period. Risk factors assessed included age, pre-existing medical conditions, socioeconomic factors, and ethnicity. Results: 2124 children and their parents were included. Seroconversion rates among children in all age groups increased by 3-4-fold from 06/2020 to 02/2021. Only 41% of seropositive children were symptomatic. In 51% of infected children at least one parent was also SARS-CoV-2 positive. Low level of parental education (OR 3.13 (0.72-13.69)) significantly increased the risk of infection. Of the total cohort, 38.5% had a migration background. Specifically, 9% were of Turkish and 5% of Middle Eastern origin. These children had the highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infections (OR 6.24 (1.38-28.12) and 6.44 (1.14-36.45) after adjustment for other risk factors. Discussion: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children increased by 3-4-fold within the study period. Frequently, more than one family member was infected. Children from families with lower socioeconomic status were at higher risk. The highest risk for SARS- CoV-2 infection was identified in families with Turkish or Middle Eastern background.

However, most of the current COVID-19 clinical practices and trials do not take sex as consideration. Methods: We performed an unbiased sex-based comparative analysis for the clinical outcomes, peripheral immune cells, and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels of 1,558 males and 1,499 females COVID-19 patients from a single center. The lymphocyte subgroups were measured by Flow cytometry. Total antibody, Spike protein (S)-, receptor binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)- specific IgM and IgG levels were measured by chemiluminescence. Results: We found that the mortality and ICU admission rates were approximately 2-fold higher in males than that in females (P<0.005). Survival analysis revealed that sex is an independent prognostic factor for COVID-19 (Hazard ratio=2.2, P=0.003). The concentration of inflammatory factors in peripheral blood was significantly higher in males. Besides, the renal and hepatic abnormality induced by COVID-19 was more common in males during the hospitalization. The analysis of lymphocyte subsets revealed that the percentage of CD19+ B cell and CD4+ T cell was significantly higher in females (P<0.001) during hospitalization, indicating the stronger humoral immunity in females than males. Notably, the protective IgG sharply increased and reached a peak in the fourth week after symptom onset in females, while gradually increased and reached a peak in the seventh week in males. Conclusions: The unfavorable prognosis of male COVID-19 patients may result from the weak humoral immunity and indolent antibody responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery. Early medical intervention and close monitoring are important, especially for male COVID-19 patients. Hormonal or convalescent plasma therapy may help improve the immunity of males to fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Sex-based clinical and immunological differences in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) seniors are generally a medically underserved population that faces unique healthcare challenges. When compared to younger patients, LGBT seniors are at a greater risk for social isolation and have higher rates of smoking, disability, physical and mental distress, and lack of access to healthcare services. They are often reluctant to discuss their sexual orientations and gender identities with healthcare providers due to fear of discrimination and receiving inferior care based on prior unsatisfactory experiences with untrained or insensitive healthcare providers. Furthermore, recent research has revealed that only about 50% of primary care providers indicated confidence in providing culturally competent LGBT healthcare, highlighting the need for more LGBT proficiency training in medical school curricula. Objectives: The aim of this study was to provide early intervention training to first-year medical students regarding best practices for equitable healthcare for LGBT seniors through integrative, small group, case-based discussions. The impact of this activity on the knowledge and attitudes of medical students regarding LGBT healthcare was also assessed. Methods: First-year medical students participated in a two-hour small group, case-based discussion. Each group consisted of seven to eight students with one of seven facilitators who were invited members of the LGBT community. Students were provided with two clinical case scenarios related to treatment of LGBT senior patients. Students were given a pre/post-session knowledge and attitude survey to assess the impact of the session on their attitudes and understanding of the importance of providing equitable healthcare to LGBT patients. A rubric was also used by facilitators to evaluate level of student engagement and professionalism. Results: A total of 51 first-year medical students attended the session and 38 (74.5%) completed the pre/post surveys. There was diverse representation in our student demographic with 5.2% of respondents identifying as LGBT. Survey results showed a significant increase in knowledge confidence and attitudes following the session. Students attitudes regarding determinants of health status changed significantly for nine of the 13 (69%) survey items. In addition, their confidence in knowledge regarding healthcare barriers, health issues, and practices for LGBT culturally competent care significantly increased post-session. Data from our assessment rubrics also show that students were highly professional and engaged with the LGBT facilitators. Conclusion: Our study provides some evidence that case-based training of medical students regarding issues that affect health of LGBT seniors can improve attitudes and sensitize them to the unique needs of this population. Through this activity, the students indicated their desire to learn more about the topics covered and to receive further training in this field of study. While the study was somewhat limited by a small participant number, the significance of the data demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach involving members of the LGBT community as facilitators. Future work with these students as part of a longitudinal curriculum will include additional LGBT proficiency training to be offered in the subsequent blocks of instruction. Additionally, this intervention could potentially be adapted by other medical schools.","output":"Attitudes and Knowledge of Medical Students Towards Healthcare for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Seniors: Impact of a Case-Based Discussion With Facilitators From the Community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare is an essential service at any time more so in the crisis like Covid. With increase in number of cases and mortality from Covid, the primary focus is shifted to the management of the Covid crisis and other health emergencies thus affecting normal health services and routine treatment of other diseases like cancer. METHODS: This article reviews the published literature and guidelines on Covid and cancer and discusses them to optimize the care of cancer patients during Covid pandemic to improve treatment outcomes. RESULTS: The results of the review of published literature show a twofold increase in probability of getting CoV2 infection by the cancer patients and a four-fold increase in chance of death. On the other hand, if left untreated a 20% increase in cancer death is expected. Data further show that none of the medicines like remdesivir, hydroxy chloroquin, dexamethasone, or azithromycin improves survival and response to Covid in cancer patients. Surgical results too show similar outcome before and after the pandemic though most of these report on highly selected patients populations. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid 2019 pandemic places cancer patients in a very difficult situation wherein if they seek treatment, they are exposing themselves to a risk of developing CoV2 infection and if they do not, the probability of dying without treatment increases. Hence, for them it is a choice between the devil and deep sea, and it is for the healthcare providers to triage patients and treat who cannot wait even though the data from the carefully selected cohort of patients show no increase in mortality or morbidity from treatment during Covid.","output":"Caring for cancer patients in the Covid pandemic: choosing between the devil and deep sea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate how trust in healthcare providers, public health agencies, politicians, and pharmaceutical companies shaped peoples attitudes and behavioral intention associated with COVID-19 vaccination, directly and indirectly via the mediation of vaccine evaluation and emotions.

Malaysia Energy Commission recommends crystalline PV modules for net energy metering (NEM), but the climate regime is a concern for output power and efficiency. Based on rainfall and irradiance data, this study aims to categorize the climate of peninsular Malaysia into rainy and dry seasons; and then the performance of the two modules are evaluated under the dry season. A new mathematical model is developed to predict energy yield and the results are validated through experimental and systematic error analysis. The parameters are collected using a self-developed ZigBeePRO-based wireless system with the rate of 3 samples/min over a period of five days. The results unveil that efficiency is inversely proportional to the irradiance due to negative temperature coefficient for crystalline modules. For this phenomenon, efficiency of c-Si (9.8%) is found always higher than a-Si (3.5%). However, a-Si shows better shadow tolerance compared to c-Si, observed from a lesser decrease rate in efficiency of the former with the increase in irradiance. Due to better spectrum response and temperature coefficient, a-Si shows greater performance on output power efficiency (OPE), performance ratio (PR), and yield factor. From the regression analysis, it is found that the coefficient of determination (R(2)) is between 0.7179 and 0.9611. The energy from the proposed model indicates that a-Si yields 15.07% higher kWh than c-Si when luminance for recorded days is 70% medium and 30% high.

During the pandemic, physicians in our hospital have had to respond both to the issue of treating the patients and the increasing domestic burden associated with social disruption. The purpose of this study was to assess how much the burden on our doctors, especially female doctors, was increasing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Physicians Career Support Committee in Sapporo Medical University conducted a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire inquired about a wide range of subjects with regard to working style and family life during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was sent to all medical/dental physicians working in Sapporo Medical University. RESULTS: A total of 266 (42.7%) physicians in our hospital responded to our questionnaire and the data for 264 data were analyzed. The total numbers of males, females, and others, including those who did not want to specify, were 178 (67.4%), 82 (31.0%), and 4 (1.5%), respectively. Among them, 62 (23.5%) and 23 (8.7%) answered that their domestic burden was slightly or markedly increased. The increase in the domestic burden showed a significant difference between genders (p = 0.04). Even after correction for background differences using multivariate analysis, being female (p<0.001), having child dependents (p<0.001), and treating COVID-19 patients (p = 0.03) were significantly related to an increased domestic burden. Regarding family style, 58.1% of the physician-fathers were from two-income families (i.e., families with both parents in employment), and they answered that their partner mainly cared for the children. In contrast, 97.3% of physician-mothers were from two-income families, and 94.6% of the physician-mothers had to take care of children by themselves. CONCLUSION: Physician-mothers are caught in a dilemma between an increased home burden and clinical duties in the hospital, with a significantly higher ratio than physician-fathers during the pandemic. As we showed, female doctors could have not continued their careers and take responsible positions in the same way as male doctors.

It became clear that high volume inter-hospital transfers would be required to dissipate capacity pressures across the region and prevent units from becoming overwhelmed. However, ICU transfers are highly complex, requiring specialist teams and intensive coordination C resources that individual units could not spare - and to perform this at scale presented a real challenge.In response, the North West London Critical Care Network (NWLCCN) rapidly created an ICU Transfer Hub to coordinate the strategy and logistics of capacity transfers. It was staffed by three doctors who communicated closely with ICU leads for real-time metrics on the fluctuating capacity pressures to plan the volume and destinations of patient transfers. An emergency bank of stand-by transfer volunteers was created, consisting of 69 critical care clinicians from across London, and the Hub partnered with a staff-bank management app to create a bespoke digital platform to facilitate shift scheduling and payment. This automation provided a way to onboard new staff swiftly and scale the bank with ease.Between 17 March - 6 May 2020, the Hub coordinated the transfer of 238 patients, at its peak organising 13 patient transfers in a single day - the highest frequency of ICU transfers ever carried out in NWL.These inter-hospital transfers were essential for NWL to cope with pandemic-driven ICU admission pressures and created greater equity of access to critical care for patients. The strengths of a network uniting to deliver mutual aid were maximised by having a single hub as the conduit to support information flow and co-ordinate decision making.

Here, we demonstrate that human CD4+ T cells cells exposed to a Th17-differentiating milieu are significantly more resistant to immune suppression by CD8+ T cells compared to control Th0 cells.

Due to these challenges, the care of several chronic conditions was in many cases discontinued and patients and healthcare professionals treating these conditions had to cope with this new scenario. This was the case of the world rare diseases (RDs) that had to face this global emergency despite the vulnerability of people with RDs and the well-known need for high expertise required to treat and manage them. The numerous lessons learned so far regarding health emergencies and RDs should represent the basis for the establishment of new healthcare policies and plans aimed at ensuring the preparedness of our health systems in providing appropriate care to people living with RDs in the case of eventual new emergencies. This paper aims at providing pragmatic considerations that might be useful in designing future actions to create or optimise existing organisational models for the care of RDs in case of future emergencies or any other situation that might threaten the provision of routine care. These policies and plans should benefit from the multi-stakeholder RDs networks (such as the European Reference Networks), that should join forces at European, national, and local levels to minimise the economic, organisational, and health-related impact and the negative effects of potential emergencies on the RDs community.

We presume that most researchers intend to describe effects under real-world conditions when investigating hrQoL as an endpoint. Unfortunately, most studies are designed to confirm two theories: the efficacy of a new intervention under experimental study conditions and the real-world effectiveness of this intervention on hrQoL under non-experimental study conditions. Conflicting information emerges when the outcomes are supposed to describe effects under real-world conditions, but the assessment generates results obtained under experimental conditions. This paper examines the existing conflict between efficacy and effectiveness in a sample of 100 studies investigating hrQoL. Methods: We analysed a sample of freely available publications of clinical studies listed in PubMed between April 2015 and August 2016 which assessed quality of life as an outcome. We assessed the following four characteristics that should differ in studies measuring either efficacy or effectiveness: 1) specification of the study as a randomised controlled trial or not, 2) description of the study design as pragmatic or not, 3) classification of the study as an efficacy or an effectiveness study and 4) number of selected inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: 91% of the studies assessed hrQoL under experimental conditions (in a randomised controlled trial), but not under real-world conditions. The important difference between efficacy and effectiveness was not described in 60% of the studies. Only 6% of studies classified the study as a pragmatic trial. The difference between inclusion and exclusion criteria was not addressed in any of the investigated studies. Conclusion: The results of the four criteria confirmed our hypothesis that hrQoL studies are conducted mainly as experimental, but not pragmatic, trials indicating that the meaningfulness of the important difference between efficacy and effectiveness requires further discussion.

This lack of dependence on region size leads us to hypothesize that virus spread depends on universal properties of the network of social interactions. We test this hypothesis by simulating the propagation of a virus on networks of different topologies. Our main finding is that Gompertz growth observed for early outbreaks occurs only for a scale-free network, in which nodes with many more neighbors than average are common. These nodes that have very many neighbors are infected early in the outbreak and then spread the infection very rapidly. When these nodes are no longer infectious, the remaining nodes that have most neighbors take over and continue to spread the infection. In this way, the rate of spread is fastest at the very start and slows down immediately. Geometrically it is seen that the\\"surface\\"of the epidemic, the number of susceptible nodes in contact with the infected nodes, starts to rapidly decrease very early in the epidemic and as soon as the larger nodes have been infected. In our simulation, the speed and impact of an outbreak depend on three parameters: the average number of contacts each node makes, the probability of being infected by a neighbor, and the probability of recovery. Intelligent interventions to reduce the impact of future outbreaks need to focus on these critical parameters in order to minimize economic and social collateral damage.","output":"The Gompertz Growth of COVID-19 Outbreaks is Caused by Super-Spreaders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) remains one of the most economically significant diseases in the swine industry worldwide.

In times of contact restrictions, digital solutions have become increasingly important, especially for people with dementia and their mostly elderly caregiving relatives, which are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. As in many other health areas, there is a lack of digital interventions in the dementia landscape that are successfully implemented (i.e., put into practice), especially digital interventions that are scientifically evaluated. Evaluated and proven effective digital interventions exist, but these often do not find their way from research into practice and stay on low-level implementation readiness. Within the project digiDEM Bayern, a digital platform with digital services and interventions for people affected by dementia (people with dementia, caregivers, volunteers and interested citizens) is established. As one digital intervention for informal caregivers, the 'Angeh?rigenampel' (caregivers' traffic-light) was developed, which is able to assess the physical and psychological burden of caregivers. This can help to counteract the health effects of caregiving burden early on before it is too late.

The main goals of the proposed system are to identify and inform irregular and improper posture to prevent sitting-related health issues such as pressure ulcers, with the potential that it could also be used for individuals without mobility issues. In the proposed monitoring system, an array of 16 screen printed pressure sensor units was employed to obtain pressure data, which are sampled and processed in real-time using read-out electronics. The posture recognition was performed for four sitting positions: right-, left-, forward- and backward leaning based on k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT) and LightGBM machine learning algorithms. As a result, a posture classification accuracy of up to 99.03 percent can be achieved. Experimental studies illustrate that the system can provide real-time pressure distribution value in the form of a pressure map on a standard PC and also on a raspberry pi system equipped with a touchscreen monitor. The stored pressure distribution data can later be shared with healthcare professionals so that abnormalities in sitting patterns can be identified by employing a post-processing unit. The proposed system could be used for risk assessments related to pressure ulcers.

COVID-19 is associated with notable increases in morbidity and death worldwide. Preexisting conditions, like cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, are correlated with higher severity and a significant increase in the fatality rate of COVID-19. COVID-19 induces multiple cardiovascular complexities, such as cardiac arrest, myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias and, subsequently, heart failure (HF). The precise mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 may cause myocardial complications are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury based on current knowledge are the direct viral entry of the virus and damage to the myocardium, systemic inflammation, hypoxia, cytokine storm, interferon-mediated immune response, and plaque destabilization. The virus enters the cell through the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and plays a central function in the viruss pathogenesis. A systematic understanding of cardiovascular effects of SARS-CoV2 is needed to develop novel therapeutic tools to target the virus-induced cardiac damage as a potential strategy to minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system and reduce the morbidity.

Children don't suffer from COVID-19 as much as their grandparents and have a much higher melatonin level. Bats are nocturnal animals possessing high levels of melatonin, which may contribute to their high anti-viral resistance. Viruses induce an explosion of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and melatonin is the best natural antioxidant that is lost with age. The programmed cell death coronaviruses cause, which can result in significant lung damage, is also inhibited by melatonin. Coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. Melatonin blocks these inflammasomes. General immunity is impaired by anxiety and sleep deprivation. Melatonin improves sleep habits, reduces anxiety and stimulates immunity. Fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after COVID-19. Melatonin is known to prevent fibrosis. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin. Thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients' health after the active phase of the infection is over.","output":"Can melatonin reduce the severity of COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus pneumonia, namely COVID-19, has become a global public health problem.

DESIGN: Correlative study comparing the association between (1) workforce demand and ACGME case requirements, and (2) workforce demand and perceived resident competency. Three distinct datasets were used; (1) the 2017 Medicare Part B National Summary Data File; (2) the 2017 National Data Report published by the ACGME; and (3) a graduating resident survey from Okhunov et al. SETTING: N/A. PARTICIPANTS: N/A. RESULTS: In 2017, there were a total of 6,784,696 urologic cases performed through Medicare. We found nonsignificant positive associations between resident case logs (rho = 0.16, p = 0.5784), ACGME minimum procedure requirements (rho = 0.42, p = 0.1255), and Medicare procedural demand. Our 15 index procedures accounted for 21.1% (n = 1,431,775) of all Medicare cases, with a median number of 7706 procedures.

In particular, this review provided an in-depth discussion regarding the pathophysiology by which COVID-19 leads to GSH depletion, tissue damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, the current review demonstrated how GSH depletion could result in failure of the immune system and rendering the end organs vulnerable to damage from the oxidative stress.

CONCLUSION: Rituximab, the efficacy of which has thus far been examined predominantly in patients outside the ICU, in conjunction with extensive organ support was effective treatment for MCD with associated multiple organ failure. There is, to our knowledge, only one other published report of its successful use in an ICU setting, where it was combined with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and prednisolone. Reports such as ours support the notion that critically unwell patients with HIV and haematological disease can benefit from intensive care.","output":"Successful treatment of HIV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease and multiple organ failure with rituximab and supportive care: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate, up-to-date data are the bedrock of effective public health responses, including in the context of the suffering caused by COVID-19.

Unsafe and inappropriate medication use, especially high alert medications (HAMs), is one of the important factors compromising patient safety and quality of care. Besides economic loss, HAMs contribute to greater morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality. Physicians as key members of the provision of healthcare are expected to be well aware of the administration and regulations surrounding HAMs. However, the current status is unknown in Pakistan. Consequently, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the knowledge of Pakistani physicians about the administration, regulation, and practices related to HAMs. This builds on our recently published study with nurses. Methods: An online cross-sectional study design was used, and data were gathered from the physicians throughout Pakistan using previously used self-administered questionnaires during a period of 5 months (January 1 to May 30, 2021). All data were entered and analyzed using SPSS 22 for Windows. Results: Physicians (847) who provided consent were enrolled in the study. Most physicians (62.2%) were male, aged between 25 and 30 years (75.2%) and had 2- to 5-year work experience (50.9%). About 27% were working in the emergency departments. The median (IQR) knowledge score for HAMs administration and regulation was 5 (3) and 5 (2), respectively. About 46.4% of respondents were found to have moderate knowledge about HAMs; increasing age, work experience, and higher qualifications were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with better HAMs knowledge. Around 58% had good practices relating to HAMs during their routine work. Median practice scores increased significantly (p < 0.05) with age, work experience, and postgraduate qualification. Conclusion: Most Pakistani physicians possess moderate knowledge about HAMs administration and regulations. However, their practices relating to the HAMs administration and regulations are typically sub-optimal. Consequently, HAMs awareness needs to be improved by including course content in the current curriculum, provision of hospital-based continuous training programs about patient safety and care, and establishment of multi-disciplinary health care teams, including board-certified pharmacists and specialized nurses, for the effective execution of medication use process in Pakistani hospitals in the future.","output":"Exploring Pakistani Physicians' Knowledge and Practices Regarding High Alert Medications: Findings and Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Four thoracic evacuation techniques for pneumothorax elimination after diaphragmatic defect closure were compared in 40 canine cadavers.

It is most often associated with 8th cranial nerve (vestibular schwanomma) and only rarely presents outside the head and neck. Extremely rarely it occurs as a retroperitoneal mass that can remain asymptomatic until it reaches a size so big that it compresses the adjacent organs and therefore requires surgical intervention. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of 58 years old male with a benign pelvic schwannoma, adherent to S1-S2 intervertebral foramen, presenting with increased urinary frequency and treated with surgical en block excision. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Diagnostic procedure and surgical treatment of giant pelvic schwanomma could be both challenging. Radiologic investigation is essential for preoperative planning and helpful in diagnosis but does not offer a definitive diagnosis of pelvic schwannoma. Definitive diagnosis is therefore based on histological and immunohistochemical analysis of surgically removed specimens. Possible surgical interventions include complete or partial resection, both bearing its risks and advantages in terms of postoperative morbidity.

Secondarily it aims to summarize methods to minimize potential risk to operating room staff. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Continuing operative practice during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic places the health of operating theatre staff at potential risk. SARS-CoV2 is transmitted through inhaled droplets and aerosol particles, thus posing an inhalation threat even at considerable distance. Surgical energy devices generate an aerosol of biological particular matter during use. The risk to healthcare staff through use of surgical energy devices is unknown. METHODS: This review was conducted utilizing a rapid review methodology to enable efficient generation and dissemination of information useful for concurrent clinical practice. RESULTS: There are conflicting stances on the use of energy devices and laparoscopy by different surgical governing bodies and societies. There is no definitive evidence that aerosol generated by energy devices may carry active SARS-CoV2 virus. However, investigations of other viruses have demonstrated aerosolization through energy devise use. Measures to reduce potential transmission include appropriate personal protective equipment, evacuation and filtration of surgical plume, limiting energy device use if appropriate, and adjusting endoscopic and laparoscopic practice (low CO(2) pressures, evacuation through ultrafiltration systems). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of transmission of SARS-CoV2 through aerosolized surgical smoke associated with energy device use is not fully understood, however transmission is biologically plausible.

In this study we aimed to investigate the spatial distribution of excess mortality during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and relate it at the subnational level to contextual determinants from various dimensions (socioeconomic, population density, overall health status, healthcare access etc.). We also explored whether the determinants identified at the national level varied depending on geographical location. METHODS: We used available national data on deaths in France to calculate excess mortality by department for three age groups: 0C49, 50C74 and > 74 yrs. between March 1st and April 27th, 2020. We selected 15 variables at the department level that represent four dimensions that may be related to overall mortality at the ecological level, two representing population-level vulnerabilities (morbidity, social deprivation) and two representing environmental-level vulnerabilities (primary healthcare supply, urbanization). We modelled excess mortality by age group for our contextual variables at the department level. We conducted both a global (i.e., country-wide) analysis and a multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model to account for the spatial variations in excess mortality. RESULTS: In both age groups, excess all-cause mortality was significantly higher in departments where urbanization was higher (50C74 yrs.:  = 15.33, p < 0.001; > 74 yrs.:  = 18.24, p < 0.001) and the supply of primary healthcare providers lower (50C74 yrs.:  = ? 8.10, p < 0.001; > 74 yrs.:  = ? 8.27, p < 0.001). In the 50C74 yrs. age group, excess mortality was negatively associated with the supply of pharmacists ( = ? 3.70, p < 0.02) and positively associated with work-related mobility ( = 4.62, p < 0.003); in the > 74 yrs. age group our measures of deprivation ( = 15.46, p < 0.05) and morbidity ( = 0.79, p < 0.008) were associated with excess mortality.

The issues identified formed the basis of policy analysis and evaluation. RESULTS Pandemic (H(1)N(1) ) 2009 had a significant impact on EDs with presentation for patients with 'influenza-like illness' up to three times that of the same time in previous years. Staff reported a range of issues, including poor awareness of pandemic plans, patient and family aggression, chaotic information flow to themselves and the public, heightened stress related to increased workloads and lower levels of staffing due to illness, family care duties and redeployment of staff to flu clinics. Staff identified considerable discomfort associated with prolonged times wearing personal protective equipment.

In particular, there is a need for a single authoritative source of information, the re-engineering of EDs to accommodate infectious patients and organizational changes to enable rapid deployment of alternative sources of care.","output":"Pandemic (H1N1 influenza 2009 and Australian emergency departments: implications for policy, practice and pandemic preparedness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abuse and neglect of children is a public health issue at a global, European, and Croatian level, with significant rates of morbidity and mortality.

On September 28, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) contacted CDC to report a COVID-19 outbreak in a state prison (prison A). During October 6-20, a CDC team investigated the outbreak, which began with 12 cases detected from specimens collected during August 17-24 from incarcerated persons housed within the same unit, 10 of whom were transferred together on August 13 and under quarantine following prison intake procedures (intake quarantine). Potentially exposed persons within the unit began a 14-day group quarantine on August 25. However, quarantine was not restarted after quarantined persons were potentially exposed to incarcerated persons with COVID-19 who were moved to the unit. During the subsequent 8 weeks (August 14-October 22), 869 (79.4%) of 1,095 incarcerated persons and 69 (22.6%) of 305 staff members at prison A received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens from 172 cases among incarcerated persons showed that all clustered in the same lineage; this finding, along with others, demonstrated that facility spread originated with the transferred cohort. To effectively implement a cohorted quarantine, which is a harm reduction strategy for correctional settings with limited space, CDC's interim guidance recommendation is to serial test cohorts, restarting the 14-day quarantine period when a new case is identified (3). Implementing more effective intake quarantine procedures and available mitigation measures, including vaccination, among incarcerated persons is important to controlling transmission in prisons. Understanding and addressing the challenges faced by correctional facilities to implement medical isolation and quarantine can help reduce and prevent outbreaks.","output":"Rapid Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a State Prison After Introduction by Newly Transferred Incarcerated Persons - Wisconsin, August 14-October 22, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of viral and bacterial pathogens mediated by contact with surfaces is a leading cause of infection worldwide.

The Beacon Caresystem is a model-based bedside decision support system using mathematical models tuned to the individual patient's physiology to advise on appropriate ventilator settings. Personalised approaches using individual patient description may be particularly advantageous in complex patients, including those who are difficult to mechanically ventilate and wean, in particular ARDS. Methods: We will conduct a multi-centre international randomised, controlled, allocation concealed, open, pragmatic clinical trial to compare mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients following application of the Beacon Caresystem to that of standard routine care to investigate whether use of the system results in a reduction in driving pressure across all severities and phases of ARDS. Discussion. Despite 20 years of clinical trial data showing significant improvements in ARDS mortality through mitigation of ventilator induced lung injury, there remains a gap in its personalised application at the bedside. Importantly, the protective effects of higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were noted only when there were associated decreases in driving pressure. Hence, the pressures set on the ventilator should be determined by the diseased lungs' pressure-volume relationship which is often unknown or difficult to determine. Knowledge of extent of recruitable lung could improve the ventilator driving pressure. Hence, personalised management demands the application of mechanical ventilation according to the physiological state of the diseased lung at that time. Hence, there is significant rationale for the development of point-of-care clinical decision support systems which help personalise ventilatory strategy according to the current physiology. Furthermore, the potential for the application of the Beacon Caresystem to facilitate local and remote management of large numbers of ventilated patients (as seen during this COVID-19 pandemic), could change the outcome of mechanically ventilated patients during the course of this and future pandemics.

BACKGROUND Respiratory pandemics have negative impacts on nurses' wellbeing. While literature is replete with hospital nurses' experiences, there is less exploration of COVID-19 impacts on primary healthcare nurses. Given the importance of primary healthcare nurses in the health system, understanding their experiences is vital. METHODS A cross-sectional survey of 359 primary healthcare nurses. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) was used to measure emotional state. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS DASS-21 scores indicated that 39.6% of participants were experiencing depressive, anxiety or stress symptoms. Of those, 41.8% were experiencing symptoms on one scale, 26.9% were experiencing symptoms on two scales and 31.2% were experiencing symptoms across all three scales. Most participants identified that their feelings were related to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 is having a significant impact on primary healthcare nurses' mental health. Nurse managers need to develop strategies to effectively address nurses' concerns and support them to sustain the workforce during and after the pandemic.

However, Black individuals living in countries where they are considered a minority population group (eg, in Northern America and Europe) are underrepresented in studies evaluating ADHD. Objective To estimate the pooled prevalence of ADHD and identify associated risk factors among US Black individuals. Data Sources This systematic review and meta-analysis identified peer-reviewed studies published until October 18, 2019, using the APA PsycInfo, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, ERIC, and Education Source databases. Study Selection Eligible trials were published in French or English, had empirical data on the prevalence of ADHD in samples or subsamples of Black people, and were conducted in countries with Black minority populations. All studies were assessed and passed quality evaluation. Data Extraction and Synthesis The PRISMA guideline was used for extracting and reporting data. Random-effects meta-analyses were generated to estimate the prevalence of ADHD among Black individuals using the metafor package in R. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence and risk factors associated with ADHD among Black individuals were identified. Results A total of 24 independent samples and subsamples from 21 studies published between 1979 and 2020 (154 818 Black participants) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. All included studies were conducted in the US. Two studies were conducted assessing adults (aged 18 years or older), 8 assessing children (0-12 years), 1 assessing adolescents (aged 13-17 years), and 13 assessing both children and adolescents. The pooled prevalence of ADHD was 14.54% (95% CI, 10.64%-19.56%). In a narrative review of the studies in this analysis, some studies found risk factors associated with ADHD, such as sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status), familial factors, environmental factors, and risk behaviors, but the data did not permit a moderation analysis to assess these findings in this study. Conclusions and Relevance Contrary to what is stated in the DSM-5, the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that Black individuals are at higher risk for ADHD diagnoses than the general US population. These results highlight a need to increase ADHD assessment and monitoring among Black individuals from different social backgrounds. They also higlight the importance of establishing accurate diagnoses and culturally appropriate care.","output":"Prevalence and Risk Factors Associated With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Among US Black Individuals: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite close links with ethnic identity and other health-relevant identities, there is surprisingly little work on national identity in the context of population health.

Inherent latencies in pathogen transmission, coupled with smaller and intrinsically noisier case incidence across periods of subcritical spread, mean that resurgence cannot be reliably detected without significant delays of the order of the generation time of the disease, even when case reporting is perfect. In contrast, epidemic suppression (where R falls from supercritical to subcritical values) may be ascertained 5C10 times faster due to the naturally larger incidence at which control actions are generally applied. We prove that these innate limits on detecting resurgence only worsen when spatial or demographic heterogeneities are incorporated. Consequently, we argue that resurgence is more effectively handled proactively, potentially at the expense of false alarms. Timely responses to recrudescent infections or emerging variants of concern are more likely to be possible when policy is informed by a greater quality and diversity of surveillance data than by further optimisation of the statistical models used to process routine outbreak data.","output":"Fundamental limits on inferring epidemic resurgence in real time using effective reproduction numbers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The economic burden of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) has not been investigated at population-level.

Anakinra blocks the activity of both IL-1 and IL?1 and is approved for different autoinflammatory disorders, but it is used off-label for conditions characterized by an excess of cytokine production. Several studies on anakinra in COVID-19 patients reported positive effects. We performed a meta-analysis of all published evidence on the use of anakinra in COVID19 to investigate its effect on survival and need for mechanical ventilation. METHODS: : We searched for any study performed on adult patients with acute hypoxemic failure related to 2019-nCoV infection, receiving anakinra versus any comparator. Primary endpoint was mortality at the longest available follow-up. Adverse effects, need for mechanical ventilation and discharge at home with no limitations were also analysed. RESULTS: : Four observational studies involving 184 patients were included. Overall mortality of patients treated with anakinra was significantly lower than mortality in the control group (95% CI 0.14-0.48, p<0.0001).

The aim of this study was to identify potential risk factors for surgical morbidity with a focus on the development of pancreatic fistula. METHODS Clinicopathologic parameters were collected for 283 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy between January 2000 and May 2010. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify potential risk factors for surgical morbidity and pancreatic fistula. RESULTS Spleen-preserving pancreatectomy was carried out in 12% of all cases and multivisceral resections were performed in 37.8%. For closure of the pancreatic remnant, three different techniques were used: hand-sewn suture in 44.5%, pancreaticojejunal anastomosis in 24%, and closure by stapler in 31.5%. Overall morbidity and mortality were 53 and 3.5%. Surgical morbidity was observed in 50.2% of all cases and pancreatic fistula in 24%. The stapling group had significantly higher surgical morbidity at 65.2% (p=0.001) and the most pancreatic fistulas, though this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.189). Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses indicated that closure by stapler [odds ratio (OR)=3.61; p<0.001] is a risk factor for surgical morbidity.

For contact tracing to be effective, those with symptoms must self-report themselves while their contacts must self-isolate when asked.

We use an existing branching process model to examine which aspects of contact tracing adherence should be prioritized. We consider an inverse relationship between self-isolation adherence and self-reporting engagement, assuming that increasingly strict self-isolation policies will result in fewer individuals self-reporting to the programme.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for those at risk of acquiring HIV, yet wide-scale implementation of PrEP, on a daily or event-driven basis, has been limited in Asia. METHODS: The Optima HIV model was applied to examine the impact of scaling-up PrEP over five-years to cover an additional 15% of MSM compared with baseline coverage, a target deemed feasible by regional experts. Based on behavioral survey data, we assume that covering 15% of higher-risk MSM will cover 30% of all sexual acts in this group. Scenarios to compare the impact of generic-brand daily dosing of PrEP with generic event-driven dosing (15 days a month) were modelled from the start of 2022 to the end of 2026. Cost-effectiveness of generic versus branded PrEP was also assessed for China, the only country with an active patent for branded, higher cost PrEP. The impact on new HIV infections among the entire population and cost per HIV-related disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted were estimated from the beginning of 2022 to the end of 2031 and from 2022 to 2051. RESULTS: If PrEP were scaled-up to cover an additional 15% of MSM engaging in higher-risk behavior from the beginning of 2022 to the end of 2026 in the eight Asian countries considered, an additional 100,000 (66,000C130,000) HIV infections (17%) and 300,000 (198,000C390,000) HIV-related DALYs (3%) could be averted over the 2022 to 2031 period. The estimated cost per HIV-related DALY averted from 2022 to 2031 ranged from US$600 for event-driven generic PrEP in Indonesia to US$34,400 for daily branded PrEP in Thailand. Over a longer timeframe from 2022 to 2051, the cost per HIV-related DALY averted could be reduced to US$100CUS$12,700.

Mean daily air temperature (inversely) and wind speed (positively) were significantly associated with time dependent R0, but the contribution of countrywide lockdown to variability in R0 was over three times stronger as compared to that of temperature and wind speed combined. Thus, abating temperatures and easing lockdown may concur with increased transmissibility of COVID-19.","output":"INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF METEOROLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS WITH INITIAL SPREAD OF COVID-19 IN INDIA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School Psychology is an outlet for research on children, youth, educators, and families that has scientific, practice, and policy implications.

Convalescent plasma (CP) containing antibodies against the virus has been used with some success. We did a systematic review to synthesize the available data on CP therapy for treatment of Covid-19 to study the efficacy and safety outcomes. Methods: Two reviewers searched the published and pre-published literature between 1 January 2019 and 23 June 2020 for studies comparing the use of CP with standard therapy for Covid-19 patients. Data from the selected studies were abstracted and analysed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool and the quality of evidence was graded as per GRADE. Results: We found 13 case series and 1 randomized trial that fulfilled our search criteria. Of the 12 case series with a total of 264 patients that reported the efficacy outcomes, 11 studies showed favourable results with survival benefit. The only RCT with 103 patients did not show any mortality benefit but was terminated early prior to complete enrolment. A single large study of 5000 patients reported safety outcomes and showed no major adverse events in patient streated with CP. Conclusion: There is very low-quality evidence to suggest efficacy and safety of CP in patients with Covid-19 infection.

Here, we show that complement triggers contraction of Th1 responses by inducing intrinsic expression of the vitamin D (VitD) receptor (VDR) and the VitD-activating enzyme CYP27B1, permitting T cells to both activate and respond to VitD. VitD then initiated transition from pro-inflammatory IFN- (+) Th1 cells to suppressive IL-10(+) cells. This process was primed by dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape of CD4(+) T cells, generating super-enhancers and recruiting several transcription factors, notably c-JUN, STAT3 and BACH2, which together with VDR shaped the transcriptional response to VitD. Accordingly, VitD did not induce IL-10 in cells with dysfunctional BACH2 or STAT3.

Multi-organ involvement with systemic, cutaneous, gastrointestinal and cardiac features and clinical overlap with conditions like sepsis, toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease (KD) and have led to delays in recognition of PIMS-TS. Objectives We evaluated the clinical characteristics and reattendance rates of children presenting to urgent care facilities [(primary care or Emergency Department (ED)] prior to definitive hospital admission. Methods An observational study using retrospective data collection was undertaken on children with a diagnosis of PIMSTS, who presented to a specialist children's hospital, between 1st April 2020 and 17th May 2020. Diagnosis of PIMS-TS was based on published RCPCH criteria1 Reattendance rates, patient demographics, initial presenting features and subsequent progress was assessed Results Eighteen children were included in the study (median 9.6 years;IQR 7-12.6 years). All children required high dependency or intensive care treatment. 89% (n=16) required fluid resuscitation and inotropes with 17% (n=3) requiring invasive ventilatory support. In this cohort, 39% (n=7) were first assessed by a primary care physician and 61% (n=11) presented to ED. Overall, 89% (n=16) of the children were discharged after initial presentation and subsequently reattended with worsening symptoms. Only 11% were admitted at first presentation. Of the study population, 22% (n=4) received advice from either 111 or 999 before attending GP or ED. The majority of reattenders (88%) were admitted during their third attendance and 12% were admitted at their sixth attendance. All children (100%) presented with fever above 38.5C with a median duration of 3 (range 1-5) days. Gastrointestinal symptoms at presentation included abdominal pain in fifteen children (83%), vomiting in eleven children (61%) and diarrhoea in thirteen children (72%). Syncope was reported in six children (33%) and lethargy in fourteen children (77%). Muco-cutaneous features of rash and conjunctivitis resembling KD, were seen in eleven children (61%). Other symptoms at presentation were oedema (38%), myalgia (61%), headache (38%), neck pain six (33%) and sore throat (33%). Conclusions Children with PIMS-TS were older (above 9 years) and presented with persistent high-grade fever, hypotension, gastrointestinal and muco-cutaneous features. High reattendance rates were seen in our cohort of children with PIMS-TS. While this could indicate the natural course of evolution of the condition, prolonged duration of fever in an older age group and requirement of fluid resuscitation at admission suggests a missed opportunity for earlier recognition and intervention. UK data of median of 5 days interval between presentation and referral for KD, suggests a similar delayed recognition of PIMSTS, due to the multi-system features and overlap with childhood infections. A high index of suspicion of PIMSTS and lower thresholds for admission in children presenting with these features to urgent care facilities in the current pandemic, will help institute early definitive treatment, thus reducing morbidity.","output":"Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with sarscov-2 (Pims-ts)-reattendance rates and lessons for urgent care facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Older adults across the globe have been particularly affected by the novel coronavirus due to their increased susceptibility to the virus. With limited existing research, the aim of this study was to explore the psychological effects of COVID-19 public health measures on older adults in Uganda and their coping mechanisms.Methods: Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with older Ugandans (aged 60+) in June 2020. Participants were asked about their experiences of public health measures, and their effects on the lives of older adults compared to pre-pandemic.Results: Three themes were identified: Impact on emotional well-being; Implications on physical well-being; and Coping mechanisms. Older adults experienced both psychological and physical effects, including upset, fear, and frustration about restrictions and the virus, as well as early signs of increased frailty, thus causing concerns for the long-term emotional and physical health of older Ugandans.Conclusions: Public health measures need to be considerate of the potential long-term implications on the well-being of older adults in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, and ensure the possibility for continued physical exercise and social connection. This can be particularly challenging for people from more disadvantaged backgrounds who may not be able to afford a smartphone or laptop, with older adults further requiring support in using digital technologies.Clinical Implications: Older adults need to receive adequate psychological support to cope with the mental health impacts of the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Public Health Restrictions and Older Adults' Well-being in Uganda: Psychological Impacts and Coping Mechanisms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One in three American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) children live in poverty.

In order to assess the preventive strategy adopted in Algeria, we studied three zones whole Algeria, Blida region, and whole Algeria except Blida, we used as a indicator the basic reproduction number R0, we compared the mean R0-before and R0-after the implementation of the mitigation measures using bivariate analysis, then we used the results we found to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases avoided by these measures, then after, we predicted the peak of the first wave of the epidemic. We note that the decrease in R0 after the preventive measures implementation was statistically significant, p value < 10-4, in the three areas, thus, the preventive strategy in Algeria has been effective in its entirety. Our projection revealed that 15613 cases of COVID-19 were avoided in 14 days, from April 6, to April 19, 2020, in the whole country, and 1747 cases were prevented in Blida during the same period. We estimate that the peak of the first wave of the epidemic in Algeria will be reached with herd immunity of 15.93% as of November 2020, however, at least 56% of people with protective immunity would be needed to be sufficient to avoid a second wave. The used method to carry out the evaluation has given us a good overview, but, R0 is not the only factor to consider when estimating the burden of the epidemic, to do that, the number of daily admissions to intensive care units and hospitalizations remain good indicators. In order to better the epidemic control in Algeria, it is possible to act on contact efficacy rate by adding an instruction to wear medical mask by ordinary population outside, this measure has been reported to be effective in some countries. To conclude, it is good to keep in mind that a new way of life based on good hygiene habits and social distancing must therefore be in place and adopted by the population for at least several months, otherwise the demand for health care will exceed the availability.

These risk factors account for over 30% of population attributable dementia risk and accrue over the lifespan. Young adults have the greatest potential to reduce their own risk for dementia. This study aimed to investigate what young Australian adults know about dementia and its risk factors, and further, how they estimated these risks. METHODS: An online survey promoted through various social media platforms was completed by 604 young Australian adults aged 18C44 years of age. RESULTS: Seventy percent of participants had a limited understanding of dementia (identifying cognitive or functional impairment), 25% had a good understanding, with 5% having no understanding. Twenty percent of respondents thought there were no modifiable risk factors for dementia. Less the half of participants agreed with two of the nine established dementia risk factors (hearing loss in midlife and education in early life), with over half of participants agreeing to the remaining seven risk factors. Females consistently judged the risks conferred by the nine established dementia risk factors to be higher than males. Those who were lonely judged the dementia risk conferred by loneliness to be higher than those who were not lonely; and smokers judged the dementia risk conferred by smoking to be less than non-smokers. CONCLUSION: Young adults have the greatest potential to change their dementia risk, and these findings show that there are important gaps in knowledge of dementia and its risk factors in this group.

We undertook an auditto understand experiences of shielding particularly in rheumatologicalBAME patients in multi-ethnic communities in 3 centres -Wolverhampton, Leicester and Oxford.MethodsThis study was approved in all three sites as an audit. Patientscontacting rheumatology helpline or having routine consultations wereincluded. Each centre aimed to recruit at least 20 patients. Aquestionnaire was developed to capture important data on shielding.The study was conducted between May and June 2020 during thepeak of the first wave of Covid 19.ResultsWe recruited 79 patients into this audit, of these 54 were of BAME and25 of Caucasian ethnicity with 17 males and 62 females. RheumatoidArthritis (RA) was the commonest diagnosis in 49 of these patients(62%) and these patients were older (median ages 56 vs. 46 years, p = 0.14). BSR risk scoring algorithm was used to determine need forshielding (BSR score of 3 or more) - 38 patients fell into this category.The remaining patients had scored lower and had the option ofshielding or enhanced social distancing. Of the 13 Caucasian patientswho should have been shielding, 11 were (85%). Of the 25 BAMEpatients who should have been shielding: 17 were, and 8 were not(68%, p = 0.26;65% looking at South Asian patients alone).Understanding of reasons for shielding was clear for 21 out of 25Caucasian patients (84%). In contrast, 33 of 54 patients from BAMEbackgrounds (61%) were clear on this (p = 0.10). WithinWolverhampton and Leicester, the numbers are starker with 20 outof 37 (54%) being clear on this. Very few Caucasian patients madechanges to their existing medications with 84% carrying on theirmedications as they were before the onset of COVID 19.

The high reported efficacy, low cost, and long shelf-life of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine positions it well for evaluation in different settings. Methods: Using data from the ongoing ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 clinical trials, an individual-based model was constructed to predict the 6-month population-level impact of vaccine deployment. A detailed probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was developed to evaluate the importance of epidemiological, demographic, immunological, and logistical factors in determining vaccine effectiveness. Using representative countries, logistical plans for vaccination rollout at various levels of vaccine availability and delivery speed, conditional on vaccine efficacy profiles (efficacy of the booster dose, time interval between doses, and relative efficacy of the first dose) were explored. Findings: and Interpretation Our results highlight how expedient vaccine delivery to high-risk groups is critical in mitigating COVID-19 disease and mortality. In scenarios where the number of vaccine doses available is insufficient for high-risk groups (those aged more than 65 years) to receive two vaccine doses, administration of a single dose of vaccine is optimal. This effect is consistent even when vaccine efficacy after one dose is just 75% of the levels achieved after two doses. These findings offer a nuanced perspective of the critical drivers of COVID-19 vaccination effectiveness and can inform optimal allocation strategies. These are relevant to high-income countries with a large high-risk group population as well as to low-income countries with younger populations, where the cost and logistical challenges of procuring and delivering two doses for each citizen represent a significant challenge.","output":"An analysis of the potential global impact of dosing regimen and rollout options for the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep learning significantly accelerates the drug discovery process, and contributes to global efforts to stop the spread of infectious diseases.

The COVID-19 external shock to the economy has the potential to affect corporate governance profoundly. This article explores its possible impact on comparative corporate governance. For an economy to operate successfully, a society must first find a politically sustainable social equilibrium. In many countries, historical crises C such as the Great Depression and World War II C have resulted in a reconfiguration of corporate governance institutions that set the course for generations. While it is not yet clear whether COVID-19 will have a similar effect, it is possible that it will change patterns of what kind of firms are C from an evolutionary perspective C likely to survive, and which ones are not. We argue that to some extent, it will accelerate ongoing trends, whereas in other areas it put corporations on an entirely new course. We observe three trends, namely the need for resilience, a growth of nationalist policies in corporate law, and an increasing orientation toward stakeholder interests. First, firms will have to become resilient to the crisis, and consequently long-term oriented. Corporations that are not operating merely on an arms length capital market basis but are integrated into a network, generated by core shareholders, state ownership or bank lending may be more likely to survive. In addition, firms are beginning to interact with their workforce differently in their attempts to maintain what could be called healthy human capital. Second, we are likely to see a resurgence of nationalism in corporate governance to ensure that foreign ownership and interconnected supply chains do not put national security at risk. Third, the existing critiques of inequality but also climate change awareness will accelerate the trend toward a broadening of corporate purpose toward stakeholderism and public policy issues.

The evidence synthesis was pursued through a random-effects meta-analysis. The effect size was expressed as relative risk (RR) and RRR (RR reduction) of SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination. Heterogeneity was investigated through a between-study heterogeneity analysis and a subgroup meta-analysis. (3) Results: The systematic review identified 27 studies eligible for the quantitative synthesis. Partially vaccinated individuals presented a RRR = 73% (95%CI = 59C83%) for positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (RR = 0.27) and a RRR=79% (95%CI = 30C93%) for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR (RR = 0.21).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of frailty and prefrailty in patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD and correlate with severity of liver disease. DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of functional and laboratory frailty assessments, including the Fried frailty index (FFI), a self-reported frailty index (SRFI) and a lab-based frailty index (FI-LAB), was performed in a cohort of 109 patients with NAFLD, and results compared with fibrosis staging based on transient elastography. RESULTS: Patients with NAFLD had a high prevalence of prefrailty and frailty, with a median SRFI score of 0.18 (IQR: 0.18), FFI of 1 (IQR: 1) and FI-LAB of 0.18 (IQR: 0.12). Using the SRFI, 45% of F0/F1 patients were classified as prefrail and 20% were classified as frail, while in F2/F3 patients this increased to 36% and 41%, respectively. SRFI, 30 s sit-to-stand and FI-LAB scores increased with increasing liver fibrosis stages (p=0.001, 0.006 and <0.001, respectively). On multivariate linear regression, female gender was identified as a significant predictor of elevated frailty scores. CONCLUSION: This study identifies a high prevalence of frailty in individuals with non-cirrhotic NAFLD. Addressing frailty through early rehabilitation interventions may reduce overall morbidity and mortality in this population.","output":"Prevalence of frailty in patients with non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Influenza A viruses cause epidemics/severe pandemics that pose a great global health threat. Among eight viral RNA segments, the multiple functions of nucleoprotein (NP) play important roles in viral replication and transcription. METHODS: To understand how NP contributes to the virus evolution, we analyzed the NP gene of H3N2 viruses in Taiwan and 14,220 NP sequences collected from Influenza Research Database. The identified genetic variations were further analyzed by mini-genome assay, virus growth assay, viral RNA and protein expression as well as ferret model to analyze their impacts on viral replication properties. RESULTS: The NP genetic analysis by Taiwan and global sequences showed similar evolution pattern that the NP backbones changed through time accompanied with specific residue substitutions from 1999 to 2018. Other than the conserved residues, fifteen sporadic substitutions were observed in which the 31R, 377G and 450S showed higher frequency. We found 31R and 450S decreased polymerase activity while the dominant residues (31 K and 450G) had higher activity. The 31 K and 450G showed better viral translation and replication in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated variations identified in evolution have roles in modulating viral replication in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates that the interaction between variations of NP during virus evolution deserves future attention.","output":"Genetic variations on 31 and 450 residues of influenza A nucleoprotein affect viral replication and translation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Consumer purchase behavior is a process highly influenced by the stability (economic, social, political) of the surrounding environment.

Evidence for the impact of clinical trials on brain health is less consistent, especially with dietary interventions which often rely on varying intervention approaches. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 6-month intervention combining exercise with a novel dietary counselling approach among older adults with vascular risk factors (VRFs) and early dementia risk. Methods: Participants with VRFs and SCD or early MCI were cluster randomized into the intervention (exercise + Baycrest Brain-healthy Eating Approach (EX+DIET)) or control group (exercise + brain health education (EX+ED)). Both groups participated in 1-hour of supervised exercise per week and were prescribed additional exercise at home. EX+DIET involved 1-hour per week of group-based dietary counselling comprising didactic education focused on brain healthy eating recommendations, goal setting and strategy training. Whereas, EX+ED involved 1-hour per week of group-based brain health education. The primary outcome was change in hippocampal volume from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes included fitness, diet, cognition, and blood biomarkers. Recruitment challenges and early discontinuation of the trial due to COVID-19 necessitated a revised focus on feasibility and preliminary efficacy. Results: Of 190 older adults contacted, 14 (7%) were eligible and randomized, constituting 21% of our recruitment target. All participants completed the intervention and attended 90% of exercise and diet/education sessions on average. All 6-month follow-up assessments pre-COVID-19 were completed but disruptions to testing during the pandemic resulted in incomplete data collection. No serious adverse events occurred and all participants expressed positive feedback about the intervention. Mean improvements in peak oxygen consumption were observed in both EX+DIET ( d = .98) and EX+ED ( d = 1.15) groups. Substantial improvements in diet and HbA1c were observed in the EX+DIET group compared to EX+ED ( d = 1.75 and 1.07, respectively). Conclusions: : High adherence and retention rates were observed among LEAD participants and preliminary findings illustrate improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and diet quality.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe alcohol-related content posted by mothers on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using two popular hashtags, #momjuice and #winemom, 50 Instagram posts on each were collected from the \\"top posts\\" tab. The coding categories were created inductively and were as follows: displays alcohol (drinking/holding alcohol or alcohol itself), person is making alcoholic beverages, type of alcohol featured or discussed, highlights anxiety and/or depression/mental state, highlights struggling (in general), highlights parenting challenges, encourages alcohol consumption, discourages alcohol consumption, features a person wearing clothing or shows products promoting alcohol, promotes alcohol rehabilitation, highlights caffeine to alcohol daily transition throughout the day, and highlights other drugs besides caffeine and alcohol. RESULTS: Overall, the 100 selected posts had a total of 5108 comments and 94,671 likes. The respective averages were 51.08 (SD 77.94) and 946.71 (SD 1731.72). A majority (>50%) of the posts reviewed encouraged alcohol consumption (n=66) and/or displayed alcohol (n=56). Of the 66 that encouraged and/or displayed alcohol, the common type of alcohol discussed or featured was wine (n=55). Only 6 posts discouraged alcohol use and only 4 provided the audience with a disclaimer. None of the videos promoted or endorsed alcohol rehabilitation in any way. Only 37 posts highlighted struggle. However, these posts garnered more than a majority of the likes (n=50,034, 52.3%). Posts that showed struggle received an average of 1359.57 (SD 2108.02) likes. Those that did not show struggle had an average of 704.24 (SD 1447.46) likes. An independent one-tailed t test demonstrated this difference to be statistically significant (P=.0499). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this investigation suggest that though these hashtags ostensibly exist to valorize excess alcohol consumption, they may be serving as a support system for mothers who are experiencing increased burdens and role stress during the pandemic. Given the strains placed on mothers overall and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts must be taken to increase access to and affordability of telehealth-based mental health care.","output":"Use of the Instagram Hashtags #winemom and #momjuice Among Mothers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Descriptive, Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been recommended as a basic treatment for lupus nephritis (LN) during this decade based on its ability to improve LN-related renal immune-mediated inflammatory lesions. As a classical lysosomal inhibitor, HCQ may inhibit lysosomal degradation and disrupt protective autophagy in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs). Therefore, the final renal effects of HCQ on LN need to be clarified. METHOD: HCQ was administered on spontaneous female MRL/lpr LN mice with severe proteinuria daily for 4 weeks. Moreover, the MRL/lpr mice with proteinuric LN were subjected to cisplatin-induced or unilateral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) after 2 weeks of HCQ preadministration. RESULTS: As expected, HCQ treatment increased the survival ratio and downregulated the levels of serum creatinine in the mice with LN, ameliorated renal lesions, and inhibited renal interstitial inflammation. Unexpectedly, HCQ preadministration significantly increased susceptibility to and delayed the recovery of AKI complicated by LN, as demonstrated by an increase in PTEC apoptosis and expression of the tubular injury marker KIM-1 as well as the retardation of PTEC replenishment. HCQ preadministration suppressed the proliferation of PTECs by arresting cells in G1/S phase and upregulated the expression of cell cycle inhibitors. Furthermore, HCQ preadministration disrupted the PTEC autophagy-lysosomal pathway and accelerated PTEC senescence. CONCLUSION: HCQ treatment may increase susceptibility and delay the recovery of AKI complicated by LN despite its ability to improve LN-related renal immune-mediated inflammatory lesions. The probable mechanism involves accelerated apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of PTECs via autophagy-lysosomal pathway disruption and senescence promotion.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine administration exacerbates acute kidney injury complicated by lupus nephritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The worldwide lockdown in response to COVID-19 pandemics has often led to physical inactivity and social distancing. When combined, these factors may affect quality and life and increase the risk of different diseases. Therefore, assessment of physical activity levels should be encouraged to monitor and identify those at a higher risk of inactivity. Smart technology is a promising tool to assess physical activity and health, and may be particularly useful during a period of general lockdown. METHODS An online survey was developed and shared among the Italian general population to collect data about physical activity and daily routine changes between January 2020 and the lockdown period from 23rd to 29th of March. Participants were asked to provide data such as daily step count (Steps) or heart rate (HR) measured and collected by their smart technology devices.

This study utilizes data from the COVID C 19 Survey for assessing Travel impact (COST) for the Kelowna region of British Columbia, Canada. The analysis suggests that individuals' participation in out-of-home activities were reduced by more than 50% during COVID C 19. The highest daily frequency of travel is found for routine shopping, followed by work-related travel. A comparative analysis of adjustment in out-of-home activities during COVID C 19 and the pre-pandemic period suggests that work-related travel increased for some occupations such as health, community, government, and sales and services. For recreational/social activities, travel increased for a higher share of older adults, and decreased for a higher share of younger adults. In the case of in-home activities, higher income households were found to be predominant in tele-working for a longer duration; whereas, lower and middle income groups were more involved in leisure and discretionary activities, and sleep. In the case of long-distance travel, the majority of the completed long-distance travel was made regionally using private car. Among the altered (i.e. cancelled, rescheduled, and unchanged) long-distance trips, international air-travel was predominant. The findings of this study provide insights towards people's immediate response to COVID C 19 travel restrictions, which will help in developing transportation plans and policies during COVID C 19, as well as for future pandemic and any other unprecedented scenarios.","output":"COVID C 19 Impact on Urban Mobility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the relationship between cultural value orientations and country-specific changes in mobility during the Covid-19 pandemic The aim was to understand how cultural values relate to mobility behavior during the initial stages of the pandemic The aggregated data include Schwartz's cultural orientations, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, number of Covid-19 cases per million, and mobility change during the Covid-19 pandemic (Google Mobility Reports;percentage decrease in retail and recreation mobility, transit station mobility, workplace mobility and percentage mobility increase in residential areas) Regression analyses showed that, after controlling for economy and severity of disease, hierarchy was the primary factor reducing mobility, such as staying at home, and mobility in public spaces, such as avoiding retail and recreation sites (marginally significant) The results are discussed in the light of previous literature and the implications for social distancing measures","output":"The Relationship Between Cultural Value Orientations and the Changes in Mobility During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A National-Level Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intestine is not only an important digestive organ but also an important immune organ for shrimp; it plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis. Decapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1) is a new type of shrimp-lethal virus that has received extensive attention in recent years. To date, most studies of the shrimp intestinal immune response under viral infections have relied on single omics analyses; there is a lack of systematic multi-omics research. In the current study, intestinal mRNA-seq and microRNA (miRNA)-seq analyses of Marsupenaeus japonicus under DIV1 infection were performed. A total of 1,976 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 32 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified. Among them, 21 DEMs were negatively correlated with 194 DEGs from a total of 223 correlations. Functional annotation analysis revealed that M. japonicus can regulate glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis (chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate), vitamin metabolism (retinol metabolism and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism), immune pathway activation (Toll and IMD signaling pathways, Wnt signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and Hippo signaling pathway), immunity enzyme activity promotion (triose-phosphate isomerase), antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cell apoptosis through miRNAs to participate in the hosts antiviral immune response, while DIV1 can influence Warburg effect-related pathways (pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and citrate cycle), glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-related pathways (glycosphingolipid biosynthesisglobo and isoglobo series and glycosphingolipid biosynthesislacto and neolacto series), and the tight junction and adhesion junction of the intestinal mucosal epithelium through the hosts miRNAs and mRNA to promote its own invasion and replication.

This study provides a basis for further study of the shrimp intestinal antiviral immune response and for the formulation of effective new strategies for the prevention and treatment of DIV1 infection.","output":"Integrated Analysis of mRNA-Seq and MiRNA-Seq Reveals the Molecular Mechanism of the Intestinal Immune Response in Marsupenaeus japonicus Under Decapod Iridescent Virus 1 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Describe tendon injuries and their structural causes seen on ultrasound in wrists with distal radius fractures and estimate the accuracy of ultrasound and its impact on clinical management. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ultrasounds of 226 wrists (221 patients) with distal radius fractures were retrospectively reviewed. Ultrasound findings of tendon injuries and their structural causes were correlated with surgery and clinical outcome. Accuracy and inter- and intra-observer reproducibilities were calculated. RESULTS Twenty-five wrists were treated non-operatively while 201 underwent surgery. Ultrasound demonstrated hardware contact with flexor pollicis longus (FPL) in 76 wrists, extensor pollicis longus (EPL) in 21, and other tendons in 94. Ultrasound identified tendon ruptures in 23 wrists (13 EPL/8 FPL/2 extensor indicis proprius (EIP)), most of which were surgically confirmed. Among 12 wrists with confirmed EPL ruptures, distal radius fracture had been treated with volar plating in 6 and non-operatively in 6, and ultrasound showed osseous irregularity at the rupture site in 8. All FPL ruptures occurred in wrists with volar plating. Ultrasound findings were concordant with subsequent clinical management in most. In 2, ultrasound findings led to the decision to remove hardware despite lack of symptoms. Ultrasound had sensitivity/specificity/accuracy of 88/99/98% for identifying a specific tendon as ruptured and 88/87/88% for tendon abnormalities in general. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibilities were excellent (kappa = 0.85 ~ 1.0). CONCLUSION Certain wrist tendons, particularly EPL and FPL, are vulnerable after distal radius fractures.

We review testing outside traditional clinical settings. We focus on three curable bacterial STIs among the top 10 U.S. nationally notifiable conditions with screening recommendations: syphilis, gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also known as the gonococcus [GC]), and chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis). At least 19 million GC/C. trachomatis (GC/CT) screening or diagnostic tests are performed annually, presenting a considerable challenge during the pandemic. Unlike for HIV, STI at-home tests are currently not commercially available. However, innovative telemedicine providers currently offer services where specimen self-collection kits are mailed to patients at home who then ship them to laboratories for processing. We discuss technical and regulatory aspects of modifications for home-based specimen self-collection. The telemedicine provider typically manages and communicates results, provides linkage to care, and is responsible for billing and case reporting. We also describe rapid testing devices in development that may present an opportunity for future self-testing. In summary, COVID-19 has accelerated the evaluation and development of STI self-tests and specimen self-collection.

However, few studies explore adolescents postoperative experiences beyond physical and metabolic outcomes and quality-of-life measures. METHODS: Between 2016 and 2021, 45 semi-structured interviews were conducted with adolescents (16C20 years) at 6 months (N = 15), 12 months (N = 15), and 24 months (N = 15) following bariatric surgery. A deductive thematic analysis framework was applied by two independent coders (Cronbachs  = 0.84). Themes were identified and refined iteratively, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. RESULTS: Five major themes emerged related to: (1) weight-loss expectations vs. reality, (2) social landscape, (3) body image, (4) eating and moving, and (5) challenges for long-term success. The pace of and satisfaction with weight loss and side effects was heterogenous among participants, with most changes occurring early and stabilizing by 24 months. Adolescents adapted over time to their new social landscapes (e.g., relationships) and reported improved body image and confidence, yet persistently struggled to reconcile their internal identity with evolving external perceptions and discomfort with new attention. Participants experienced changes to lifestyle routines after surgery (e.g., eating, moving, habits), which introduced distress at 6 months but resolved over time. Life transitions in early adulthood (e.g., moving away, university/college, employment), concurrent with their evolving and increasing autonomy, physical, social, and financial independence, imposed unexpected challenges to postoperative routines and support systems. Participants unanimously reaffirmed that bariatric surgery is a lifelong journey and that they were committed to long-term success. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide insight into optimizing adolescent selection for bariatric surgery and perioperative support. Specifically, important life transitions during this developmental period impact postoperative experiences and outcomes and adolescents may benefit from postoperative counseling focused on managing weight-loss expectations and adapting to evolving nutritional needs and changing social circumstances.","output":"Your own pace, your own path: perspectives of adolescents navigating life after bariatric surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of gut microbiota and its association with the central nervous system via the microbiome-brain-gut axis has been widely discussed in the literature.

Each study's quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We performed random-effect meta-analyses including 21 of the identified articles evaluating cancer and/or mortality of coal mine workers. The meta-analysis showed an increased risk of all-cause mortality (SMR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.30) and mortality from non-malignant respiratory disease (NMRD) (3.59, 95% CI 3.00 to 4.30) in cohorts with coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP). We found a somewhat increased risk of stomach cancer (1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.35) and of mortality from NMRD (1.26, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.61) in the cohorts of coal miners with unknown CWP status. The meta-analysis also showed a decreased risk of prostate cancer and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality among coal miners. This may be a result of the healthy worker effect and possible lower smoking rates, and perhaps also reflect the physically active nature of many jobs in coal mines. The meta-analysis for lung cancer did not show increased risk in coal miners with CWP (1.49, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.18) or for coal miners of unknown CWP status (1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18). Lower smoking rates in coal mine workers could explain why case-control studies where smoking was controlled for showed higher risks for lung cancer than were seen in cohort studies.

Under cox regression, compared to other groups, the 22C28 days and 29C35 days groups revealed a better OS (21 vs. 22C28 days: HR 1.54, 95% CI = 0.81C2.93, P = 0.185; 36C42 vs. 22C28 days: HR 2.20, 95% CI = 1.28?3.79, P = 0.004; 43C84 vs. 22C28 days: HR 1.83, 95% CI = 1.09C3.06, P = 0.022) and PFS (21 vs. 22C28 days: HR 1.54, 95% CI = 0.81C2.93, P = 0.256; 36C42 vs. 22C28 days: HR 2.20, 95% CI = 1.28?3.79, P = 0.111; 43C84 vs. 22C28 days: HR 1.83, 95% CI = 1.09C3.06, P = 0.047). Further analysis revealed a better prognosis in patients with TTS within 22C35 days (OS: HR 1.78 95% CI = 1.25?2.54, P = 0.001; PFS: HR 1.49, 95% CI = 1.07?2.08, P = 0.017). Postoperative stay was significantly higher in the 21 days group, while other parameters revealed no statistical significance (P > 0.05). Restricted cubic spline depicted the nonlinear relationship between TTS and OS/PFS. CONCLUSION: Patients who received surgery within 3?5 weeks experienced the maximal survival benefit without an increase in postoperative complications or lowering the rate of pCR.

We investigate the phenomenon of cyberchondria, which potentially causes individuals to avoid getting tested and quarantined directly upon experiencing symptoms for fear of losing their salaries or jobs. We utilize Google Trends data to predict future disease statistics, like the pandemic's impact on human activities and health-related issues in India. By means of a bootstrapped Pearson correlation, a time-lead correlation, and a quantile regression, we found a strong relationship between Google Trend searches and COVID-19 cases. Contextualizing the second COVID-19 wave in India through the lenses of cyberchondria and protection motivation theory, our article notes that, when people develop COVID-19 symptoms, they turn to Google for confirmation and treatment, rather than getting themselves checked early, only getting medically tested, and treated when their health deteriorates. At that stage, given the patientscritical conditions, hospitalization is the only option. This places an unsustainable burden on hospitals, resulting in capacity constraints and increased mortality rates.

The question is how many people will be willing to get vaccinated. STUDY DESIGN We systematically reviewed peer-reviewed manuscripts monitoring peoples intention to receive a vaccine against COVID-19. METHODS Up to December 28, 2020 we identified 62 relevant peer-reviewed articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and GoogleScholar. RESULTS Total sample size was 118 855 respondents with overall average COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate of 72.5% which is \\"just\\" the level estimated to be sufficient for reaching herd immunity threshold. Surprisingly, healthcare workers showed smaller interest in receiving the vaccine when compared to general adult population and university students. On the other hand, their attitude to vaccination did not change over time. In case of general adult population, the longer the pandemic lasts, the smaller proportion of population wants to get vaccinated. Vaccination intentions were independent of gross domestic product and human development index.

Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs either does not prevent disease progression (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], colchicine), or is recommended only at the advanced disease stage (dexamethasone). Fluvoxamine and amantadine are drugs used to treat neurological and psychiatric diseases. Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, whereas amantadine is an old antiviral variably influencing brain neurotransmitter systems, and repurposed to Parkinson's disease. Both drugs are agonists of sigma-1 receptors located in the endoplasmic reticulum, which effect seems responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, amantadine was found to dampen the expression of cathepsin-L, a lysosomal enzyme implicated in SARS-CoV-2 virus entry to target cells. In two small controlled clinical trials, early treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons with fluvoxamine fully prevented COVID-19 symptoms. Anecdotal evidence shows that amantadine may be similarly effective. Both drugs are easily available, inexpensive and have favorable safety profiles.

To ensure that the limited pool of concessionary funding is used efficiently and effectively, a shared understanding of the roles and limitations of public and private funders is necessary. In this paper, we describe the high-level funding gap for sustainable agriculture, the general landscape of agricultural finance, and the concept and potential roles of blended finance in this context. This paper introduces the conditions under which different financing mechanisms can contribute to addressing barriers related to sustainable agriculture investments.

The disease was later named as a novel Coronavirus disease or COVID-19. It was then declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. As of February 5, 2021, 103 million laboratory-confirmed cases and nearly 2.3 million deaths have been reported globally. The number of death tolls continue to rise, and a large number of countries have been forced to implement social distancing and lockdown. As per literature, Coronavirus is transmitted human to human or human to animal via airborne droplets. Coronavirus enters the human cell through membrane ACE-2 exopeptidase receptor. WHO, ECDC, and ICMR advised to avoid public places and close contact with infected persons and pet animals. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and respiratory therapy. Although several therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate.

This study, however, takes a different approach, by exploring features of community locations considered welcoming by individuals with serious mental illnesses. This is important because welcoming environments are more likely to promote community participation. Using a survey approach, 75 participants were asked to identify and describe locations where they felt welcomed as a person with a mental illness. Our findings suggest that there are a number of places within the general community individuals with serious mental illnesses perceive as welcoming. Participants described religious communities, restaurants/cafs shops, parks, libraries, and cultural centers. Welcoming places were often perceived as architecturally open, featuring natural light and plants. Places provided opportunities for individuals to engage in a number of activities (e.g., socializing, entertainment, improving health, among others); data suggest welcoming places facilitated reciprocal relationships. We link these findings to a number of key recovery principles and make recommendation for multilevel interventions. This study may facilitate conversations with mainstream community organizations about inclusion and strategies to create welcoming environments and with mental health providers to consider strategies to encourage participation in welcoming places.

We introduce a SIR epidemiological model into a neoclassical production economy in which goods are distinguished by the degree to which they can be consumed at home rather than in a social, possibly contagious context. We demonstrate that within the model the Swedish solution of letting the epidemic play out without government intervention and allowing agents to shift their consumption behavior towards relatively safe sectors can lead to substantial mitigation of the economic and human costs of the COVID-19 crisis. We estimate the model on Swedish health data and then show that compared to a model in which sectors are assumed to be homogeneous in their infection risk, as in Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt (2020), endogenous sectoral reallocation avoids more than 2/3 of the decline in aggregate output and consumption, and at the same time induces a dynamics of weekly death that accords very well with the matching and of the number of deaths within one year. Our analysis implies case fatality rates below 0.2 percent and a limit of less than 800 deaths per million for Sweden. We also characterize the allocation a social planner would choose that can dictate sectoral consumption patterns and demonstrate that the laissez-faire outcome with sectoral reallocation, while mitigating the economic and health crisis, still implies suboptimally many deaths and too massive a decline in economic activity.","output":"Macroeconomic Dynamics and Reallocation in an Epidemic: Evaluating the Swedish Solution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The delineation of flood risk maps is a fundamental step in planning urban areas management.

Serological test is required to evaluate a previous exposure to the virus, as well as antibody response. The aim of this multicentric study is to analyse the antibody response following COVID-19 vaccination in healthcare workers and guests of nursing homes, and to determine differences between subjects with or without a confirmed previous infection. Methods Our study included 657 subjects, recruited from guests and healthcare workers of nursing homes in the Piedmont region. 10 days after the completion of the vaccination cycle, a blood sample was taken from the subjects to measure IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Serological testing was performed using an enzyme immunoassay kit (EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA). We performed statistical analysis with R software. Results We recruited 657 subjects aged between 19 to 106. Among them, 404 had a previous infection and 253 didn't have a known previous infection.

In this survey, we investigated attitudes of final year medical students regarding substance use during pregnancy and identified the factors that influence these attitudes. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019 and 2020 in Belgium using the short version of the Substance Abuse Attitude Survey questionnaire. We focused on two items regarding punishment of substance use during pregnancy. We analysed the concordance between these two, their correlation with other items (e.g. stereotyping, morality, forced withdrawal, low treatment optimism) and the association between respondents opinion on punishment and their sociodemographic data. RESULTS: The response rate was 65.2% (370/567 online and face-to face questionnaires). 19.2% of respondents were in favour of punishment for alcohol use (n = 353) and 15.1% for drug use (n = 356) during pregnancy. The agreement analysis between the two items showed that 14.3% of students were in favour of punishing both pregnant women who use drugs and those using alcohol. Respondents tended to be more in favour of punishment if they were male students, older, their mothers had a lower education level or had no personal or family history of substance use. Attitudes appeared to be more punitive among students with limited contact with people with substance use disorder (i.e. none or limited to hospital). Students intending to specialise in internal medicine were more in favour of punishment of women whereas none of those intending to specialise in psychiatry were in favour.

Social determinants and pre-existing health conditions place homeless people at increased risk of severe disease. Described outbreaks in homeless shelters resulted in high proportions of infected residents and staff members. In addition to other infection prevention strategies, regular shelter-wide (universal) testing for COVID-19 may be valuable, depending on the level of community transmission and when resources permit. METHODS: This was a prospective feasibility cohort study to evaluate universal testing for COVID-19 at a homeless shelter with 106 beds in Berlin, Germany. Co-researchers were recruited from the shelter staff. A PCR analysis of saliva or self-collected nasal/oral swab was performed weekly over a period of 3 weeks in July 2020. Acceptability and implementation barriers were analyzed by process evaluation using mixed methods including evaluation sheets, focus group discussion and a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Ninety-three out of 124 (75%) residents were approached to participate in the study. Fifty-one out of the 93 residents (54.8%) gave written informed consent; thus 41.1% (51 out of 124) of all residents were included in the study. Among these, high retention rates (88.9C93.6%) of a weekly respiratory specimen were reached, but repeated collection attempts, as well as assistance were required. Around 48 person-hours were necessary for the sample collection including the preparation of materials. A self-collected nasal/oral swab was considered easier and more hygienic to collect than a saliva specimen. No resident was tested positive by RT-PCR. Language barriers were the main reason for non-participation. Flexibility of sample collection schedules, the use of video and audio materials, and concise written information were the main recommendations of the co-researchers for future implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary universal testing for COVID-19 is feasible in homeless shelters. Universal testing of high-risk facilities will require flexible approaches, considering the level of the community transmission, the available resources, and the local recommendations. Lack of human resources and laboratory capacity may be a major barrier for implementation of universal testing, requiring adapted approaches compared to standard individual testing. Assisted self-collection of specimens and barrier free communication may facilitate implementation in homeless shelters. Program planning must consider homeless peoples needs and life situation, and guarantee confidentiality and autonomy.

The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 2018 data submitted by health plans reporting 2 new Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures assessing receipt of clinically recommended vaccines among pregnant women and adults. We analyzed the number of plans reporting a valid performance rate and electronic data source used. We consulted expert panels and reviewed coverage rates from other sources to understand the results. RESULTS: We received 136 data submissions across commercial, Medicaid and Medicare plans and 87 submissions across commercial and Medicaid plans for the adult and prenatal immunization measures, respectively. These submissions represent approximately 15% of possible submissions. Plans used claims, registries and electronic health records. Mean performance rates for adult immunizations were 21.2 (commercial), 14.0 (Medicaid) and 19.5% (Medicare). Mean rates for prenatal immunizations were 33.1 (commercial) and 16.7% (Medicaid). DISCUSSION: Results from the first year of reporting 2 electronic clinical data measures suggest health plans can feasibly report these measures and are seeking electronic data to supplement claims. Comparison of rates to other national results showed lower than expected rates for the adult immunization measure. However, prenatal immunization rates were on par with those from a national survey, suggesting this measure is closer to use for quality improvement. CONCLUSION: Quality measure reporting that encourages connection to electronic data sources is a step forward in performance monitoring and improvement. The use of electronic sources may advance health information exchange for patient care.","output":"Harnessing electronic clinical data to report adult and prenatal immunization quality measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dramatic uptake of virtual care, or telehealth, utilization because of COVID\\\\19 restrictions for persons with limb loss has led to a much greater understanding of this health care delivery method for this complex patient population.

This is expected to have a negative impact on the global economy, especially on those countries that depend more on the revenue from sales of crude oil. One of the measures that can be taken to survive this kind of situation in the future is to reduce the unit technical cost for producing a barrel of oil by using locally available materials. This research investigated a local clay sourced from Ropp in Plateau State, Nigeria, by considering its rheological characteristics and economic implications of using it for partial to total substitution of imported bentonite clay for oil and gas drilling operations. The local clay was termed as Ropp bentonite clay (RBC). Various spud mud samples were prepared by dispersing a mixture of imported bentonite clay (IBC) and RBC (0-100%) in 350 ml of water. Certain quantity (0-1 g) of polyacrylamide cellulose was added to the mud samples before rheological and physical properties were determined using the standard API procedure. An economic model was built to determine the cost implications of using any of the mud formulations at different consumption rates. The results show that IBC-RBC blend in the right proportion could save Nigeria 12 to 36% of the cost of bentonite clay used to drill wells in the country.","output":"Rheological impact and economic implications of partial to total substitution of imported bentonite clay for oil and gas drilling operations in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this present study is to focus on the in silico study to screen for an alternative drug that can block the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic target of the COVID-19 virus using natural compounds (Isothymol, Thymol, Limonene, P-cymene and ?3-terpinene) derived from the essential oil of the antiviral and antimicrobial plant Ammoides verticillata (Desf.)

Implementing the gMMPI, this paper reviews the inequality of the coastal and non-coastal provinces, as well as the latent impact of scale efficiency change (SEC) for China. Using provincial data for the years 1996C2004, the empirical results are as follows. On average, China demonstrates an annual 3.191% productivity change, which is lower than 4.729% for the conventional MPI and accounts for about 26.508% of output growth over the period 1996C2004. Most of this change is propelled by technical progress, while a fraction is driven by the adjustment in production scale, and the efficiency change has an adverse effect. Furthermore, regional inequality is also found in this empirical work, and the productivity change of the coastal region is actually stronger than that of the non-coastal region. This paper also casts some focus on the China Western Development policy. Indeed, we do not find any outstanding achievement from the policy in the sample period, except that the west region sustained its rate of productivity change after 2000. Moreover, the SEC is found to be trivial in the advanced coastal region, but plays an important role in the relatively laggard non-coastal region. The implication of the positive SEC in the non-coastal region means that China's Western Development policy will improve the scale efficiency and the TFP growth of the west region.","output":"Analysis of regional productivity growth in China: A generalized metafrontier MPI approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus represents a multi-dimensional challenge for European and global societies alike.

This vaccine hesitancy is an important factor affecting our ability to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The objective of the study was to examine the attitudes and willingness among US Veterans toward receiving COVID-19 vaccination. The study used a quantitative qualitative mixed methods design with a telephone survey and then in-depth interviews in a subset of those surveyed. Participants were unvaccinated Veterans (N = 184) selected randomly from a registry of patients who had received VA healthcare during the pandemic and had a diagnostic test for COVID-19. The primary outcome was willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccination. Survey data collection and in-depth interviews were conducted by telephone. Analyses of the survey data compared the primary outcome with demographics, clinical data, and survey responses using bivariate and multiple regression analyses. A subset (N = 10) of those surveyed, participated in an in-depth interview. Interview transcripts were analyzed to derive themes using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Almost 40% of participants disagreed they would receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants who were younger, female, and had fewer comorbid conditions were more likely (P < 0.05) to disagree with COVID-19 vaccination. In multiple regression analysis, willingness to accept vaccination was associated with reliance on a doctor or family members recommendation and with a belief that vaccines are effective. In-depth interviews revealed several barriers to COVID-19 vaccination, including lack of trust in the government and vaccine manufacturers, concerns about the speed of vaccine development, fear of side effects, and fear the vaccine was a tool of racism. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the complexity of patients deliberation about COVID-19 vaccination and may help physicians and other health care providers understand patients perspectives about COVID-19 vaccination. The results highlight the importance of patients trust in physicians, healthcare organizations, pharmaceutical manufacturers and the government when making health decisions.

In this study, we investigated differences in codon usage preferences among the highly mutable single strain RNA viruses which infect vertebrate or invertebrate hosts, respectively. We incorporate principal component analysis (PCA) and k-mean methods to clustering viruses infected with different type of hosts. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) indices of all genes in 32 RNA viruses were calculated, and the correlation of the RSCU indices among different viruses was analyzed by the PCA. Our results show a positive correlation in codon usage preferences among viruses that target the same host category. Results of k-means clustering analysis further confirmed the statistical significance of this study, demonstrating that viruses infecting vertebrate hosts have different codon usage preferences to those of invertebrate viruses. Based on the analysis of the effective number of codons (ENC) in relation to the GC-content at the synonymous third codon position (GC3s), we further identified that mutational pressure was the dominant evolution driving force in making the different codon usage preferences.

The anterior-posterior and transverse diameter at the inferior orbital margin, the narrowest diameter of the NLD, NLD length, and the orientation angle in the sagittal plane (the angle between the line connecting the distal and proximal ends of the NLD and a line drawn parallel to the nasal floor) were analyzed by age group. Results: The anterior-posterior and transverse diameters at the level of the inferior orbital margin and the NLD length recorded in sagittal CT images were statistically significantly greater in patients older than 5 years of age (p<0.05).

This pathway plays a pivotal role in the transduction of signals from different apoptotic stimuli. Recently, it has become evident that ASK1 and its downstream pathway are employed in the transduction of signals from Toll-like receptors (TLR) - multistep processes that interfere with different intracellular signalling pathways. TLR are the key proteins that allow mammals to detect pathogens and mediate innate immune responses. In addition, ASK1 and its downstream pathway play a target role in the regulation of apoptosis in some cases of viral infection - AIDS, influenza, hepatitis C and others.

This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly-l-lysine backbone with multiple copies of this sulfated HNK-1 trisaccharide. This decoy, poly(phenyl disodium 3-O-sulfo-?-d-glucopyranuronate)-(1a3)-?-d-galactopyranoside, known as PPSGG, removed anti-MAG IgM autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor-binding domain of CoViD-19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life-threatening disease.

Metabolic resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is conferred by the chimeric P450 enzyme CYP337B3, produced by unequal crossing-over between CYP337B1 and CYP337B2. CYP337B3 is 99.7% similar to CYP337B1 except for the 177 N-terminal amino acids containing the substrate recognition site 1 from CYP337B2. Here, we studied the structure-function relationship of CYP337B3 and CYP337B1 to determine the amino acids that enable CYP337B3 to efficiently hydroxylate the 4'-carbon position of fenvalerate, while neither CYP337B1 nor CYP337B2 can do so. RESULTS: Site-directed mutagenesis showed the L114F substitution in CYP337B3 reduced its 4'-hydroxylation activity by 89%, but the reciprocal F114L substitution in CYP337B1 increased its 4'-hydroxylation activity to only 49% of the level of CYP337B3. Docking models showed that amino acid 114 seems to have different functions in CYP337B1 and CYP337B3. Antibodies detected 2 to 3-fold more CYP337B1 than CYP337B3 in larval cuticle, which along with a 49% 4'-hydroxylation activity increase due to a F114L substitution in vivo might be expected to provide as much protection of the larva against exposure to fenvalerate as CYP337B3. However, CYP337B3 is present at much higher frequencies than CYP337B1-CYP337B2 in most populations, including those recently invading South America. CONCLUSION: The metabolic resistance to pyrethroids in H. armigera has evolved by saltational evolution; i.e. by a single mutation, an unequal crossing-over, producing a larger selective advantage than could be attained gradually by stepwise improvement of the parental enzyme.

IMC patients lack specific therapy and have poor outcomes. This proof-of-principle preclinical study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and effect on survival of neoadjuvant intratumoral (in situ) empty cowpea mosaic virus (eCPMV) immunotherapy in companion dogs diagnosed with IMC. METHODS: Ten IMC-bearing dogs were enrolled in the study. Five dogs received medical therapy, and five received weekly neoadjuvant in situ eCPMV immunotherapy (0.2C0.4 mg per injection) and medical therapy after the second eCPMV injection. Efficacy was evaluated by reduction of tumor growth; safety by hematological and biochemistry changes in blood and plasma; and patient outcome by survival analysis. eCPMV-induced immune changes in blood cells were analyzed by flow cytometry; changes in the tumor microenvironment were evaluated by CD3 (T lymphocytes), CD20 (B lymphocytes), FoxP3 (Treg lymphocytes), myeloperoxidase (MPO; neutrophils), Ki-67 (proliferation index, PI; tumor cell proliferation), and Cleaved Caspase-3 (CC-3; apoptosis) immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Two neoadjuvant in situ eCPMV injections resulted in tumor shrinkage in all patients by day 14 without systemic adverse events. Although surgery for IMC is generally not an option, reduction in tumor size allowed surgery in two IMC patients. In peripheral blood, in situ eCPMV immunotherapy was associated with a significant decrease of Treg(+)/CD8(+) ratio and changes in CD8(+)Granzyme B(+) T cells, which behave as a lagging predictive biomarker. In the TME, higher neutrophilic infiltration and MPO expression, lower tumor Ki-67 PI, increase in CD3(+) lymphocytes, decrease in FoxP3(+)/CD3(+) ratio (p<0.04 for all comparisons), and no changes in CC-3(+) immunostainings were observed in post-treatment tumor tissues when compared with pretreatment tumor samples. eCPMV-treated IMC patients had a statistically significant (p=0.033) improved overall survival than patients treated with medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant in situ eCPMV immunotherapy demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy and improved survival in IMC patients without systemic adverse effects. eCPMV-induced changes in immune cells point to neutrophils as a driver of immune response. Neoadjuvant in situ eCPMV immunotherapy could be a groundbreaking immunotherapy for canine IMC and a potential future immunotherapy for human IBC patients.","output":"Neoadjuvant in situ vaccination with cowpea mosaic virus as a novel therapy against canine inflammatory mammary cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic with very limited specific treatments. To fight COVID-19, various traditional antiviral medicines have been prescribed in China to infected patients with mild to moderate symptoms and received unexpected success in controlling the disease. However, the molecular mechanisms of how these herbal medicines interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 have remained elusive. It is well known that the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in maturation of many viral proteins such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of the computationally determined top candidate, namely, rutin which is a key component in many traditional antiviral medicines such as Lianhuaqinwen and Shuanghuanlian, for inhibiting the viral target-Mpro. Using in silico methods (docking and molecular dynamics simulations), we revealed the dynamics and energetics of rutin when interacting with the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the highly hydrophilic rutin molecule can be bound inside the Mpro's pocket (active site) and possibly inhibit its biological functions. In addition, we optimized the structure of rutin and designed two more hydrophobic analogs, M1 and M2, which satisfy the rule of five for western medicines and demonstrated that they (M2 in particular) possess much stronger binding affinities to the SARS-COV-2s Mpro than rutin, due to the enhanced hydrophobic interaction as well as more hydrogen bonds. Therefore, our results provide invaluable insights into the mechanism of a ligand's binding inside the Mpro and shed light on future structure-based designs of high-potent inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","output":"Structure-based lead optimization of herbal medicine rutin for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2's main protease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Assessing the inflammation is important in the follow-up of paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aim to evaluate the value of B cell-activating factor (BAFF) in paediatric IBD as a potential biomarker for follow-up. METHOD We determined BAFF in serum and faeces and faecal calprotectin (CP) in 32 IBD children-16 Crohn's disease (CD) and 16 ulcerative colitis (UC). Twenty-six healthy children and 10 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were included as controls. RESULTS No differences were found in serum BAFF between IBD, IBS, and healthy group: 1037.35, 990.9 and 979.8 pg/ml, respectively, all p > 0.05, but faecal BAFF was higher in the IBD group: 15.1, 8.5 and 8.2 pg/ml, respectively, p < 0.05, and higher in the UC group (55.975 pg/ml) compared to the CD group (10.95 pg/ml), p = 0.015. Splitting the IBD group in relation to the CP level, the serum BAFF had no significantly different values between the subgroups, but the faecal BAFF was significantly higher in the >250 g/g subgroup. Cut-off values of BAFF were calculated. CONCLUSION Faecal BAFF is a promising marker for monitoring the children with IBD, higher levels of BAFF being correlated with high CP.

It comes and goes when life situation changes. In the case of chronic loneliness, it is experienced no matter what the circumstances. Loneliness functions in the temporal (time) dimension: it can be continuous, but it can also occur temporarily. The feeling of loneliness occurs in situations where the emotional bond is broken or in the case of isolation. The aim of this article is to address the problem of seniors' loneliness which is caused by the limitations of the Covid-19 pandemic. The participants of the study are seniors living in Poland and Slovakia. Research conducted in Poland, with two elderly women over 70, living in a small fishing village in the north of the country, shows that they experience unpleasant states of loneliness despite having adequate relationships with other people. As observations show, the increase in loneliness is caused by conditions that require the observance of precautionary measures related to the pandemic and restrictions on socializing and conducting classes in senior clubs. The above factors result in shallowing interpersonal interactions;weakening interpersonal relations;contribute to more superficial contacts mainly by telephone. Seniors who are in care at the Retirement Home and Nursing Home in Slovakia also admit to feeling lonely, though not directly. From the conversation, however, it can be concluded that this condition does not result directly from pandemic limitations, but rather from too little contact with loved ones. The presence of other residents and staff, contact with people, meals, activities and conversations significantly fill the time during the day. The study was aimed at checking the facts of loneliness faced by seniors living in Slovakia and Poland as well as providing information about their views on their situation. The aim of the study is also to indicate the direction that will be helpful in combating and preventing such a pejorative phenomenon as loneliness. The research was conducted in the form of an interview. In order for the quality of the interviews to be as high as possible, the respondents were selected from various backgrounds. In Poland, there were two single women, aged over 70, living in a tiny fishing village;in Slovakia they were clients of the Retirement Home and the Nursing Home in Ri-mavska Sobota.

Residual analysis, quadratic discrimination, multi-resolution wavelet analysis are integrated for the extraction of the aforementioned features, which will be applied for the downstream tasks of traffic anomaly detection.

In the (current) absence of an authoritative national steer in England, professional bodies and local organisations have been developing and disseminating their own ethical guidance. Questions inevitably arise, some of which are particularly pressing during the pandemic, as events are unfolding quickly and the field is becoming crowded. My central question here is: which professional ethical guidance should the professional follow? MAIN BODY: Adopting a working definition of professional ethical guidance, I offer three domains for a healthcare professional to consider, and some associated questions to ask, when determining whether C in relation to any guidance document C they should bin it or pin it. First, the professional should consider the source of the guidance: is the issuing body authoritative or, if not, at least sufficiently influential that its guidance should be followed? Second, the professional should consider the applicability of the guidance, ascertaining whether the guidance is available and, if so, whether it is pertinent. Pertinence has various dimensions, including whether the guidance applies to this professional, this patient and/or this setting, whether it is up-to-date, and whether the guidance addresses the situation the professional is facing. Third, the professional should consider the methodology and methods by which the guidance was produced. Although the substantive quality of the guidance is important, so too are the methods by which it was produced. Here, the professional should ask whether the guidance is sufficiently inclusive C in terms of who has prepared it and who contributed to its development C and whether it was rigorously developed, and thus utilised appropriate processes, principles and evidence. CONCLUSION: Asking and answering such questions may be challenging, particularly during a pandemic. Furthermore, guidance will not do all the work: professionals will still need to exercise their judgment in deciding what is best in the individual case, whether or not this concerns COVID-19. But such judgments can and should be informed (and constrained) by guidance, and hopefully these preliminary observations will provide some useful pointers for time-pressed professionals.","output":"Bin it or pin it?

However, recent advances in the field of RNA sequencing revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) add an extensive additional layer to the cells molecular network. Here, we performed transcriptome profiling throughout a primary HIV infection in vitro to investigate lncRNA expression at the different HIV replication cycle processes (reverse transcription, integration and particle production). Subsequently, guilt-by-association, transcription factor and co-expression analysis were performed to infer biological roles for the lncRNAs identified in the HIV-host interplay. Many lncRNAs were suggested to play a role in mechanisms relying on proteasomal and ubiquitination pathways, apoptosis, DNA damage responses and cell cycle regulation. Through transcription factor binding analysis, we found that lncRNAs display a distinct transcriptional regulation profile as compared to protein coding mRNAs, suggesting that mRNAs and lncRNAs are independently modulated. In addition, we identified five differentially expressed lncRNA-mRNA pairs with mRNA involvement in HIV pathogenesis with possible cis regulatory lncRNAs that control nearby mRNA expression and function. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that lncRNAs add a new dimension to the HIV-host interplay and should be further investigated as they may represent targets for controlling HIV replication.","output":"Differential expression of lncRNAs during the HIV replication cycle: an underestimated layer in the HIV-host interplay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The VOC of SARS-CoV-2, Omicron (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, or BA.3), is associated with an increased risk of reinfection.

FE noise is attributed to a broadband part and narrowband components-forced expiratory wheezes (FEWs). FE respiratory noise is composed by acoustic and hydrodynamic mechanisms. An origin of the most powerful mid-frequency FEWs (400-600 Hz) is associated with the 0th-3rd levels of bronchial tree in terms of Weibel [(2009). Swiss Med. Wkly. 139(27-28), 375-386], whereas high-frequency FEWs (above 600 Hz) are attributed to the 2nd-6th levels of bronchial tree. The laboratory prototype of the apparatus is developed, which includes the electret microphone sensor with stethoscope head, a laptop with external sound card, and specially developed software. An analysis of signals by the new method, including FE time in the range from 200 to 2000 Hz and band-pass durations and energies in the 200-Hz bands evaluation, is applied instead of FEWs direct measures. It is demonstrated experimentally that developed FE acoustic parameters correspond to basic indices of lung function evaluated by spirometry and body plethysmography and may be even more sensitive to some respiratory deviations. According to preliminary experimental results, the developed technique may be considered as a promising instrument for acoustic monitoring human lung function in extreme conditions, including diving and space flights. The developed technique eliminates the contact of the sensor with the human oral cavity, which is characteristic for spirometry and body plethysmography.

Research, including ours, has shown anti-inflammatory effects of milk-derived EVs, using human breast milk as well as bovine colostrum and store-bought pasteurized cow milk, in in vitro systems as well as therapeutically in animal models. Although it is not completely elucidated which proteins and miRNAs within the milk-derived EVs contribute to these immunosuppressive capacities, one proposed mechanism of action of the EVs is via the modulation of the crosstalk between the (intestinal) microbiome and their host health. There is increasing awareness that the gut plays an important role in many inflammatory diseases. Enhanced intestinal leakiness, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, and bowel inflammation are not only associated with intestinal diseases like colitis and Crohn's disease, but also characteristic for systemic inflammatory diseases such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Strategies to target the gut, and especially its microbiome, are under investigation and hold a promise as a therapeutic intervention for these diseases. The use of milk-derived EVs, either as stand-alone drug or as a drug carrier, is often suggested in recent years. Several research groups have studied the tolerance and safety of using milk-derived EVs in animal models. Due to its composition, milk-derived EVs are highly biocompatible and have limited immunogenicity even cross species. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that milk-derived EVs, when taken up in the gastro-intestinal tract, stay intact after absorption, indicating excellent stability. These characteristics make milk-derived EVs very suitable as drug carriers, but also by themselves, these EVs already have a substantial immunoregulatory function, and even without loading, these vesicles can act as therapeutics.

Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 h after SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with 0.1 g/ml and 0.05 g/ml concentrations causing greater than 100-fold reduction as measured at 48 h, and the 0.05 g/ml concentration resulting in a 78-fold reduction. Concentrations of oleandrin up to 10 g/ml were well tolerated in Vero cells. We also present in vivo evidence of the safety and efficacy of defined N. oleander extract (PBI-06150), which was administered to golden Syrian hamsters in a preparation containing as high as 130 g/ml of oleandrin. In comparison to administration of control vehicle, PBI-06150 provided a statistically significant reduction of the viral titer in the nasal turbinates (nasal conchae). The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here, together with initial evidence of its safety and efficacy in a relevant hamster model of COVID-19, support the further development of oleandrin and/or defined extracts containing this molecule for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and associated COVID-19 disease and potentially also for reduction of virus spread by persons diagnosed early after infection.","output":"Antiviral activity of oleandrin and a defined extract of Nerium oleander against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that has achieved community spread among humans and become a pandemic.

Model training was performed on a cohort of patients admitted from May 1 to December 31, 2020. Participants: Eight hundred and seventy COVID-19 patients with AKI defined according KDIGO serum creatinine criteria were included between 01 March to 31 December 2020.Material and Methods: We evaluated four categories of predictor variables available at the time of AKI diagnosis: (1) demographic data;(2) comorbidities and condition at admission;(3) laboratory exams at admission;(4) characteristics and causes of AKI. We used a machine learning approach to fit models in the training set using 10-fold-cross validation. Predictors with more than 30% missing were removed. We select the best model and confirm the accuracy in a validation cohort using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).Main Outcome Measured: In-hospital mortality.Results: There were 544 (62.5%) in-hospital deaths. Increasing age, mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressors, leukocytosis, hypertension, severe condition at admission, AKI ethiology, and need kidney replacement therapies (KRT) were associated with increased risk of death. Longer time from symptoms to hospitalization or to AKI diagnosis, and higher urine output were associated with reduced risk of death. The coefficients of the best model (Elastic Net) were used to build the predictive ImAgeS score. The final model has an AUC-ROC of 0.823 [95% CI 0.761 C 0.885] in the validation cohort.Conclusion: We developed a predictive model using only demographic data, comorbidities, hospital admission condition, laboratory variables and causes of AKI that shows good accuracy and is easily applicable.

Demand for NHS 111 advice has increased since its introduction in 2013, and the service is of particular importance in light of the current pandemic and resulting increased demand for emergency care. Currently, little is known about the effectiveness of NHS 111 in terms of the appropriateness of the advice given, or about the compliance of patients with that advice. We aimed to address this issue by analysing a large linked routine dataset of all NHS 111 calls (n = 3,631,069) and subsequent emergency department (ED) attendances made in the Yorkshire & Humber region from March 2013-March 2017. We found that many patients do not comply with advice, with 11% (n = 289,748) of patients attending ED when they are advised to self-care or seek primary care. We also found that a considerable number of these patients are further classed as urgent (88%, n = 255,931) and a substantial minority (37%, 106,207) are subsequently admitted to hospital. Further, many patients who are sent an ambulance or told to attend ED are classed as non-urgent upon attending ED (9%, n = 42,372). This research suggests that the level at which NHS 111 is currently triaging results in many hundreds of thousands of mis-triaged cases annually.

As part of the response, India imposed a nation-wide lockdown and prioritized COVID-19 care in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs). Leveraging data from the Indian Registry of IntenSive care, we sought to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on critical care service utilization, case-mix, and clinical outcomes in non-COVID ICUs. Methods: We included all consecutive patients admitted between 1 st October 2019 and 27 th September 2020. Data were extracted from the registry database and included patients admitted to the non-COVID or general ICUs at each of the sites. Outcomes included measures of resource-availability, utilisation, case-mix, acuity, and demand for ICU beds. We used a Mann-Whitney test to compare the pre-pandemic period (October 2019 - February 2020) to the pandemic period (March-September 2020). In addition, we also compared the period of intense lockdown (March-May 31 st 2020) with the pre-pandemic period. Results: There were 3424 patient encounters in the pre-pandemic period and 3524 encounters in the pandemic period. Comparing these periods, weekly admissions declined (median [Q1 Q3] 160 [145,168] to 113 [98.5,134];p=0.00002);unit turnover declined (median [Q1 Q3] 12.1 [11.32,13] to 8.58 [7.24,10], p<0.00001), and APACHE II score increased (median [Q1 Q3] 19 [19,20] to 21 [20,22] ;p<0.00001). Unadjusted ICU mortality increased (9.3% to 11.7%, p=0.01519) and the length of ICU stay was similar (median [Q1 Q3] 2.11 [2, 2] vs. 2.24 [2, 3] days;p=0.15096).

The scale evaluates the emotional responses to COVID-19. To date, the FCV-19S has been translated and validated in about 20 languages and has been used in many published research. The current study aimed to validate the Polish version of the FCV-19S. Method The FCV-19S was translated into Polish using forward- and back-translation. From May 15th to June 15th 2020, a total of 708 community members (Sample 1: 383 persons, 209 females, Sample 2: 325 persons, 198 females) participated in the online study. The participants were recruited using online advertisements in social media. Participation was anonymous, voluntary, and without compensation. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the one-factor structure of the FCV-19S. Then, measurement invariance was analyzed across samples, gender and age groups. To assess the validity of the scale, correlations between the FCV-19S and the remaining scales were computed. Results Internal consistency of the FCV-19S was good in both samples (Cronbachs alpha 0.89 and 0.85). The CFA showed that the one-factor model fits the data well (RMSEA = 0.067, 90% CI [0.059C0.094], CFI = 0.977, TLI = 0.965, GFI = 0.986). The criteria for configural, metric, scalar and strict invariance were met for all models tested. The FCV-19S scores correlated significantly with age, subjective vulnerability to the disease, neuroticism, self-reported compliance with the pandemic measures, and three kinds of preventive behavior (i.e., social distancing, hand hygiene, and disinfecting things). Conclusion The Polish version of the FCV-19S had a unidimensional structure, good reliability, and correlated as predicted with other variables. With the FCV-19S and the obtained results, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the government can gain more valuable information about people who may be at risk for negative psychological outcomes during the pandemic or who are not implementing protective behavior.

Lack of specific drug molecules or treatment strategy against this disease makes it more devastating. Thus, there is an urgent need of effective drug molecules to fight against COVID-19. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS CoV-2, a key component of this viral replication, is considered as a prime target for anti-COVID-19 drug development. In order to find potent Mpro inhibitors, we have selected eight polyphenols from green tea, as these are already known to exert antiviral activity against many RNA viruses. We have elucidated the binding affinities and binding modes between these polyphenols including a well-known Mpro inhibitor N3 (having binding affinity ?7.0 kcal/mol) and Mpro using molecular docking studies. All eight polyphenols exhibit good binding affinity toward Mpro (?7.1 to ?9.0 kcal/mol). However, only three polyphenols (epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechingallate and gallocatechin-3-gallate) interact strongly with one or both catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of Mpro. Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) on these three MproCpolyphenol systems further reveal that these complexes are highly stable, experience less conformational fluctuations and share similar degree of compactness. Estimation of total number of intermolecular H-bond and MM-GBSA analysis affirm the stability of these three MproCpolyphenol complexes. Pharmacokinetic analysis additionally suggested that these polyphenols possess favorable drug-likeness characteristics. Altogether, our study shows that these three polyphenols can be used as potential inhibitors against SARS CoV-2 Mpro and are promising drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment.

When historical data are absent (that is, the overwhelming majority), viral sequence sampling on a time scale commensurate with the rate of substitution permits the inference of the times of subtype divergence. Currently, researchers use two strategies to approach this task, both requiring strong conditions on the molecular clock assumption of substitution rate. As the underlying structure of the substitution rate process at the time of subtype divergence is not understood and likely highly variable, we present a simple method that estimates rates of substitution, and from there, times of divergence, without use of an assumed molecular clock. We accomplish this by blending estimates of the substitution rate for triplets of dated sequences where each sequence draws from a distinct viral subtype, providing a zeroth-order approximation for the rate between subtypes. As an example, we calculate the time of divergence for three genes among influenza subtypes A-H3N2 and B using subtype C as an outgroup.

Few interventions, however, have been developed specifically for this age group. OBJECTIVE: In this randomized trial, we will provide a mobile app (SweetGoals) to all participants as a core intervention. The app prompts participants to upload data from their diabetes devices weekly to a device-agnostic uploader (Glooko), automatically retrieves uploaded data, assesses daily and weekly self-management goals, and generates feedback messages about goal attainment. Further, the trial will test two unique intervention components: (1) incentives to promote consistent daily adherence to goals, and (2) web health coaching to teach effective problem solving focused on personalized barriers to self-management. We will use a novel digital direct-to-patient recruitment method and intervention delivery model that transcends the clinic. METHODS: A 2x2 factorial randomized trial will be conducted with 300 young adults ages 19-25 with type 1 diabetes and (Hb)A(1c)  8.0%. All participants will receive the SweetGoals app that tracks and provides feedback about two adherence targets: (a) daily glucose monitoring; and (b) mealtime behaviors. Participants will be randomized to the factorial combination of incentives and health coaching. The intervention will last 6 months. The primary outcome will be reduction in A(1c). Secondary outcomes include self-regulation mechanisms in longitudinal mediation models and engagement metrics as a predictor of outcomes. Participants will complete 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments. We hypothesize greater sustained A(1c) improvements in participants who receive coaching and who receive incentives compared to those who do not receive those components. RESULTS: Data collection is expected to be complete by February 2025. Analyses of primary and secondary outcomes are expected by December 2025.

Then, a novel method implemented in the incidence and Optimum function in desolve package to the data of cumulative daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating the reproduction number in the R software. Result: Analysis has been seen that the lockdown was really quite as effective, India has already shown a major steady decline. The growth rate has fluctuated about 20 percent with trend line projections in various lockdown. A comparative analysis gives an idea of decline in value of R0 from 1.73 to 1.08. Annotation plot showing the predicted R0 values based on previous lockdown in month of June and July. Conclusion: Without lockdown, the growth might not have been contained in India and may have gone into the exponential zone. We show that, the lockdown in India was fairly successful. The effect partial lifting of the lockdown (unlock) is also seen in the results, in terms of increment in R0 values. Hence this study provides a platform for policy makers and government authorities for implementing the strategies to prevent the spread of infection.","output":"A comprehensive analysis of R0 with different lockdown phase during covid-19 in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Affibody molecules, small scaffold proteins, have demonstrated an appreciable potential as imaging probes. Affibody molecules are composed of three alpha-helices. Helices 1 and 2 are involved in molecular recognition, while helix 3 provides stability. The size of Affibody molecules can be reduced by omitting the third alpha-helix and cross-linking the two remaining, providing a smaller molecule with better extravasation and quicker clearance of unbound tracer. The goal of this study was to develop a novel 2-helix Affibody molecule based on backbone cyclization by native chemical ligation (NCL). METHODS The HER2-targeting NCL-cyclized Affibody molecule ZHER2:342min has been designed, synthesized and site-specifically conjugated with a DOTA chelator. DOTA-ZHER2:342min was labeled with (111)In and (68)Ga. The binding affinity of DOTA-ZHER2:342min was evaluated in vitro. The targeting properties of (111)In- and (68)Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:342min were evaluated in mice bearing SKOV-3 xenografts and compared with the properties of (111)In- and (68)Ga-labeled PEP09239, a DOTA-conjugated 2-helix Affibody analogue cyclized by a homocysteine disulfide bridge. RESULTS The dissociation constant (KD) for DOTA-ZHER2:342min binding to HER2 was 18nM according to SPR measurements. DOTA-ZHER2:342min was labeled with (111)In and (68)Ga. Both conjugates demonstrated bi-phasic binding kinetics to HER2-expressing cells, with KD1 in low nanomolar range. Both variants demonstrated specific uptake in HER2-expressing xenografts. Tumor-to-blood ratios at 2h p.i. were 6.11.3 for (111)In- DOTA-ZHER2:342min and 4.60.7 for (68)Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:342min. However, the uptake of DOTA-ZHER2:342min in lung, liver and spleen was appreciably higher than the uptake of PEP09239-based counterparts. CONCLUSIONS Native chemical ligation enables production of a backbone-cyclized HER2-binding 2-helix Affibody molecule (ZHER2:342min) with low nanomolar target affinity and specific tumor uptake.","output":"Evaluation of backbone-cyclized HER2-binding 2-helix affibody molecule for in vivo molecular imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Apart from claiming the lives of more than 3.2 million people, the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening the global plastic pollution every day, mainly with the overflux of single-use polypropylene (PP) face masks. In this scenario, as an innovative solution to mitigate plastic pollution as well as to meet the rising electrical energy demand, we are introducing an all-flexible and facile waste material-based triboelectric nanogenerator (WM-TENG), aiding toward the circular economy. The WM-TENG operating in contact separation mode is fabricated using the PP from a used face mask in combination with recovered Mylar sheets from solid wastes as triboelectric contact layers and a flexible supporting structure. After detailed investigation and trials to study the effect of various disinfection mechanisms of PP materials on the energy output of WM-TENG, UV-C radiation is selected for disinfecting the used masks owing to the retention of electrical energy output. Under a tapping force of 3 N, the WM-TENG having an active area of 6 cm2 delivers an open-circuit voltage of 200 V and a short-circuit current density of 0.29 mA/m2, respectively. The WM-TENG also delivered a maximum power density of 71.16 mW/m2 under 108  load. Additionally, the WM-TENG is demonstrated for powering electronic gadgets such as a calculator, digital thermometer, and LCD clock.

We synthesized the evidence regarding efficacy and safety (review 1), as well as risks of droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, and associated transmission (review 2) of viral products. SOURCE: Literature searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese databases, and medRxiv. Review 1: we synthesized results from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HFNC to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) in critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Review 2: we narratively summarized findings from studies evaluating droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, or infection transmission associated with HFNC. For both reviews, paired reviewers independently conducted screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. We evaluated certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: No eligible studies included COVID-19 patients. Review 1: 12 RCTs (n = 1,989 patients) provided low-certainty evidence that HFNC may reduce invasive ventilation (relative risk [RR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.99) and escalation of oxygen therapy (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98) in patients with respiratory failure. Results provided no support for differences in mortality (moderate certainty), or in-hospital or intensive care length of stay (moderate and low certainty, respectively). Review 2: four studies evaluating droplet dispersion and three evaluating aerosol generation and dispersion provided very low certainty evidence. Two simulation studies and a crossover study showed mixed findings regarding the effect of HFNC on droplet dispersion. Although two simulation studies reported no associated increase in aerosol dispersion, one reported that higher flow rates were associated with increased regions of aerosol density. CONCLUSIONS: High-flow nasal cannula may reduce the need for invasive ventilation and escalation of therapy compared with COT in COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. This benefit must be balanced against the unknown risk of airborne transmission.","output":"Les canules nasales  haut dbit pour le traitement de l'insuffisance respiratoire hypoxmique aigu? chez les patients atteints de la COVID-19: comptes rendus systmatiques de l'efficacit et des risques d'arosolisation, de dispersion et de transmission de l'infection./ High-flow nasal cannula for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19: systematic reviews of effectiveness and its risks of aerosolization, dispersion, and infection transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxygen is the most commonly used therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In those patients who develop worsening pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), high concentrations of oxygen may need to be administered for prolonged time periods, often together with mechanical ventilation. Hyperoxia, although lifesaving and essential for maintaining adequate oxygenation in the short-term, may have adverse long-term consequences upon lung parenchymal structure and function. How hyperoxia per se impacts lung disease in COVID-19 has remained largely unexplored. Numbers of experimental studies have previously established that hyperoxia is associated with deleterious outcomes inclusive of: perturbations in immunologic responses; abnormal metabolic function and alterations in hemodynamics and alveolar barrier function. Such changes may ultimately progress into clinically evident lung injury, adverse remodeling and result in parenchymal fibrosis when exposure is prolonged. Given that significant exposure to hyperoxia in patients with severe COVID-19 may be unavoidable to preserve life, these sequelae of hyperoxia, superimposed on the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 virus may well impact pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced ARDS.","output":"Hyperoxia and modulation of pulmonary vascular and immune responses in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Few studies compared the yield of the RT-PCR assay in nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and sputum for SARS-CoV-2 detection. METHOD: We conducted an observational study in Beijing Ditan Hospital, China. Specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs and sputum from confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected for RT-PCR testing. Disease duration was calculated from the date of symptom onset to the date of specimens collection and divided into three groups: 14days, 14-21days, and >21days. We compared positive rates across three specimens collected in different disease duration. The kappa coefficient (KC) was used to evaluate consistency of RT-PCR results between different specimens. RESULTS: A total of 291 specimens were collected and tested from 43 confirmed patients. Among specimens collected in disease duration of  14days, the positive rate was highest in sputum (79.2%), and significantly higher than that in nasopharyngeal swabs (37.5%, p=0.003) and oropharyngeal swabs (20.8%, p&0.001). Similar findings were observed in disease duration of 14-21days and >21days. The consistency of testing results between nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs was low in disease duration of 14days and >21days. The consistency between the sputum and oropharyngeal swabs, and between the sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were very low across all three disease durations with statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Compared to nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs, sputum had the highest yield of SARS-CoV-2 detection. Nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs had a similar yield.

Children spend most of their time at school, which is often the place where problems are identified and interventions are offered, not only for treatment but also prevention. Embedding arts therapies into the educational system may help address childrens emerging needs and have a positive impact on their wellbeing. METHODS: A pilot cross-over randomized controlled design was employed to investigate the effectiveness of an arts therapies intervention on a series of child- and teacher-reported outcome measures, specifically, health related quality of life (assessed using a HRQOL scale; EQ-5D-Y), wellbeing and life functioning (assessed using the child outcome rating scale; CORS), emotional and behavioral difficulties (assessed using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire; SDQ), as well as duration of sleep (assessed using Fitbits). Sample size calculations for future large-scale studies were also performed, and the sustained impact of the intervention was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. The pluralistic theoretical and therapeutic framework of this intervention was informed by a systematic review on school-based arts therapies interventions and is presented in detail in the study protocol. Participants were 62 children with mild emotional and behavioral difficulties. RESULTS: Improvements in HRQOL and CORS were greater in those engaged in the arts therapies intervention than the control groups and were maintained at the follow-up stages. Significant improvements were only found for duration of sleep (P = 0.002) and SDQ (P = 0.008). Minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) as defined in the published protocol were found for CORS, SDQ and duration of sleep, but not HRQOL. DISCUSSION: Findings indicate that the arts therapies interventions were having a clinically significant effect on life functioning, duration of sleep, emotional and behavioral difficulties. Findings also indicate a small effect size for health related quality of life, suggesting the intervention was having a small positive effect on this outcome measure. The study indicates that all outcome measures assessed here would be suitable for inclusion in a larger randomized controlled study utilizing these arts therapies interventions, and that a sample size of 225 participants would be required if these outcome measures were used.","output":"An Investigation of the Effectiveness of Arts Therapies Interventions on Measures of Quality of Life and Wellbeing: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Study in Primary Schools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several of the key organizational issues that we have had to face with the emergence of COVID-19 crisis are related to Human Factors/Ergonomics (HFE) and the safety culture.

RESULTS: Overall, the total SEYLL in males and females was 10,702 and 3817.5 years, respectively. The MERS patients within the age range of 30C59 year-olds had the highest SEYLL (8305.5 years) in comparison to the patients within the age groups 0C29 (SEYLL = 3744.5 years) and  60 years (SEYLL = 2466.5 years).

We found that 38.9% (95%CI 36.3-41.5) of these patients had sepsis. Using a 490 patient validation cohort, two clinicians had good agreement with weighted kappa of 0.75 (95% CI 0.69-0.81) before coming to consensus on diagnosis of uncomplicated infection or sepsis for all patients. Our method had sensitivity 0.93 (95%CI 0.89-0.96), specificity 0.86 (95%CI 0.82-0.90) and an AUC 0.90 (95%CI 0.87-0.92) when validated against clinician review.

The aim was to explore how these care services have adapted during the pandemic in the UK and are providing care to people living with dementia (PLWD) and carers. METHOD: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted in June and July 2020 with 16 purposefully sampled unpaid dementia carers. Participants were asked about their experiences of accessing care services since the lockdown, and whether they were beneficial, if accessed at all. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (1) Impacts of no activities; (2) Difficulties accessing care during the pandemic; (3) Remote vs. face-to-face support. Loss of access to previously enjoyed activities and having had to shield for many PLWD is suggested to have led to severe physical and cognitive deteriorations, advancing the dementia. Where remote support was available, this was helpful to some, but did not replace the benefits of face-to-face support. Where PLWD were residing in a care home, carers had very limited remote access. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore the impact on carers both from a community and institutionalised care angle. Few care services have adapted to providing remote support. With the vaccine taking time to be accessible to everyone, it is vital for organisations to work closely with carers and PLWD to adapt services to provide much needed support.","output":"Navigating the new normal: accessing community and institutionalised care for dementia during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, research institutions across the globe have modified their operations in ways that have limited or eliminated the amount of permissible in-person research interaction.

It was expected that the measure would show acceptable validity and reliability, females would report greater COVID-19 anxiety than males, and the addition of gender would improve a regression model of COVID-19 anxiety. METHOD: Participants were 201 college undergraduates who completed multiple self-report measures and two snack selection tasks. RESULTS: The C-19-I showed a multifactor solution and acceptable psychometric properties. Females scored higher than males and were more likely than males to select a healthy snack after responding to questions about illness and contamination.

The Munich/Augsburg consortium was selected to participate as one of six partner sites with its concept Precision in Mental Health (PriMe): Understanding, predicting, and preventing chronicity. PriMe bundles interdisciplinary research from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU), Technical University of Munich (TUM), University of Augsburg (UniA), Helmholtz Center Munich (HMGU), and Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry (MPIP) and has a focus on schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BPD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). PriMe takes a longitudinal perspective on these three disorders from the at-risk stage to the first-episode, relapsing, and chronic stages. These disorders pose a major health burden because in up to 50% of patients they cause untreatable residual symptoms, which lead to early social and vocational disability, comorbidities, and excess mortality. PriMe aims at reducing mortality on different levels, e.g., reducing death by psychiatric and somatic comorbidities, and will approach this goal by addressing interdisciplinary and cross-sector approaches across the lifespan. PriMe aims to add a precision medicine framework to the DZPG that will propel deeper understanding, more accurate prediction, and personalized prevention to prevent disease chronicity and mortality across mental illnesses. This framework is structured along the translational chain and will be used by PriMe to innovate the preventive and therapeutic management of SZ, BPD, and MDD from rural to urban areas and from patients in early disease stages to patients with long-term disease courses. Research will build on platforms that include one on model systems, one on the identification and validation of predictive markers, one on the development of novel multimodal treatments, one on the regulation and strengthening of the uptake and dissemination of personalized treatments, and finally one on testing of the clinical effectiveness, utility, and scalability of such personalized treatments. In accordance with the translational chain, PriMes expertise includes the ability to integrate understanding of bio-behavioral processes based on innovative models, to translate this knowledge into clinical practice and to promote user participation in mental health research and care.","output":"Concept of the Munich/Augsburg Consortium Precision in Mental Health for the German Center of Mental Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: RT-qPCR is the current recommended laboratory method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 acute infection, several factors such as requirement of special equipment, time consuming, high cost and skilled staff limit the use of these techniques.

The performance of the Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 AG Rapid Test Device for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen was compared to RT-qPCR. RESULTS: 255 nasopharyngeal swabs, including 150 from the emergency department and 105 from primary helthcare centers, were tested. 184 patients were symptomatic (72.1 %). Amongst the 60 positive RT-qPCR samples, 40 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 73.3 %. All the samples detected positive with the rapid antigen test were also positive with RT-qPCR. The median cycle threshold was 23.28 (IQR 18.5-30.16). Patients with less than seven days onset of symptoms showed a higher viral load, and sensitivity for rapid antigen test (86.5 %), compared to those with more days (sensitivity of 53.8 %)(pa?<a?0.004).

Few studies have investigated psychotherapies for reducing the components of suicidality. In this study, we compared the effect of behavioural activation (BA), trial-based cognitive therapy (TBCT) - both added to antidepressant (AD) treatment - and treatment as usual (TAU) in mitigating suicidal ideation in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS A post hoc study was conducted with data from a randomized clinical trial. Secondary analyses compared the treatments using scores from the items that evaluated suicidal ideation with the HAM-D (HAM-D-3) and BDI (BDI-9). A composite measurement was constructed by summing the scores from the two items (HAM-D-3 plus BDI-9). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Seventy-six patients were analysed (BA + AD = 24; TBCT + AD = 26 and TAU = 26). In HAM-D-3, the BA + AD group showed a statistically greater reduction than the TAU group. In BDI-9, the three groups did not show significant differences. In the HAM-D-3 plus BDI-9, TBCT + AD reduced ideations more than the TAU group. There were no differences among the psychotherapies in any of the measures. Sensitivity analyses showed improvement in suicidal ideation in both psychotherapies compared to TAU. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION This is one of the few studies that evaluated the effect of BA and TBCT in lowering suicidal ideation. Adding these therapies to ADs seems to decrease suicidal ideation. We suggest the possible beneficial effects of BA and TBCT in the management of suicidal ideation in patients with recurrent MDD.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, mask wearing has become a common practice outside the home environment. With masks covering nose and mouth regions, the facial cues available to the infant are impoverished. The impact of these changes on development is unknown but is critical to debates around mask mandates in early childhood settings. As infants grow, they increasingly interact with a broader range of familiar and unfamiliar people outside the home; in these settings, mask wearing could possibly influence social development. In order to generate hypotheses about the effects of mask wearing on infant social development, in the present work, we systematically review N = 129 studies selected based on the most recent PRISMA guidelines providing a state-of-the-art framework of behavioral studies investigating face processing in early infancy. We focused on identifying sensitive periods during which being exposed to specific facial features or to the entire face configuration has been found to be important for the development of perceptive and socio-communicative skills. For perceptive skills, infants gradually learn to analyze the eyes or the gaze direction within the context of the entire face configuration. This contributes to identity recognition as well as emotional expression discrimination. For socio-communicative skills, direct gaze and emotional facial expressions are crucial for attention engagement while eye-gaze cuing is important for joint attention. Moreover, attention to the mouth is particularly relevant for speech learning. We discuss possible implications of the exposure to masked faces for developmental needs and functions. Providing groundwork for further research, we encourage the investigation of the consequences of mask wearing for infants perceptive and socio-communicative development, suggesting new directions within the research field.","output":"Face Processing in Early Development: A Systematic Review of Behavioral Studies and Considerations in Times of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThere is uncertainty about the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population of Austria, and about the extent to which antibodies elicited by vaccination or infection wane over time.

MethodsWe conducted a seroepidemiological study between June 2020 and September 2021, enrolling blood donors aged 18-70 years across Tyrol, Austria (participation rate 84.0%). We analysed serum samples for antibodies against spike or nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays.

Seroprevalence increased from 3.4% (95% CI: 2.8-4.2%) in June 2020 to 82.7% (95% CI: 81.4-83.8%) in September 2021, largely due to vaccination. Anti-spike IgG seroprevalence was 99.6% (99.4-99.7%) among fully vaccinated individuals, 90.4% (88.8-91.7%) among unvaccinated with prior infection, and 11.5% (10.8-12.3%) among unvaccinated without known prior infection. Anti-spike IgG levels were reduced by 44.0% (34.9-51.7%) at 5-6 months compared to 0-3 months after infection. In fully vaccinated individuals, they decreased by 31.7% (29.4-33.9%) per month. In multivariable adjusted analyses, both seropositivity among unvaccinated and antibody levels among fully vaccinated individuals were higher at young age (<25 years), higher with a known prior infection, and lower in current smokers.

In the WD-NS reverse evolution the primary star evolves and transfers mass to the secondary star, forms a PN, and leaves a WD remnant. If the mass transfer brings the secondary star to have a mass of>8Mo before it develops a helium core, it explodes as a CCSN and leaves a NS remnant. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) we find that in the reverse evolution the time period from the formation of the PN by the primary star to the explosion of the secondary star is longer than a million years. By that time the PN has long dispersed into the interstellar medium. If we start with two stars that are too close in mass to each other, then the mass transfer takes place after the secondary star has developed a helium core and it ends forming a PN and a WD. The formation of a CCSN inside a PN (so called CCSNIP) requires the presence of a third star, either as a tertiary star in the system or as a nearby member in an open cluster. The third star should be less massive than the secondary star but by no more than few 0.01Mo.

However, researchers have postulated that this relationship is reciprocal, where infection with Covid-19 may trigger new onset diabetes. Data on pediatric new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and Covid-19 remains scarce. Furthermore, the results are conflicting;some studies showed increased rate of new onset T1DM in children with Covid-19 and the others did not find any difference in 2020 compared to previous years. The aim of this study is to elucidate the relationship between pediatric new onset T1DM and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with Covid-19 infection in a single center. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 50 pediatric diabetes cases admitted to the Bronson Children's Hospital between March 2020 and December 2020. Results: From the total of 50 patients, 42 had new onset T1DM. Of these 42, 33 (78.6%) presented with DKA, and 17 (40.5%) met hospital criteria for Covid-19 testing, with 16 of those producing a negative result. There was only 1 (5.9% of tested, 2.4% of T1DM cases) patient with new onset T1DM associated with a positive Covid-19 test. Conclusion: The low number of positive cases identified in this study suggests that there may be no link between Covid-19 viral illness and new onset T1DM in the pediatric population. Major limitations include the single center localization of the study and inability to test all cases for Covid-19 at this facility. Due to the scarcity of test kits and lab personnel especially early during the pandemic, only patients that met symptomatic criteria were tested.

RECENT FINDINGS: As documented in other settings, racial bias appears to operate in HF providers consideration of patients for advanced therapy. Multiple medical and psychosocial elements of the evaluation process are particularly vulnerable to bias. SUMMARY: Reducing gaps in access to advanced therapies will require commitments at multiple levels to reduce barriers to healthcare access, standardize clinical operations, research the determinants of patient success and increase diversity among providers and researchers.

These infants require continuous care in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). Medical parameters are continuously monitored in premature infants in the NICU using a set of wired, sticky electrodes attached to the body. Medical adhesives used on the electrodes can be harmful to the baby, causing skin injuries, discomfort, and irritation. In addition, respiration rate (RR) monitoring in the NICU faces challenges of accuracy and clinical quality because RR is extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG). This research paper presents a design and validation of a smart textile pressure sensor system that addresses the existing challenges of medical monitoring in NICU. We designed two e-textile, piezoresistive pressure sensors made of Velostat for noninvasive RR monitoring; one was hand-stitched on a mattress topper material, and the other was embroidered on a denim fabric using an industrial embroidery machine. We developed a data acquisition system for validation experiments conducted on a high-fidelity, programmable NICU baby mannequin. We designed a signal processing pipeline to convert raw time-series signals into parameters including RR, rise and fall time, and comparison metrics. The results of the experiments showed that the relative accuracies of hand-stitched sensors were 98.68 (top sensor) and 98.07 (bottom sensor), while the accuracies of embroidered sensors were 99.37 (left sensor) and 99.39 (right sensor) for the 60 BrPM test case.

With limited therapeutic options, proning nonintubated patients emerged as a safe and affordable intervention to manage hypoxemia. METHODS: A proning protocol to identify and prone eligible patients was implemented. Patients were encouraged to self-prone for 2-3 hours, 3 times daily. Investigators created educational materials for nurses and patients and developed a COVID-19-specific proning order within the electronic health record (EHR). Investigators completed an 800-person retrospective chart review to study the implementation of this protocol. RESULTS: From March 22, 2020, to June 5, 2020, 586 patients were admitted to the COVID-19 floor. Of these patients, 42.8% were eligible for proning. Common contraindications were lack of hypoxia, altered mental status, and fall risk. The proning protocol led to a significant improvement in provider awareness of patients appropriate for proning, increasing from 12% to 83%, as measured by placement of a proning order into the EHR. There was a significant improvement in all appropriate patients documented as proned, increasing from 18% to 45% of eligible patients.

In spite of this, the expected gains of offshoring can be offset by hidden costs and risks, such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the trade war between the USA and China, and the ongoing trade dispute between Korea and Japan. To obviate such business failure and prevent critical business blunders, offshoring strategies that efficiently consider both risk elements and potential wealth creation are urgently need. The first purpose of this study is to contribute to the development of more advanced offshoring strategies to help host countries select the best locations to manage supply chain risks and create unique value. The second purpose is to specifically analyze the current status of Korea and provide Korean companies with implications to be considered when deciding whether to offshore or re-shore. Design/methodology - A Network DEA model was applied to measure the comparative location efficiency of national competencies for offshoring strategy from perspectives of wealth creation opportunities (profitability and marketability) and supply chain risk management. The location efficiencies are compared among a total 70 countries selected from the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and globally attractive locations outlined by Kearney (2017). For the secondary analysis of efficiency, a t-test examining the nature of competitive advantage and the level of sophistication in production processes was implemented in three divisions. We then analyzed differences in offshoring performance in terms of the identified national traits. Moreover, Tobit regression analysis is conducted to investigate the correlation between value-added business activities and each divisional efficiency, seeking to determine how each degree of value-added business activity influences the increase in offshoring productivity. Findings - Regarding overall location efficiency for offshoring performance, only the USA and Italy were identified as being efficient as host countries for offshoring, under circumstances of advanced development, such as productivity and risk management. Korea ranks 13th among 70 countries. The determinants of national competitiveness depend on national traits (the nature of competitive advantage and business sophistication). Countries with labor/resource advantages and labor-intensive industries are more competitive in terms of marketability than others. In contrast, countries with strong technology-intensive industries benefit offshoring companies, particularly in the technology sector, with the added advantage of supply chain risk management. As the perception of a value chain is broader in a country, it can achieve both production sophistication and competitive advantages such as marketability and SCRM. Originality/value - Existing studies focus on offshoring effectiveness from a company perspective. This paper contributes to comparing country efficiency in producing core competencies related to an offshoring strategy and also segments countries into three performance-based considerations associated with the global offshoring market. It also details Korea's position as an offshoring location according to national efficiency and competency.","output":"Location Efficiencies of Host Countries for Strategic Offshoring Decisions Amid Wealth Creation Opportunities and Supply Chain Risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess influenza vaccine uptake during the 2020/2021 flu season and compare it with that of the 2019/2020 flu season among respondents to the second phase of the web-based EPICOVID-19 survey, we performed an observational web-based nationwide online survey (JanuaryCFebruary 2021) in which respondents to the first survey (AprilCJune 2020) were contacted and asked to complete a second questionnaire.

Organizational empowerment practices in hospitals likely shape the psychological experiences of empowerment among these personnel; however, little is known about this relationship. OBJECTIVE: We used qualitative inquiry to explore the relationship between organizational empowerment structural components and feelings of psychological empowerment among hospital frontline workers during a public health emergency. METHODS: Kanters Theory of Structural Empowerment and Spreitzers Psychological Empowerment in the Workplace Framework were applied to identify the conceptual influences of organizational practices on psychological experiences of empowerment. In-depth interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of NAs, caring for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Directed content analysis was performed to generate a data matrix consisting of the psychological experiences of meaning, competence, self-determination, and impact embedded under the organizational structural components of information, resources, support, and opportunity. RESULTS: Thirteen NAs (mean age = 42 years, 92% female) completed interviews. Information, or lack thereof, provided to the NAs influenced feelings of fear, preparation, and autonomy. Resources (e.g., protocols, equipment, and person-power) made it easier to cope with overwhelming emotions, affected the NAs abilities to do their jobs, and when limited, drove NAs to take on new roles. NAs noted that support was mostly provided by nurses and made the NAs feel appreciated, desiring to contribute more. While NAs felt they could consult leadership when needed, several felt leadership showed little appreciation for their roles and contributions. Similar to support, the opportunity to take care of COVID-19 patients yielded a diverse array of emotions, exposed advances and gaps in NA preparation, and challenged NAs to autonomously develop new care practices and processes. CONCLUSION: Management and empowerment of healthcare workers are critical to hospital performance and success. We found many ways in which the NAs psychological experiences of empowerment were shaped by the healthcare systems empowerment-related structural conditions during a public health emergency.

The trial enrolled 941 participants who were hospitalized for 3 or less days or presented 7 or less days after symptom onset and required noninvasive oxygen supplementation. INTERVENTIONS: A unit of approximately 250 mL of CCP or equivalent volume of placebo (normal saline). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was participant scores on the 11-point World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement on day 14 after randomization; the secondary outcome was WHO scores determined on day 28. Subgroups were analyzed with respect to age, baseline WHO score, concomitant medications, symptom duration, CCP SARS-CoV-2 titer, baseline SARS-CoV-2 serostatus, and enrollment quarter. Outcomes were analyzed using a bayesian proportional cumulative odds model. Efficacy of CCP was defined as a cumulative adjusted odds ratio (cOR) less than 1 and a clinically meaningful effect as cOR less than 0.8. RESULTS: Of 941 participants randomized (473 to placebo and 468 to CCP), 556 were men (59.1%); median age was 63 years (IQR, 52-73); 373 (39.6%) were Hispanic and 132 (14.0%) were non-Hispanic Black. The cOR for the primary outcome adjusted for site, baseline risk, WHO score, age, sex, and symptom duration was 0.94 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.75-1.18) with posterior probability (P[cOR<1] = 72%); the cOR for the secondary adjusted outcome was 0.92 (95% CrI, 0.74-1.16; P[cOR<1] = 76%). Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested heterogeneity of treatment effect: at day 28, cORs were 0.72 (95% CrI, 0.46-1.13; P[cOR<1] = 93%) for participants enrolled in April-June 2020 and 0.65 (95% CrI, 0.41 to 1.02; P[cOR<1] = 97%) for those not receiving remdesivir and not receiving corticosteroids at randomization. Median CCP SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer used in April to June 2020 was 1:175 (IQR, 76-379). Any adverse events (excluding transfusion reactions) were reported for 39 (8.2%) placebo recipients and 44 (9.4%) CCP recipients (P = .57). Transfusion reactions occurred in 2 (0.4) placebo recipients and 8 (1.7) CCP recipients (P = .06). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this trial, CCP did not meet the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes for CCP efficacy. However, high-titer CCP may have benefited participants early in the pandemic when remdesivir and corticosteroids were not in use.

METHODS: The effect of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 on ROS and cytokine generation in macrophages was assessed by treating RAW 264.7 cells with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 heat inactivated virus (0\\\\20 million viral particles) or recombinant proteins for 24 hours. 2,7\\\\Dichlorodihydrofluorescein (2,7\\\\DCF) fluorescence analysis was utilized to quantify ROS generation within the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. Cell culture medium was sampled to quantify the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) using enzyme\\\\linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To assess the effects of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 on mitochondrial function, cells were treated with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 heat inactivated virus (0\\\\20 million viral particles) for 24 hrs. Mitochondria\\\\derived superoxide was measured using the MitoSOX? red mitochondrial superoxide indicator. RESULTS: Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with inactivated SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 viral particles or recombinant proteins stimulated ROS production. Mitochondria\\\\derived superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production were increased in response to inactivated SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 viral particles and recombinant protein exposure. The increased ROS generation is linked to macrophage activation induced by SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 exposures. Along with the ROS generation, increased TNF production was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that both SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 viral proteins and heat\\\\inactivated viral particle exposures cause significant generation of ROS and cytokines by RAW 264.7 cells. ROS generation and the subsequent cytokine release apparently play a significant role in the pathogenesis associated with the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 viral infection. The imbalanced cellular defense system against oxidative stress commonly associated with aging could explain the increased occurrence of more severe SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 illness in seniors and in patients with underlying health conditions. Based on the results from this study, we propose that antioxidants such as N\\\\acetyl\\\\L\\\\cysteine, resveratrol, or Vitamin E in combination with anti\\\\inflammatory drug could be used to control excess ROS and cytokines in patients with severe COVID\\\\19.","output":"Exposures to Heat\\\\Inactivated SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 Causes Reactive Oxygen Species Generation And Inflammatory Response in RAW 264.7 Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hiccups are involuntary diaphragmatic muscle contractions with early glottis closure terminating inspiration. They are classified into two types: acute (<48 hours) and persistent (>48 hours). COVID-19 is the defining health crisis of our generation. Although there are common symptoms of the disease (e.g. fever, cough), several atypical presentations have appeared as the pandemic has evolved. Here, we present a patient with COVID-19 presenting with fever, sore throat, and persistent hiccups. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 48-year-old man presented to the hospital with a seven-day history of persistent hiccups, fever, and sore throat. Physical examination was unremarkable and abdominal ultrasound showed gaseous abdominal distension. Laboratory values were remarkable for elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral subpleural areas of ground-glass attenuation and crazy-paving pattern. A COVID-19 test was positive, and hydroxychloroquine, oseltamivir, baclofen, and symptomatic treatment were initiated. The hiccups improved, and the patient was discharged home after ten days.

AIMS: The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize empirical evidence to understand fear of COVID-19 and its associations with mental health-related problems during this pandemic period. METHOD: Relevant studies were searched for on five databases (Scopus, ProQuest, EMBASE, PubMed Central, and ISI Web of Knowledge), using relevant terms (COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, depression, mental health-related factors, mental well-being and sleep problems). All studies were included for analyses irrespective of their methodological quality, and the impact of quality on pooled effect size was examined by subgroup analysis. RESULTS: The meta-analysis pooled data from 91 studies comprising 88 320 participants (mean age 38.88 years; 60.66% females) from 36 countries. The pooled estimated mean of fear of COVID-19 was 13.11 (out of 35), using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale.

Methods: Cross-sectional analytical and multicentre study, based on a virtual survey sent to Peruvian health personnel (from the 25 Peruvian regions) working during the COVID-19 pandemic. The three dependent variables (depression, anxiety, and stress) were measured with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 (DASS-21) (Cronbach's Alpha: 0.93) and compared with sociodemographic and occupational variables. P-values were obtained through generalized linear models, adjusted for each location where the survey was sent. Results: Of the 550 participants, 2%, 13%, and 3% of them had severe or very severe depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, we observed that professionals with a greater number of children had a lower frequency of severe depression (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR): 0.37;95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-0.79;p = 0.010). In addition, physicians had a lower frequency of severe anxiety (aPR: 0.37;95% CI: 0.18-0.75;p = 0.036), and professionals who lived in the Central region (aPR: 0.50;95% CI: 0.25-0.97;p = 0.042) and in the South of the country (aPR: 0.37;95% CI: 0.19-0.71;p = 0.003) had lower anxiety levels compared to those in the Northern region. With regard to severe stress, those who lived in the Central (aPR: 0.15;95% CI: 0.03-0.75;p = 0.021) and South regions (aPR: 0.19;95% CI: 0.04-0.79;p = 0.011) had lower stress levels.

This modelling combines knowledge about infectious disease dynamics with the subjective opinion of the researcher who develops and refines the model and often also adjusts model outputs. Developing a forecast model is difficult, resource- and time-consuming. It is therefore worth asking what modelling is able to add beyond the subjective opinion of the researcher alone. To investigate this, we analysed different real-time forecasts of cases of and deaths from COVID-19 in Germany and Poland over a 1-4 week horizon submitted to the German and Polish Forecast Hub. We compared crowd forecasts elicited from researchers and volunteers, against a) forecasts from two semi-mechanistic models based on common epidemiological assumptions and b) the ensemble of all other models submitted to the Forecast Hub. We found crowd forecasts, despite being overconfident, to outperform all other methods across all forecast horizons when forecasting cases (weighted interval score relative to the Hub ensemble 2 weeks ahead: 0.89).

Aim This study aims to assess the attitude and practices of parents toward their children's oral health care during COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology The present cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 120 parents selected randomly from the outpatient department after obtaining informed consent. A structured questionnaire was used to assess attitude and practice of parents toward their child's oral hygiene during lockdown in COVID-19 pandemic. Results The overall attitude and practice score of parents in maintaining their child's oral hygiene was low, with mean value of 2.36  1.36 and 2.51  1.50, respectively. 60.8% of parents reported the need of dental treatment for their child during the lockdown period whereas 50.8% parents contacted the dentist during this period; majority (37.5%) of which reported due to toothache. 68.3% of parents would like to visit nearby dental hospital for emergencies during lockdown period. Only 33.3% of parents took extra efforts to maintain their child's oral hygiene while 45% made dietary changes in their child's diet to prevent tooth decay. Conclusion The overall attitude and practices of the parents were poor toward the oral health of their children during the lockdown period in COVID-19 pandemic. There is urgent need of increasing awareness among parents regarding the importance of maintaining their child's oral health. The inability to see the doctor should at least encourage better home practice measures for future.

Respiratory status of the patients was assessed using pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, procedural airway complications, and oxygen therapy adjustments. The endoscopist assessed the ease of performing EUS at the end of the procedure and patient satisfaction score (PSS) was assessed by using a Likert score in the post-anesthesia care unit. Results SpO2 measurements in the HFNC group during the procedure were marginally better compared to the NC group but this failed to reach statistical significance.

Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a high degree of genetic similarity and bind to the same host cell ACE2 receptor. Based on previous experience with SARS-CoV vaccines, it is expected that all COVID-19 vaccines will require careful safety evaluations for immunopotentiation that could lead to increased infectivity or eosinophilic infiltration. Besides this, a COVID-19 vaccine target product profile must address vaccinating at-risk human populations including frontline healthcare workers, individuals over the age of 60, and those with underlying and debilitating chronic conditions. Among the vaccine technologies under evaluation are whole virus vaccines, recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines.

COVID-19 disease severity, while highly variable, is typically lower in pediatric patients than adults (particularly the elderly), but increased rates of hospitalizations requiring intensive care are observed in infants than in older children. The reasons for these differences are unknown. To detect potential age-based correlates of disease severity, we measured ACE2 protein expression at the single cell level in human lung tissue specimens from over 100 donors from ~4 months to 75 years of age. We found that expression of ACE2 in distal lung epithelial cells generally increases with advancing age but exhibits extreme intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity. Notably, we also detected ACE2 expression on neonatal airway epithelial cells and within the lung parenchyma. Similar patterns were found at the transcript level: ACE2 mRNA is expressed in the lung and trachea shortly after birth, downregulated during childhood, and again expressed at high levels in late adulthood in alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, we find that apoptosis, which is a natural host defense system against viral infection, is also dynamically regulated during lung maturation, resulting in periods of heightened apoptotic priming and dependence on pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins including MCL-1. Infection of human lung cells with SARS-CoV-2 triggers an unfolded protein stress response and upregulation of the endogenous MCL-1 inhibitor Noxa; in juveniles, MCL-1 inhibition is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in lung epithelial cells C this may limit virion production and inflammatory signaling. Overall, we identify strong and distinct correlates of COVID-19 disease severity across lifespan and advance our understanding of the regulation of ACE2 and cell death programs in the mammalian lung. Furthermore, our work provides the framework for potential translation of apoptosis modulating drugs as novel treatments for COVID-19.","output":"Age-dependent regulation of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry genes and cell death programs correlates with COVID-19 disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine had a significant impact on mental health which resulted in an increase of anxiety and depression in adult, child and adolescent clinical populations. Less is known about the potential effect of pandemic on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) so there is a lack of review work to illustrate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on OCD. Purpose: The main objective is to review all the empirical contributions published after March 2020 that dealt with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on OCD in adults, children and adolescents, investigating the state-of-the-art literature concerning the impact on OCD and detailing limitations. Methods: The literature search was conducted using PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. This review analyzed all studies from January 2020 to 8 January 2021, focusing on clinical populations of children, adolescents, and adults with OCD. Results: A total of 102 articles were screened, resulting in the identification of 64 full-text articles to be further scrutinized. Upon closer examination, there was consensus that 39 articles met the study inclusion criteria and 14 of these were selected for study. Analysis of the results revealed that COVID-19 had an impact on OCD in both adults and young people and seems to have caused exacerbation of symptoms, especially of the contamination/washing subtypes. Eight studies in adult samples showed an increase in the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms; two studies underlined a minimal impact of COVID-19 on OCD patients and one study showed a slight improvement in symptoms. Two out of three studies on children and adolescents showed an exacerbation of OCD and a worsening even in the presence of an ongoing treatment. Conclusions: The studies reviewed are few. There are more studies on adult OCD than on children and adolescents. The results are controversial: few studies examined OCD subtypes; in most studies the typology of treatment was not clear and the samples covered a wide age range; a large number of studies did not use the same monitoring period or quantitative measures, both of which make it difficult to compare or rely on the results.","output":"Narrative Review of COVID-19 Impact on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in Child, Adolescent and Adult Clinical Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The notion of \\"immune privilege\\" of the brain has been revised to accommodate its infiltration, at steady state, by immune cells that participate in normal neurophysiology.

To make an object of interest stand out independently from a number of distractors, the underlying visual cue, e.g., color, has to be preattentive. In our prior work, we introduced Deadeye as an instantly recognizable highlighting technique that works by rendering the target object for one eye only. In contrast to prior approaches, Deadeye excels by not modifying any visual properties of the target. However, in the case of 2D visualizations, the method requires an additional setup to allow dichoptic presentation, which is a considerable drawback. As a follow-up to requests from the community, this paper explores Deadeye as a highlighting technique for 3D visualizations, because such stereoscopic scenarios support dichoptic presentation out of the box. Deadeye suppresses binocular disparities for the target object, so we cannot assume the applicability of our technique as a given fact. With this motivation, the paper presents quantitative evaluations of Deadeye in VR, including configurations with multiple heterogeneous distractors as an important robustness challenge. After confirming the preserved preattentiveness (all average accuracies above 90 %) under such real-world conditions, we explore VR volume rendering as an example application scenario for Deadeye.

Twenty-five patients were recruited; patients with bilateral edema (n = 12) wore the ELS on one limb, and the ETB on the other. Patients with unilateral edema (n = 13) were randomized to wear either the ELS or ETB. Edema measurements, leg pain, and patient preference were recorded. RESULTS: There were 14 females (56%) and 11 males (44%); mean age was 66 years (range, 32-88 years); and mean body mass index was 40.4 kg/m(2) (range, 26.1C66.9 kg/m(2)). Patients with bilateral edema wearing ELS had a foot-to-leg circumference between 25.5 and 42.9 cm pre-ELS that remained essentially unchanged at 2 weeks. The five patients with unilateral edema using ELS had a 24.3C to 43.7-cm circumference pre-ELS and 24.2- to 42.6-cm range at 2 weeks. The patients with bilateral edema using ETBs had a foot-to-leg circumference of 25.5 to 43.7 cm before treatment, unchanged 2 weeks later. The eight patients with unilateral edema using ETB had a 25.4- to 45.3-cm circumference pre-ETB and 24.8C to 42.0-cm range post-ETB. Mean pain levels decreased from 1.0 at week 0 to 0.5 at week 2. More patients preferred ELS (17/23, 78.3%) over ETB (5/23, 21.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Both systems were easy to apply and provided low compression without increased pain.

The objective of this article is to estimate the influence of the hospital care system on lethality in metropolitan France during the inception of the COVID-19 epidemic, by analyzing the spatial variability of the hospital case-fatality rate (CFR) between French districts. In theory, the hospital age-standardized CFR should not display significant differences between districts, since hospital lethality depends on the virulence of the pathogen (the SARS-CoV-2 virus), the vulnerability of the population (mainly age-related), the healthcare system quality, and cases and deaths definition and the recording accuracy. We analyzed hospital data on COVID-19 hospitalizations, severity (admission to intensive care units for reanimation or endotracheal intubation) and mortality, from March 19 to May 8 corresponding to the first French lockdown. All rates were age-standardized to eliminate differences in districts age structure. The results show that the higher case-fatality rates observed by districts are mostly related to the level of morbidity. Time analysis shows that the case-fatality rate has decreased over time, globally and in almost all districts, showing an improvement in the management of severe patients during the epidemic. In conclusion, it appears that during the first critical phase of COVID-19 ramping epidemic in metropolitan France, the higher case-fatality rates were generally related to the higher level of hospitalization, then potentially related to the overload of healthcare system. Also, low hospitalization with high case-fatality rates were mostly found in districts with low population density, and could due to some limitation of the local healthcare access. However, the magnitude of this increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average case-fatality rate, and this variation is small compared to much greater variation across countries reported in the literature.","output":"COVID-19: Spatial analysis of hospital case-fatality rate in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 in the United States. It has been associated with high mortality and morbidity all over the world. COVID-19 can cause a significant inflammatory response leading to coagulopathy and this hypercoagulable state has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in these patients. The published data regarding the presence of lupus anticoagulant in critically ill COVID-19-positive patients is limited and indicates varying conclusions so far. CASE REPORT Here, we present a case of a 31-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia, complicated with superadded bacterial empyema and required video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with decortication. This patient also had prolonged prothrombin time on preoperative labs, which was not corrected with mixing study. Further workup detected positive lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin IgM along with alteration in other coagulation factor levels. The patient was treated with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K before surgical intervention. He had an uneventful surgical course. He received prophylactic-dose low molecular weight heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and did not experience any thrombotic events while hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 infection creates a prothrombotic state in affected patients. The formation of micro-thrombotic emboli results in significantly increased mortality and morbidity. Routine anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin can prevent thrombotic events and thus can improve patient outcomes. In patients with elevated prothrombin time, lupus anticoagulant/anti-cardiolipin antibody-positivity should be suspected, and anticoagulation prophylaxis should be continued perioperatively for better outcomes.","output":"A 31-Year-Old Man with COVID-19-Associated Empyema and Lupus Anticoagulant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To quantify the microvasculature density of the optic nerve head (ONH) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis.in patients recovered from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Methods: In a comparative cross-sectional, observational study patients recovered from COVID-19, whom diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal sample were included in this study.

Two improved indices were more suitable in China, and they displayed similar characteristics: most of the air stagnant days were found in winter, and seasonal distributions showed substantial regional heterogeneity. During stagnation events, flat west or northwest winds at 500 hPa and high pressure at surface dominated, with high relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T), weak winds in most regions. The pollutants concentrations on stagnant days were higher than those on non-stagnant days in most studied areas, with the largest difference of the 90th percentiles of maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 up to 62.2 g m-3 in Pearl River Delta (PRD) and PM2.5 up to 95.8 g m-3 in North China Plain (NCP). During the evolution of stagnation events, the MDA8 O3 concentrations showed a significant increase (6.0 g m-3 day-1) in PRD and a slight rise in other regions; the PM2.5 concentrations and the frequency of extreme PM2.5 days increased, especially in NCP.

Cloud services have been affected in terms of latency and QoS due to the high streams of data produced by many Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart machines, and other computing devices joining the network, which in turn affects network capabilities. Content delivery networks (CDNs) previously provided a partial solution for content retrieval, availability, and resource download time. CDNs rely on the geographic distribution of cloud servers to provide better content reachability. CDNs are perceived as a network layer near cloud data centers. Recently, CDNs began to perceive the same degradations of QoS due to the same factors.

To further enhance immunogenicity, AKS-452 was evaluated in formulations containing a panel of adjuvants in which the water-in-oil adjuvant, Montanide? ISA 720, enhanced neutralizing IgG titers by approximately 7-fold after one and two doses in mice, including the neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of VERO-E6 cells. Furthermore, ISA 720-adjuvanted AKS-452 was immunogenic in rabbits and non-human primates (NHPs) and protected from infection and clinical symptoms with live SARS-CoV-2 virus in NHPs (USA-WA1/2020 viral strain) and the K18 human ACE2-trangenic (K18-huACE2-Tg) mouse (South African B.1.351 viral variant). These preclinical studies support the initiation of Phase I clinical studies with adjuvanted AKS-452 with the expectation that this room-temperature stable, Fc-fusion subunit vaccine can be rapidly and inexpensively manufactured to provide billions of doses per year especially in regions where the cold-chain is difficult to maintain.","output":"Development of an IgG-Fc fusion COVID-19 subunit vaccine, AKS-452"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as an emergency public health concern has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths in the world. Identifying predictors of death in COVID-19 patients is a key to improving survival and helping patients triage, better management, and assist physicians and health care. The present study was conducted on 512 positive COVID-19 patients confirmed by real-time PCR hospitalized in Sina Hospital, Hamadan, in 2020. The data of demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, chest examination, and disease outcome were collected. The logistic regression model was performed to explore the predictors of in-hospital mortality. Among 512 patients, 57 (11.1%) deaths have occurred. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) estimate of death in COVID-19 for patients with age more than 60 years versus those lower than 60 years was 3.15 (95% CI: 1.06, 9.37). The adjusted OR estimate of death in patients with hypertension comorbidity versus those with no comorbidity was 3.84 (95% CI: 1.27, 11.59). In addition, the adjusted OR estimate (95% CI) of death in patients with respiratory rate above 30 per minute, BUN >20 mg/dL, LDH >942 U/L and SGOT >45 U/L against lower than those values was respectively 10.72 (1.99, 57.68), 5.85 (2.19, 15.63), 13.42 (2.17, 83.22) and 2.86 (1.02, 8.05). The risk of death was higher among the patients with multiple comorbidity diseases, systolic BP lower than 90 mmHg, SPO2 lower than 88 and more than ten days hospitalization in comparison with COVID-19 patients with no comorbidity disease (P=0.002), systolic BP higher than 90 mmHg (P=0.002), SPO2 higher than 88 (P<0.001) and hospitalization for lower than ten days (P=0.012). Our findings suggest that older age, pre-existing hypertension and/or multiple co-morbidities, high respiratory rate, elevated BUN, LDH and SGOT, low systolic BP, and hypoxemia were independently associated with in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. These results can be helpful for physicians and health care workers to improve clinical management and appropriate medical care of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Demographic and clinical features association with mortality in patients with covid-19: A cross-sectional study in the west of Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mathematical approaches have been for decades used to probe the structure of DNA sequences. This has led to the development of Bioinformatics. In this exploratory work, a novel mathematical method is applied to probe the DNA structure of two related viral families: those of coronaviruses and those of influenza viruses. The coronaviruses are SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS. The influenza viruses include H1N1-1918, H1N1-2009, H2N2-1957, and H3N2-1968. METHODS: The mathematical method used is the slow feature analysis (SFA), a rather new but promising method to delineate complex structure in DNA sequences. RESULTS: The analysis indicates that the DNA sequences exhibit an elaborate and convoluted structure akin to complex networks. We define a measure of complexity and show that each DNA sequence exhibits a certain degree of complexity within itself, while at the same time there exists complex inter-relationships between the sequences within a family and between the two families. From these relationships, we find evidence, especially for the coronavirus family, that increasing complexity in a sequence is associated with higher transmission rate but with lower mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity measure defined here may hold a promise and could become a useful tool in the prediction of transmission and mortality rates in future new viral strains.

To prevent overspill of transmission to the wider population, starting in early April 2020, residents were confined to their dormitories while measures were put in place to arrest the spread of infection. This descriptive study presents epidemiological data for a population of more than 60 000 migrant workers living in two barracks-style and four apartment-style dormitories located in western Singapore from April 3 to June 10, 2020. METHODS: Our report draws from data obtained over the first 50 days of outbreak management in order to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission in high-density housing environments. Cumulative counts of SARS-CoV-2 cases and numbers of housing units affected were analyzed to report the harmonic means of harmonic means of doubling times and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Multiple transmission peaks were identified involving at least 5467 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection across six dormitories. Our geospatial heat maps gave an early indication of outbreak severity in affected buildings. We found that the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection doubled every 1.56 days (95% CI 1.29C1.96) in barracks-style buildings. The corresponding doubling time for apartment-style buildings was 2.65 days (95% CI 2.01C3.87).

However, scarce information is available on the potential oxidative stress damage caused at low concentrations typically used for disinfection. We aimed to assess whether exposure to sodium hypochlorite during the COVID-19 pandemic causes oxidative stress damage in workers engaged in disinfection tasks. 75 operators engaged in the disinfection of public places were recruited as the case group, and 60 individuals who were not exposed to disinfectant were chosen as the control group. Spot urine samples were collected before (BE) and after exposure (AE) to disinfectants in the case group. Likewise, controls provided two spot urine samples in the same way as the case group. Urinary malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were quantified by forming thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in the urine. In addition, the concentration of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the urine was determined using an ELISA kit. Results showed significant differences in the urinary levels of oxidative stress markers, where median 8-OHdG (AE case: 3.84  2.89 g/g creatinine vs AE control 2.54  1.21 g/g creatinine) and MDA (AE case: 169  89 g/g creatinine vs AE control 121  47 g/g creatinine) levels in case group AE samples were 1.55 and 1.35-times higher than the control group AE samples (P < 0.05), respectively.

PBL commonly presents at extranodal sites and carries a poor prognosis with a global overall survival of 9-15 months after initial diagnosis. Despite poor prognosis for patients with PBL, therapeutic strategies to target this disease are limited, as CHOP-like regimens have failed to produce durable remission, and no standard of care has been established. The cell of origin for PBL is believed to be the plasmablast, as PBL cells possess immunoblastic morphology and contain an immunohistochemical profile positive for plasmablast markers, such as CD38, CD138, and MUM1/IRF4, and negative for B cell markers, such as CD20, CD19, and PAX5. The similarities between PBL cells and multiple myeloma (MM) cells, a plasma cell neoplasm, have led to investigations of the efficacy of MM therapeutics for the treatment of PBL. Daratumumab is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody directed against CD38 that has shown efficacy in treating relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed MM. Here, we describe the treatment of four patients with advanced-stage PBL in the context of varying degrees of immunosuppression using combination treatment with daratumumab and EPOCH. Methods:Four consecutive patients were treated with daratumumab plus chemotherapy. Three of the four patients were treated in the frontline setting and received low-dose EPOCH (vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide daily for 4 days;cyclophosphamide day 5) with 16mg/kg daratumumab dosed on days 1 and 8 for 6 cycles. Patient #4 showed partial CD20 positivity, prompting Rituximab co-administration (R-EPOCH). Patient #3 was treated in the relapsed setting with 16mg/kg daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin. She was treated for 12 months. Responses were followed by PET/CT imaging. Results:The four consecutive patients (2 female, 2 male) ranged in age from 26-88 and all had advanced-stage PBL (Table 1). Three of the four patients had some degree of immunosuppression (Patient #1- post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), Patient #2- HIV/AIDS, Patient #3- Chron's disease, Patient #4- no history of immunosuppression). All patients had a Ki67 proliferation index over 70% and demonstrated extranodal involvement of disease (bone n=3, intestine n=2, liver n=2;kidney n=1;adrenal n=1). The three patients that received daratumumab in combination with EPOCH demonstrated a complete response at their first disease assessment by PET/CT scan after cycle 2 (Patient #1) or cycle 4 (Patients #2,4) (Fig1). Patient #3, who demonstrated a mixed response to previous therapy, achieved a complete response 5 months after starting treatment with daratumumab in combination with chemotherapy. As of July 2021, three of the four patients continued to have no evidence of disease for a median of 17 months (range 15-19 months). Patient #4 relapsed in July 2021, 3 months after demonstrating a complete response. Adverse events that required hospitalization were rarely noted following daratumumab treatment but included neutropenic fever (n=2, one event following treatment cycle 4 and the other event 2 months after completion of daratumumab administration), COVID-19 infection (n=1), and a PICC line-associated thrombus (n=1). Minor events were also noted and included self-limiting bradycardia (n=1), neuropathy (n=1), and rigor (n=1). Conclusions:We describe four patients with varying degrees of immunosuppression and HIV-status with aggressive-stage PBL that achieved complete response following treatment with daratumumab in combination with low-dose EPOCH or other chemotherapy. Three of four patients obtained durable responses. At the time of this writing, three additional HIV +patients have initiated treatment with daratumumab but have not yet reached their first disease assessment. Disease progression for these patients will be monitored and presented as part of this study. Our findings suggest a potential efficacy and warrant further investigation of using daratumumab for the treatment of HIV +and HIV - PBLs.

However, Zimbabwe has not witnessed the exponential growth witnessed in other countries so far, and the trajectory seems different. We set out to describe the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe from when the first case was confirmed to June 2020. METHODS: data were collected from daily situation reports that were published by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Care from 20(th) March to 27(th) June 2020. Missing data on the daily situation reports was not imputed. RESULTS: as of 27(th) June 2020, Zimbabwe had 567 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Eighty-two percent of these were returning residents and 18% were local transmission. The testing was heavily skewed towards returnees despite a comprehensive testing strategy. Of the confirmed cases, 142 were reported as recovered. However, demographic data for the cases were missing from the reports. It was not possible to estimate the probable period of infection of an active case, and case fatality in Zimbabwe was about 1% for the first 4 months of the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate how telehealth was used in a metropolitan outpatient pharmacy setting before and after the start of the COVID-19 restrictions and the various influences on the uptake of phone and video modalities. METHODS: A multi-methods approach was used including: (1) quantifying administrative activity data between July 2019 to December 2020 and, (2) semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (n = 34). RESULTS: Activity data: Between July 2019 to December 2020 16,377 outpatient pharmacy consults were provided. Of these, 13,543 (83%) were provided in-person, 2,608 (16%) by telephone and 226 (1.4%) by video consult. COVID-19 impacted how these services were provided with telephone activity more than four-times higher in April 2020 than March 2020 and slight increases in video consults. Pharmacists have heavily favoured using the telephone despite the recommendation that video consults be used as the primary mode of contact and that telephone only be used when video consult was not possible. As soon as COVID-19 restrictions eased, clinicians gradually returned to in-person appointments, maintaining some use of telephone and very limited use of video consult. Semi-structured interviews: Whilst clinicians recognised the potential benefits of video consults, challenges to routine use included the additional administrative and planning work required pre-consult, perceptions that patients were unable to use the technology, and the belief that in-person care was better and that the telephone was easier. CONCLUSION: Organisational strategies that encouraged the use of video over telephone (e.g. through financial incentives) did not appear to influence clinicians choice of care modality.

Using the finite window of time created by an autonomous vehicle, a theoretical framework is put forward that seeks to show how contrasting narratives exist regarding the experience of the window of time within the autonomous vehicle. By taking a theoretical approach informed by social theory, the dissolution of barriers between separate spheres of life is explored to highlight the increased commodification of time. In focusing on both the space and time created by the autonomous vehicle this approach seeks to highlight how artificial intelligence can provide a contemporary space in the urban environment while also opening a new window of time. The cognitive dissonance observed when comparing the narratives of autonomous vehicle stakeholders and the historical shift in time use leads to a belief that technology makes the user more free in terms of time.

We identified a clear resurgence and expansion of social robots during the crisis. The social robots' capacity to perform the roles of liaison in tasks that require human-human interaction, to act as a safeguard to ensure contagion risk-free environments, and to act as well-being coaches by providing therapeutic and entertaining functions for quarantined patients, which are directly associated with the needs of facilitating physical distance and palliate the effects of isolation, have been key to the renaissance of these robots during the pandemic.","output":"The implementation of social robots during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Neck dissection results in a high probability of postoperative shoulder functional impairment, even when the spinal accessory nerve is preserved. Therefore, surgeons must inform patients about the expected functional and qualitative recovery of shoulder function after surgery. METHODS The present study included a prospective cohort of 66 patients (85 neck dissection sides) who underwent neck dissection between December 2015 and July 2017 at a single institution. The active shoulder abduction angles of the affected side and the patient-reported shoulder-specific quality-of-life recovery score of the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) questionnaire were examined at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively. Additionally, the association between these outcomes and risk factors for shoulder impairment were investigated. RESULTS The average active shoulder abduction angles were significantly improved at 3 and 6 months postoperatively compared with 1 month postoperatively (96.5  4.3 at 1 month versus 110.1  4.7 at 3 months, p = 0.035, and versus 142.0  4.6 at 6 months, p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients who were unable to abduct their shoulders by 150 or more was significantly lower at 6 months postoperatively (41.5%) compared with 1 month postoperatively (82.4%, p < 0.0001). The WORC score significantly improved from 60.4  2.4% at 1 month postoperatively to 67.9  2.6% at 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.036). Multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative radiotherapy was a significant risk factor for shoulder impairment at 3 and 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027, respectively), and that level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were significant risk factors for a worse shoulder outcome at 6 and 9 months postoperatively (respective p values for level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were p = 0.049 and p = 0.030 at 6 months postoperatively, and p = 0.016 and p = 0.013 at 9 months postoperatively). CONCLUSION Satisfactory functional and qualitative recovery of shoulder function was achieved at 6 months after neck dissection. Postoperative radiotherapy was a predictor of poor shoulder function in the early postoperative period; both level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were predictors of poor shoulder function at 6 and 9 months after neck dissection.","output":"Shoulder function after neck dissection: Assessment via a shoulder-specific quality-of-life questionnaire and active shoulder abduction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Numerous factors have been associated with the number of lymph nodes retrieved during laparoscopic colectomy. This study compared the impact of vascular pedicle ligation method on the number of retrieved lymph nodes in patients undergoing laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for cancer. Mesenteric root dissection with individualized vessel ligation was compared to en bloc vascular root stapling. METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from a database of patients' charts including operative and pathological reports. All patients that underwent laparoscopic colectomy in a single department were identified. Patients that underwent elective laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for cancer were further evaluated. The impact of the method used for ileo-colic vascular transection, age, gender, nodes status, T stage, BMI and the operating surgeon on the number of retrieved lymph nodes was studied. RESULTS Among 239 laparoscopic colectomies, 75 patients underwent elective laparoscopic right colectomy for cancer. Ileo-colic vascular transection was routinely performed at the level of the inferior border of the pancreas. In total, 34 patients underwent ileo-colic vascular root dissection with individualized vessel ligation and 41 underwent vascular root stapling. No difference was found in the mean number of retrieved lymph nodes between pedicle dissection and vascular root stapling (18.7  5.9 vs. 19.6  7.9, P = 0.396), and in the rate of patients who had 12 nodes or more (97.1 vs. 92.7 %, P = 0.401). BMI above 30 was associated with decreased number of retrieved nodes (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS No difference was found in the number of retrieved lymph nodes between ileo-colic vascular root dissection with individual vessel ligation and vascular root stapling in patients undergoing laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for cancer. High BMI was associated with decreased number of retrieved nodes in both groups. A standard approach regarding the level of mesenteric root transection, regardless of the ligation approach, leads to adequate lymph node harvesting by different surgeons.","output":"Mesenteric root dissection with individualized ileo-colic vessel ligation versus mesenteric pedicle stapling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Passenger predicting is an integral component of advanced, automated, and innovative railway transit operations and management.

The gel strength, hardness, gelling (T(g)) and melting (T(m)) temperatures, gelation rate (k(gel)), and water mobility of gelatin decreased with increasing amounts of HCQ. The addition of HCQ led to hydrogen bonding that interfered with triple helix formation in gelatin. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis further confirmed that the interaction between HCQ and gelatin is primarily through hydrogen bonding. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that higher content of HCQ resulted in more and larger aggregates in gelatin.

Here we aimed at analysing the role of CD81 in Herpes simplex virus 1 infectivity using a neuroblastoma cell model. For this purpose, we generated a CD81 KO cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Despite being CD81 a plasma membrane protein, CD81 KO cells showed no defects in viral entry nor in the expression of early protein markers. In contrast, glycoprotein B and C, which require viral DNA replication for their expression, were significantly reduced in CD81 KO infected cells. Indeed, HSV-1 DNA replication and the formation of new infectious particles were severely compromised in CD81 KO cells. We could not detect significant changes in SAMHD1 total expression levels, but a relocalization into endosomal structures was observed in CD81 KO cells.

However, few studies have examined whether these factors vary across developmental periods. The present study therefore adopted a life course perspective to investigate the longitudinal effects of residential mobility and caregiver social support on a range of individual health outcomes (i.e., caregiver depression, adolescent internalizing problems, and adolescent externalizing problems) among families exposed to disadvantaged social and economic conditions. Data were obtained from the Longitudinal Studies in Child Abuse and Neglect, and 425 children and their caregivers who completed the age 12, 14, 16, and 18 interviews were included in this study. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test the measurement and structural models. The results showed that greater residential mobility was significantly associated with higher levels of caregiver depression, which in turn led to more adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. Alternatively, higher levels of caregiver social support mitigated the levels of caregiver depression, which in turn resulted in fewer adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. Highly mobile children and their caregivers were found to be vulnerable to several negative health outcomes and in high need of mental and behavioral health support and services.

All patients with non-severe COVID-19 showed a swift humoral response within two weeks after the onset of symptoms, which remained stable for the duration of the study. One month after the outbreak, titers in COVID-19 convalescents did not differ from the titers of asymptomatically infected individuals.

There is still a pressing demand for drug discovery and vaccine development against this highly contagious disease. To design and develop antiviral drugs against COVID-19, the main protease (M(pro)) has emerged as one of the important drug targets. In this context, the present work explored Jadwar (Delphinium denudatum)Cderived natural alkaloids as potential inhibitors against M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 by employing a combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulationCbased methods. Molecular docking and interaction profile analysis revealed strong binding on the M(pro) functional domain with four natural alkaloids viz. panicutine (?7.4 kcal/mol), vilmorrianone (?7.0 kcal/mol), denudatine (?6.0 kcal/mol), and condelphine (?5.9 kcal/mol).

We further model three successive stages of radicalization guided by prior theoretical works. Specific sub-populations of users, namely those on steady high and increasing conspiracy engagement pathways, progress successively through various radicalization stages. In contrast, users on the decreasing engagement pathway show distinct behavior: they limit their CT discussions to specialized topics, participate in diverse discussion groups, and show reduced conformity with conspiracy subreddits.

In addition, it uses two types of infections, mild and serious, with a different recovery time.

Alarming concern is, the number of second wave infections surpassed the first wave and the onset of severe symptoms manifesting rapidly. In this scenario, testing of maximum population in less time and minimum cost with existing diagnostic amenities is the only possible way to control the spread of the virus. The previously described RNA extraction-free methods using dry swab have been shown to be advantageous in these critical times by different studies. In this work, we show the temporal stability and performance of the dry swab viral detection method at two different temperatures. Contrived dry swabs holding serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 strains A2a and A3i at 25C (room temperature; RT) and 4C were subjected to direct RT-PCR and compared with standard VTM-RNA based method. The results clearly indicate that dry swab method of RNA detection is as efficient as VTM-RNA-based method in both strains, when checked for up to 72 h. The lesser C(T) values of dry swab samples in comparison to that of the VTM-RNA samples suggest better sensitivity of the method within 48 h of time. The results collectively suggest that dry swab samples are stable at RT for 24 h and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR do not show variance from VTM-RNA. This extraction free, direct RT-PCR method holds phenomenal standing in the present life-threatening circumstances due to SARS-CoV-2.

In the Department of Defense (DoD), over 129,000 personnel (civilians, dependents, and active duty) have been infected with the virus to date. Rapid estimations of transmission and mutational patterns of virus outbreaks can be accomplished using whole-genome viral sequencing. Deriving interpretable and actionable results from pathogen sequence data is accomplished by the construction of phylogenetic trees (from local and global virus sequences) and by the creation of protein maps, to visualize and predict the effects of structural protein amino acid mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a sequencing and bioinformatics workflow for molecular epidemiological SARS-CoV-2 surveillance using excess clinical specimens collected under an institutional review board exempt protocol at Joint Base San Antonio, Lackland AFB. This workflow includes viral RNA isolation, viral load quantification, tiling-based next-generation sequencing, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, and data visualization via phylogenetic trees and protein mapping. RESULTS: Sequencing of 37 clinical specimens collected at JBSA/Lackland revealed that by June 2020, SAR-CoV-2 strains carrying the 614G mutation were the predominant cause of local coronavirus disease 2019 infections. We identified 109 nucleotide changes in the coding region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (which lead to 63 unique, non-synonymous amino acid mutations), one mutation in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), and two mutations in the 3'UTR. Furthermore, we identified and mapped six additional spike protein amino acid changes-information which could potentially aid vaccine design. CONCLUSION: The workflow presented here is designed to enable DoD public health officials to track viral evolution and conduct near real-time evaluation of future outbreaks. The generation of molecular epidemiological sequence data is critical for the development of disease intervention strategies-most notably, vaccine design. Overall, we present a streamlined sequencing and bioinformatics methodology aimed at improving long-term readiness efforts in the DoD.","output":"Whole-genome Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2: Using Phylogeny and Structural Modeling to Contextualize Local Viral Evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In combating the coronavirus pandemic in Germany, soft law has played an important, albeit not a central, role Its use basically corresponds with that of normal circumstances In accordance with the German constitutional order, almost all substantial decisions are made in a legally binding form However, these are often prepared through or supplemented by soft law This article shows that soft law has played an important role in fighting the pandemic and its effects in Germany, although there cannot be any doubt that legally binding forms of regulation have prevailed At the same time, the current pandemic has shed light on the advantages and effects of soft law in the context of the German legal order ?","output":"Coronavirus and Soft Law in Germany: Business as Usual?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: : The novel coronavirus disease 2019 has posed significant limitations and barriers to providing in-person healthcare.

PATIENTS: Among all inpatients, inclusion criteria are: &#8805;18 years of age and admission and discharge within the study time frame. The initial search yielded 920 patients; 896 met the inclusion criteria. Subjects were stratified by COVID-19 status and rehabilitation impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), length of stay (LOS), discharge location, and functional ability in self-care and mobility (FA-SC, FA-Mob). One-sample t-tests were used to assess the difference of age, BMI, LOS, FA-SC, FA-Mob, and FA efficiency between COVID-19+ and COVID-19- patients. RESULTS: COVID-19+ patients were younger (59.4 years vs 62.9 years; t[894] = -2.05, p = .04) with a higher mean BMI (32 vs 28; t[894] = 3.51, p < .01) than COVID-19- patients. COVID-19+ patients had equivalent or superior improvements in FA-SC and FA-Mob, functional change efficiency, and LOS relative to COVID-19- patients.

The overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor4. Structural analysis identified residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that are critical for ACE2 binding, the majority of which either are highly conserved or share similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for convergent evolution between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs for improved binding to ACE2, although SARS-CoV-2 does not cluster within SARS and SARS-related coronaviruses1-3,5.

It is also unclear which pathways are contributing to complement activation in COVID-19, and if complement activation is associated with certain features of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as endothelial injury and hypercoagulability. To address these questions, we investigated complement activation in the plasma from patients with COVID-19 prospectively enrolled at two tertiary care centers: Washington University School of Medicine (n=134) and Yale School of Medicine (n=49). We compared our patients to two non-COVID cohorts: (a) patients hospitalized with influenza (n=54), and (b) patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV, n=22). We demonstrate that circulating markers of complement activation are elevated in patients with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza and to patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory failure. Further, the results facilitate distinguishing those who are at higher risk of worse outcomes such as requiring ICU admission, or IMV. Moreover, the results indicate enhanced activation of the alternative complement pathway is most prevalent in patients with severe COVID-19 and is associated with markers of endothelial injury (i.e., angiopoietin-2) as well as hypercoagulability (i.e., thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm, post-marketing study included 67 patients undergoing cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of TFNT00 across five Indian sites. Postoperative outcomes were assessed at 3 months after second eye surgery. Effectiveness outcomes included: mean binocular and monocular visual acuity (VA) at distance (4 m), intermediate (60 cm), and near (40 cm); binocular defocus curve; manifest refraction; and subjective symptom questionnaire evaluation. Safety outcomes included the rate of ocular adverse events and mesopic contrast sensitivity. RESULTS: Mean binocular and monocular distance-corrected and uncorrected VAs of 0.1 logMAR or better (approximately 20/25 Snellen) were achieved at distance, intermediate, and near. Overall, 70% of patients achieved binocular 0.1 logMAR vision or better across all distances. TFNT00 maintained a mean VA of 0.1 logMAR or better at the defocus range of +0.5 diopters (D) to C2.5 D (200 cm to 40 cm). The subjective symptom questionnaire-assessed frequency of halo visual disturbances was low at Month 3; halos were reported none of the time to only some of the time in 86.6% of patients. The large majority of patients (98.5%) were satisfied or very satisfied with their near, intermediate, and distance vision at Month 3, and 94.0% of patients reported spectacle independence for tasks at all distances. The adverse event rate was low; no patients discontinued due to an adverse event. CONCLUSION: TFNT00 provided a continuous range of vision of 20/25 or better for distance to near and performed effectively at an intermediate functional distance of 60 cm, resulting in high levels of spectacle independence and patient satisfaction.

At-home collection kits, in which samples are self-collected without requiring a laboratory or clinic visit and sent to an external laboratory for testing, can provide convenient testing to those with barriers to access. They can prevent unnecessary exposure between patient and clinical staff, increase access for patients with disabilities or remote workers, and decrease burdens on health care resources, such as provider time and personal protective equipment. Exact Sciences developed an at-home collection kit for samples to be tested to detect SARS-CoV-2 that includes an Instructions for Use (IFU) document, which guides people without prior experience on collecting a nasal swab sample. Demonstrating successful sample collection and usability is critical to ensure that these samples meet the same high-quality sample collection standards as samples collected in clinics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the usability of a SARS-CoV-2 at-home nasal swab sample collection kit. METHODS: A human factors usability study was conducted with 30 subjects without prior medical, laboratory, or health care training and without COVID-19 sample self-collection experience. Subjects were observed while they followed the IFU for the at-home sample collection portion of the SARS-CoV-2 test in a setting that simulated a home environment. IFU usability was further evaluated by requiring the subjects to complete a survey, answer comprehension questions, provide written feedback, and respond to questions from the observer about problems during use.

Immunometabolism, by definition, is a multidisciplinary area of immunology research that integrates the knowledge of energy transduction mechanisms and biochemical pathways. An important concept in the field is metabolic switch, a transition of immune cells upon activation to preferential utilization of select catabolic pathways for their energy needs. Mitochondria are not inert in this process and contribute to the metabolic adaptation by different mechanisms which include increasing ATP production to match dynamic bioenergetic demands and serving as a signaling platform. The latter involves generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), one of the most intensively studied mitochondrial processes. While the role of mitochondrial ROS in the context of oxidative stress is well established, ROS signaling in immunity is an emerging and quickly changing field. In this review, we discuss ROS signaling and immunometabolism concepts from the standpoint of bioenergetics. We also provide a critical insight into the methodology for ROS assessment, outlining current challenges in the field.

However, the prebiotic feasibility and robustness of the UAFW system are unclear. Here, we study the UAFW system as a medium in which phosphate minerals are potentially solubilized. Specifically, we conduct a series of chemical experiments alongside thermodynamic models that simulate the formation of ammonium formate from the hydrolysis of hydrogen cyanide, and demonstrate the stability of formamide in such solvents (as an aqueous mixture). The dissolution of hydroxylapatite requires a liquid medium, and we investigate whether a UAFW system is solid or liquid over varied conditions, finding that this characteristic is controlled by the molar ratios of the three components. For liquid UAFW mixtures, we also find the solubility of phosphate is higher when the quantity of ammonium formate is greater than urea. We suggest the urea within the system can lower the activity of water, help create a stable and persistent solution, and may act as a condensing agent/catalyst to improve nucleoside phosphorylation yields.","output":"The Prebiotic Provenance of Semi-Aqueous Solvents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the impact of extreme weather events on urban human flow disruptions using location-based service data obtained from Baidu Map.

Tfh1 sub-population was recently identified and associated with severity in infection and autoimmune diseases.

Our work investigated the role of human dendritic cells (DC) in promoting Tfh1 differentiation and their physiopathological implication in mycobacterium tuberculosis and mild COVID-19 infection. Activated human blood CD1c+ DC were cocultured with allogeneic naive CD4+ T cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing was then used alongside protein validation to define the induced Tfh lineage. DC signature and correlation with Tfh1 cells in infected patients was established through bioinformatic analysis. Our results show that GM-CSF-activated DC drove the differentiation of Tfh1 cells, displaying typical Tfh molecular features, including 1) high levels of PD-1, CXCR5, and ICOS expression; 2) BCL6 and TBET co-expression; 3) IL-21 and IFN-{gamma} secretion. Mechanistically, GM-CSF triggered the emergence of two distinct DC sub-populations defined by their differential expression of CD40 and ICOS-ligand (ICOS-L), and distinct phenotype, morphology, transcriptomic signature, and function. We showed that Tfh1 differentiation was efficiently and specifically induced by CD40highICOS-Llow DC in a CD40-dependent manner.

RESULTS Among individuals with COVID-19, the most frequently reported symptoms were cough (70%), fever (45%), muscular pain (29%), and headache (21%), whereas sore throat (12%), and rhinorrhea (4%) were observed at lower rates. Fever was identified as most frequent in COVID-19 (74%), appearing at a higher rate in those cases than in influenza (68%) or the common cold (40%) (p < 0.05). In comparison to other viral diseases, sore throat was rarely reported in COVID-19 and SARS (12% and 18%, respectively) (p < 0.05). In influenza and common cold, a cough was identified in 93% and 80% of cases (p < 0.05). Headache, rhinorrhea, muscular pain, and sore throat were more common in influenza (91%, 91%, 94%, and 84%, respectively) and common cold (89%, 81%, 94%, and 84%, respectively) than in COVID-19 (21%, 4%, 29%, and 12%, respectively) and SARS (45%, 12%, 55%, and 18%, respectively) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The results of the analysis show that a greater number of general symptoms should lead to a diagnosis of influenza or common cold rather than COVID-19.","output":"Comparison of the clinical differences between COVID-19, SARS, influenza, and the common cold: A systematic literature review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decade, the vision of smart cities filled with technological innovation and digitally engaged citizens has been pursued around the globe, but not all city residents have a chance to participate in or benefit from these innovations Connectivity is unequally distributed across cities and neighborhoods, and these disparities have costs not only for individuals, but for communities, as COVID-19 so aptly demonstrated There is a need to examine uses and outcomes for broadband across cities and neighborhoods as digital human capital in communities Two studies summarized here show that like other human capital, technology use conveys economic benefits for communities Broadband adoption over time is related to prosperity and growth in the 50 largest metros Big data on the density of domain name websites shows that this measure of technology use is likewise a significant predictor of prosperity and median income, controlling for other factors We conclude with a research agenda on digital human capital and community outcomes ? 2021 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc All rights reserved","output":"Digital Citizenship and Digital Communities: How Technology Matters for Individuals and Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 might produce dramatic psychological effects on the individuals' life.

We determined the proportion of screening and surveillance colonoscopies appropriate for rescheduling to a future year through strict adoption of US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a single-center observational study of patients scheduled for \\"open-access colonoscopy\\"-ordered by a primary care provider without being seen in gastroenterology clinic-over a 6-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each chart was reviewed to appropriately assign a surveillance year per USMSTF guidelines including demographics, colonoscopy history and family history. When guidelines recommended a range of colonoscopy intervals, both a \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" guideline adherence were assessed. RESULTS: We delayed 769 \\"open-access\\" screening or surveillance colonoscopies due to COVID-19. Between 14.8% (conservative) and 20.7% (liberal), colonoscopies were appropriate for rescheduling to a future year. Conversely, 415 (54.0%) patients were overdue for colonoscopy. Family history of CRC was associated with being scheduled too early for both screening (OR 3.9; CI 1.9-8.2) and surveillance colonoscopy (OR 2.6, CI 1.0-6.5). The most common reasons a colonoscopy was inappropriately scheduled this year were failure to use new surveillance colonoscopy intervals (28.9%), incorrectly applied family history guidelines (27.2%) and recommending early surveillance colonoscopy after recent normal colonoscopy (19.3%). CONCLUSION: Up to one-fifth of patients scheduled for \\"open-access\\" colonoscopy can be rescheduled into a future year based on USMSTF guidelines.

Lymphocyte count has been a marker of interest since the first COVID-19 publication. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to investigate the association of lymphocyte count on admission and the severity of COVID-19. We would also like to analyze whether patient characteristics such as age and comorbidities affect the relationship between lymphocyte count and COVID-19. METHODS: Comprehensive and systematic literature search was performed from PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC, ProQuest, Cochrane Central Databases, and Google Scholar. Research articles in adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with information on lymphocyte count and several outcomes of interest, including mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) care, and severe COVID-19, were included in the analysis. Inverse variance method was used to obtain mean differences and its standard deviations. Maentel-Haenszel formula was used to calculate dichotomous variables to obtain odds ratios (ORs) along with its 95% confidence intervals. Random-effect models were used for meta-analysis regardless of heterogeneity. Restricted-maximum likelihood random-effects meta-regression was performed for age, gender, cardiac comorbidity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, COPD, and smoking. RESULTS: There were a total of 3099 patients from 24 studies. Meta-analysis showed that patients with poor outcome have a lower lymphocyte count (mean difference ? 361.06 L [? 439.18, ? 282.95], p < 0.001; I(2) 84%) compared to those with good outcome.

Limited evidence exists on immediate patient and health system impacts of research participation. This study uses real-world data and quasi-experimental matching to examine early-stage cost and health impacts of research-based genomic sequencing.

Our cohort includes POG patients enrolled between 2014 and 2015 and 1:1 genetic algorithmCmatched usual care controls. We undertake a cost consequence analysis and estimate 1-year effects of WGTA on patient management, patient survival, and health system costs reported in 2015 Canadian dollars. WGTA costs are imputed and forecast using system of equations modeling. We use Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to explore survival differences and inverse probability of censoring weighted linear regression to estimate mean 1-year survival times and costs. Non-parametric bootstrapping simulates sampling distributions and enables scenario analysis, revealing drivers of incremental costs, survival, and net monetary benefit for assumed willingness to pay thresholds. We identified 230 POG patients and 230 matched controls for cohort inclusion. The mean period cost of research-funded WGTA was $26,211 (SD: $14,191). Sequencing costs declined rapidly, with WGTA forecasts hitting $13,741 in 2021. The incremental healthcare system effect (non-research expenditures) was $5203 (95% CI: 75, 10,424) compared to usual care. No overall survival differences were observed, but outcome heterogeneity was present. POG patients receiving WGTA-informed treatment experienced incremental survival gains of 2.49 months (95% CI: 1.32, 3.64). Future cost consequences became favorable as WGTA cost drivers declined and WGTA-informed treatment rates improved to 60%. Our study demonstrates the ability of real-world data to support evaluations of only-in-research health technologies. We identify situations where precision oncology research initiatives may produce survival benefit at a cost that is within healthcare systems willingness to pay.

Updated evidence about the associations of BP categories with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and its subtypes is warranted. METHODS AND FINDINGS: About 0.5 million adults aged 30 to 79 years were recruited from 10 areas in China during 2004C2008. The present study included 430 977 participants without antihypertension treatment, cancer, or CVD at baseline. BP was measured at least twice in a single visit at baseline and CVD deaths during follow-up were collected via registries and the national health insurance databases. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate the associations between BP categories and CVD mortality. Overall, 16.3% had prehypertension-low, 25.1% had prehypertension-high, 14.1% had isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), 1.9% had isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), and 9.1% had systolic-diastolic hypertension (SDH). During a median 10-year follow-up, 9660 CVD deaths were documented. Compared with normal, the hazard ratios (95% CI) of prehypertension-low, prehypertension-high, ISH, IDH, SDH for CVD were 1.10 (1.01C1.19), 1.32 (1.23C1.42), 2.04 (1.91C2.19), 2.20 (1.85C2.61), and 3.81 (3.54C4.09), respectively.

Health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of infection because the virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted by a variety of routes. Health care workers are required to use a variety of personal protective equipment (PPE) for prolonged hours and, as a result, they face varying degrees of cutaneous complications. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online questionnaire survey to investigate skin problems caused by the use of PPE and personal hygiene measures. We developed a survey with 32 questions using Google forms and distributed it via WhatsApp and Facebook groups. RESULTS: A total of 1142 responses were obtained. Among the respondents, 88.1% reported adverse skin reactions due to PPE and personal hygiene measures. Female sex, working as a nurse, wearing PPE more than 6 h/day, and working more than 3 days/week increase the risk of PPE-related skin problems. CONCLUSION: In this study, we highlighted skin problems related to PPE and found out risk factors for PPE-related skin problems.","output":"Skin problems related to personal protective equipment among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic (online research)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden in hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of coronavirus from the pre-coronavirus disease 2019 era in the United States. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified hospitalized adults with a diagnosis of coronavirus in a large US administrative database, the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample, from January 1, 2016, to December 3, 2017, to study patient demographic characteristics, clinical comorbidities, and outcomes (in-hospital mortality and health care resource utilization) based on the presence or absence of CVD. RESULTS: A total of 21,300 hospitalized adults with a diagnosis of coronavirus in 2016 and 2017 from all across the United States were included in the final analysis; the mean age was 63.6 years, 11,033 (51.8%) were female, and 15,911 (74.7%) had public insurers. Among these hospitalized patients, 11,930 (56.0%) had a diagnosis of CVD. Compared with those without CVD, the patients with CVD were older (70.1 vs 55.4 years) and had higher Charlson comorbidity index scores (2.5 vs 1.6) and Elixhauser comorbidity index scores (4.3 vs 2.4) (all P<.001). After multivariable risk adjustment, patients with CVD had higher mortality than those without CVD (5.3% [632 of 11,930] vs 1.5% [140 of 9370]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.2 to 3.4]; P=.008).

In this work, direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent pulsatile jets, coupled with Lagrangian particle tracking of micron-sized droplets, is performed to investigate the role of secondary and tertiary expulsions on particle dispersion and penetration. Fully developed turbulence obtained from DNS of a turbulent pipe flow is provided at the jet orifice. The volumetric flow rate at the orifice is modulated in time according to a damped sine wave, thereby allowing for control of the number of pulses, duration, and peak amplitude. Thermodynamic effects, such as evaporation and buoyancy, are neglected in order to isolate the role of pulsatility on particle dispersion. The resulting vortex structures are analyzed for single-, two-, and three-pulse jets. The evolution of the particle cloud is then compared to existing single-pulse models. Particle dispersion and penetration of the entire cloud are found to be hindered by increased pulsatility. However, the penetration of particles emanating from a secondary or tertiary expulsion is enhanced due to acceleration downstream by vortex structures.","output":"Role of pulsatility on particle dispersion in expiratory flows"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Dysmenorrhea is a prevalent pain condition among women and a risk factor for other chronic pain conditions. Individuals vary in dysmenorrhea pain severity, the number of painful sites, and co-occurring gastrointestinal symptoms. Three dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes were previously identified using latent class analysis; however, there is a need to validate these in an independent sample, so they can be used in mechanistic and interventional research. There also is a need to further characterize dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes in terms of demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics so they can be used to inform precision dysmenorrhea treatment. OBJECTIVES The study objectives were to: (a) determine whether the same dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes would be found in a new sample; (b) determine whether including demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral covariates in latent class analyses would change individuals' phenotype memberships; and (c) investigate relationships between dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes and demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics. METHODS This cross-sectional survey study included 678 women (aged 14 to 42 years) with dysmenorrhea. Participants reported dysmenorrhea symptom severity, demographic, clinical (comorbid chronic pain and gynecological conditions), and psychobehavioral characteristics (perceived stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and pain catastrophizing). We used latent class analysis to identify symptom-based phenotypes. We compared analyses with and without covariates (i.e., demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics) to determine if individuals' phenotype memberships changed. We then examined associations between phenotypes and demographic, clinical, and psychobehavioral characteristics. RESULTS We reproduced three dysmenorrhea symptom-based phenotypes: the \\"mild localized pain\\" phenotype (characterized by mild abdominal cramps), the \\"severe localized pain\\" phenotype (characterized by severe abdominal cramps), and the \\"multiple severe symptoms\\" phenotype (characterized by severe pain at multiple locations and gastrointestinal symptoms). Analyses with and without covariates had little effect on individuals' phenotype membership. Race, comorbid chronic pain condition, endometriosis, and pain catastrophizing were significantly associated with the dysmenorrhea phenotypes. DISCUSSION Findings provide a foundation to further study mechanisms of dysmenorrhea symptom heterogeneity and develop dysmenorrhea precision treatments.

One of the most serious manifestations of PD is gait instability, leading to falls and subsequent complications that can be debilitating, even fatal. Boxing therapy (BT) uses gait and balance exercises to improve ambulation in people with PD, though its efficacy has not yet been fully proven. METHODS: In the current longitudinal observational study, 98 participants with idiopathic PD underwent twice-weekly BT sessions. Primary outcome was self-reported falls per month;secondary outcomes were quantitative and semi-quantitative gait and balance performance evaluations. Statistical methods included segmented generalized estimating equation with an independent correlation structure, binomial distribution, and log link. RESULTS: The average number of self-reported falls per month per participant decreased by 87%, from 0.86  3.58 prior to BT, to 0.11  0.26 during BT. During the lockdown imposed by COVID-19, this increased to 0.26  0.48 falls per month. Females and those &gt; 65 years old reported the greatest increase in falls during the lockdown period. Post-lockdown resumption of BT resulted in another decline in falls, to 0.14  0.33. Quantitative performance metrics, including standing from a seated position and standing on one leg, largely mirrored the pattern of falls pre-and post-lockdown.

Here we report the long-term outcome of patients in this trial. METHODS We randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by centre with randomly permuted block sizes) 451 patients with recent transient ischaemic attack or stroke related to 70-99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery to aggressive medical management (antiplatelet therapy, intensive management of vascular risk factors, and a lifestyle-modification programme) or aggressive medical management plus stenting with the Wingspan stent. The primary endpoint was any of the following: stroke or death within 30 days after enrolment, ischaemic stroke in the territory of the qualifying artery beyond 30 days of enrolment, or stroke or death within 30 days after a revascularisation procedure of the qualifying lesion during follow-up. Primary endpoint analysis of between-group differences with log-rank test was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 00576693. FINDINGS During a median follow-up of 324 months, 34 (15%) of 227 patients in the medical group and 52 (23%) of 224 patients in the stenting group had a primary endpoint event. The cumulative probability of the primary endpoints was smaller in the medical group versus the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) group (p=00252). Beyond 30 days, 21 (10%) of 210 patients in the medical group and 19 (10%) of 191 patients in the stenting group had a primary endpoint. The absolute differences in the primary endpoint rates between the two groups were 71% at year 1 (95% CI 02 to 138%; p=00428), 65% at year 2 (-05 to 135%; p=007) and 90% at year 3 (15 to 165%; p=00193). The occurrence of the following adverse events was higher in the PTAS group than in the medical group: any stroke (59 [26%] of 224 patients vs 42 [19%] of 227 patients; p=00468) and major haemorrhage (29 [13%]of 224 patients vs 10 [4%] of 227 patients; p=00009).

However, many report that they lack the knowledge and confidence to do so, and few mental health training programs available for educators are evidence based. To address this gap, the Black Dog Institute (BDI) developed a web-based training program (Building Educators' Skills in Adolescent Mental Health [BEAM]) that aims to improve mental health knowledge, confidence, and helping behaviors among secondary school educators in leadership positions. A pilot study of the training program found it to be positively associated with increased confidence and helping behaviors among educators and reduced personal psychological distress. An adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this cluster RCT is to evaluate the effectiveness of the BEAM program for improving educators' confidence in managing student mental health. The trial will also evaluate the effect of the BEAM program in increasing educators' frequency of providing help to students and improving their mental health knowledge and reducing educators' psychological distress and stigma toward students with mental health issues. METHODS: The target sample size is 234 educators from 47 secondary schools across New South Wales, Australia. Four waves of recruitment and enrollment into the trial are planned. Schools will participate in one wave only and will be randomized to the intervention or waitlist control conditions. Participants from the same school will be assigned to the same condition. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, posttest (10 weeks after baseline), and follow-up (22 weeks after baseline) using the BDI eHealth research platform. Intervention participants will receive access to the BEAM program for 10 weeks upon completion of baseline, and the control condition will receive access for 10 weeks upon completion of the follow-up assessment. RESULTS: Recruitment for this trial began on July 21, 2020, with the first baseline assessments occurring on August 17, 2020. To date, 295 participants from 71 schools have completed baseline. Due to the unexpected success of recruitment in the first 3 waves, the final fourth wave has been abandoned. Intervention participants are currently receiving the program, with follow-up due for completion in March 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first RCTs to examine the effectiveness of a web-based adolescent mental health training program for Australian secondary school educators in leadership positions. If found to be effective, this training program will offer a sustainable and scalable delivery method for upskilling educators in caring for students' mental health.

Specifically, I conducted a multiverse analysis using a representative population sample in Switzerland (Study 1; N = 2,919 individuals between 15 and 94 years old), finding that interindividual differences in risk perceptions were strongly associated with hazard-related drivers (e.g., trust in the institutions regulating 5G, dread) and person-specific drivers (e.g., electromagnetic hypersensitivity)-and strongly predictive of people's policy-related attitudes (e.g., voting intentions).

Therefore, our analysis takes into account the time series of the daily number of deaths related to COVID-19 from March 17, 2020 until October 19, 2021 with 582 observations. Specifically, we apply the permutation entropy (Hs), statistical complexity (Cs) and Fisher information measure (Fs) to investigate the predictability of the daily deaths for COVID-19 considering two pandemic scenarios (until and after the extreme day). Based on these complexity measures, we construct the Complexity-Entropy causality plane (CECP) and ShannonCFisher causality plane (SFCP), which allows us to assess the disorder and estimate randomness inherent to the time series of the daily deaths for COVID-19 concerning these two pandemic scenarios. Our empirical results indicate that after the extreme day, the increase in the vaccinated population contingent led to a lower entropy, higher predictability, and lower death cases. Given this, we conclude that the COVID-19 vaccines in Brazil were a highly effective public health action. In the most extreme situation, Brazil had 4249 records of daily deaths on April 8, 2021, approximately 3.5 months after the first dose of the vaccine. After this extreme situation on April 9, 2021, the daily records of deaths decrease to a minimum of 130 deaths on October 19, 2021.

Current research on the experience of stress for students in the health professions has focused on nursing and medical students. There are no published studies exploring pandemic-related stress in physical therapy. The purpose of this study was to explore the experience of stress for Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects. Twenty-four students in their first, second, and third year of study from 3 physical therapist education programs. Methods. Using a phenomenological qualitative approach, 60-minute semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant through video conference in April and May of 2020. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify and refine codes and construct themes and subthemes. Results. Four themes resulted from analyses of these data: sources of stress, stress management, stress modifiers, and positive aspects of COVID. Sources of stress were related to academics, uncertainty, personal circumstances, and finances. DPT students described stress associated with the transition to online learning related to focus, engagement, workload, and reduced opportunities to practice hands-on skills. Uncertainty was particularly stressful for third-year students who were anxious about clinical experiences, board examinations, and future employment. Stress management strategies were centered on cognitive reappraisal, physical activity, and social support. Discussion and Conclusion. While students identified several sources of stress during the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic, important stress modifiers, such as faculty and cohort-based peer support, were highlighted that have the potential to reduce stress for students both in times of crisis and under more typical circumstances. These factors, in combination with findings suggesting that increased flexibility and agency over learning mediated stress responses, have potential implications for instructional delivery and academic program design.","output":"Physical Therapy Student Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With restrictions on opportunities for face to face (FtF) interactions, Covid-19 lockdowns test the promises of digitally mediated communication (DMC) to foster social contact and wellbeing.

DMC was more popular than FtF and Covid-19 death rates played a bigger role in DMC use than state stringency measures. FtF contact was positively associated and messaging negatively associated with wellbeing. FtF was especially positive for people who did not perceive any loved ones in their household as vulnerable to the disease, yet did not vary with peoples perception of their own vulnerability. The results suggest that, in the face of the pandemic, men and women of all ages relied on DMC over FtF contact.

METHODS: We used national population-based datasets of 44,624 households in Vietnam from 2000 to 2014. We applied Bayesian regression models to estimate the trends in and projections of RMNCH indicators and the probabilities of achieving the 2030 targets. Using the relative index, slope index, and concentration index of inequality, we examined the patterns and trends in RMNCH coverage inequality. FINDINGS: We projected that 9 out of 17 health service indicators (53%) would likely achieve the 2030 targets at the national level, including at least one and four ANC visits, BCG immunization, access to improved water and adequate sanitation, institutional delivery, skilled birth attendance, care-seeking for pneumonia, and ARI treatment. We observed very low coverages and zero chance of achieving the 2030 targets at national and sub-national levels in early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding, family planning needs satisfied, and oral rehydration therapy. The most deprived households living in rural areas and the Northwest, Northeast, North Central, Central Highlands, and Mekong River Delta regions would not reach the 80% immunization coverage of DPT3, Polio3, Measles and full immunization. We found socioeconomic, regional, and urban-rural inequalities in all RMNCH indicators in 2014 and no change in inequalities over 15 years in the lowest-coverage indicators. INTERPRETATION: Vietnam has made substantial progress toward UHC. By improving the government's health system reform efforts, re-allocating resources focusing on people in the most impoverished rural regions, and restructuring and enhancing current health programs, Vietnam can achieve the UHC targets and other health-related SDGs.

METHODS: An online questionnaire was designed and administered to collect the necessary information. Data from 988 respondents were included in the analyses. RESULTS: Overall perception of productivity level among workers did not change relative to their in-office productivity before the pandemic. Female, older, and high-income workers were likely to report increased productivity. Productivity was positively influenced by better mental and physical health statuses, having a teenager, increased communication with coworkers and having a dedicated room for work. Number of hours spent at a workstation increased by approximately 1.5 hours during a typical WFH day. Longer hours were reported by individuals who had school age children, owned an office desk or an adjustable chair, and had adjusted their work hours.

A light source panel was developed composed of 200 lasers centered at 808nm with an irradiance of 77.8  10.0 mW/cm2 and tested in an ex vivo thoracic cage model. Monte Carlo simulations were used to understand the photon migration through all the tissues at the thoracic wall. It was observed that tissues responsible for the major absorption of photons are the skin and subcutaneous fat. Experimental measurement of the irradiance was obtained after the light pass-through ex vivo pig thoracic cage, obtaining 3-5% of the emitted irradiance. Finally, it was observed that even with 3% of the initial irradiance, a 99.9% reduction of the S. pneumoniae was successfully achieved after 42.6 minutes of irradiation.

In the last decade, the field has seen significant advances in the understanding and use of this new technology. This review aims to describe the large, randomized controlled studies leading to the modern use of rTMS for MDD. It also includes a special section briefly discussing the use of these technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Several new approaches and technologies are emerging in this field, including novel approaches to reduce treatment time and potentially yield new approaches to optimize and maximize clinical outcomes. Of these, theta burst TMS now has evidence indicating it is non-inferior to standard TMS and provides significant advantages in administration. Recent studies also indicate that neuroimaging and related approaches may be able to improve TMS targeting methods and potentially identify those patients most likely to respond to stimulation. SUMMARY: While new data is promising, significant research remains to be done to individualize and optimize TMS procedures. Emerging new approaches, such as accelerated TMS and advanced targeting methods, require additional replication and demonstration of real-world clinical utility. Cautious administration of TMS during the pandemic is possible with careful attention to safety procedures.","output":"Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression: Recent Critical Advances in Patient Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease of man with over 400,000 cases in the United States and over 2.5 million cases worldwide. There are over 64,000 citations in Pubmed dating back as far as 1887. Much has been learned over the past 129 years with a recent burst in therapeutic options (mostly anti-inflammatory) with newer medications in development that are neuroprotective and/or neuroreparative. However, with all these advancements the cause of MS remains elusive. There is a clear interplay of genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors that influences both the development and progression of this disorder. This chapter will give a brief overview of the history and pathogenesis of MS with attention to how host immune responses in genetically susceptible individuals contribute to the MS disease process. In addition, we will explore the role of infectious agents in MS as potential triggers of disease. Models of virus-induced demyelination will be discussed, with an emphasis on the recent interest in human herpesviruses and the role they may play in MS disease pathogenesis. Although we remain circumspect as to the role of any microbial pathogen in MS, we suggest that only through well-controlled serological, cellular immune, molecular, and animal studies we will be able to identify candidate agents. Ultimately, clinical interventional trials that either target a specific pathogen or class of pathogens will be required to make definitive links between the suspected agent and MS.","output":"Virus-Induced Demyelination: The Case for Virus(es) in Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSchool-based COVID-19 contacts in England are asked to self-isolate at home. However, this has led to large numbers of missed school days. Therefore, we trialled daily testing of contacts as an alternative, to investigate if it would affect transmission in schools. MethodsWe performed an open-label cluster randomised controlled trial in students and staff from secondary schools and further education colleges in England (ISRCTN18100261). Schools were randomised to self-isolation of COVID-19 contacts for 10 days (control) or to voluntary daily lateral flow device (LFD) testing for school contacts with LFD-negative contacts remaining at school (intervention). Household contacts were excluded from participation. Co-primary outcomes in all students and staff were symptomatic COVID-19, adjusted for community case rates, to estimate within-school transmission (non-inferiority margin: <50% relative increase), and COVID-19-related school absence. Analyses were performed on an intention to treat (ITT) basis using quasi-Poisson regression, also estimating complier average causal effects (CACE). Secondary outcomes included participation rates, PCR results in contacts and performance characteristics of LFDs vs. PCR. FindingsOf 99 control and 102 intervention schools, 76 and 86 actively participated (19-April-2021 to 27-June-2021); additional national data allowed most non-participating schools to be included in the co-primary outcomes. 2432/5763(42.4%) intervention arm contacts participated. There were 657 symptomatic PCR-confirmed infections during 7,782,537 days-at-risk (59.1/100k/week) and 740 during 8,379,749 days-at-risk (61.8/100k/week) in the control and intervention arms respectively (ITT adjusted incidence rate ratio, aIRR=0.96 [95%CI 0.75-1.22;p=0.72]) (CACE-aIRR=0.86 [0.55-1.34]).

Here we present a simple, efficient and generalizable enzymatic synthesis method for the conversion of nucleosides to NTPs. Our one-pot method is modular, applicable to a wide range of natural and modified nucleotide products and accesses NTPs directly from cheap nucleoside precursors. Nucleoside kinases, nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases and a nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase were applied as biocatalysts. Enzymes with different substrate specificities were combined to produce derivatives of adenosine and cytidine triphosphate with conversions of 4 to 26%. The implementation of a (deoxy)ATP recycling system resulted in a significant increase in the conversion to all NTP products, furnishing 4 different NTPs in quantitative conversion. Natural (deoxy)NTPs were synthesized with 60 to >99% conversion and sugar- and base-modified NTPs were produced with 69 to >99% and 27 to 75% conversion, respectively.

However, technology-enabled services have faced challenges in being sustainably implemented despite showing promising outcomes in efficacy trials since the early 2000s. The ongoing failure of these implementations has been addressed in reconceptualized models and frameworks, along with various efforts to branch out among disparate developers and clinical researchers to provide them with a key for furthering evaluative research. However, the limitations of traditional research methods in dealing with the complexities of mental health care warrant a diversified approach. The crux of the challenges of digital mental health implementation is the efficacy and evaluation of existing studies. Web-based interventions are increasingly used during the pandemic, allowing for affordable access to psychological therapies. However, a lagging infrastructure and skill base has limited the application of digital solutions in mental health care. Methodologies need to be converged owing to the rapid development of digital technologies that have outpaced the evaluation of rigorous digital mental health interventions and strategies to prevent mental illness. The functions and implications of human-computer interaction require a better understanding to overcome engagement barriers, especially with predictive technologies. Explainable artificial intelligence is being incorporated into digital mental health implementation to obtain positive and responsible outcomes. Investment in digital platforms and associated apps for real-time screening, tracking, and treatment offer the promise of cost-effectiveness in vulnerable populations. Although machine learning has been limited by study conduct and reporting methods, the increasing use of unstructured data has strengthened its potential. Early evidence suggests that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of incrementing such technology. The limitations of an evidence-based approach require better integration of decision support tools to guide policymakers with digital mental health implementation.

The aim of the present study is to identify the prevalence of schistosomiasis-related appendicitis in Beira, Mozambique and compare to global prevalence. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all cases of appendicitis recorded from January 2017 to March 2020 at a single pathology department located in Beira in order to assess the prevalence of schistosomiasis. Moreover, we performed a systematic review on the prevalence of schistosomiasis-related appendicitis in all countries. FINDINGS: A total of 145 appendicitis cases in Beira showed a 13.1% prevalence of schistosomal-related appendicitis. The mean age of patients was 29.1 years, and 14 (73.7%) were male. The systematic review identified 20 studies with 34,790 inpatients with schistosomiasis-related appendicitis with a global prevalence of 1.31% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72 to 2.06); a high heterogeneity (I(2) = 96.0%) was observed.

In this study, we examined and verified the anomalous high expression of Anillin in both HCC patients' specimens and HCC cell lines. High expression of Anillin is associated with dismal clinicopathologic features of HCC patients and poor prognosis. We conducted loss-of and gain-of function studies in HCC Hep3B cells. Anillin presented a significantly facilitating effect on cell proliferation in vitro and induced remarkable tumor growth in vivo.

Transcription factor SOX4 presented a high expression profile positive correlated with Anillin, and ChIP assay validated the interaction between SOX4 and the specific sequence of the promoter region of Anillin gene. While, we verified miR-138 as an upstream regulator of SOX4, which is abrogated in HCC cells and exerts degenerating effect on SOX4 mRNA. In our conclusion, Anillin facilitates the cell proliferation and enhances tumor growth of HCC, and is modulated by miR-138/SOX4 axis which regulates the transcriptional activity of Anillin.

From a nursing human resources for health (HRH) perspective, there are challenges of low nursing school capacity, high employment of expatriates, labor market fragmentation, shortage of nurses in rural areas, uneven quality, and gender challenges. CASE PRESENTATION: This case study summarizes Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) and Saudi Health Councils (SHCs) evaluation of the current challenges facing the nursing profession in the KSA. We propose policy interventions to support the transformation of nursing into a profession that contributes to efficient, high-quality healthcare for every Saudi citizen. Key to the success of modernizing the Saudi workforce will be an improved pipeline of nurses that leads from middle and high school to nursing school; followed by a diverse career path that includes postgraduate education. To retain nurses in the profession, there are opportunities to make nursing practice more attractive and family friendly. Interventions include reducing shift length, redesigning the nursing team to add more allied health workers, and introducing locum tenens staffing to balance work-load.

METHODS: We utilized the UK Biobank to investigate the relationships of social isolation and loneliness with dementia (n = 462,619). Neuroanatomical correlates were identified in a subset of participants (n = 32,263). The transcriptomic signatures of related brain changes were characterized by gene enrichment analysis. RESULTS: After full adjustment, social isolation but not loneliness was associated with dementia (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-1.39). Isolated individuals had reduced gray matter volumes in temporal, frontal, occipital and subcortical regions (e.g., hippocampus and amygdala). Relevant brain changes were spatially correlated with genes involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation, and down-regulated Alzheimer's disease-related genes.

Data from inguinal and ventral hernia surgeries were retrieved from a medical database using procedure codes from all three hospitals in Region J?nk?ping County from March 1, 2019 to January 31, 2021. The participants were divided into two groups: COVID-19 group (March 1, 2020 - January 31, 2021) and reference group (March 1, 2019 - January 31, 2020). The incidence rate (IR) and relative risk (RR) of operations over different time frames were analyzed. RESULTS: A total 1351 participants met the inclusion criteria. 590 were operated during the COVID-19 period and 761 during the reference period. The IR of elective operations was decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic; 146 operations/100.000 population vs 192 operations/100.000 population during the reference period. RR was 0,76 (95% CI 0.6813-0.8545, p < 0.0001). Moreover, IR of emergency operations decreased insignificantly during the COVID-19 pandemic; 17,5 operations/100.000 population vs 19,4 operations/100.000 population during the reference period.

Therefore, we combined a large empirical study with a physical model of human heat transfer to determine the climates where increased air movement (with electric fans) provides effective body cooling. The model allowed us to generate practical advice using a high-resolution matrix of temperature and humidity. The empirical study involved a total of 300 1-h work trials in a variety of environments (35, 40, 45, and 50 C, with 20 up to 80% relative humidity) with and without simulated wind (3.5 vs 0.2 m?s(?1)), and wearing either minimal clothing or a full body work coverall. Our data provides compelling evidence that the impact of fans is strongly determined by air temperature and humidity. When air temperature is  35 C, fans are ineffective and potentially harmful when relative humidity is below 50%. Our simulated data also show the climates where high wind/fans are beneficial or harmful, considering heat acclimation, age, and wind speed. Using unified weather indices, the impact of air movement is well captured by the universal thermal climate index, but not by wet-bulb globe temperature and aspirated wet-bulb temperature. Overall, the data from this study can inform new guidance for major public and occupational health agencies, potentially maintaining health and productivity in a warming climate.

The death rate is even higher in the obese COVID-19 patients, as a result of hypoxia, due to the interplay between adipose tissue hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea. The discrepancy of manifestations seen in COVID-19 seems to be mediated by a differential immune response rather than a differential viral load. One of the key players of the immune response is HIF. HIF-1 is a stable constitutively expressed protein in the nucleus; and under hypoxic changes, its activity is unaffected, whereas the HIF- subunit has a short half-life and because of its degradation by an enzyme known as propyl hydroxylase; under hypoxic conditions, propyl hydroxylase gets deactivated thus leading to the stabilization of HIF-1. As mentioned before, HIF-1 expression is triggered by hypoxic states, this crippling condition will aggravate the pro-inflammatory characteristics of HIF-1. The vast majority of decompensated COVID19 cases manifest with drastic lung injury and severe viral pneumonia, the infection-induced hypoxia will the existing hypoxia in obesity. This will additionally augment HIF-1 levels that will provoke the already existing cytokines' storm to fulminant. Consequently, this will directly correlate the effect of a hypoxic environment with the increase of HIF-1 level. HIF exists in two main isoforms HIF-1 and HIF-2. HIF-1 and HIF-2 act in distinct ways in how they work on different target genes. For example, HIF-2 may act on hemopoietin genes (heme-regulating genes); while HIF-1 acts on EPO. HIF-1 release seems to be markedly augmented in obesity due to adipose tissue hypoxia and obstructive sleep apnea resulting in cyclic hypoxia. HIF-1 can also be secreted by direct viral proteolytic effects. Whereas, HIF-2 is stimulated by chronic hypoxia. HIF-1 exerts detrimental effects on the immune system, characterized by unopposed pro-inflammation at the macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and complement levels resulting in cytokines storm, which is linked to the poor outcomes of COVID-19. On the other hand, HIF-2 role is regulatory and largely opposes the actions mediated by HIF-1. In view of this, inhibiting HIF-1 release or switching its production to HIF-2 by natural products such as resveratrol or by synthetic drugs, offer a good therapeutic strategy that can prevent COVID-19 worst outcome in infected patients. The approach of breaking the vicious circle between lung damage-induced hypoxia and HIF-1 pro-inflammatory stimulant through drugs is considered to be extremely promising as a therapeutic manner to combat further deterioration of COVID19 cases.","output":"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF): The link between obesity and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Inguinoscrotal pathologies such as undescended testis, retractile testis, hydrocele be acquired or congenital;inguinoscrotal region anoma-lies may not be noticed in many children.

ABSTRACT: Meat cultivation via cellular agriculture holds great promise as a method for future food production. In theory, it is an ideal way of meat production, humane to the animals and sustainable for the environment, while keeping the same taste and nutritional values as traditional meat and having additional benefits such as controlled fat content and absence of antibiotics and hormones used in the traditional meat industry. However, in practice, there is still a number of challenges, such as those associated with the upscale of cultured meat (CM). CM food safety monitoring is a necessary factor when envisioning both the regulatory compliance and consumer acceptance. To achieve this, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary. This includes extensive development of the sensitive and specific analytical devices i.e., sensors to enable reliable food safety monitoring throughout the whole future food supply chain. In addition, advanced monitoring options can help in the further optimization of the meat cultivation which may reduce the currently still high costs of production. This review presents an overview of the sensor monitoring options for the most relevant parameters of importance for meat cultivation. Examples of the various types of sensors that can potentially be used in CM production are provided and the options for their integration into bioreactors, as well as suggestions on further improvements and more advanced integration approaches. In favor of the multidisciplinary approach, we also include an overview of the bioreactor types, scaffolding options as well as imaging techniques relevant for CM research.

Oncology services have been reorganized to decrease the risk of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2, but changes in treatment pathways and follow-up cancer care can result in patients receiving suboptimal or delayed care. Herein, we describe a cross-sectional nested cohort study conducted to evaluate delays in care for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) in post-treatment follow-up or palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northeast Brazil and its impact on health outcomes. Information was extracted from medical records and supplemented by telephone interviews. We compared the following health outcomes: self-perception of anxiety or sadness, fear of COVID-19 infection, cancer-related complications during social isolation, self-medication, diagnosis of COVID-19, and death between patients with and without delayed cancer care. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare distributions of continuous variables and the Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables. Thirty-one HNC patients were included in the study, and no case of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 was found. Delayed cancer care due to restriction in health services was reported in 58.1% of cases, and there was no report of telemedicine use during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cancer-related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic were described for most patients (67.7%) and included pain or discomfort, swelling, and dyspnea. Eight (25.8%) patients reported use of prescribed morphine or codeine to manage pain and six (19.4%) patients reported self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We found an association between delayed HNC care and the use of self-medication (p = 0.028). This study indicated that patients with delayed HNC care during the COVID-19 outbreak are more likely to use self-medication with NSAIDs for pain management. Better strategies to follow HNC patients in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities need to be discussed and implemented.","output":"Delay in head and neck cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on health outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics for family clusters of COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province.

Inefficient viral clearance at any stage is a hallmark of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Disease severity is associated with increases in peripheral blood cytokines among which interleukin 10 (IL-10) increases particularly early and independent of patient age, which is not seen in active SARS-CoV infection. Here, we consider the known multi-faceted immune regulatory role of IL-10, both in protecting the lung from injury and in defense against infections, as well as its potential cellular source. While the absence of an IL-10 response in SARS is thought to contribute to early deterioration, we suspect IL-10 to protect the lung from early immune-mediated damage and to interfere with viral clearance in COVID-19. This may further both viral spread and poor outcome in many high-risk patients. Identifying the features of the viral genotype, which specifically underlie the different IL-10 dynamics as an etiological endotype and the different viral load kinetics and outcomes as clinical phenotype, may unveil a new immune evasive strategy of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Lung Protection vs. Infection Resolution: Interleukin 10 Suspected of Double-Dealing in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the risk of exposure and the need for heightened precautions related to COVID-19, visitor restrictions are in place in the ICU On this particular day, I noticed one of the glass doors of a patient room in the ICU had \\"Happy Birthday\\" written on it in dry-erase marker David Wyatt, PhD, RN, CNOR, NEA-BC, is the AORN President and chief nursing officer of University Hospitals at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas","output":"Our Shared Purpose: Leaving a Legacy of Caring: The Official Voice of Perioperative Nursing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused people to shelter-at-home for an extended period, resulting in a sudden rise in unstructured time. This unexpected disruption in everyday life has raised concerns about weight management, especially in high-risk populations of women and individuals with overweight and obesity. This study aimed to investigate the changes in behaviors that may impact energy intake and/or energy expenditure in U.S. adults during the home confinement. Methods: Cross-sectional data from 1,779 adults were collected using an online Qualtrics survey between April 24th and May 4th, 2020. Self-reported data on demographics, eating behaviors, physical activity, sleep, screen time, takeout food intake, and food purchasing behaviors were collected. Chi-Square analyses were conducted to evaluate differences in the percent of participants reporting increasing, decreasing, or staying the same in each health behavior since the COVID-19 outbreak in their area. Each analysis was followed by comparing whether increases or decreases were more likely for each health behavior. Similar comparisons were made between male and female participants and between body mass index (BMI) categories. Results: We observed an increase in the intake of both healthy and energy-dense unhealthy foods and snacks during the home confinement. Participants also reported increases in sedentary activities and decrease in physical activity, alcohol intake, and consumption of takeout meals during this time. In women, several behavioral changes support greater energy intake and less energy expenditure than men. No clear difference in patterns was observed across BMI status. Conclusion: Acute changes in behaviors underscore the significance of a sudden increase in unstructured time at home on potential weight gain. Our findings support the need to implement and support measures that promote strategies to maintain body weight and establish a methodology to collect body weight data at multiple time points to longitudinally assess the dynamic relationship between behaviors and body weight change.","output":"Self-reported changes in energy balance behaviors during COVID-19 related home confinement: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents an analysis of the work of the largest children's COVID-19 center in Moscow, organized on the basis of the Children's City Clinical Hospital named after Z.

This strategy involves integration of high-temperature thermal isolation followed by thermal nanowiring techniques. The impure thermally-isolated REOs were purified and transformed into one dimensional (1D) nanorods of hybrid REOs. Besides, during high-temperature thermal isolation, defect-rich ZnO with tailored structures of nanorods and nanoribbons were fabricated using controllable vapour deposition. The electrochemical performance of ZnO nanoribbons for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) revealed a considerable overpotential reduction of 131 mV (18%) compared to pure commercial nano-ZnO.

Linear regression and means comparison were used to identify overall job demand and resource perception with burnout, unique stressor portraits by provider subtype and mean survey scores between those who did or did not voluntarily complete at least 14 days of a 28 day novel self-help intervention tool. ResultsRegarding the pre COVID-19 data, of 73 respondents, there was statistically significant (p<.01) correlation between overall job demands (directly) and resources (inversely) with burnout intensity. With respect to the HCW stressor characteristic analyses there was statistical significance (p<.05) between the mean frequency occurrence of the top 5 stressors identified by respondent subtype when compared to the mean occurrence of overall individual responses within the corresponding subtype.

One hundred and 73 sera from CF patients, comprising 33 patients with M. abscessus positive cultures, and 31 non-CF healthy controls were assessed. IgA levels were evaluated by indirect ELISAs using a surface antigenic extract named TLR2eF for TLR2 positive extract and a recombinant protein, the phospholipase C (rMAB_0555 or rPLC). These assays revealed a sensitivity of 52.6% (95% CI = 35.8% to 69%) and 42.1% (95% CI = 26.3% to 59.2%) using TLR2eF and rPLC, respectively, and respective specificities of 92.6% (95% CI = 87.5% to 96.1%) and 92% (95% CI = 86.7% to 95.7%) for samples culture positive for M. abscessus. Overall sensitivity and specificity of 66.7% and 85.4%, respectively, were calculated for IgA detection in M. abscessus-culture positive CF patients, when we combine the results of the two used antigens, thus demonstrating the efficiency in detection of positive cases for these two antigens with IgA isotype. CF patients with a positive culture for M. abscessus had the highest IgA titers against TLR2eF and rPLC. The diagnosis of NTM infections, including those due to M. abscessus, can be improved by the addition of an IgA serological assay, especially when cultures, for example, are negative. Based on these promising results, a serological follow-up of a larger number of patients should be performed to determine if the IgA response may be correlated with an active/acute infection state or a very recent infection.

It has recently emerged as responsible for severe pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or those who have undergone lung transplantation. In addition, it represents the most antibiotic resistant mycobacterial species. However, despite its increasing clinical importance, very little is known about the use of M. abscessus parietal compounds and the host response. This has led to the development of serological tests to measure the antibody response in infected patients, and potentially to link this to the culture of respiratory samples. Herein, we describe an important analysis of the serological IgA response from CF patients, and we demonstrate the full diagnostic usefulness of this assay in the diagnosis of NTM infections, and more particularly M. abscessus, in CF patients.","output":"IgA Serological Response for the Diagnosis of Mycobacterium abscessus Infections in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the VECMA toolkit (VECMAtk), a flexible software environment for single and multiscale simulations that introduces directly applicable and reusable procedures for verification, validation (V&V), sensitivity analysis (SA) and uncertainty quantification (UQ).

This paper presents the initial findings of the symptomatology, neurocognitive, and pathophysiological changes in CTE (SNAP-CTE) study. A preliminary, retrospective, cohort study of 28 patients (25 males and 3 females) presenting with complaints of mood, behavioral, and cognitive decline, comprising TES, aged 24 to 78 years (M = 53, SD = 15.3) with at least 10 years of exposure to RC/SCI (mostly through contact sport) and cognitive decline were examined including: demographics; duration of play; age of first exposure to RC/SCI; and neuropsychology. Participants performed significantly worse in tests of auditory, visual, immediate, and delayed memory compared to a normative sample. Those with absent insight, compared to those with preserved insight, had a larger discrepancy between predicted and actual auditory memory scores, and had more severe mood disturbances.

Here, we describe the case of a 45-year-old male, successfully treated for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The patient was feeling sick in early April 2020; he had a fever and pharyngodynia. When he came to our COVID hospital, his breathing was normal. The nasopharyngeal swab specimen turned out positive. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed mild interstitial pneumonia. The patient was admitted to our department and treated with hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, darunavir, azithromycin and enoxaparin. On day seven of the disease, the patient's respiratory condition got worse as he was developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was given tocilizumab and corticosteroids and was immediately treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). His condition improved, and in the ensuing days, the treatment gradually switched to a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC); after 18 days, the patient's clinical condition was good.The successful results we have been able to obtain are closely associated with avoidance of invasive ventilation that may lead to intensive care unit (ICU)-related superinfections.

We measured the proportion of seroconverted employees and evaluated risk factors for seroconversion during the first pandemic wave. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we recruited Geneva University Hospitals employees and sampled them 3 times, every 3 weeks from March 30 to June 12, 2020. We measured the proportion of seroconverted employees and determined prevalence ratios of risk factors for seroconversion using multivariate mixed-effects Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 3,421 participants (29% of all employees) were included, with 92% follow-up. The proportion of seroconverted employees increased from 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7%-5.1%) at baseline to 8.5% [(95% CI, 7.6%-9.5%) at the last visit. The proportions of seroconverted employees working in COVID-19 geriatrics and rehabilitation (G&R) wards (32.3%) and non-COVID-19 G&R wards (12.3%) were higher compared to office workers (4.9%) at the last visit. Only nursing assistants had a significantly higher risk of seroconversion compared to office workers (11.7% vs 4.9%; P = .006). Significant risk factors for seroconversion included the use of public transportation (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.25-2.03), known community exposure to severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (2.80; 95% CI, 2.22-3.54), working in a ward with a nosocomial COVID outbreak (2.93; 95% CI, 2.27-3.79), and working in a COVID-19 G&R ward (3.47; 95% CI, 2.45-4.91) or a non-COVID-19 G&R ward (1.96; 95% CI, 1.46-2.63).

The aim of this study was to better understand the effectiveness of low-dose emetine for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In this real-world study, 63 patients with mild or common COVID-19 were recruited from Wuhan Fangcang Shelter Hospital and five COVID-19-designated hospitals in Anhui Province, China from February to March 2020. Thirty-nine patients from Wuhan Fangcang Shelter Hospital were assigned to a pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial, and 24 patients from the 5 COVID-19-designated hospitals in Anhui Province underwent a real-world study. The medication course of emetine was less than 10 days. The main symptoms and adverse reactions of all patients were observed and recorded. The primary outcome measure was the time required for a negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA result or the negative result rate on day 10. Secondary outcomes included axillary temperature, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, and respiratory frequency recovery. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University on February 20, 2019 (approval No. PJ2020-03-19) and was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on February 20, 2019 (registration number: ChiCTR2000030022). RESULTS: The oxygen saturation values were higher in the treatment group than in the control group on the first day after enrollment for patients treated at Fangcang Shelter Hospital. The axillary body temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation among patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital were related to the time effect but not to the intervention measures. The respiratory rate and oxygen saturation of patients in the Anhui designated hospitals were related to the intervention measures but not to the time effect. The axillary body temperature of patients in Anhui designated hospitals was related to the time effect but not to the intervention measures.

Like other members of the family Peribunyaviridae, the viral genome exists as 3 single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments. The medium-sized segment encodes a viral glycoprotein complex (GPC) that is proteolytically processed into two viral envelope proteins, Gn and Gc, responsible for attachment and membrane fusion.

VSV-OROV lacking this variable region of Gc was also immunogenic in mice producing neutralizing sera that recognize additional regions of Gc. Challenge of both sets of immunized mice with wild-type OROV shows that the VSV-OROV chimeras reduce wild-type viral infection and suggest that antibodies that recognize the variable N terminus of Gc afford less protection than those that target more conserved regions of Gc.","output":"Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Chimeras Expressing the Oropouche Virus Glycoproteins Elicit Protective Immune Responses in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the interaction between (1) sleep and the COVID-19 pandemic; and (2) social cumulative risk and COVID-19 pandemic on executive function (EF).

Gastric ultrasound was performed in the semirecumbent and right lateral decubitus positions for a qualitative assessment of gastric contents, using a 0-2 grading scale. A final induction plan was made based on this assessment. Immediately after tracheal intubation, gastric contents were suctioned through a multi-orifice nasogastric tube; these were defined as above risk threshold for regurgitation and aspiration if there was clear fluid > 0.8 ml.kg-1 , and/or the presence of thick fluid and/or solid particles. Gastric ultrasound was feasible in 130 out of 143 (90%) of children, and led to a change in the planned induction technique in 67 patients: 30 from routine to rapid sequence, and 37 from rapid sequence to routine. An appropriate induction technique was therefore performed in 85% of children, vs. 49% planned after pre-operative clinical assessment alone (p < 0.00001).

More than 3.1 million have died from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. The virus affects mainly the upper respiratory tract and the lungs causing pneumonias of varying severity. Moreover, via direct and indirect pathogenetic mechanisms, SARS-CoV-2 may lead to a variety of extrapulmonary as well as vascular manifestations. METHODS Based on a systematic literature search via PubMed, original research articles, meta-analyses, reviews, and case reports representing the current scientific knowledge regarding diagnostic imaging of COVID-19 were selected. Focusing on the imaging appearance of pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations as well as indications for imaging, these data were summarized in the present review article and correlated with basic pathophysiologic mechanisms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Typical signs of COVID-19 pneumonia are multifocal, mostly bilateral, rounded, polycyclic or geographic ground-glass opacities and/or consolidations with mainly peripheral distribution. In severe cases, peribronchovascular lung zones are affected as well. Other typical signs are the \\"crazy paving\\" pattern and the halo and reversed halo (the latter two being less common). Venous thromboembolism (and pulmonary embolism in particular) is the most frequent vascular complication of COVID-19. However, arterial thromboembolic events like ischemic strokes, myocardial infarctions, and systemic arterial emboli also occur at higher rates. The most frequent extrapulmonary organ manifestations of COVID-19 affect the central nervous system, the heart, the hepatobiliary system, and the gastrointestinal tract. Usually, they can be visualized in imaging studies as well. The most important imaging modality for COVID-19 is chest CT. Its main purpose is not to make the primary diagnosis, but to differentiate COVID-19 from other (pulmonary) pathologies, to estimate disease severity, and to detect concomitant diseases and complications. KEY POINTS  Typical signs of COVID-19 pneumonia are multifocal, mostly peripheral ground-glass opacities/consolidations..  Imaging facilitates differential diagnosis, estimation of disease severity, and detection of complications..  Venous thromboembolism (especially pulmonary embolism) is the predominant vascular complication of COVID-19..

Some states made the decision to lift mask mandates starting spring 2021. Data-driven methods help evaluate the appropriateness and consequences of such decisions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of lifting the mask mandate with changes in the cumulative coronavirus case rate. DESIGN: Synthetic control study design on lifting mask mandate in the state of Iowa implemented on February 7, 2021. SETTING: Daily state-level data from the COVID-19 Community Profile Report published by the US Department of Health & Human Services, COVIDcast dataset of the Delphi Research Group, and Google Community Mobility Reports. EXPOSURES AND OUTCOME: Mask mandate policy lift at the state level. State-day observations of the cumulative case rate measured as the cumulative number of new cases per 100,000 people in the previous 7 days. RESULTS: The cumulative case rate in Iowa increased by 20%-30% within 3 weeks of lifting the mask mandate as compared with a synthetic control unit. This association appeared to be related to people, in fact, reducing their mask-wearing habits. CONCLUSIONS: Lifting the mask mandate in Iowa was associated with an increase in new COVID-19 cases.

The bioassays evaluated three scenarios, including the AOM extracted from Chlorella sorokiniana, the quenching condition used in the tests, and the DBPs formed after the chlorination of the two test waters with AOM (with and without bromide presence). The results showed that AOM has no toxic effects for the tested species under typical environmental concentration (5 mg?L-1). However, since AOM is a potential precursor of DBPs, the toxicity of two test waters (TW-1 and TW-2) after the chlorination process (25 mg Cl2L-1, for 7 days, at 20 C) was tested. The sample with higher toxicity to the tested species was TW-1, in which chloroform and chloral hydrate were quantified (615 and 267 g?L-1, respectively). However, TW-2 showed lower concentration of chloroform and chloral hydrate (260 and 157 g?L-1, respectively), although bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform were also detected (464, 366, and 141 g?L-1, respectively). Although free chlorine is highly toxic to the tested species, the quenching conditions also affected the organisms' survival due to the use of ascorbic acid and the presence of reaction intermediates. Nonetheless, both species were more affected by TW-1 and TW-2 than the quenching condition.

It is considered an important drug target for treating SARS-CoV-2 as well as pulmonary diseases, heart failure, hypertension, renal diseases, and diabetes. Despite the critical importance, the mechanism of ligand binding to the human ACE2 receptor remains unknown.

Microsecond time scale LiGaMD simulations have unprecedentedly captured multiple times of spontaneous binding and unbinding of a potent inhibitor MLN-4760 in the ACE2 receptor. With ligand far away in the unbound state, the ACE2 receptor samples distinct Open, Partially Open, Closed, and Fully Closed conformations. Upon ligand binding to the active site, conformational ensemble of the ACE2 receptor is biased toward the Closed state as observed in the X-ray experimental structure. The LiGaMD simulations thus suggest a conformational selection mechanism for ligand recognition by the highly flexible ACE2 receptor, which is expected to facilitate rational drug design targeting human ACE2 against coronaviruses and other related human diseases.","output":"Mechanism of Ligand Recognition by Human ACE2 Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines are the mainstay of influenza prevention.

This tool is useful as it clearly illustrates the evolutionary patterns of different markets, and allows us to identify close relationships with economic fluctuations. We found that German tourism plays a leading role, since its movements are followed with delays by tourism flows from other countries, and exhibits higher resilience to shocks. Also, domestic and Spanish tourism have both displayed less irregular behaviors than tourism from other source markets. On the contrary, tourism from the Netherlands and the UK, have displayed irregular patterns, which demonstrates the urgency to diversify tourism source markets to reduce the country's vulnerability to external shocks and economic cycles.","output":"Monitoring tourism flows and destination management: Empirical evidence for Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The application of disinfection is becoming popular in recent months due to the COVID-19 Usually, the disinfection is used by spraying the liquid into an object However, the disinfection process for humans and objects in the human environment is still done manually and takes time and increases exposure to viruses Robotic technology can be a solution to handle that problem Following that problem, robot design is proposed with many abilities and features The robot can operate in remote conditions and full function for approximately 56 minutes and spray the liquid for more than 1 meter This research can effectively be applied in COVID-19 handlings ? 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science All rights reserved","output":"All-terrain mobile robot disinfectant sprayer to decrease the spread of COVID-19 in open area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FcR activity underpins the role of antibodies in both protective immunity and auto-immunity and importantly, the therapeutic activity of many monoclonal antibody therapies. Some monoclonal anti-FcR antibodies activate their receptors, but the properties required for cell activation are not well defined. Here we examined activation of the most widely expressed human FcR; FcRIIa, by two non-blocking, mAbs, 8.26 and 8.2. Crosslinking of FcRIIa by the mAb F(ab)(2) regions alone was insufficient for activation, indicating activation also required receptor engagement by the Fc region. Similarly, when mutant receptors were inactivated in the Fc binding site, so that intact mAb was only able to engage receptors via its two Fab regions, again activation did not occur. Mutation of FcRIIa in the epitope recognized by the agonist mAbs, completely abrogated the activity of mAb 8.26, but mAb 8.2 activity was only partially inhibited indicating differences in receptor recognition by these mAbs. FcRIIa inactivated in the Fc binding site was next co-expressed with the FcRIIa mutated in the epitope recognized by the Fab so that each mAb 8.26 molecule can contribute only three interactions, each with separate receptors, one via the Fc and two via the Fab regions. When the Fab and Fc binding were thus segregated onto different receptor molecules receptor activation by intact mAb did not occur. Thus, receptor activation requires mAb 8.26 Fab and Fc interaction simultaneously with the same receptor molecules. Establishing the molecular nature of FcR engagement required for cell activation may inform the optimal design of therapeutic mAbs.","output":"Fc Binding by FcRIIa Is Essential for Cellular Activation by the Anti-FcRIIa mAbs 8.26 and 8.2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior to COVID-19 pandemic, Morotai waters was well known as one of the favorite destination for shark watching tourism in Indonesia.

The in vitro cytotoxicity of NKM cells was tenfold higher than that of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The cytotoxicity of NKM cells was negatively correlated with the proportion of T-helper cells (cluster of differentiation: CD3+CD4+ T), and positively correlated with the proportion of NK cells (especially CD56(bright)CD16(bright) NK cells). Then, we defined sub-healthy individuals after measuring Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) expression in PBMCs from 95 donors aged > 50 years. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential clinical application of NKM-cell therapy in 11 patients with malignant lymphoma, one patient with pancreatic cancer, and four sub-healthy individuals. NKM-cell therapy elicited good tolerance and side-effects were not found. In sub-healthy individuals, the proportion of CD3(+)PD-1(+) T cells and CD3(+)CD8(+)PD-1(+) T cells was reduced significantly after NKM-cell treatment.

At the end of the experiment, behavioral reactions, metabolic syndrome indices, thyroid status, and cortisol levels were evaluated. At the second stage, the animals were exposed to short-term acute stress, and the shifts in the hormonal indices were recorded one hour later versus the initial background. A high-calorie diet led to the development of metabolic syndrome, signs of depression, increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine and triiodothyronine serum levels, as well as iodothyronine deiodinase type 1 (D1) activity, in the rat liver. At the same time, there was a decrease in thyroperoxidase activity and an increase in thyroid levels of triglycerides and malondialdehyde. The physiological response to stress in the control rat group included an increase in cortisol and TSH serum levels, however, against the background of a high-calorie diet, no cortisol release into the bloodstream was recorded. Social isolation did not alter normal reactivity of the adrenal cortex, but reduced TSH release in response to acute stress, since the initial level of this hormone was slightly elevated against the background of chronic social isolation stress.

However, limited data on trends in the global burden of T2D attributed to PM2.5, particularly in different regions by social-economic levels. We evaluated the spatio-temporal changes in the disease burden of T2D attributed to PM2.5 from 1990 to 2019 in 204 countries and regions with different socio-demographic indexes (SDI). METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis with data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD2019) database. The burden of T2D attributed to PM2.5, age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rate (ASDR) were estimated according to sex, age, nationality and SDI. The annual percentage change (APCs) and the average annual percentage change (AAPCs) were calculated by using the Joinpoint model to evaluate the changing trend of ASMR and ASDR attributed to PM2.5 from 1990 to 2019. The Gaussian process regression model was used to estimate the relationship of SDI with ASMR and ASDR. RESULTS: Overall, the global burden of T2D attributable to PM2.5 increased significantly since 1990, particularly in the elderly, men, Africa, Asia and low-middle SDI regions. The ASMR and ASDR of T2D attributable to PM2.5 in 2019 were 2.47 (95% CI: 1.71, 3.24) per 100,000 population and 108.98 (95% CI: 74.06, 147.23) per 100,000 population, respectively.

Results: No evidence that exposure to anti-vaccine news reduces SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions was found. However, causal discovery analysis suggested that limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 increases belief in anti-vaccine fake news, and that this belief directly reduces willingness to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2, and may also do so indirectly, by increasing perceived vaccine dangerousness.

Currently, SARS-CoV-2 is affecting over 85.1 million global cases of SARS-CoV-2 (20.7 millions in US) infections with 1.84 million (0.352 million in US) deaths globally. SARS-CoV-2 genome is 30kb in size and makes 29 proteins including key Spike protein (SP) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). The SP facilitates the entry of the virus into human host cells. Interactions of potential drugs with the SP can prevent or inhibit the entry of the virus into the host cells by blocking the interaction. Similarly, the non-structural proteins (nsp) 7 and 8 facilitate the function of the RdRp/nsp12 that is essential for the replication of viral genome leading to multiply and spread of the virus within and from the host. In this study, we have selected 26 known phytochemicals (TC1 - TC26) from medicinally important Ayurvedic plant, Tinospora cordifolia (TC), to study the interactions of these phytochemicals with key SARS-CoV-2 proteins using in silico methods. We have identified promising interactions between TC phytochemicals, and the key SARS-CoV2 proteins that can potentially block the viral entry and/or replication of SARS-CoV-2 thereby preventing and treating COVID19. Methods A molecular docking algorithm, PatchDock, was used to study the interactions between target proteins and phytochemicals of TC. To filter out the redundant docking predictions resulting from the patch matching system, a RMSD clustering calculation is used. The molecular display program, Chimera, was used to display the interactions between the phytochemicals and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Results Of the 26 compounds tested (TC1 - TC26), 11 showed effective binding to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, SP or nsp7/8/12 complex including RdRp. The effectiveness of the docking compounds was measured in terms of atomic contact energy (ACE) Scores and rankings based on clusters. The compounds TC1, TC4, TC10 and TC14 achieved lower scores (of binding) less than -100 showing potential binding to all three viral proteins/complexes, SP, RdRp and nsp7/8/12. Further, analysis indicates that TC4 and TC10 are binding remarkably close to the active site of the SP that binds to the ACE2 receptor of host cells, providing evidence for effective inhibition of the SP. TC1 and TC14 binds between the N-terminal, palm domain, and thumb domain of the RdRp, creating an interaction inside the active site, substantially inhibiting its critical replication function. Conclusion For the first time, we present in silico evidence that TC4 and TC10, and TC1 and TC14 potentially impair the entry and replication of SARS-COV-2 proteins respectively by inhibiting the functions of Spike and RdRp/nsp7-8/12 proteins respectively.","output":"Efficacy of Tinospora cordifolia in treating SARS-CoV-2: in silico studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To evaluate safety, technical and clinical success of embolization of type Ia endoleak (T1a EL) using ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer as embolic agent alone or in combination with other materials.

Perceived stigma was also directly and negatively related to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, whereas having tested negative for COVID diagnosis was positively and directly associated with eudaimonic well-being. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related stigma and appraisals can impair positive feelings about life as well as the pursuit of self-realization and the search for meaning in life. The findings highlight the importance of developing psychological preventive and rehabilitative interventions to help people cope with these risk factors.","output":"Hedonic and eudaimonic well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy: The role of stigma and appraisals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid the pandemic, a second epidemic of preliminary, unverified and misinterpreted research has broken out, reports Graham Lawton.","output":"Science in crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ethical relationships are important among many participants in healthcare, including the ethical relationship between nurse and employer. One aspect of organizational behavior that can impact ethical culture and moral well-being is institutional betrayal. RESEARCH AIM: The purpose of this concept analysis is to develop a conceptual understanding of institutional betrayal in nursing by defining the concept and differentiating it from other forms of betrayal. DESIGN: This analysis uses the method developed by Walker and Avant. RESEARCH CONTEXT: Studies were reviewed using health literature databases with no date restrictions. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Analysis was conducted using established guidelines for ethical research. FINDINGS: Although institutional betrayal is a concept applied in the literature, there was a paucity of studies exploring the concept within nursing. Examples of the concept in the literature include violation of trust between organization (i.e. employer) and nurse, such as provision of inadequate workplace protections, ineffective or hostile management, and gaslighting of those who experience negative events. Examples of institutional betrayal have become more visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: A conceptual definition of institutional betrayal is a deep violation of trust or confidence or violation of moral standards committed by an institution toward a nurse. This definition incorporates experiences and issues suggested by the literature. Outcomes are likely negative, including impacts on nurse psychological and workplace well-being. This concept likely fits within a framework of ethical workplaces and has conceptual relationships with moral distress and moral resilience. Further studies can help qualitatively explore and empirically measure this concept. CONCLUSION: In the pursuit of improving the ethical culture of healthcare workplaces, this concept can provide meaningful insight into organizational behavior and its consequences. Naming and describing the concept can promote conceptual clarity and equip researchers, nurses, and leaders to identify and mitigate the issue.","output":"Institutional betrayal in nursing: A concept analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Before COVID-19, digital divide research among college students was scarce, reinforcing the idea that technology access was nearly universal, with few demographic differences. Pandemic-era research found some technical challenges, but most studies were conducted nationally or at research-intensive (R1) universities, indicating a paucity in research among underrepresented populations, notably Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI). This mixed-methods study aimed to assess digital inequities and pandemic-related technological challenges at an HSI, with high percentages of low-income and first-generation students. This study also sought to determine if findings were consistent with national and R1 research. We surveyed a representative sample of 2188 undergraduates and conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 students. Results showed many students had inadequate technology. Just 79% had the optimal combination of smartphone plus laptop or desktop, with first-generation, low-income, Black, and older students significantly less likely to have this combination and often having to share devices within their households. Internet quality significantly affected all coursework-related challenges, as almost half of students with unstable internet reported trouble completing assignments compared to 20% with stable internet. Finally, results suggest the digital divide may be more prevalent at HSIs than previously studied institutions, while also offering insight into how these challenges affect similar universities.","output":"Digital Divide Issues Affecting Undergraduates at a Hispanic-Serving Institution during the Pandemic: A Mixed-Methods Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Biologic drugs have significantly improved the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). However, the availability of these drugs is limited by their high cost. Infliximab was the first biologic to be approved for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).

AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence on CT-P13 use in IBD, with particular interest in the phase II trials of a subcutaneous version of CT-P13. EXPERT OPINION: Biosimilars, such as CT-P13, are an important resource for health-care systems. Although CT-P13 approval in IBD was based on extrapolation, subsequent studies confirmed its clinical equivalence to originator infliximab. A new subcutaneous formulation of CT-P13 showed promising results in phase I and II trials in both CD and UC. Clinical efficacy and safety were comparable and interestingly serum drug doses appeared to be more stable than conventional intravenous CT-P13. If these preliminary results will be confirmed, the first sub-cutaneous version of infliximab could soon be available for IBD.","output":"Evolution of infliximab biosimilar in inflammatory bowel disease: from intravenous to subcutaneous CT-P13"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virion RNAs from the bovine enteric coronavirus and the human respiratory coronavirus OC43 were compared by one dimensional gel electrophoresis and by oligonucleotide fingerprinting.

This study tries to discover a novel potential inhibitor to the main protease of the virus, by computer aided drug discovery where various major active phytochemicals of the plant Boerhavia diffusa Linn. namely 2-3-4 beta-Ecdysone, Bioquercetin, Biorobin, Boeravinone J, Boerhavisterol, kaempferol, Liriodendrin, quercetin and trans-caftaric acid were docked to SAR-CoV-2 Main Protease using Molecular docking server. The ligands that showed the least binding energy were Biorobin with - 8.17 kcal/mol, Bioquercetin with - 7.97 kcal/mol and Boerhavisterol with - 6.77 kcal/mol. These binding energies were found to be favorable for an efficient docking and resultant inhibition of the viral main protease. The graphical illustrations and visualizations of the docking were obtained along with inhibition constant, intermolecular energy (total and degenerate), interaction surfaces and HB Plot for all the successfully docked conditions of all the 9 ligands mentioned. Additionally the druglikeness of the top 3 hits namely Bioquercetin, Biorobin and Boeravisterol were tested by ADME studies and Boeravisterol was found to be a suitable candidate obeying the Lipinsky's rule. Since the main protease of SARS has been reported to possess structural similarity with the main protease of MERS, comparative docking of these ligands were also carried out on the MERS Mpro, however the binding energies for this target was found to be unfavorable for spontaneous binding. From these results, it was concluded that Boerhavia diffusa possess potential therapeutic properties against COVID-19.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of patients with preexisting lung injury and inflammation are undergoing surgery or artificial ventilation under sedation in intensive care units, where 2,6-diisopropylphenol (propofol) is a commonly used drug for sedation. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether post-inflammation treatment with propofol protects epithelial type II cells against inflammation in an in vitro model of inflammation. The A549 cell line, characterised as epithelial type II cells, were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 2 h and subsequently treated with different concentrations of propofol (0, 10, 25 or 50 M) for 3 h. Western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analyses were used to detect the protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively, of CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the in situ CD14 and TLR4 expression in epithelial type II cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- production was also examined using ELISA. LPS significantly increased the expression of CD14 and TLR4, as well as the secretion of TNF-. Post-treatment with 25 and 50 M propofol of the LPS-treated cells significantly decreased CD14 and TLR4 expression, as well as TNF- secretion, compared with the cells treated with LPS only, indicating that post-treatment with propofol alleviated inflammation and this effect was dose-dependent.

The aim was to detect by molecular methods nucleic acids (NAs) of other respiratory viruses possibly involved in salivary gland swelling. At the same time, paired sera, if available, were tested. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group consisted of 72 buccal swabs from patients of the Clinic of infectious, tropical, and parasitic diseases, Na Bulovce Hospital. Paired sera were available from ten patients. Samples were collected in 2013 to 2015. Buccal swabs were tested by PCR for the presence of NAs of adenoviruses (AdV), bocaviruses (hBoV), parainfluenza viruses of types 1-4 (HPIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses (HCoV: NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Paired sera were screened by the complement fixation test (AdV and influenza A and B viruses), hemagglutination inhibition test (HPIV types 2 and 3), ELISA (AdV, EBV), and immunofluorescence (EBV). RESULTS NAs from viruses other than the mumps virus were detected in 27 of 72 patients with clinical symptoms of parotitis epidemica, and serological tests revealed etiological links with parainfluenza viruses in three more cases. Overall, 30 (41.7%) of 72 patients with suspected mumps tested positive for one or more viruses from the study panel. The most commonly detected viruses were AdV 11/72 (15.3%), EBV 9/72 (12.5%), and HPIV 3/72 (4.2%), but influenza A virus (H3N2) 1/72 (1.4%) was also found. Some patients tested positive for more than one virus: 2/72 (3%) for AdV plus hBoV and 1/72 (1.4%) for HPIV plus HCoV. In addition, examination of paired sera revealed HPIV positivity in three more patients. PCR and serology detected etiological link with HPIV in six (8.3%) of 72 patients tested. CONCLUSION In our study group, nearly 42% of patients with the clinical picture of parotitis epidemica in whom mumps virus (MV) infection was not confirmed by direct detection or serologically tested positive for viruses other than the mumps virus.

This virus is mainly transmitted through exhalations from the airways of infected persons, so that Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems might play a role in increasing or reducing the spreading of the infection in indoor environments. METHODS: We modeled the role of HVAC systems in the diffusion of the contagion through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of cough at the \\"Bambino Ges\\" Vatican State Children's Hospital. Both waiting and hospital rooms were modeled as indoor scenarios. A specific Infection-Index (?) parameter was used to estimate the amount of contaminated air inhaled by each person present in the simulated indoor scenarios. The potential role of exhaust air ventilation systems placed above the coughing patient's mouth was also assessed. RESULTS: Our CFD-based simulations of the waiting room show that HVAC air-flow remarkably enhances infected droplets diffusion in the whole indoor environment within 25 s from the cough event, despite the observed dilution of saliva particles containing the virus. At the same time also their number is reduced due to removal through the HVAC system or deposition on the surfaces. The proper use of Local Exhaust Ventilation systems (LEV) simulated in the hospital room was associated to a complete reduction of infected droplets spreading from the patient's mouth in the first 0.5 s following the cough event. In the hospital room, the use of LEV system completely reduced the ? index computed for the patient hospitalized at the bed next to the spreader, with a decreased possibility of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: CFD-based simulations for indoor environment can be useful to optimize air conditioning flow and to predict the contagion risk both in hospitals/ambulatories and in other public/private settings.","output":"The role of air conditioning in the diffusion of Sars-CoV-2 in indoor environments: A first computational fluid dynamic model, based on investigations performed at the Vatican State Children's hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical treatment outcome of MRONJ (medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw) surgery despite radical osseous removal and primary closure healing still shows differences in terms of outcome and disease recurrence.

AIM: The present study aimed to obtain a preliminary understanding of the changes in people's sexual behavior, as a result of the pandemic, and explore the context in which they manifest. METHODS: A convenience sample of 270 men and 189 women who completed an online survey consisting of 12 items plus an additional question were included in the study. OUTCOMES: The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people's sexual behavior. RESULTS: While there was a wide range of individual responses, our results showed that 44% of participants reported a decrease in the number of sexual partners and about 37% of participants reported a decrease in sexual frequency. Multiple regression analysis showed that age, partner relationship, and sexual desire were closely related to sexual frequency.

In this case-control study, patients were divided into two groups according to their survival (total entry size, n = 21; survivors, n = 13; non-survivors, n = 8). Patients were evaluated using the oral assessment guide from Fukuoka University (OAG-F) and the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) to examine the oral and fecal conditions. A blood-based inflammatory factor, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), was used as an indicator of systemic immunity. The high total OAG-F scores were associated with both elevated BSFS and NLR values, and a mutually positive correlation between BSFS and NLR was observed. This indicated an interplay between oral deterioration, gut dysbiosis, and the impairment of immunity. Furthermore, oral deterioration was more frequently observed in non-survivors on day 14 of ICU admission. In addition, on days 7 and 21 of ICU admission, impaired immunity, reflected by an elevated NLR, was observed in non-survivors.

Pathogenic hantavirus species, such as Puumala virus (PUUV), Hantaan virus (HTNV), Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), and Sin Nombre virus (SNV), are associated with significant case fatality rates. In contrast, Tula virus (TULV) only sporadically causes mild disease in immunocompetent humans and Prospect Hill virus (PHV) so far has not been associated with any symptoms. They are thus defined here as low pathogenic/apathogenic hantavirus species. We found that productive infection of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), such as monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), correlated well with the pathogenicity of hantavirus species tested. HTNV (intermediate case fatality rates) replicated more efficiently than PUUV (low case fatality rates) in myeloid cells, whereas low pathogenic/apathogenic hantavirus species did not produce any detectable virus titers. Analysis of PHPUV, a reassortant hantavirus derived from a pathogenic (PUUV) and an apathogenic (PHV) hantavirus species, indicated that the viral glycoproteins are not decisive for replication in MPS cells. Moreover, blocking acidification of endosomes with chloroquine decreased the number of TULV genomes in myeloid cells suggesting a post-entry block for low pathogenic/apathogenic hantavirus species in myeloid cells. Intriguingly, pathogenic but not low pathogenic/apathogenic hantavirus species induced conversion of monocytes into inflammatory DCs.

A county health ranking and roadmaps program has been established to identify factors associated with disparity in mobility and mortality of COVID-19 in all counties in the United States. The risk factors associated with county-level mortality of COVID-19 with various levels of prevalence are not well understood. METHODS: Using the data obtained from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps program, this study applied a negative binomial design to the county-level mortality counts of COVID-19 as of August 27, 2020 in the United States. In this design, the infected counties were categorized into three levels of infections using clustering analysis based on time-varying cumulative confirmed cases from March 1 to August 27, 2020. COVID-19 patients were not analyzed individually but were aggregated at the county-level, where the county-level deaths of COVID-19 confirmed by the local health agencies. Clustering analysis and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in our statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 3125 infected counties were assigned into three classes corresponding to low, median, and high prevalence levels of infection. Several risk factors were significantly associated with the mortality counts of COVID-19, where higher level of air pollution (0.153, P < 0.001) increased the mortality in the low prevalence counties and elder individuals were more vulnerable in both the median (0.049, P < 0.001) and high (0.114, P < 0.001) prevalence counties. The segregation between non-Whites and Whites (low: 0.015, P < 0.001; median:0.025, P < 0.001; high: 0.019, P = 0.005) and higher Hispanic population (low and median: 0.020, P < 0.001; high: 0.014, P = 0.009) had higher likelihood of risk of the deaths in all infected counties. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of COVID-19 depended on sex, race/ethnicity, and outdoor environment. The increasing awareness of the impact of these significant factors may help decision makers, the public health officials, and the general public better control the risk of pandemic, particularly in the reduction in the mortality of COVID-19.","output":"Risk factors associated with mortality of COVID-19 in 3125 counties of the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) are a mainstay of therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infections and have a profound effect on hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppression.

As the clinical realm has rapidly adjusted to the realities of the pandemic, anesthesiology literature has also changed significantly to reflect this. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had on anesthesiology literature. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the COVID-19-related literature in the anesthesiology community would gain more interest than non-COVID-19-related articles. A total of 15 anesthesiology-related journals with the highest impact factor in 2019, according to the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), were selected for data collection. An advanced PubMed search identified 5,722 COVID-19-related articles published by these journals in 2020. Next, articles with titles including corona, COVID, COVID-19, pandemic, SARS, or SARS-CoV-2 were selected for inclusion in the study, which resulted in 676 (12%) articles. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the Altmetric score, which is a weighted calculation of the attention an article receives online, for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 articles. Articles were then further characterized across multiple different variables, including country of origin, month published, type of article, and subspecialty of anesthesiology it pertained to. Of the 15 journals investigated, 676 (12%) articles of the 5,722 total articles published were found to be COVID-19-related material. The majority of the articles were found to be published in April (18%), May (19.5%), and June (14%). The majority of these articles were related either to general anesthesia (operating room anesthesiology that is not tied to a particular subspecialty fellowship track) (48%) or critical care (39%). By article type, most were determined to be editorial (71%) in nature, followed by original research articles (21%), of which most were cross-sectional (55%) studies. When compared with non-COVID-19-related articles, COVID-19-related articles had a significantly greater Altmetric score (29.518 versus 8.6333, p < 0.001). Of the COVID-19-related articles, original articles had the greatest Altmetric score, when compared to editorials and guidelines (54.794 versus 20.777 versus 40.643, p < 0.002). The response of the academic anesthesiology community to the COVID-19 pandemic was strong and timely, with a particularly strong focus on critical care anesthesia. The impact of the pandemic was strongly felt by the anesthesiology community, and their timely response served to guide our country and world through an incredibly challenging time. The pandemic highlighted the value of anesthesiologists worldwide, not only in the operating room setting but particularly as critical care physicians.","output":"Anesthesiology Articles Published in 2020: A Review and Characterization of COVID-19 Versus Non-COVID-19 Publications in Top Anesthesiology Journals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We quantified the association between public compliance with social distancing measures and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the epidemic (March-May 2020) in 5 states that accounted for half of the total number of COVID-19 cases in the United States. METHODS We used data on mobility and number of COVID-19 cases to longitudinally estimate associations between public compliance, as measured by human mobility, and the daily reproduction number and daily growth rate during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. RESULTS The 5 states mandated social distancing directives during March 19-24, 2020, and public compliance with mandates started to decrease in mid-April 2020. As of May 31, 2020, the daily reproduction number decreased from 2.41-5.21 to 0.72-1.19, and the daily growth rate decreased from 0.22-0.77 to -0.04 to 0.05 in the 5 states. The level of public compliance, as measured by the social distancing index (SDI) and daily encounter-density change, was high at the early stage of implementation but decreased in the 5 states. The SDI was negatively associated with the daily reproduction number (regression coefficients range, -0.04 to -0.01) and the daily growth rate (from -0.009 to -0.01). The daily encounter-density change was positively associated with the daily reproduction number (regression coefficients range, 0.24 to 1.02) and the daily growth rate (from 0.05 to 0.26).

METHODS: In this study, we mathematically modeled and quantified individual CD4+ T-cell reconstitution of a subset of 276 children who started treatment within 6 months of age and achieved sustained viral suppression. Considering natural age differences in CD4+ T-cell dynamics, we fitted distances to age-matched healthy reference values with a linear model approaching an asymptote. RESULTS: Depleted CD4+ percentages (CD4%) and CD4+ counts (CD4ct) restored healthy levels during treatment. CD4ct recovered with a median rate of 4 cells/L/d, and individual recovery rates were correlated negatively with their initial CD4ct. CD4 values at onset of treatment decrease with age, whereas recovery times and levels seem to be age-independent. CD4 recovery correlates positively with viral suppression, and the stabilization of CD4 levels usually occurs after viral suppression. CD4 levels stabilize within 3-13 months after treatment initiation. The recovery dynamics of the CD4% is comparable with those of the CD4ct.

However, there are properties that cannot be immediately proved by means of logical relations, for instance program continuity and differentiability in higher-order languages extended with real-valued functions. Informally, the problem stems from the fact that these properties are naturally expressed on terms of non-ground type (or, equivalently, on open terms of base type), and there is no apparent good definition for a base case (i.e. for closed terms of ground types). To overcome this issue, we study a generalization of the concept of a logical relation, called open logical relation, and prove that it can be fruitfully applied in several contexts in which the property of interest is about expressions of first-order type. Our setting is a simply-typed [Formula: see text] -calculus enriched with real numbers and real-valued first-order functions from a given set, such as the one of continuous or differentiable functions.

Then, we show by way of open logical relations the correctness of the core of a recently published algorithm for forward automatic differentiation.

We focus on a West African country (Benin) to assess the medicinal and spiritual values of pangolins among different ethnic groups and identify the cohort of buyers involved in the pangolin trade and related economic values along the chain, notably from local diasporas. METHODS: We organised 54 focus groups in villages surrounding occurrence habitats of pangolins across Benin and conducted 35 individual interviews with vendors from five major traditional medicine markets (TMMs). Our questionnaire addressed the different uses of pangolins, the commercial value of pangolin items, the categories of clients and the related selling prices. RESULTS: Pangolin meat was strictly consumed as food. Scales, head, bones, tongue, blood, heart and xiphisternum were the items used by local communities as part of medicinal (65% of the focus groups) and spiritual (37%) practices. Scales were the most frequently used item (use value index = 1.56). A total of 42 medicinal and spiritual uses, covering 15 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) categories, were recorded among ethnic groups. The ICD and spiritual categories-based analyses of similarity showed a partial overlapping of ethnozoological knowledge across Benin, although knowledge was significantly influenced by ethnicity and geographic location. The pricing of pangolins both varied with the category of stakeholders (local communities vs. stakeholders of TMMs) and clients (local and West African clients vs. Chinese community) and the type of items sold. The Chinese community was reported to only buy pangolins alive, and average selling prices were 3C8 times higher than those to West African clients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that pangolins in Africa are valuable and versatile resources for consumption and medicinal / spiritual practices. The pangolin trade in Benin is based on an endogenous and complex network of actors that now appears influenced by the specific, high-valued demand from the Chinese diaspora.

Here, we review the research status on the respiratory diseases related with oral microecosystem. Potential mechanisms on how respiratory pathogens colonize oral microecosystem and the role of indigenous oral microbes in pathogenesis of respiratory diseases are also summarized and analyzed. Given the importance of oral plaque control and oral health interventions in controlling or preventing respiratory infection and diseases, we also summarize the oral health management measures and attentions, not only for populations susceptible to respiratory infection like the elderly and hospitalized patients, but also for dentist or oral hygienists who undertake oral health care. In conclusion, the relationship between respiratory diseases and oral microecosystem has been established and supported by growing body of literature. However, etiological evidence on the role of oral microecosystem in the development of respiratory diseases is still insufficient. Further detailed studies focusing on specific mechanisms on how oral microecosystem participate in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases could be helpful to prevent and treat respiratory diseases.","output":"Relationships Between Oral Microecosystem and Respiratory Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We investigated whether heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNP F) stimulates renal ACE-2 expression and prevents TGF-1 signalling, TGF-1 inhibition of Ace-2 gene expression and induction of tubulo-fibrosis in an Akita mouse model of type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Adult male Akita transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing specifically hnRNP F in their renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs) were studied. Non-Akita littermates and Akita mice served as controls. Immortalised rat RPTCs stably transfected with plasmid containing either rat Hnrnpf cDNA or rat Ace-2 gene promoter were also studied. RESULTS: Overexpression of hnRNP F attenuated systemic hypertension, glomerular filtration rate, albumin/creatinine ratio, urinary angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin (Ang) II levels, renal fibrosis and profibrotic gene (Agt, Tgf-1, TGF- receptor II [Tgf-rII]) expression, stimulated anti-profibrotic gene (Ace-2 and Ang 1C7 receptor [MasR]) expression, and normalised urinary Ang 1C7 level in Akita Hnrnpf-Tg mice as compared with Akita mice. In vitro, hnRNP F overexpression stimulated Ace-2 gene promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression, and attenuated Agt, Tgf-1 and Tgf-rII gene expression. Furthermore, hnRNP F overexpression prevented TGF-1 signalling and TGF-1 inhibition of Ace-2 gene expression. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate that hnRNP F stimulates Ace-2 gene transcription, prevents TGF-1 inhibition of Ace-2 gene transcription and induction of kidney injury in diabetes. HnRNP F may be a potential target for treating hypertension and renal fibrosis in diabetes.

The structure shows clear evidence for the inhibitor at the catalytic site of the enzyme, and resolves the conformation of key side chains and ions surrounding the binding pocket. Polymerase activity assays indicate that the inhibitor is weakly incorporated into the RNA primer strand, and suppresses RNA replication in the presence of natural nucleotides. The structure reveals an unusual, non-productive binding mode of favipiravir-RTP at the catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp which explains its low rate of incorporation into the RNA primer strand. Together, these findings inform current and future efforts to develop polymerase inhibitors for SARS coronaviruses.","output":"Structural basis for the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by favipiravir-RTP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Das Pr?sidium der Leibniz Universit?t Hannover (LUH) hat am 26.

Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Patients with diagnoses of URTIs, GIIs and UTIs from 994 general practitioner (GP) and 192 paediatric practices that routinely send anonymous data to the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) were investigated. We studied the differences in recorded URTIs, GIIs and UTIs between April 2019CMarch 2020 (non-pandemic period) and April 2020CMarch 2021 (pandemic period) in terms of rates and baseline characteristics by comparing absolute frequencies. Results Compared with the non-pandemic period, the total number of patients with defined diagnoses was lower in the pandemic period (URTIs: 810,324 vs 520,800; GIIs: 253,029 vs 142,037; UTIs: 132,425 vs 117,932). The number of patients per practice with URTIs (683 vs 439, -36%, p < 0.001) and GIIs (213 vs 120, -44%, p < 0.001) decreased significantly during the pandemic period; the decrease in the number of recorded UTIs was smaller (112 vs 99, -11%, p < 0.05). The decrease in diagnoses was more pronounced among paediatricians than GPs (URTIs: -39% vs -35%; GIIs: -57% vs -39%; UTIs: -15% vs -9%). The decrease in URTIs varied between -35% and -40% depending on the age group. Conclusions Measures introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce transmission of the virus also helped to reduce the spread of non-COVID-19-related URTIs and GIIs. UTIs were impacted to a lesser extent, with rates seeing a slight decrease. An increase in awareness of infectious diseases may have also contributed to the reduction in recorded diagnoses.","output":"Investigation of the prevalence of non-COVID-19 infectious diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly emerged as a global health threat. The purpose of this article is to share our local experience of stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology to minimise COVID-19 infection of both healthcare workers and patients. METHODS: Infection control measures implemented in our ophthalmology clinic are discussed. The measures are based on detailed risk assessment by both local ophthalmologists and infection control experts. RESULTS: A three-level hierarchy of control measures was adopted. First, for administrative control, in order to lower patient attendance, text messages with an enquiry phone number were sent to patients to reschedule appointments or arrange drug refill. In order to minimise cross-infection of COVID-19, a triage system was set up to identify patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, acute conjunctivitis or recent travel to outbreak areas and to encourage these individuals to postpone their appointments for at least 14 days. Micro-aerosol generating procedures, such as non-contact tonometry and operations under general anaesthesia were avoided. Nasal endoscopy was avoided as it may provoke sneezing and cause generation of droplets. All elective clinical services were suspended. Infection control training was provided to all clinical staff. Second, for environmental control, to reduce droplet transmission of COVID-19, installation of protective shields on slit lamps, frequent disinfection of equipment, and provision of eye protection to staff were implemented. All staff were advised to measure their own body temperatures before work and promptly report any symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting or diarrhoea. Third, universal masking, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were promoted. CONCLUSION: We hope our initial experience in stepping up infection control measures for COVID-19 infection in ophthalmology can help ophthalmologists globally to prepare for the potential community outbreak or pandemic. In order to minimise transmission of COVID-19, ophthalmologists should work closely with local infection control teams to implement infection control measures that are appropriate for their own clinical settings.","output":"Stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology during the novel coronavirus outbreak: an experience from Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are many patients who require continuous monitoring of vital signs and their sleep position such as bedbound patients and hospitalized patients. Also, in some cases, like COVID-19, it is critical for a caregiver to keep a safe distance to the patient. For remote monitoring, radar technologies have been shown to be promising. Thus, in this paper, we present a novel solution for the remote breath and sleep position monitoring by using a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) radar. Our proposed system could monitor a number of people simultaneously, and therein we use a high-resolution direction of arrival (DOA) detection for finding close targets. Furthermore, the sleep position of each target is determined using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The breath analysis involves designing an optimum filter for estimating both the breathing rate and the noiseless breathing waveform. Furthermore, we tested the system by hand-made targets and real human targets. The radar placed in a bedroom environment above a bed where two subjects were sleeping next to each other. For the breathing rate, the accuracy of the radar is more than 97% for human subjects compared with a reference sensor. Also, the sleep position correct detection is more than 83%.","output":"Remote Health Monitoring System for Bedbound Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/aim: Based on the antiviral and antibacterial properties of aluminum salts, we aimed to find out the influence of aluminum salts on COVID-19 infected patients. Materials and methods: We performed an observational retrospective cohort study which includes the patients diagnosed as COVID-19 and received aluminum salts in addition to actual treatments during hospitalization as the treatment group (Alum Group). Patients who received standard COVID-19 treatment protocols in the Infectious Diseases Clinics were included as the Control Group. Clinical findings, laboratory parameters, length of stay, survival, radiological follow-up, intensive care and mechanical ventilation needs, the presence of comorbidity, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, symptoms, symptom recovery times, hospital stay times, treatment protocols, and clinical presence of pneumonia were examined in all patients. Advanced chemical composition analyzes of existing aluminum salts were also performed. Results: A total of 109 patients, 54 in the alum group and 55 in the control group, were included in the study. None of the patients in the aluminum group developed side effects due to the intake of aluminum salt. Survival status was significantly different between the two groups as there were 5 loss in the Control Group and none in the Alum Group (P = 0.023). The symptom recovery time was significantly shorter in the Alum Group; 2 (1-3) vs. 1 (1-2) days, P = 0.003. According to the paired samples analyses of the comparison between hospitalization and discharge, CRP levels significantly drops in the Alum Group (from 54.09 to 27, P = 0.001) but not in the Control Group. The drop was significantly same for the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and procalcitonin levels with P = 0.001. Conclusion: It has been observed that aluminum salts have beneficial effects in COVID-19 infected cases.

To date, 463,000 people died worldwide due to this disease. Several attempts have been taken in search of effective drugs to control the spread of SARS CoV-2 infection. The main protease (Mpro) from SARS CoV-2 plays a vital role in viral replication and thus serves as an important drug target. This Mpro shares a high degree of sequence similarity (>96%) with the same protease from SARS CoV-1 and MERS. It was already reported that Broussonetia papyrifera polyphenols efficiently inhibit the catalytic activity of SARS CoV-1 and MERS Mpro. But whether these polyphenols exhibit any inhibitory effect on SARS CoV-2 Mpro is far from clear. To understand this fact, here we have adopted computational approaches. Polyphenols having proper drug-likeness properties and two repurposed drugs (lopinavir and darunavir; having binding affinity ?7.3 to ?7.4 kcal/mol) were docked against SARS CoV-2 Mpro to study their binding properties. Only six polyphenols (broussochalcone A, papyriflavonol A, 3'-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-3',4',7-trihydroxyflavane, broussoflavan A, kazinol F and kazinol J) had interaction with both the catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of Mpro and exhibited good binding affinity (?7.6 to ?8.2 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamic simulations (100 ns) revealed that all Mpro-polyphenol complexes are more stable, conformationally less fluctuated; slightly less compact and marginally expanded than Mpro-darunavir/lopinavir complex. Even the number of intermolecular H-bond and MM-GBSA analysis suggested that these six polyphenols are more potent Mpro inhibitors than the two repurposed drugs (lopinavir and darunavir) and may serve as promising anti-COVID-19 drugs.

Older adults, particularly residents of nursing facilities, represent a small percentage of the population but account for 40% of mortality from COVID-19 in the United States. Racial and ethnic minority individuals, particularly Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous Americans have experienced higher rates of infection and death than the White population. Although there has been an unprecedented explosion of clinical trials to examine potential therapies, participation by members of these vulnerable communities is crucial to obtaining data generalizable to those communities. METHODS: We undertook an open-label, factorial randomized clinical trial examining hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin for hospitalized patients. RESULTS: Of 53 screened patients, 11 (21%) were enrolled. Ten percent (3/31) of Black patients were enrolled, 33% (7/21) of White patients, and 50% (6/12) of Hispanic patients. Forty-seven percent (25/53) of patients declined participation despite eligibility; 58%(18/31) of Black patients declined participation. Forty percent (21/53) of screened patients were from a nursing facility and 10% (2/21) were enrolled. Enrolled patients had fewer comorbidities than nonenrolled patients: median modified Charlson comorbidity score 2.0 (interquartile range 0C2.5), versus 4.0 (interquartile range 2C6) for nonenrolled patients (P = 0.006). The limitations of the study were the low participation rate and the multiple treatment trials concurrently recruiting at our institution. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of nonparticipation in our trial of nursing facility residents and Black people emphasizes the concern that clinical trials for therapeutics may not target key populations with high mortality rates.","output":"COVID-19 Trials: Who Participates and Who Benefits?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This case highlights challenges in the assessment and management of the \\"difficult airway\\" patient in the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic era.

METHODS: STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and enrolled in the ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 registry were included in the present sub-analysis and divided according to RASI therapy at admission. RESULTS: Our population is represented by 6095 patients, of whom 3654 admitted in 2019 and 2441 in 2020. No difference in the prevalence of SARSCoV2 infection was observed according to RASI therapy at admission (2.5% vs 2.1%, p = 0.5), which was associated with a significantly lower mortality (adjusted OR [95% CI]=0.68 [0.51-0.90], P = 0.006), confirmed in the analysis restricted to 2020 (adjusted OR [95% CI]=0.5[0.33-0.74], P = 0.001).

Results Concerning the median distances of dispersion, all masks were able to decrease the impulse dispersion of the aerosols to the front. In contrast, the dispersion to the sides and to the top was increased. The evaluation revealed that most of the subjects would reject performing a concert with any of the masks.

MethodsCOVID-19 case series (March 6, 2020 - January 10, 2021) were shifted by 9 days to approximate the infection date. We analyzed the effects of state and county policies on Rt using EpiEstim. We performed linear regression to evaluate if per-capita cumulative case count varies across counties with different population size. ResultsRt shifted from 2-3 in March to <1 during April and May. Rt rose over the summer and stayed between 1.4 and 0.7. The introduction of statewide mask mandates was associated with a decline in Rt (-15.3%; 95% CrI, -13.6%, -16.8%), and school re-opening, an increase by 12.3% (95% CrI, 10.1%, 14.4%).

The SARS-CoV-2 S RBD is a major target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that block RBD - ACE2 interactions. In this report, NAb-RBD binding epitopes in the protein databank were classified as C1, C1D, C2, C3, or C4, using a RBD binding profile (BP), based on NAb-specific RBD buried surface area and used to predict the binding epitopes of a series of uncharacterized NAbs. Naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence variation was also quantified to predict NAb binding sensitivities to the RBD-variants. NAb and ACE2 binding studies confirmed the NAb classifications and determined whether the RBD variants enhanced ACE2 binding to promote viral infectivity, and/or disrupted NAb binding to evade the host immune response. Of 9 single RBD mutants evaluated, K417T, E484K, and N501Y disrupted binding of 65% of the NAbs evaluated, consistent with the assignment of the SARS-CoV-2 P.1 Japan/Brazil strain as a variant of concern (VoC). RBD variants E484K and N501Y exhibited ACE2 binding equivalent to a Wuhan-1 reference SARS-CoV-2 RBD. While slightly less disruptive to NAb binding, L452R enhanced ACE2 binding affinity. Thus, the L452R mutant, associated with the SARS-CoV-2 California VoC (B.1.427/B.1.429-California), has evolved to enhance ACE2 binding, while simultaneously disrupting C1 and C2 NAb classes.

The comprehensive analysis showed that GLY1 and SKP1, instead of two traditionally used RGs (eIF1 and ACT2), were the most stable genes across diverse A. tuberosum tissues, indicating the necessity to carefully validate the stability of RGs prior to their use for normalizations. As indicated by geNorm, the normalizations with at least two RGs could give more accurate results. qRT-PCR experiments were conducted with randomly selected genes, demonstrating that normalization with a combination of GLY1 and SKP1 resulted in reliable normalization results. Our finding represents the first attempt toward establishing a standardized qRT-PCR analysis in this economically important vegetable.","output":"Determination of reliable reference genes for gene expression studies in Chinese chive (Allium tuberosum) based on the transcriptome profiling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compare different methods of estimating the basic reproduction number, R0, focusing on the early stages of an epidemic, and considering weekly reports of new infecteds.

However, pulmonary and extrapulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 after recovery from the acute disease are unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation were included and followed 6 weeks after discharge. Body plethysmography, lung diffusion capacity (DLco), blood gas analysis (ABG), 6-min walk test (6MWT), echocardiography, and laboratory tests were performed. Quality of life (QoL), depression, and anxiety were assessed using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: 33 patients with severe disease were included. Patients were discharged without prophylactic anticoagulation. At follow-up there were no thromboembolic complications in any patient. 11 patients (33%) had dyspnea, 11 (33%) had cough, and 15 (45%) suffered from symptoms of fatigue. Pulmonary function tests including ABG did not reveal any limitations (TLC: median = 94% of predicted [IQR:85C105]; VC: 93% [78C101]; FEV1: 95% [72C103]; FEV1/FVC 79% [76C85]; PaO2: 72 mmHg [67C79]; PaCO2: 38 mmHg (Xu et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Ware, 2013) [35-38], except for slightly reduced DLco (77% [69C95]). There were no echocardiographic impairments. 6MWT distance was reduced in most patients without oxygen desaturation.

We also evaluated the associations of perceived change in MVPA and sedentary behaviors with measures of psychological distress. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 317 mothers living with children (0C20 years old) at home. Mothers self-reported perceived changes in MVPA and sedentary behaviors from before the pandemic to during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and early reopening, and levels of depression and anxiety symptomatology, perceived stress, and positive and negative affect during the pandemic. RESULTS: Compared to pre-pandemic levels, 39% of mothers reported engaging less in MVPA, and 63% reported engaging in more sedentary activities. One-quarter and 31% of mothers reported moderate/severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, and 78% medium/high levels of perceived stress. Adjusted linear regression analyses revealed that reduced MVPA and increased sedentary behaviors were associated with high average scores of depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, negative affect, and low scores of positive affect.

However, race/ethnicity data are often not captured in population-level traffic safety databases, limiting the field's ability to comprehensively study racial/ethnic differences in transportation outcomes, as well as our ability to mitigate them. To overcome this limitation, we explored the utility of estimating race and ethnicity for drivers in the New Jersey Safety and Health Outcomes (NJ-SHO) data warehouse using the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) algorithm. In addition, we summarize important recommendations established to guide researchers developing and implementing racial and ethnic disparity research. METHODS We applied BISG to estimate population-level race/ethnicity for New Jersey drivers in 2017 and evaluated the concordance between reported values available in integrated administrative sources (e.g., hospital records) and BISG probability distributions using an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) within each race/ethnicity category. Overall AUC was calculated by weighting each AUC value by the population count in each reported category. In an exemplar analysis using 2017 crash data, we conducted an analysis of average monthly police-reported crash rates in 2017 by race/ethnicity using the NJ-SHO and BISG sets of race/ethnicity values to compare their outputs. RESULTS We found excellent or outstanding concordance (AUC 0.86) between reported race/ethnicity and BISG probabilities for White, Hispanic, Black, and Asian/Pacific Islander drivers. We found poor concordance for American Indian/Alaskan Native drivers (AUC= 0.65), and concordance was no better than random assignment for Multiracial drivers (AUC = 0.52). Among White, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaskan native drivers, monthly crash rates calculated using both NJ-SHO reported race/ethnicity values and BISG probabilities were similar. Monthly crash rates differed by 11% for Black drivers, and by more than 200% for Multiracial drivers. CONCLUSION Findings of excellent or outstanding concordance between and mostly similar crash rates derived from reported race/ethnicity and BISG probabilities for White, Hispanic, Black, and Asian/Pacific Islander drivers (98.9% of all drivers in this sample) demonstrate the potential utility of BISG in enabling research on transportation disparities and inequities. Concordance between race/ethnicity values were not acceptable for American Indian/Alaskan Native and Multiracial drivers, which is similar to previous applications and evaluations of BISG. Future work is needed to determine the extent to which BISG may be applied to traffic safety contexts.","output":"Facilitating research on racial and ethnic disparities and inequities in transportation: Application and evaluation of the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) algorithm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite in the lumen of the human large intestine, occasionally spreads to the liver and induces amebic liver abscesses (ALAs).

The epidemiological consequences of homophily regarding other beliefs as well as correlations among beliefs or circumstances are poorly understood, however. Here, we use a simple compartmental disease model as well as a more complex COVID-19 model to study how homophily and correlation of beliefs and circumstances in a social interaction network affect the probability of disease outbreak and COVID-19-related mortality. We find that the current social context, characterized by the presence of homophily and correlations between who vaccinates, who engages in risk reduction, and individual risk status, corresponds to a situation with substantially worse disease burden than in the absence of heterogeneities. In the presence of an effective vaccine, the effects of homophily and correlation of beliefs and circumstances become stronger. Further, the optimal vaccination strategy depends on the degree of homophily regarding vaccination status as well as the relative level of risk mitigation high- and low-risk individuals practice.

Infected animals show viral RNA and may show clinical symptoms. It is known that the virus originated from some animals, while others may be carriers. Moreover, it can be that wild as well as domestic and farm animals are in close contact with humans. Therefore, it is advisable to conduct a study of the degree of threat to humans associated with the persistence of the virus in animal communities. Conclusion.

However, the feasibility of using STAT for translumenal organ resection is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the technical performance of organ resection using STAT, the integrity of the STAT gastric tunnel after organ resection, and the postoperative morbidity of organ resection using STAT. METHODS In this study, 14 domestic swine underwent transgastric organ resection (7 cholecystectomies, 7 uterine horn resections) followed by sequential removal of two different sizes of standardized specimens. Evaluation of operative injury to the tunnel and difficulty of specimen extraction was performed. After 2 weeks of observation, necropsy was performed for evaluation and documentation of gross findings. RESULTS The mean operating room time (intubation recovery) was 4.1 h. A tunnel with a mean length of 12 cm and a mean width of 4 cm was created. The tunnel remained fully intact in 14 of 14 animals after organ resection, in 13 of 13 animals after balloon extraction, and in 12 of 14 animals after rigid specimen extraction (1 clinically significant tear occurred). Postoperatively, all the animals gained weight appropriately. Necropsy findings included adhesions (n = 4), bile leak (n = 2), minor lap-port abscess (n = 1), and ventral hernia (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS Although this study was a limited, prospective, animal survival study without a control arm, it again indicates that STAT allows safe abdominal access, a reliable means of closure, and directed endoscope positioning. Although one significant mucosal tear did occur, this study suggests STAT will tolerate the mechanical forces of peroral transgastric procedures provided the organ resected is small to moderate in size (<8  3 cm).","output":"Durability of the self-approximating translumenal access technique (STAT) for potential use in natural orifice translumenal surgery (NOTES)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: During this COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan is one of the few countries where fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and endoscopic activity for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening keeps ongoing We aimed to investigate how screening uptake and colonoscopy rate were affected in one of the biggest screening hubs in Northern Taiwan METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study tracing and analyzing the screening uptake and the trend of compliance to diagnostic colonoscopy in FIT positive subjects in the National Taiwan University Hospital screening hub since the outbreak of COVID-19 and compared it with that of the corresponding periods in the past three years Cancellation and rescheduling rates of colonoscopy, and related reasons were also explored RESULTS: Screening uptake during December 2019 to April 2020 was 88 8 %, which was significantly lower than that in the corresponding period of the past three years (91 2-92 7%, p for trend &lt;0 0001) Colonoscopy rate in this period was 66 1%, which was also significantly lower than that in the past three years (70 2%-77 5%;p for trend =0 017) Rescheduling or cancellation rate was up to 10 9%, which was significantly higher than that in the past 3 years (p for trend=0 023) and half of them was due to the fear of being infected DISCUSSION: FIT screening was significantly affected by COVID-19 pandemic In order to resume the practice in COVID-19 era, screening organizers should consider various approaches to secure timely diagnosis of CRC","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on fecal immunochemical test screening uptake and compliance to diagnostic colonoscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Background In the absence of a treatment still considered universally effective, and of a vaccine validated by the health authorities, we wanted to know which Catholic saint the European Christian community turned to in the event of infection with Covid-19 to request a miraculous healing Methodology An online survey was carried out on a sample of 1158 adults using social media tools Results All results are presented in this research, with a few saints in the majority, and some dictated by the symptomatology of the Covid-19 infection or the personalities of certain ? doctor guru ?

Ror1 and/or Ror2-mediated signaling plays essential roles in regulating cell polarity, migration, proliferation and differentiation during developmental morphogenesis, tissue-/organo-genesis and regeneration of adult tissues following injury. Ror1 and Ror2 are expressed abundantly in developing tissues in an overlapping, yet distinct manner, and their expression in adult tissues is restricted to specific cell types such as tissue stem/progenitor cells. Expression levels of Ror1 and/or Ror2 in the adult tissues are increased following injury, thereby promoting regeneration or repair of these injured tissues. On the other hand, disruption of Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling is implicated in senescence of tissue stem/progenitor cells that is related to the impaired regeneration capacity of aged tissues. In fact, Ror1 and Ror2 are implicated in age-related diseases, including tissue fibrosis, atherosclerosis (or arteriosclerosis), neurodegenerative diseases, and cancers. In these diseases, enhanced and/or sustained (chronic) expression of Ror1 and/or Ror2 is observed, and they might contribute to the progression of these diseases through Wnt5a-dependent and -independent manners.

Results: We determined that 1051 patients were followed up with COVID-19 infection and 43 (4%) of them were cancer patients. The mean age of the patients was 64.3  12.3 years. Lung cancer is the most common cancer type among the patients (23.2%). Dyspnea (51.2%) was the most common symptom in the first admission. Typical ground-glass consolidation or patchy appearance with peribronchial thickening resembling bronchopneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was present in 29 (67.4%) patients.

This study introduced two new indices into the popular while perfect-mixing-based Wells-Riley model for predicting airborne virus related infection probability C the underlying reasons for keeping adequate social distance and space ventilation. The distance index P dcan be obtained by theoretical analysis on droplet distribution and transmission from human respiration activities, and the ventilation index E zrepresents the system-dependent air distribution efficiency in a space. The study indicated that 1.6?3.0 m (5.2C9.8 ft) is the safe social distance when considering aerosol transmission of exhaled large droplets from talking, while the distance can be up to 8.2 m (26 ft) if taking into account of all droplets under calm air environment. Because of unknown dose response to COVID-19, the model used one actual pandemic case to calibrate the infectious dose (quantum of infection), which was then verified by a number of other existing cases with short exposure time (hours). Projections using the validated model for a variety of scenarios including transportation vehicles and building spaces illustrated that (1) increasing social distance (e.g., halving occupancy density) can significantly reduce the infection rate (20C40 %) during the first 30 min even under current ventilation practices; (2) minimum ventilation or fresh air requirement should vary with distancing condition, exposure time, and effectiveness of air distribution systems.","output":"The efficacy of social distance and ventilation effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changes in the osmolality and level of angiotensin II (ANG II) are important peripheral signals modulating appropriate central sympathetic output and maintaining a normal arterial pressure during high salt intake.

We, therefore, hypothesized that the MnPO is a crucial part of the central neuronal mechanisms mediating the blood pressure control by altered osmolality and/or ANG II signaling during chronic high dietary salt intake. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either sham (operation), or electrolytic lesion of the MnPO. After a 7-day recovery, rats were instrumented with radiotelemetric transducers and aortic flow probes for the measurement of the mean arterial pressure + heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO), respectively. Femoral venous catheters were also implanted to collect blood for the measurements of plasma osmolality and sodium concentration, as well as plasma renin activity. Rats were given another 10 days to recover and then were subjected to a 28-day-long study protocol that included a 7-day control period (1.0% NaCl diet), followed by 14 days of high salt (4.0% NaCl), and a 7-day recovery period (1.0% NaCl). The data showed, that despite a slight increase in the MAP observed in both MnPO- (n = 12) and sham-lesioned (n = 8) rats during the high-salt period, there were no significant differences between the MAP, HR, and CO in the two groups throughout the study protocol. These findings do not support the hypothesis that the MnPO is necessary to maintain normal blood pressure during high dietary salt intake. However, MnPO-lesioned rats showed less sodium balance than sham-lesioned rats during the first 4 days of high salt intake. Although, these results may be explained partly by the plasma hyperosmolarity and hypernatremia observed in MnPO-lesioned rats; they also shed light on the role of the MnPO in central neuronal control of renal sodium handling during chronic high dietary salt intake.","output":"Role of the Median Preoptic Nucleus in Arterial Pressure Regulation and Sodium and Water Homeostasis during High Dietary Salt Intake"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This short paper aims to present some philosophical considerations about the relationship between credibility and the uses of evidence.

It appears that such preventive measures are critical to \\"flattening the curve\\" of the spread of the Coronavirus. The public's adoption of such behaviors, barring an effective vaccine or cure, is an essential component in the battle against what has been referred to as the \\"invisible enemy\\". OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the present study was to develop a model for predicting COVID-19 among US college students. The Health Belief Model (HBM) has a long history of use and empirical support in predicting preventive health behaviors but is not without its purported shortcomings. The present study identifies a more optimal, and defensible, combination of variables to explain preventive behaviors among college students. This segment of the US population is critical in helping slow the spread of the Coronavirus because of its relative reluctance to perform the needed behaviors given they do not feel susceptible or fearful of the COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A sample of 415 US college students were surveyed via Qualtrics and asked to answer questions regarding their fear of COVID-19, information receptivity (seeking relevant information), perceived knowledge of the disease, self-efficacy, and performance of preventive behaviors. The PROCESS Model 6 was used to test our conceptual model including predictions involving sequential mediation. RESULTS: Sequential mediation results show that fear of COVID-19 leads individuals to seek out information regarding the disease, which increases their perceived knowledge and fosters self-efficacy which is key to driving preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Self-imposed preventive measures can drastically impact the rate of infection among populations. Based upon the study's newly created sequential mediation model, communication strategies for encouraging COVID-19 preventive behaviors are offered. It is clear that college students, and very possibly adults of all ages, must have a healthy fear of COVID-19 to set in motion a process where concerned individuals seek COVID-19 related information, increasing their store of knowledge concerning the disease, enhancing their self-efficacy and ultimately their likelihood of performing the needed preventive behaviors.","output":"Flattening the Curve: Development of a Sequential Mediation Model to Better Predict COVID-19 Preventive Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ever since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, mucocutaneous manifestations started being noticed and are still being documented.

The goal of this study was to undertake a pilot study in mice of a novel ultrashort vaccine immunotherapy regimen incorporating various adjuvants to assess its ability to treat allergic bronchial asthma caused by wormwood pollen. We evaluated in a mouse model of wormwood pollen allergy candidates comprising recombinant Art v 1 wormwood pollen protein formulated with either newer (Advax, Advax-CpG, ISA-51) or more traditional [aluminum hydroxide, squalene water emulsion (SWE)] adjuvants administered by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route vs. intranasal administration of a mucosal vaccine formulation using chitosan-mannose nanoparticle entrapped with Art v 1 protein. The vaccine formulations were administered to previously wormwood pollen-sensitized animals, four times at weekly intervals. Desensitization was determined by measuring decreases in immunoglobulin E (IgE), cellular immunity, ear swelling test, and pathological changes in the lungs of animals after aeroallergen challenge. Art v 1 protein formulation with Advax, Advax-CpG, SWE, or ISA-51 adjuvants induced a significant decrease in both total and Art v 1-specific IgE with a concurrent increase in Art v 1-specific IgG compared to the positive control group. There was a shift in T-cell cytokine secretion toward a Th1 (Advax-CpG, ISA-51, and Advax) or a balanced Th1/Th2 (SWE) pattern.

GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IR/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid -oxidation.

Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) can occur in 0.2-35 % of patients after inguinal hernia repair. The primary objective of this study was to determine the incidence of POUR after inguinal hernia repair. As a secondary goal, we sought to determine whether perioperative and patient factors predicted urinary retention. METHODS This study is a retrospective review of patients who underwent inguinal hernia repair with synthetic mesh at the Medical College of Wisconsin from January 2007 to June 2012. Procedures were performed by four surgeons. Clinical information and perioperative outcomes were collected up to hospital discharge. Urinary retention was defined as need for urinary catheterization postoperatively. RESULTS A total of 192 patients were included in the study (88 bilateral, 46 %) and (104 unilateral, 54 %). The majority of subjects (76 %) underwent laparoscopic repair. The overall POUR rate was 13 %, with 25 of 192 patients requiring a Foley catheter prior to discharge. POUR was significantly associated with bilateral hernia repairs (p = 0.04), BMI  35 kg/m(2) (p = 0.05) and longer operative times (p = 0.03).

Here, we show a hypoxia-inducible factor 1-dependent microRNA (miR)-210 up-regulation in monocytes and macrophages upon pathogen interaction. MiR-210 knockout in the hematopoietic lineage or in monocytes/macrophages mitigated the symptoms of endotoxemia, bacteremia, sepsis, and parasitosis, limiting the cytokine storm, organ damage/dysfunction, pathogen spreading, and lethality. Similarly, pharmacologic miR-210 inhibition improved the survival of septic mice. Mechanistically, miR-210 induction in activated macrophages supported a switch toward a proinflammatory state by lessening mitochondria respiration in favor of glycolysis, partly achieved by downmodulating the iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme ISCU. In humans, augmented miR-210 levels in circulating monocytes correlated with the incidence of sepsis, while serum levels of monocyte/macrophage-derived miR-210 were associated with sepsis mortality. Together, our data identify miR-210 as a fine-tuning regulator of macrophage metabolism and inflammatory responses, suggesting miR-210-based therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.","output":"Macrophage miR-210 induction and metabolic reprogramming in response to pathogen interaction boost life-threatening inflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule in biological systems, and as such, the ability of porous materials to reversibly adsorb NO is of interest for potential medical applications. Although certain metalCorganic frameworks are known to bind NO reversibly at coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, the influence of the metal coordination environment on NO adsorption has not been studied in detail. Here, we examine NO adsorption in the frameworks Co(2)Cl(2)(bbta) (H(2)bbta = 1H,5H-benzo(1,2-d:4,5-d)bistriazole) and Co(2)(OH)(2)(bbta) using gas adsorption, infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and magnetometry. At room temperature, NO adsorbs reversibly in Co(2)Cl(2)(bbta) without electron transfer, with low temperature data supporting spin-crossover of the NO-bound cobalt(ii) centers of the material. In contrast, adsorption of low pressures of NO in Co(2)(OH)(2)(bbta) is accompanied by charge transfer from the cobalt(ii) centers to form a cobalt(iii)CNO(?) adduct, as supported by diffraction and infrared spectroscopy data. At higher pressures of NO, characterization data indicate additional uptake of the gas and disproportionation of the bound NO to form a cobalt(iii)Cnitro (NO(2)(?)) species and N(2)O gas, a transformation that appears to be facilitated by secondary sphere hydrogen bonding interactions between the bound NO(2)(?) and framework hydroxo groups. These results provide a rare example of reductive NO binding in a cobalt-based metalCorganic framework, and they demonstrate that NO uptake can be tuned by changing the primary and secondary coordination environment of the framework metal centers.","output":"Influence of the primary and secondary coordination spheres on nitric oxide adsorption and reactivity in cobalt(ii)Ctriazolate frameworks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Data on long-term cosmetic outcome, overall survival, and disease-free survival of endoscope-assisted partial mastectomy (EAPM) for breast cancer are scarce. Thus, we examined these outcomes after a 10-year follow-up period, and compared with conventional conservative method (CCM). PATIENTS AND METHODS Data on 257 patients with stage  IIA breast cancer who underwent CCM (n = 125) or EAPM (n = 132) were analyzed. Cosmetic outcome at 2, 5, and 10 years was evaluated by 5 criteria (breast retraction assessment, nipple deviation, atrophy, skin change, scar). For overall mortality, breast cancer-specific mortality, and recurrence, the risk by operation method was tested by Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS EAPM performed significantly better than CCM in terms of cosmetic outcomes for location B at 2, 5, and 10 year-follow ups. As for cosmetic outcomes by individual criteria, EAPM had significantly higher proportions of satisfactory results for scar across all follow-up periods, and atrophy at 2-year and 10-year follow-up. There were no significant differences in terms of overall mortality, breast cancer-specific mortality, and recurrence between EAPM and CCM. The rates of patients who experienced local recurrence were similar between CCM and EAPM. CONCLUSION EAPM is better than CCM in terms of long-term cosmetic outcome, especially for location B. As a surgical treatment for breast cancer, EAPM is comparable to CCM in terms of mortality and recurrence.","output":"Ten-year follow up of cosmetic outcome, overall survival, and disease-free survival in endoscope-assisted partial mastectomy with filling of dead space using absorbable mesh for stage  IIA breast cancer: comparison with conventional conservative method."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this investigation a population of dogs at a rehoming center was monitored over a period of 2 years. Despite regular vaccination of incoming dogs against distemper, canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), and canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), respiratory disease was endemic.

The development of PCR assays for the detection of CPIV, canine adenovirus types 1 and 2, and canine herpesvirus (CHV) is described. Surprisingly, canine adenovirus was not detected in samples from this population, whereas 19.4% of tracheal and 10.4% of lung samples were positive for CPIV and 12.8% of tracheal and 9.6% of lung samples were positive for CHV.

Furthermore, the evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of antibodies to CPIV and an immunofluorescence assay for detection of antibodies to CHV is described. This study shows that CPIV is present at kennels despite vaccination.

Self-reported outcomes are cost-effective; however, they are subject to error. Diagnosis of silent events may also occur through the use of imperfect laboratory-based diagnostic tests. In this paper, we describe an approach for variable selection in high dimensional datasets for settings in which the outcome is observed with error. METHODS We adapt the spike and slab Bayesian Variable Selection approach in the context of error-prone, self-reported outcomes. The performance of the proposed approach is studied through simulation studies. An illustrative application is included using data from the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource, which includes extensive genotypic (>900,000 SNPs) and phenotypic data on 9,873 African American and Hispanic American women. RESULTS Simulation studies show improved sensitivity of our proposed method when compared to a naive approach that ignores error in the self-reported outcomes. Application of the proposed method resulted in discovery of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in a dataset of 9,873 African American and Hispanic participants in the Women's Health Initiative. There was little overlap among the top ranking SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes risk between the racial groups, adding support to previous observations in the literature of disease associated genetic loci that are often not generalizable across race/ethnicity populations. The adapted Bayesian variable selection algorithm is implemented in R. The source code for the simulations are available in the Supplement. CONCLUSIONS Variable selection accuracy is reduced when the outcome is ascertained by error-prone self-reports. For this setting, our proposed algorithm has improved variable selection performance when compared to approaches that neglect to account for the error-prone nature of self-reports.","output":"Bayesian variable selection for high dimensional predictors and self-reported outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To analyze the relationship of birth weight, birth order, breastfeeding duration, and age of introduction of solid foods with height, fat mass, and fat-free mass in a sample of Maya children when aged 6 to 8 years old. METHODS We collected data on anthropometry, body composition, children's birth weight, birth order, early feeding practices, and household socioeconomic characteristics in a sample of 260 Maya children aged 6 to 8 years living in Merida and Motul, two cities in Yucatan, Mexico. Multiple regression models were performed to identify variables associated with height-for-age (HAZ), fat mass index (FMI), and fat-free mass index (FFMI). The predictors included in the models were birth weight (kg), birth order, duration of breastfeeding (months), age at introduction of solid foods (months), maternal age (years), and height (cm). Models were adjusted for the influence of children's age and sex, maternal educational level, and household overcrowding. RESULTS HAZ was positively associated with child birthweight and maternal height and age, but inversely associated with birth order and age of introduction of solid foods. FMI was positively associated with birth weight, maternal age, and height, and negatively associated with birth order. FFMI was positively associated with maternal age and birth weight.

The emergence of these mutations might dictate when variants from chronic infections can dramatically spread onwards. Next, we tested the ability to predict antibody-evasion mutations from patient- and viral-specific features, and found that viral rebound is strongly associated with the emergence of antibody-evasion. We found evidence for dynamic polymorphic viral populations in most patients, suggesting that a compromised immune system selects for antibody-evasion in particular niches in a patients body.

The challenge is to encompass social/citizen values, health system goals, and financial realities and to incorporate them into the policy-making process. This is a challenge for all health systems and of particular importance for Latin American (LA) countries. Our objective was to understand how and under what conditions societal values inform decisions about health system financing in LA countries. METHODS A critical interpretive synthesis approach was utilised for this work. We searched 17 databases in December 2016 to identify articles written in English, Spanish or Portuguese that focus on values that inform the policy process for health system financing in LA countries at the macro and meso levels. Two reviewers independently screened records and assessed them for inclusion. One researcher conceptually mapped the included articles, created structured summaries of key findings from each, and selected a purposive sample of articles to thematically synthesise the results across the domains of agenda-setting/prioritisation, policy development and implementation. RESULTS We identified 5925 references, included 199 papers, and synthesised 68 papers. We identified 116 values and developed a framework to explain how values have been used to inform policy decisions about financing in LA countries. This framework has four categories - (1) goal-related values (i.e. guiding principles of the health system); (2) technical values (those incorporated into the instruments adopted by policy-makers to ensure a sustainable and efficient health system); (3) governance values (those applied in the policy process to ensure a transparent and accountable process of decision-making); and (4) situational values (a broad category of values that represent competing strategies to make decisions in the health systems, their influence varying according to the four factors). CONCLUSIONS It is an effort to consolidate and explain how different social values are considered and how they support policy decision-making about health system financing. This can help policy-makers to explicitly incorporate values into the policy process and understand how values are supporting the achievement of policy goals in health system financing.

The disease was first described in China in 2019, likely emerging as a zoonosis, before spreading worldwide to cause a severe global pandemic in 2020. COVID-19 is transmitted person to person, predominantly by droplet spread. COVID-19 causes a wide spectrum of clinical illness ranging from asymptomatic infection, to a mild self-limiting illness. A small proportion of individuals will go on to develop a more severe respiratory illness which may be complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. The majority of individuals will make a full recovery but a minority of patients will have a more severe outcome. Age is the strongest predictor of outcomes with mortality increasing to 15% or higher among those aged 80 years or older. Treatment options for COVID-19 continue to evolve. The strongest current evidence is the use of systemic corticosteroids which reduce mortality in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.

Significant variation exists in the care even of similar patients with COVID-19, including treatment practices within and between institutions. Outcome measures vary among clinical trials on the same therapies. Understanding which therapies are of most value is not possible unless consensus can be reached on which outcomes are most important to measure. Furthermore, consensus on the most important outcomes may enable patients to monitor and track their care, and may help providers to improve the care they offer through quality improvement. To develop a standardised minimum set of outcomes for clinical care, the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) assembled a working group (WG) of 28 volunteers, including health professionals, patients and patient representatives. DESIGN: A list of outcomes important to patients and professionals was generated from a systematic review of the published literature using the MEDLINE database, from review of outcomes being measured in ongoing clinical trials, from a survey distributed to patients and patient networks, and from previously published ICHOM standard sets in other disease areas. Using an online-modified Delphi process, the WG selected outcomes of greatest importance. RESULTS: The outcomes considered by the WG to be most important were selected and categorised into five domains: (1) functional status and quality of life, (2) mental functioning, (3) social functioning, (4) clinical outcomes and (5) symptoms. The WG identified demographic and clinical variables for use as case-mix risk adjusters. These included baseline demographics, clinical factors and treatment-related factors.

Throughout the paper we put focus on the Li&Lee mortality model, which has become a standard for projecting mortality in Belgium and the Netherlands. We calibrate this mortality model on annual deaths and exposures at the level of individual ages. This type of mortality data is typically collected, produced and reported with a significant delay of -- for some countries -- several years on a platform such as the Human Mortality Database. To enable a timely evaluation of the impact of a pandemic data point we have to rely on other data sources (e.g. the Short-Term Mortality Fluctuations Data series) that swiftly publish weekly mortality data collected in age buckets. To be compliant with the design and calibration strategy of the Li&Lee model, we have to transform the weekly mortality data collected in age buckets to yearly, age-specific observations. Therefore, our paper constructs a protocol to ungroup the deaths and exposures registered in age buckets to individual ages. To evaluate the impact of a pandemic shock, like COVID-19 in the year 2020, we weigh this data point in either the calibration or projection step. Obviously, the more weight we place on this data point, the more impact we observe on future estimated mortality rates and life expectancies.

First, meta-analysis results of RCTs showed that, there were no statistically significant differences between CP transfusion and the control group in terms of reducing mortality(OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52C1.19, I(2) = 28%) and improving clinical symptoms(OR 1.21, 95%CI 0.68C2.16; I(2) = 0%). The results of controlled NRSIs showed that CP therapy may reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients(RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.53C0.66, I(2) = 0%). Second, limited safety data suggested that CP is a well-tolerated therapy with a low incidence of adverse events. But, due to lack of safety data for the control group, it is really not easy to determine whether CP transfusion has an impact on moderate to serious AEs. Thirdly, for children, pregnant, elderly, tumor and immunocompromised patients, CP may be a well-tolerated therapy, if the disease cannot be controlled and continues to progress. Studies were commonly of low or very low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results of limited RCTs showed that CP cannot significantly reduce mortality, some non-RCTs and case report(series) have found that CP may help patients improve clinical symptoms, clear the virus, and reduce mortality, especially for patients with COVID-19 within ten days of illness. We speculate that CP may be a possible treatment option. High-quality studies are needed for establishing stronger quality of evidence and pharmacists should also be actively involved in the CP treatment process and provide close pharmaceutical care.","output":"Convalescent plasma may be a possible treatment for COVID-19: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale. Jefferson County Alabama, became a U.S. Southeastern cornerstone of industrial mining for coal, iron, and limestone in the 1800's. Coal-fired power plants deposit heavy metals into the air, soil, and water. Residents living in close proximity to these plants are increasingly stricken with lung diseases such as COPD and asthma. Many reside in an area the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has requested to be placed on the National Priorities List (NPL). This site has been named the Superfund Research Center (SRC) by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Air pollution from PM2.5 carrying heavy metals such as cadmium and arsenic have left a legacy of obstructive lung disease in the SRC site. Methods. The American Lung Association State of the Air 2020 report, finds parts of Jefferson County remains among the worst in the nation for year-round particle pollution. The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) COVID-19 dashboard was used to identify the number of cases and associated deaths per county in the first four months of the pandemic. The Jefferson County Department of Health, Community Health Equity Report was used to identify demographic and life expectancy reported data. Results. Although African Americans are 29% of the population in Alabama, 45% of the deaths due to COVID-19 are in the African American population, many living within the SRC site. Subjects younger than 50 years of age showed evidence of COPD as compared to those living outside the SRC site. Subjects living in the SRC site also exhibit higher levels of cadmium in their blood than those living outside the site, even if they were nonsmokers. Prior to the pandemic, subjects living within the SRC site had a life expectancy of 60-70 years while other areas with white populations had a life expectancy of 80-90 years. Conclusion. Residents in the SRC are experiencing a cascade of effects that place their lung health at stake. Combine a vulnerable population with varying lung diseases, in a heavily polluted area, with a new onset COVID-19 infection, and an already difficult situation, with pollution induced COPD becomes dire, underscoring the environmental disadvantage the residents face. COVID- 19 has laid bare the disparities in lung health in populations suffering from environmental exposures to toxic air pollution in Jefferson County. Continued efforts in air pollution regulation and continued research and evaluation of the impacts of long-term exposure to air pollution on lung health is the ongoing focus.","output":"Determinants of lung health in a vulnerable population burdened by air pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine crime patterns in Santa Monica, California before and after passage of Proposition 47, a 2014 initiative that reclassified some non-violent felonies to misdemeanors. We also study how the 2016 opening of four new light rail stations, and how more community-based policing starting in late 2018, impacted crime. A series of statistical analyses are performed on reclassified (larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property) and non-reclassified crimes by probing publicly available databases from 2006 to 2019. We compare data before and after passage of Proposition 47, city-wide and within eight neighborhoods. Similar analyses are conducted within a 450 meter radius of the new transit stations. Reports of monthly reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. The reported incidence of larceny intensified throughout the city. Two new train stations, including Downtown, reported significant crime increases in their vicinity after service began. While the number of reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, those not affected by the new law decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 strongly impacted crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new policing measures that enhanced outreach and patrolling. These findings may be relevant to law enforcement and policy-makers.

METHODS: A cross sectional survey study was carried out to study HCWs burnout using the 19-item Full Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) that includes personal, work, and patient-related burnout subscales. Bivariate analysis was used to test for associations and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 207 responses received; where the mean score of personal burnout was 67.23, the mean of work-related burnout was 61.38, and the mean of patient-related burnout was 54.55. Significant associations were found; where female HCWs, those working in rotating day-and-night shifts, working more than 55-h per week, and who had their shift time and hours changed during the pandemic, had higher levels of personal and work-related burnout (P < 0.05).

Despite the frequency with which this scale is used in the scientific literature, there is still relatively little evidence regarding the predictive validity of this important instrument. This current research introduces a construct capable of improving the ability of the scale to predict pornography consumption (meta-cognitive certainty). METHOD Over two studies, participants completed the PPUS and the meta-cognitive certainty in their responses to the scale was measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2). Self-reported porn consumption was the criterion measure in both studies, with an additional actual overt behavior relevant to consumption of porn included in Study 2. RESULTS As expected, the PPUS significantly predicted porn consumption, confirming the predictive validity of the scale. More importantly, meta-cognitive certainty was capable of moderating the extent to which scores on the PPUS could predict porn consumption, with greater consistency between the PPUS and reported behavior from those with high (vs. low) meta-cognitive certainty.

Based on EMT genes, a gene signature for prognosis was built using TCGA training set by performing multivariate and univariate Cox regression analyses. Prediction accuracy of the signature was validated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and overall survival analysis on internal and external datasets. By conducting univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, the risk signature as an independent prognostic indicator was assessed. A nomogram was constructed and validated by calibration analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: Five molecular subtypes were characterized based on EMT genes. Patients in Cluster 2 exhibited an activated immune state and a better prognosis. An 11-EMT gene-signature was built to predict breast cancer prognosis. After validation, the signature showed independence and robustness in predicting clinical outcomes of patients.

Later on, animal cell culture became essential for scientific research, diagnosis and biotechnological activities. Along with this development, biosafety concerns have emerged pointing to the risks for human health and in a lesser extent for the environment associated to the handling of animal cell cultures. The management of these risks requires a thorough risk assessment of both the cell cultures and the type of manipulation prior the start of any activity. It involves a case-by-case evaluation of both the intrinsic properties of the cell culture genetically modified or not and the probability that it may inadvertently or intentionally become infected with pathogenic micro-organisms. The latter hazard is predominant when adventitious contaminants are pathogenic or have a better capacity to persist in unfavourable conditions. Consequently, most of the containment measures primarily aim at protecting cells from adventitious contamination. Cell cultures known to harbour an infectious etiologic agent should be manipulated in compliance with containment measures recommended for the etiologic agent itself. The manipulation of cell cultures from human or primate origin necessitates the use of a type II biosafety cabinet.

Robust IMD surveillance is essential to help assess the need for additional immunization initiatives in target populations. This is particularly important in KSA, where mass gatherings accompanying Hajj/Umrah pilgrimages have been associated with IMD outbreaks within the local KSA population, and subsequent intercontinental spread via returning pilgrims. This narrative review of the published literature describes the changing epidemiology of IMD in KSA to provide a perspective on the impact of current immunization strategies and potential gaps. As recent published surveillance data are lacking, we also evaluated publicly reported data from the KSA Ministry of Health (MoH) for 2012C2019 to inform more recent IMD trends. Between 1995 and 2011, national surveillance data indicate that 1103 IMD cases were reported in KSA: 60% in 2000C2001, involving two (mainly MenW) outbreaks involving KSA citizens/residents and pilgrims focused in Mecca and Medina. Across 2002C2011, 184 cases of IMD were reported, with a higher proportion occurring in KSA citizens/residents, and with less focus within pilgrimage centers than apparent in previous years. Our analysis of MoH data found that, between 2012 and 2019, 44 IMD cases were reported, all in KSA citizens/residents, and chiefly in children or infants. No pilgrimage-associated outbreaks have occurred since 2001. Serogroup data were available for 62.5% of all cases for 2002C2011; MenW (40.0%), MenA (35.7%), and MenB (16.5%). Serogroup data for 2012C2019 remain incompletely reported, and the existing surveillance system could be improved, as some element of underestimation/underreporting of IMD may exist. While existing MenACWY immunization strategies for KSA citizens/residents and visiting pilgrims have been successful in reducing IMD due to specific serogroups, disease due to MenB remains a potential risk, and additional immunization strategies should be considered.

It considers the time period since social establishments re-opened in July 2020, to evaluate whether increase alcoholic pancreatitis cases, as a proxy for altered drinking habits, persisted. METHODS: All codes relating to pancreatitis were used to identify cases between March to September (2016 to 2020). Inclusion criteria: acute alcohol-related pancreatitis only. These cases were screened by a group of independent medical juniors and analysed using Excel. RESULTS: A total of 1905 patients with pancreatitis were identified in the initial search, of which 136 were admitted with acute alcoholic pancreatitis.

In this context, a pooled sample testing strategy was evaluated in the setting of emerging disease outbreak in 3 central Indian districts to assess if the cost of the test and turn-around time could be reduced without compromising its diagnostic characteristics and thus lead to early containment of the outbreak. From 545 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples received from the three emerging districts, a total of 109 pools were created with 5 consecutive samples in each pool. The diagnostic performance of qRT-PCR on pooled sample was compared with that of individual samples in a blinded manner. While pooling reduced the cost of diagnosis by 68% and the laboratory processing time by 66%, 5 of the 109 pools showed discordant results when compared with induvial samples. Four pools which tested negative contained 1 positive sample and 1 pool which was positive did not show any positive sample on deconvolution. Presence of a single infected sample with Ct value of 34 or higher, in a pool of 5, was likely to be missed in pooled sample analysis. At the reported point prevalence of 4.8% in this study, the negative predictive value of qRT-PCR on pooled samples was around 96% suggesting that the adoption of this strategy as an effective screening tool for COVID-19 needs to be carefully evaluated.","output":"Evaluation of pooled sample analysis strategy in expediting case detection in areas with emerging outbreaks of COVID-19: A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Complications arising from COVID-19 reflect an abnormal immune response in people previously diagnosed with chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCD), such as cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary conditions Physical inactivity is recognized as a condition that affects the development of chronic low-grade inflammation, NCD, and susceptibility to cell infections Anxiety and mental stress, poor nutritional status, drug use and circadian rhythm disturbances can further aggravate the harm caused by physical inactivity Therefore, the purpose of the review is to invite health professionals, their respective regulatory boards, universities, research promotion foundations, media, political authorities and lay citizens to raise awareness of immunity and health in the medium- to long-term control of the current pandemic Level of evidence V;Expert opinion RESUMO As complicaes decorrentes da COVID-19 refletem uma resposta imune irregular em pessoas previamente acometidas por doen?as cr?nicas n?o transmissveis (DCNT), como por exemplo, cardiovasculares, metablicas e pulmonares A inatividade fsica  reconhecidamente uma condio que impacta o desenvolvimento de inflamao cr?nica de baixo grau, DCNT e suscetibilidade a infeces celulares Ansiedade e estresse mental, estado nutricional deficiente, consumo de drogas e ritmo circadiano perturbado podem agravar ainda mais os prejuzos da inatividade fsica Sendo assim, o objetivo da revis?o  convidar profissionais da rea da sade, seus respectivos conselhos regulatrios, universidades, fundaes de amparo  pesquisa, mdia, autoridades polticas e cidad?os leigos para a conscientizao sobre imunidade e sade no controle em mdio a longo prazo da atual pandemia Nvel de evidncia V;Opini?o do especialista RESUMEN Las complicaciones derivadas del COVID-19 reflejan una respuesta inmune irregular en personas previamente afectadas por enfermedades crnicas no transmisibles (ECNT) como, por ejemplo, cardiovasculares, metablicas y pulmonares La inactividad fsica es reconocidamente una condicin que impacta en el desarrollo de inflamacin crnica de bajo grado, ECNT y susceptibilidad a infecciones celulares La ansiedad y el estrs mental, el estado nutricional deficiente, el consumo de drogas y el ritmo circadiano alterado pueden agravar an ms los perjuicios de la inactividad fsica Por lo tanto, el objetivo de la revisin es invitar a profesionales del rea de la salud, a sus respectivos consejos reguladores, universidades, fundaciones de apoyo a la investigacin, medios de comunicacin, autoridades polticas y ciudadanos laicos para la concienciacin sobre inmunidad y salud en el control a mediano y largo plazo de la actual pandemia Nivel de evidencia V;Opinin del especialista","output":"Physical inactivity, chronic diseases, immunity and covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a social problem.

This has been exacerbated by the disruptions to training and education which the covid-19 pandemic has caused. This intensive course has been developed to improve basic surgical skills and improve confidence in simple wound closure, to mitigate these disruptions. METHODS: Candidates attended a three-part course in small groups, where they learned hand ties, basic laparoscopic skills and wound closure on animal models. Self assessment data were collected pre and post workshop on a Likert scale. All data was assessed using basic descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Data was collected from 13 participants (M:F, 5:8) at the level of foundation year 1(61.5%,n=8) and foundation year 2(38.5%,n=5). Only 38.5% (n = 5) had previous basic surgical skills training. Our delegates reported an improvement in the following surgical skills: suturing (n = 11, 84.6%), hand tying (n = 10, 76.9%), laparoscopic skills (n = 10, 76.9%). Overall 61.5% (n = 8) of our delegates reported an improvement in all three domains. CONCLUSIONS: Participants reported limited exposure prior to this course despite successfully completing an undergraduate curriculum.

Methods: The present study was carried out on patients with combined cataract and pterygium excision (combined group) and pterygium surgery first and cataract surgery after one month (sequential group). Parameters such as mean keratometry (K) values, axial length, IOL power, and corneal astigmatism were compared pre and postoperatively in the combined and sequential groups. Results: 70 eyes of 70 patients were included in the present study. The mean age of the participants in the combined group was 70.4610.12, whereas that in the sequential group was 68.6811.22 (p=0.243). The mean horizontal length of the pterygium in the combined group was 2.640.17 mm and 2.570.17 mm in the sequential group. The mean postoperative K values (p=0.03) and IOL power (p=0.04) in the combined group were significantly higher than the preoperative values. The estimated postoperative refractive error in the combined group was -0.501.00 D and 0.250.5 D in the sequential group (p=0.04). On the other hand, the postoperative refraction in the sequential group was predictable. Corneal visibility was diminished on the nasal side in almost all the patients in the combined group as compared to the sequential group. Conclusion: The postoperative refraction errors were positively correlated with the length of pterygium in the combined group.

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) in COVID-19 and its correlation with other inflammatory biomarkers. Material and Methods One-hundred patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-CRP ratio (LCR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were evaluated on admission. EAT volume and density were measured by computed tomography. Patients were followed until death or discharge. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed and ROC curve analysis was used to assess the ability of inflammatory markers in predicting survival. The relationship between EAT and other inflammatory markers was also investigated. Results The mean  SD age of patients was 55.5  15.2 years old; 68% were male. Univariate analysis revealed that increased lung involvement, blood urea nitrogen, LDH and NLR, and decreased platelet count were significantly associated with death. After adjustment, LDH was independently predictive of death (OR= 1.013, p-value= 0.03). Among inflammatory markers, LCR had the best ability for predicting survival with 79.7% sensitivity and 64.3% specificity at an optimal cut-off value of 20.8 (AUC=0.744, 95% CI= 0.612 - 0.876, p-value= 0.004).

EAT density was significantly different between decedents and survivors (p=0.008). Conclusion Routine laboratory tests that represent status of inflammation can be used as cost-effective prognostic markers of COVID-19.

The aim of the present follow-up was to investigate the asthma prevalence and risk factors for asthma in adulthood. METHODS We have prospectively studied asthma development in 101 children hospitalized due to severe wheezing before the age of 24 months. The cohort was re-investigated at a mean age of 27 years and tested for bronchial hyper-responsiveness and allergic sensitization. The response rate in adulthood was 81% (82/101). The results were compared with a population-based, age-matched control group (n = 1,210) recruited from the West Sweden Asthma Study. RESULTS Current doctor-diagnosed asthma was found in 37% (30/82) compared with 7% (82/1,210) in the control group. The risk of adult asthma in the cohort compared with the control group was increased 10-fold (adjusted OR 10.0, 95% CI 5.3-18.7), independently of allergic rhinitis, gender, smoking and heredity. Within the cohort, current allergy (aOR 9.6, 95% CI 3.0-31.2) and female gender (aOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-9.3) independently increased the risk of adult asthma. Females with current allergy had the highest risk of adult asthma (OR 29.4, 95% CI 5.0-173.3), compared with males without allergy. When separately adjusting for factors present at admission in early life within the cohort, a family history of asthma was a significant risk factor for asthma in adulthood (aOR 4.0, 95% CI 1.3-12.5).

This study is designed to explore the feasibility and efficacy of m-health-based core stability exercise (CSE) combined with self-compassion training (SCT) and compare it with m-health-based CSE alone for the management of NCLBP. METHODS: This study is a pilot, patient-blinded randomized controlled trial. Participants with NCLBP were randomized into an intervention group and a control group. All the participants received m-health-based CSE, but those in the intervention group also received SCT before CSE. The intervention took place weekly on Saturday or Sunday for 4 weeks in total. Patients self-assessed their outcomes by filling out electronic questionnaires at 4 and 16 weeks after the start of the study. The primary outcome metrics for these questionnaires were back pain disability (based on the RolandCMorris Disability Questionnaire, RMDQ) and Pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS; current pain, worst pain, average pain). The secondary outcome metrics were anxiety (GAD-7,7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), Depression Symptoms (PHQ-9,Patient Health Questionnaire-9), pain catastrophizing (PCS, Pain Catastrophizing Scale) and Self-efficiency (PSEQ, Pain Self-Efficiency Questionnaire). RESULTS: A total of 37 patients comprising 28 (75.7%) females completed the study, with 19 patients in the intervention group and 18 in the control group. The mean (SD) patient age was 35.2 (11.1) years. For all primary outcomes, although there were no significant differences between groups, we found that participants in the intervention group improved function and pain earlier. The RMDQ score changed by ? 1.771 points (95% CI ? 3.768 to 0.227) from baseline to 4 weeks in the control group and by ? 4.822 points (95% CI ? 6.752 to ? 2.892) in the intervention group (difference between groups, ? 3.052 [95% CI ? 5.836 to ? 0.267]). Also, the RMDQ score changed by ? 3.328 points (95% CI ? 5.252 to ? 1.403) from baseline to 16 weeks in the control group and by ? 5.124 points (95% CI ? 7.014 to ? 3.233) in the intervention group (difference between groups ? 1.796 [95% CI ? 4.501 to 0.909]). A similar pattern was found in the NRS scores. For secondary outcomes, the intervention group was superior to the control group in for GAD-7 (intervention difference from CSE along at week 16, ? 2.156 [95% CI ? 4.434 to ? 0.122; P value for group effect was 0.030]). At the end of treatment, the improvement in PCS in the intervention group was significant (difference in PCS score at week 4, ? 6.718 [95% CI ? 11.872 to ? 1.564]). We also found significant changes in PCS in the control group (? 6.326 [95% CI, ? 11.250 to ? 1.401]) at the 16-week follow-up. As for PSEQ, there were no apparent differences between the two groups.

Anorectal manometry and defecography are often used to make this diagnosis. However, these tests are expensive and require expertise. Balloon expulsion testing may be a simple alternative. We compared balloon expulsion to anorectal manometry and defecography for diagnosing dyssynergia in women with chronic constipation. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review. All women presenting for evaluation of chronic constipation who underwent concurrent balloon testing, manometry, and defecography were included. A diagnosis of dyssynergic defecation was established by either defecography revealing prolonged/incomplete rectal evacuation and/or by manometry revealing paradoxical contraction/inadequate relaxation of the pelvic floor. Inability to expel a 50-ml balloon defined dyssynergic defecation by balloon testing. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated. RESULTS A total of 61 women met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 50 years. There were 36 women (59 %) who met Rome III criteria for dyssynergic defecation on defecography and/or manometry. Only 12 of these 36 (33 %) were similarly diagnosed by balloon testing. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of balloon testing for dyssynergia were 33 and 71 %, respectively. Of the 25 (41 %) women who did not meet Rome III criteria for dyssynergia on defecography and/or manometry, 20 (80 %) also had negative balloon testing. Thus, the specificity and negative predictive value of balloon testing for diagnosing dyssynergia were 80 and 50 %, respectively.

Since its emergence, CPV-2 has been replaced with new genetic variants (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c). Currently, information about the genotype prevalence of CPV-2 in Vietnam is limited. In the present study, we investigated the genotype prevalence and distribution of CPV-2 in the three regions of Vietnam. METHODS: Rectal swabs were collected from 260 dogs with suspected CPV-2 infection from northern, central, and southern Vietnam from November 2016 to February 2018. All samples were identified as parvovirus positive by real-time PCR, and further genotyping was performed using a SimpleProbe? real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of the 260 Vietnamese CPV-2 isolates, 6 isolates (2.31%) were identified as CPV-2a, 251 isolates (96.54%) were identified as CPV-2c and 3 isolates (1.15%) were untypable using the SimpleProbe? real-time PCR assay. In northern Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 2.97% (3/101) and 97.3% (98/101), respectively. In central Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 1.11% (1/90) and 98.89% (89/90), respectively. In southern Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 3.03% (2/66) and 96.97% (64/66), respectively. CPV-2b was not observed in this study. The VP2 genes of CPV-2c in Vietnam are more genetically similar to those of CPV-2c strains in China and Taiwan than to those of prototype CPV-2c strains (FJ222821) or the first Vietnamese CPV-2c (AB120727). CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that CPV-2c is the most prevalent variant in Vietnam. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the recent Vietnamese CPV-2c isolates share a common evolutionary origin with Asian CPV-2c strains.

The evaluation of the present status of the provinces affected by COVID-19 is very much essential to the government authorities to impose preventive strategies in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and to take necessary measures. In this article, a computational methodology is developed to estimate the present status of states and provinces which are affected due to COVID-19 using a fuzzy inference system.

Considering positive and negative factors of the input parameters, the rule base is developed using triangular fuzzy numbers to capture uncertainties associated with the model. The application potentiality is validated by evaluating Pearsons correlation coefficient. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to observe the changes of final output by varying the tolerance ranges of the inputs. The results of the proposed method show that some of the provinces have very poor performance in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in India.

RECENT FINDINGS: People living with schizophrenia are at an increased risk of COVID-19 and present worse COVID-19-related outcomes, including mortality. They show low levels of information and of concern regarding the possibility of contagion and infection but presented substantially stable levels of psychotic symptoms and even increased subjective well being during the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, as well as the prolonged social isolation and the spread of misinformation, appear to be responsible in some cases for the onset of psychotic symptoms. SUMMARY: Clinicians should inform and educate their patients on the risks related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 and on the precautions that they should adopt to avoid contagion. Particular attention should be devoted to maintaining the continuity of care, especially in frail patients. Telemedicine might represent a valid support, but face-to-face visits in some cases remain essential. The hypothesis of a direct role of viral infection on the onset of psychotic disorders is currently debated, as viral involvement of central nervous system appears to be rather infrequent in COVID-19.","output":"Schizophrenia during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple lines of evidence strongly suggest that infection hotspots, where a single individual infects many others, play a key role in the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.

In this work, we introduce a temporal point process modeling framework that specifically represents visits to the sites where individuals get in contact and infect each other. Under our model, the number of infections caused by an infectious individual naturally emerges to be overdispersed. Using an efficient sampling algorithm, we demonstrate how to apply Bayesian optimization with longitudinal case data to estimate the transmission rate of infectious individuals at the sites they visit and in their households.

METHODS: We use cell counting chips and PCR arrays to offer the first insights into the T cell involved in the course of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. All consecutive patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection treated at the designated hospital between January 2020 and February 2020 were recruited for the study, and cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Baseline characteristics for inpatients were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 96 patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in our center were screened for inclusion in the study. The median age of the patients was 39.0 years, and 47 (49.0%) were female. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only the CD4+ cell counts were significantly lower in the infection group and slightly higher in the control group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed good discrimination power between subjects with and subjects without infection.

As elective surgeries become essential, we propose to evaluate our approach and outcomes of surgical procedures performed during the initial period of COVID-19 pandemic so as to provide a road-map for safer approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients who underwent essential elective and emergency surgeries during the 5-week period between April 18, 2020 and May 28, 2020. All patients were screened at the front desk on their arrival to identify possible exposure to SARS- CoV-2. Nasopharyngeal swab of patients requiring hospital admission was tested for COVID-19 by quantitative RT-PCR. Patients needing essential elective surgery were taken up for surgery if they tested negative for COVID-19. Emergency procedures were undertaken in a demarcated theatre for COVID after taking level-3 protection without delay. The clinical data was reviewed and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 764 surgical procedures were conducted, of which 70.7% were elective essential surgeries, with 95.4% of these patients being discharged in stable healthy condition. Approximately 23% of the elective and 26% of the emergency surgeries was categorised in the surgical difficulty category III and majority of these were performed under general anesthesia.

The aim of this paper is to review studies on the course of mental health problems during and after the first lockdown phase. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of multi-wave studies in general populations with time points during and after the first lockdown phase. Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that utilised validated instruments were included. The main outcome was whether indicators of mental health problems have changed during and after the first lockdown phase. The study was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42020218640. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies with 56 indicators were included in the qualitative review. Studies that reported data from pre-pandemic assessments through lockdown indicated an increase in mental health problems. During lockdown, no uniform trend could be identified. After lockdown, mental health problems decreased slightly. CONCLUSIONS: As mental health care utilisation indicators and data on suicides do not suggest an increase in demand during the first lockdown phase, we regard the increase in mental health problems as general distress that is to be expected during a global health crisis.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 281 non-survivors and 712 survivors with propensity score matching by age, sex, and comorbidities were enrolled from January 13, 2020 to March 31, 2020. RESULTS: Higher SOFA, qSOFA, APACHE II and SIRS scores, hypoxia, elevated inflammatory cytokines, multi-organ dysfunction, decreased immune cell subsets, and complications were significantly associated with the higher COVID-19 death risk. In addition to traditional predictors for death risk, including APACHE II (AUC = 0.83), SIRS (AUC = 0.75), SOFA (AUC = 0.70) and qSOFA scores (AUC = 0.61), another four prediction models that included immune cells subsets (AUC = 0.90), multiple organ damage biomarkers (AUC = 0.89), complications (AUC = 0.88) and inflammatory-related indexes (AUC = 0.75) were established.

This study aimed to examine the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the care and complication rates associated with subcutaneous venous port (PORT) insertion in cancer treatment. METHODS: We retrospectively studied all adult cancer patients that received a PORT in 2020 at a Swedish county hospital, including insertion characteristics and in-dwell complication rates for up to 6 months after implantation; these estimates were compared with historic data. RESULTS: Data from 257 patients, of which 56 were haematological patients, were included and compared with those of 168 patients in the control group. The group characteristics were similar, except for the inclusion of haematological patients in the study group. Insertion characteristics showed a shorter waiting time and higher rates of antibiotic and sedative use during the pandemic. The rates of postoperative haematoma and catheter occlusion during the study period were higher than otherwise. The rates of adverse events related to the PORT in the solid tumour group were comparable to those in the control group (18.4% vs. 14.9%). Patients with haematological malignancies were more likely to experience adverse events (37.5% vs. 18.4%) and deep venous thrombosis (7.1% vs. 1.0%) than those with solid tumours.

Bi-weekly measures included the Coronavirus Impact Scale, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-item, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, 7-item. Generalized estimating equations method was used to examine the longitudinal change of the measures within the lockdown and the change from pre-pandemic period to pandemic period. RESULTS: All participants reported an impact of lockdown. Individuals with bipolar disorder reported greater impact from the stay-at-home orders with disruptions in routines, income/employment, social support and pandemic related stress. While these measures improved over time, healthy controls recovered quicker and with greater magnitude than persons with bipolar disorder.

Among the roughly one hundred components, which are involved in protein import and protein folding or assembly, two components stand out: The Sec61 complex and BiP. The Sec61 complex in the ER membrane represents the major entry point for precursor polypeptides into the membrane or lumen of the ER and provides a conduit for Ca(2+) ions from the ER lumen to the cytosol. The second component, the Hsp70-type molecular chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, short BiP, plays central roles in protein folding and assembly (hence its name), protein import, cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, and various intracellular signal transduction pathways. For the purpose of this review, we focus on these two components, their relevant allosteric effectors and on the question of how their respective functional cycles are linked in order to reconcile the apparently contradictory features of the ER membrane, selective permeability for precursor polypeptides, and impermeability for Ca(2+). The key issues are that the Sec61 complex exists in two conformations: An open and a closed state that are in a dynamic equilibrium with each other, and that BiP contributes to its gating in both directions in cooperation with different co-chaperones. While the open Sec61 complex forms an aqueous polypeptide-conducting- and transiently Ca(2+)-permeable channel, the closed complex is impermeable even to Ca(2+).

Global surgery is the study and practice of improving access to timely, quality, and affordable surgical care. It emphasizes horizontal health systems strengthening through addressing a range of health challenges in surgical care that improve health outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations. Global surgery specifically contributes to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 (SDGs) by addressing the elimination of poverty (SDG 1), ensuring good health and well-being (SDG 3), promoting decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), and reducing inequalities (SDGs 5 and 10). Global surgery issues transcend national boundaries and intersect with other global health issues such as migration and the COVID-19 pandemic. These issues are nested in a highly politicised environment, therefore power and politics should be considered when identifying problems and solutions. Despite evidence of its importance, the global surgery network has not generated substantial attention and resources compared to other global health networks. Global surgery can further increase its effectiveness through linking with health systems strengthening agendas, and identifying unified solutions to improve access to quality surgical care in low- and middle-income countries.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading globally, affecting millions of people worldwide, and led to significant loss of lives and deterioration of the global economy. The current adverse effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic demands finding new detection methods for future viral outbreaks. The environment's transmission pathways include and are not limited to air, surface water, and wastewater environments. The wastewater surveillance, known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), can potentially monitor viral outbreaks and provide a complementary clinical testing method. Another investigated outbreak surveillance technique that did not yet implement in a sufficient number of studies is the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the air. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its related machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies are currently emerging techniques for detecting viral outbreaks using global data. To date, there are no reports that illustrate the potential of using WBE with AI to detect viral outbreaks. This study investigates the transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment and provides current updates on the surveillance of viral outbreaks using wastewater-based epidemiology, viral air sampling, and AI. It also proposes a novel framework based on an ensemble of ML and DL algorithms to provide a beneficial supportive tool for decision-makers. The framework exploits the available data to discover meaningful insights and knowledge that allows researchers and practitioners to build efficient methods and protocols that accurately monitor and detect viral outbreaks.

These assays have the potential to greatly enhance efficiency in the clinical laboratory. Choice of primer and probe sequences is critical for accurate diagnosis in the clinic, yet current primer/probe signature design strategies are limited, and signature evaluation methods are lacking. METHODS: We assessed the quality of a signature by predicting the number of true positive, false positive and false negative hits against all available public sequence data. We found real-time PCR signatures described in recent literature and used a BLAST search based approach to collect all hits to the primer-probe combinations that should be amplified by real-time PCR chemistry. We then compared our hits with the sequences in the NCBI taxonomy tree that the signature was designed to detect. RESULTS: We found that many published signatures have high specificity (almost no false positives) but low sensitivity (high false negative rate). Where high sensitivity is needed, we offer a revised methodology for signature design which may designate that multiple signatures are required to detect all sequenced strains. We use this methodology to produce new signatures that are predicted to have higher sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: We show that current methods for real-time PCR assay design have unacceptably low sensitivities for most clinical applications. Additionally, as new sequence data becomes available, old assays must be reassessed and redesigned. A standard protocol for both generating and assessing the quality of these assays is therefore of great value. Real-time PCR has the capacity to greatly improve clinical diagnostics.

Therefore, research is needed to explore NICU fathers' needs within the United States. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the needs of fathers who previously had a premature infant in the NICU. METHODS: This qualitative descriptive study used semistructured interviews collected to obtain in-depth knowl-edge of fathers' needs in the NICU. Twenty-eight fathers were recruited through 3 parent support organizations: Hand to Hold, NICU Parent Support Network, and March of Dimes.

Second, heterogeneity in infection rates and infected populations across regions cannot be accounted for by region-specific fixed effects, nor by conditioning on observable time-varying confounders. Third, epidemiological theory predicts heterogeneous treatment effects across regions and over time.

Consistent with these inter-species transmission barriers, phylogenetic evidence supports the prediction that FIV transmission is an exceedingly rare event between free-ranging cat species, though it has occurred occasionally in captive settings. Recently we documented that puma and bobcats in Southern California share an FIV strain, providing an opportunity to evaluate evolution of both viral strains and host intracellular restriction proteins.

METHODS: The available online articles of English (PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Ovid) and Persian (SID, Iran Medex, Magiran, and Iran Doc) databases and also the articles that presented in held parasitology congresses of Iran were involved. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of Toxocara/Toxascaris in dogs (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) was 24.2% (95% CI: 18.0C31.0%) and 32.6% (95% CI: 22.6C43.4%), respectively.

Discovery of the mechanisms underpinning the detrimental effect of causal mutations has led to some breakthroughs in the comprehension of the pathophysiology of steatohepatitis.

METHODS: We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of wellbeing over five years (2015-2020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n=1071, aged 60-71) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26-April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19. RESULTS: 1) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. 2) Wellbeing remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. 3) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four wellbeing measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher wellbeing. DISCUSSION: In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their wellbeing as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower wellbeing. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.","output":"Up and about: Older adults' wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Swedish longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La infeccion por SARS-CoV-2 causa un amplio espectro de sintomas con distintos grados de severidad;desde casos asintomaticos o en forma de sindrome pseudogripal autolimitado, hasta un sindrome de distres respiratorio rapidamente progresivo debido a una respuesta anomala del sistema inmunitario en forma de tormenta de citoquinas.

A nasopharyngeal swab returned positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Her condition rapidly worsened leading to severe liver and coagulation impairment. An emergency Caesarean section was performed at gestational week 32+6 after which the patient made a rapid recovery. Severe COVID-19 promptly improved by the termination of the pregnancy or atypical HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes and Low Platelet Count) exacerbated by concomitant COVID-19 infection could not be ruled out.

When schools closed in spring 2020, 77% of SBHCs closed temporarily, 5% closed permanently, and 12% remained physically open. Telehealth was a crucial strategy used to continue delivering essential services. The percentage reporting any telehealth service offering before and after school closures increased by over 200%. Yet they also reported challenges, including financial and policy restraints. Many SBHCs that closed temporarily did so because their host schools closed, suggesting that making arrangements to remain open if a similar situation to the COVID-19 pandemic should arise might be beneficial. SBHCs are a proven cost-effective model to deliver health care in resource-limited communities. These preliminary study results indicate that SBHCs maintained service delivery following school closures, though many faced challenges.

Design: Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and PRS construction and validation. Setting: GWAS summary statistics from three European datasets and individual-level data from Estonian Biobank, including phenotype questionnaire and measurement panel, together with follow-up data from linkage with national health-related registries. Participants: A total of 28,086 women with POP and 546,321 controls of European ancestry. Genetic risk scores were derived from a dataset of 20,118 cases and 427,426 controls of European ancestry and validated in a target dataset of 7,896 cases and 118,895 controls. Cases were defined using ICD codes and classical risk factors were derived from questionnaire data and ICD10 codes. Results: The identified novel loci reinforce the role of connective tissue abnormalities, urogenital tract development and point towards association with a range of cardiometabolic traits. A novel PRS combining 3,242,959 variants demonstrated that women in the top 5 % have 1.63 (95% CI: 1.37 to 1.93) times the hazard of developing POP compared to the rest of the women. When analyzing PRS in incident disease, it showed similar predictive ability (Harrell C-statistic 0.583, sd=0.007) than five established clinical risk factors (number of children, body mass index (BMI), ever smoked, constipation and asthma) combined (Harrell C-statistic 0.588, sd=0.007) and demonstrated its incremental value in combination with these (Harrell C-statistic 0.630, sd=0.007). Conclusions: The largest GWAS meta-analysis in POP to date identified 26 genetic loci which establish links between POP and connective tissue abnormalities, urogenital development and cardiometabolic health.

Here, we report the identification of pathogenic variants in GBF1 (Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1) in four unrelated families with individuals affected by sporadic or dominant HMN/CMT2. Genomic sequencing analyses in seven affected individuals uncovered four distinct heterozygous GBF1 variants, two of which occurred de novo. Other known HMN/CMT2-implicated genes were excluded. Affected individuals show HMN/CMT2 with slowly progressive distal muscle weakness and musculoskeletal deformities. Electrophysiological studies confirmed axonal damage with chronic neurogenic changes. Three individuals had additional distal sensory loss. GBF1 encodes a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that facilitates the activation of members of the ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor) family of small GTPases. GBF1 is mainly involved in the formation of coatomer protein complex (COPI) vesicles, maintenance and function of the Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria migration and positioning. We demonstrate that GBF1 is present in mouse spinal cord and muscle tissues and is particularly abundant in neuropathologically relevant sites, such as the motor neuron and the growth cone.

NLRs are functionally diverse and tissue-specific PRRs expressed by both immune and non-immune cells. Beyond the inflammasome activation, NLRs are also involved in NF-B and MAPK activation signaling, the regulation of type I IFN (IFN-I) production and the inflammatory cell death during microbial infections. Recent advancements of NLRs biology revealed its possible interplay with pyroptotic cell death and inflammatory mediators, such as caspase 1, caspase 11, IFN-I and GSDMD. This review provides the most updated information that caspase 8 skews the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in PANoptosis during pathogen infection. We also update multidimensional roles of NLRP12 in regulating innate immunity in a content-dependent manner: novel interference of NLRP12 on TLRs and NOD derived-signaling cascade, and the recently unveiled regulatory property of NLRP12 in production of type I IFN.

This psychological distress was predominantly described as sleep disturbance, symptoms of anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress, inability to make decisions and even somatic symptoms. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Frontline nurses from designated hospitals for COVID-19 patients were invited to complete an online survey by convenience sampling, and the survey included six main sections: the General Health Questionnaire, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Simplified Coping Style Scale, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, socio-demographic, occupation and work history. Multiple logistic analysis was used to identify the potential risk factors of psychological distress. The study methods were compliant with the STROBE checklist. RESULTS: Of the 263 frontline nurses, 66 (25.1%) were identified as psychological distress. Multiple logistic analysis revealed that working in emergency department, concern for family, being treated differently, negative coping style and COVID-19-related stress symptom were positive related to psychological distress. Perceived more social support and effective precautionary measures were negatively associated with psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that COVID-19 had a significant psychological impact on frontline nurses. Early detection of psychological distress and supportive intervention should be taken according to the associated factors to prevent more serious psychological impact on frontline nurses.

METHODS: The WHO-recommended health facility-based cross-sectional approach was adapted for this survey. Between 8(th) and 15(th) December 2020, 3142 participants across the 21 local government areas (LGAs) of the state, aged one year and over, attending randomly selected health facilities were recruited. Demographic and symptom-related information were collected from the participants as well as peripheral whole blood, which was tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM with rapid test kits. RESULTS: 425 participants tested positive for IgG only, 74 for IgM only while 54 were positive for both IgG and IgM. Overall, 553 positives were recorded giving a crude seroprevalence of 17(.)6% (95% CI = 16(.)26 C 18(.)98). It ranged widely from 31(.)9% (95% CI = 24(.)43 C 40(.)22) in Onitsha north LGA to 5(.)4% (95% CI = 2(.)19 C 10(.)78) in Awka north. Bayesian Adjustments yielded a state seroprevalence of 16(.)1%. CONCLUSION: One in six residents of the state had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and developed antibodies before the second wave.

Within a short period of time, the infectious disease has spread far and wide. This study focuses on the distribution of COVID\\\\19 confirmed cases in Chinathe original epicentre of the outbreak. We show that the upper tail of COVID\\\\19 cases in Chinese cities is well described by a power law distribution, with exponent around one in the early phases of the outbreak (when the number of cases was growing rapidly) and less than one thereafter. This finding is significant because it implies that (i) COVID\\\\19 cases in China is heavy tailed and disperse; (ii) a few cities account for a disproportionate share of COVID\\\\19 cases; and (iii) the distribution generally has no finite mean or variance.

At this point, psychodermatology forms a common field of study based on the relationship and interaction between psychiatry and dermatology. Cosmetology is a special group within dermatology, and the psychosocial needs of this group differ. In this study, it was aimed to examine the moods such as anxiety, fear and depression experienced by the patients during their application to the cosmetology unit during the COVID-19 pandemic process and to compare them with the control group. A total of 162 cases, 80 cases from the cosmetology unit meeting the specified conditions and 82 cases as the control group, were retrospectively evaluated. In all participants, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) scores decreased significantly compared to the beginning of the pandemic (p=0.001). In the study, while depression (HAM-D) and general anxiety (HAM-A) were higher in the cosmetology group compared to the control group (respectively p=0.049, p=0.001), there was no difference in coronavirus anxiety scores (CAS) (p=0.24). It should be known that patients who underwent cosmetological procedures during the pandemic period may have anxiety and depression. In this patient group, which requires a special psychodermatological approach, pandemic effects should also be considered.

Reactivation of HBV refers to an increase in the HBV load caused by chemotherapy in a patient with HBV infection. Reactivation of HBV is classified into 2 categories: reactivation in a carrier and reactivation in a patient with resolved HBV infection. Because hepatitis caused by HBV reactivation is more likely to become severe and makes the treatment of original diseases difficult, it is most important to prevent the onset of hepatitis. The basic strategy for prevention and treatment of HBV reactivation associated with powerful chemotherapy regimens should follow the guidelines for the management of hepatitis B virus infection by the Japan Society of Hepatology. Risk of HBV reactivation is determined by HBV infection status and the degree of immunosuppression. HBV infection status is classified into chronic active hepatitis, inactive carrier, and resolved infection. This corresponds, in descending order, to the risk of reactivation. Patients undergoing chemotherapy should be screened for HBV infection. HBsAg levels should be measured in all patients prior to commencement of treatment. In HBsAg-positive patients, HBeAg, anti-HBe antibody, and HBV DNA levels should also be measured. In HBsAg-negative patients, anti-HBc antibody and anti-HBs antibody should be measured. The next step for patients with resolved HBV infection is measurement of HBV DNA levels. In patients with resolved HBV infection whose HBV DNA level is 20 IU/mL or higher, as in inactive carriers, prophylactic therapy should be commenced before chemotherapy. In patients with resolved HBV infection whose HBV DNA level is less than 20 IU/mL, periodic monitoring of HBV DNA should be performed during and after chemotherapy. Preemptive therapy should be started immediately if the HBV DNA level ex- ceeds 20 IU/mL.","output":"[Viral Hepatitis]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe reported changes in sexual behaviours, including virtual sex (sexting and cybersex), and access to HIV/STI testing and care during COVID-19 measures in Panama. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey from 8 August to 12 September 2020 among adults (18 years) residing in Panama. Participants were recruited through social media. Questions included demographics, access to HIV/STI testing and HIV care, and sexual behaviours 3 months before COVID-19 social distancing measures and during social distancing measures (COVID-19 measures). Logistic regression was used to identify associations between variables and behavioural changes. RESULTS: We recruited 960 participants; 526 (54.8%) identified as cis-women, 366 (38.1%) cis-men and 68 (7.1%) non-binary or another gender. The median age was 28 years (IQR: 23C37 years), and 531 of 957 (55.5%) were of mixed ethnicity (mixed Indigenous/European/Afro-descendant ancestry). Before COVID-19 measures, virtual sex was reported by 38.5% (181 of 470) of cis-women, 58.4% (184 of 315) cis-men and 45.0% (27 of 60) non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, virtual sex increased among 17.2% of cis-women, 24.7% cis-men and 8.9% non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, 230 of 800 (28.8%) participants reported decreased casual sex compared with pre-COVID-19 measures. Compared with pre-COVID-19 measures, decreased casual sex was reported more frequently during COVID-19 measures by cis-men compared with cis-women (39.2% vs 22.9%, urban/rural adjusted OR (AOR)=2.17, 95% CI 1.57 to 3.01), and by Afro-descendant compared with participants of mixed ethnicity (40.0% vs 29.8%, AOR=1.78, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.94). Compared with no change in virtual sex (16.8%), increased virtual sex (38.5%, AOR=1.78, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.88) and decreased virtual sex (86.7%, AOR=16.53, 95% CI 7.74 to 35.27) were associated with decreased casual sex encounters. During COVID-19 measures, HIV/STI testing could not be obtained by 58.0% (58 of 100) of the participants who needed a test, and interrupted HIV care was reported by 53.3% (8 of 15) of participants living with HIV.

Our argument is that the EPSR witnesses a renewed activism of the European Commission-led supranationalism, which unfolds through the revival of the Community Method in a political environment marked by an increased domestic politicisation of the European integration process. In so doing, the EPSR acted as both a polity-maintenance and policy-trigger strategy by deepening the EU integration in social policy domain after a decade of substantial polity inertia.

Functional antibody testing with a panel of nine SARS-CoV-2 viral variant receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins reveal marked differences in vaccine responses, with low antibody levels and RBD-ACE2 blocking activity stimulated by the Sinopharm and Sputnik V vaccines in comparison to the AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. The Alpha variant caused 97% of infections in Mongolia in June and early July 2021. Individuals who recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination achieve high antibody titers in most cases.

The primary objective was to evaluate the association of marital conflict, pregnancy status, socioeconomic status, and stressful life events with violence, depression, anxiety, and stress. The secondary objective was to evaluate the mediating effect of violence on psychological distress. Methods: : A cross-sectional study was conducted among 369 women between June 8 and August 1, 2020. The questionnaire was developed on Google Forms and distributed online, using the snowball technique. Results: : Higher marital conflict (Beta=0.159), financial difficulties (Beta=2.572), a history of child abuse (Beta=2.546), and higher violence scores (Beta=0.121) were significantly associated with higher depression scores. Higher marital conflict (Beta=0.358) and having financial difficulties (Beta=3.859) were significantly associated with higher anxiety scores. Higher marital conflict (Beta=0.070) and financial difficulties (Beta=1.483) were significantly associated with higher perceived stress scores. Composite abuse scale partially mediated the association between pregnancy status (25.28%), financial difficulties (7.71%), history of child abuse (21.92%), abuse by a family member (50.50%), and anxiety scale. Also, the composite abuse scale partially mediated the association between marital conflict (21.42%), financial difficulties (14.17%), history of child abuse (20.05%), abuse by a family member (33.57%), and depression scale. Conclusion: Our main findings suggest that violence mediated the association between pregnancy status, marital conflicts, financial difficulties, and depression and anxiety but did not mediate between these factors and stress.

Since little was known about the new virus at the time, the initial reaction in many countries, including most countries in Europe, was to follow their existing pandemic influenza response plans. Countries that adopted this approach presumed that case- and contact-based management would be unable to cope with the scale of the outbreak and widespread community transmission would be inevitable. Yet it became increasingly apparent that COVID-19 was not like pandemic influenza, not least because it was caused by a coronavirus similar to SARS that had emerged in 2003 and whose successful management, maximum suppression leading to elimination, had been very different to that normally adopted with influenza. This was soon confirmed by knowledge of its transmission dynamics and epidemiology, as well as evidence from Wuhan, where the virus has been effectively eliminated even after widespread community transmission had commenced. There was also strong evidence to support the elimination approach from the early success of Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea and several countries outside Asia, such as New Zealand and Australia, which adopted a similar approach. As the pandemic continues into its second year, national responses to COVID-19 so far offer useful learning for the months ahead, as well as broader lessons for health system strengthening for the post-pandemic recovery. Countries that have been the most effective in containing the virus and preventing its resurgence offer valuable lessons to those that are still struggling with large numbers of cases and deaths. Mistakes or mis-steps are also important for future learning and decision-making. This workshop draws on the conceptual framework for analysing health system resilience developed by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (Policy Brief 36 Strengthening health systems resilience: key concepts and strategies') and on the methodology and content compiled in the COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor (HSRM), which tracks policy responses to the pandemic in the WHO European Region. The purpose of the workshop is to distil learning from national and international responses into a set of resilience enhancing strategies, thereby offering crucial learning for reacting to similar shocks in the future and enabling the commitment to build back better'. The workshop is organised as five presentations, each covering the key resilience enhancing strategies as well as examples of metrics to assess them: 1. Governing the COVID-19 response. 2. Financing the COVID-19 response. 3. Mobilizing human resources. 4. Delivering public health interventions. 5. Delivering health and social services. KEY MESSAGES: Analysis of national responses to the pandemic so far enables distilling a set of resilience enhancing strategies that offer crucial learning for responding to similar shocks in the future. Governance plays a crucial role in ensuring that financing, human and physical resources are optimally deployed, in their given national contexts, to ensure effective delivery of services.","output":"4.I.

COVID-19 containment measures, including isolation and triage, led to restrictions in the health care of chronically ill patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health care of IBD patients. METHODS: In this multicentre cross-sectional study to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health and quality of care of patients with inherited bleeding disorder, an ad hoc questionnaire was sent to 586 patients/parents of children with haemophilia A, B or von Willebrand syndrome type 3. In addition to demographic and clinical data, patients/parents of patients with inherited bleeding disorders were asked about their thoughts, concerns and experiences regarding their medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences between clinical subgroups were calculated. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between subgroups (severity, type of therapy, product class, comorbidities) with regard to the transmission of COVID-19 through plasma products, the effects of COVID-19 positive test results, fear of getting COVID-19, delayed drug supply and physiotherapy treatment. DISCUSSION: The medical care of patients with inherited bleeding disorders, who need a continuous supply of essential drugs, is a particular challenge in times of pandemics. Therefore, worries and fears of IBD patients should be taken seriously and innovative communication channels established to maintain therapy standards and quality of care.","output":"[Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Medical Care of Patients with Inherited Bleeding Disorders]./ Auswirkungen der COVID-19 Pandemie auf die medizinische Versorgung von Patienten mit angeborenen Blutungsneigungen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and diabetes have major impacts on the health of the population across the world.

The designed framework comprises 13 normalized indicators and two diagnostic studies, covering the economic, social, environmental, and institutional sustainability dimensions, and their intersections. Indicators are normalized using the concept of load capacity of a system, similarly to the planetary boundaries. Thus, the graphical representation of results facilitates their multidimensional analysis. The framework was applied to three case studies: traditional fuelwood in rural households, charcoal for restaurant grilling, and electricity cogeneration from sugarcane bagasse. This was part of an iterative process of testing and refining the framework and simultaneously demonstrating its application in the Mexican bioenergy context. This led to the conclusion that the resulting framework (a) provides a useful, quantitative, and comprehensive overview of both broad and specific sustainability aspects of the assessed system; (b) requires a balance of accessible but also scattered or sensitive data, similarly to most existing frameworks; (c) is highly flexible and applicable to both modern and traditional solid biofuels; and (d) is simple to communicate and interpret for a wide audience.

This study was designed to examine the effect of this unique time on artistic voice users, the way they perceive their voice and their voice-related behaviors. METHODS: A total of 110 participants volunteered for the study: 57 professional artistic voice users (34 singers and 19 actors) and a control group of 53 nonprofessional voice users. All participants completed three questionnaires related to their self-assessment of their voice, their voice difficulties, vocal training, and current stress in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Compared to the controls, artistic voice users were more concerned about their voice (P < 0.001), practiced their voice more often (P < 0.001), and experienced more anxiety and stress (P < 0.05). In addition, within the professional group, singers reported practicing their voice in the time of the COVID-19 significantly more than actors (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Professional artistic voice users experience the COVID-19 pandemic as a stressful time, with negative effects on their well-being and specifically on their voice. This should be considered in the treatment and maintenance of their voice and professional career at current and future stressful times.","output":"Songbirds Must Sing: How Artistic Voice Users Perceive Their Voice in Times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute pancreatitis in dogs is a prevalent disease characterised by mild to severe inflammation. Treatment with anti-inflammatory corticosteroids has been widely debated but is not generally recommended in veterinary medicine. The objective of the present study was to present current evidence on the effect of corticosteroid treatment for acute/acute-on-chronic pancreatitis across species. These findings were then used to evaluate if and how corticosteroid treatment could influence disease outcome in canine acute/acute-on-chronic pancreatitis. A scoping review was performed by searching the Agricola, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE and Embase databases to identify relevant articles published before June 24, 2021. The inclusion criteria were English language, original research published in a peer-reviewed journal, and investigation of corticosteroid treatment effects on acute/acute-on-chronic pancreatitis by the outcome parameters clinical score, circulating CRP level, hospitalisation duration, mortality and pancreas histopathology. Research on any species was considered. Studies were rated based on the level of evidence, and methodological quality was evaluated based on similarity between groups at baseline, risk of bias and study group size. The reporting method was based on the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. One thousand nine hundred fifty-four studies were identified, and 31 met the inclusion criteria. Five were canine studies, with 4 investigating experimentally induced pancreatitis; 5 were human clinical studies; and 21 were rodent studies of experimentally induced pancreatitis. The level of evidence ranged between randomised controlled trials and case series, the estimated risk of bias ranged from low to high, and the sample sizes ranged from very small to moderate. Evidence indicates that adding corticosteroid to symptomatic treatment of acute/acute-on-chronic canine pancreatitis could have a positive influence on disease outcome. However, the analysed evidence was based on several species, including both naturally occurring and experimentally induced pancreatitis; thus, the authors suggest that large randomised controlled studies should be performed in dogs with spontaneously occurring acute/acute-on-chronic pancreatitis to further elucidate a potential benefit of corticosteroid treatment.

Thus, the implementation of autonomous systems capable of monitoring the so-called social distance gained much interest. In this paper, we aim to address this task leveraging a single RGB frame without additional depth sensors. In contrast to existing single-image alternatives failing when ground localization is not available, we rely on single image depth estimation to perceive the 3D structure of the observed scene and estimate the distance between people. During the setup phase, a straightforward calibration procedure, leveraging a scale-aware SLAM algorithm available even on consumer smartphones, allows us to address the scale ambiguity affecting single image depth estimation. We validate our approach through indoor and outdoor images employing a calibrated LiDAR + RGB camera asset. Experimental results highlight that our proposal enables sufficiently reliable estimation of the inter-personal distance to monitor social distancing effectively. This fact confirms that despite its intrinsic ambiguity, if appropriately driven single image depth estimation can be a viable alternative to other depth perception techniques, more expensive and not always feasible in practical applications. Our evaluation also highlights that our framework can run reasonably fast and comparably to competitors, even on pure CPU systems. Moreover, its practical deployment on low-power systems is around the corner.","output":"Monitoring social distancing with single image depth estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Burnout among millennial medical students is an important health issue with a possibility of potential professional dissatisfaction. The reason for burnout is multifactorial. The gender of the medical student may play a significant role when choosing a residency specialty and making a career choice. Gender may also influence while establishing the burnout seen in students. Here we tested the association between burnout in medical students based on gender and residency specialty choice during COVID-19. METHODS: A multicentric cross-sectional study, using a questionnaire-based survey on the items related to gender, educational interest, status, residency aspiration, changes to career aspiration based on gender, and COVID-19 and an indigenous burnout assessment tool that was administered to all the medical students in the study. Reliability and validity of the tool were assessed, and the burnout was calculated for emotional exhaustion, personal achievement, and depersonalization domain. RESULTS: A total of 487 medical students (42.5% males, 57.2% females) completed the survey. A higher number of female participants felt that COVID-19 affected their energy levels (68.9%), interest in education (53.2%), and developed reservations about residency specialty of choice (46%); emotional and physical exhaustion (2.88  0.69 & 2.34  0.76) was higher than the male participants (3.16  0.67 & 2.75  0.85).

Liver surgery can be associated with excessive intraoperative blood loss, not only because the liver is a highly vascularized organ, but also because it plays a central role in the hemostatic system. Intraoperative blood loss and transfusion of blood products have been shown to be negatively associated with postoperative outcome after liver surgery. Dysfunction of the liver is frequently accompanied with a dysfunctional hemostatic system. However, in general, there is a poor correlation between preoperative coagulation tests and the intraoperative bleeding risk in patients undergoing liver surgery. Strategies to avoid excessive blood loss in liver surgery have been an active field of research and include three different areas: surgical methods, anesthesiological methods, and pharmacological agents.Surgeons can minimize blood loss by clamping the hepatic vasculature, by using specific dissection devices, and by using topical hemostatic agents. Anesthesiologists play an important role in minimizing blood loss by avoiding intravascular fluid overload. Maintaining a low central venous pressure has shown to be very effective in reducing blood loss during partial liver resections. Prophylactic transfusion of blood products such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has not been shown to reduce intraoperative bleeding and even seems counterproductive as it results in an increase of the intravascular filling status, which may enhance the bleeding risk. In patients with liver cirrhosis, there is increasing evidence that factors such as portal hypertension and the hyperdynamic circulation play a more important role in the bleeding tendency than changes in the coagulation system. Therefore, intravenous fluid restriction rather than prophylactic administration of large volumes of blood products (i.e., FFP) is recommended in patients undergoing major liver surgery. Pharmacological agents such as antifibrinolytic drugs or recombinant factor VIIa may be indicated in selected individual patients, but these agents do not have a routine role in the management of patients undergoing liver surgery.","output":"Prohemostatic interventions in liver surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of February 29, 2020, more than 85,000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported from China and 53 other countries with 2,924 deaths.

However, we sometimes experience refractory cases with insufficient peripheral circulation or microcirculation after revascularization. In this situation, additional therapy can be administered, such as low-density lipoprotein apheresis, high-pressure oxygen therapy, and spinal cord stimulation.

As the efficacy of ISDN-P for patients with CLTI is not well-known, we examined it in this study. We assessed the skin perfusion pressure (SPP) after affixing an ISDN-P on the foot, because SPP measurement has proved useful in the assessment of PAD and is a good indicator of wound healing potential.

METHODS We invited individuals with Parkinson's disease enrolled in a phase III clinical trial (STEADY-PD III) to enroll in a sub-study of remote video-based visits. Participants completed three remote visits over one year within four weeks of an in-person visit and completed assessments performed during the remote visit. We evaluated the ability to complete scheduled assessments remotely; agreement between remote and in-person outcome measures; and opinions of remote visits. RESULTS We enrolled 40 participants (mean (SD) age 64.3 (10.4), 29% women), and 38 (95%) completed all remote visits. There was excellent correlation (ICC 0.81-0.87) between remote and in-person patient-reported outcomes, and moderate correlation (ICC 0.43-0.51) between remote and in-person motor assessments. On average, remote visits took around one quarter of the time of in-person visits (54 vs 190 minutes). Nearly all participants liked remote visits, and three-quarters said they would be more likely to participate in future trials if some visits could be conducted remotely.

We evaluate the question of non-White distancing using social mobility data from Google on three sites: workplaces, grocery stores, and recreational locations. Employing hierarchical linear modeling and geographically weighted regression, we find the relation of race/ethnicity to COVID-19 distancing is varied across the United States. The HLM models show that compared to Black populations, Hispanic populations overall more effectively distance from recreation sites and grocery stores: each point increase in percent Hispanic was related to residents being 0.092 percent less likely (p< 0.05) to visit recreational sites and 0.127 percent less likely (p< 0.01) to visit grocery stores since the onset of COVID-19. However, the GWR models show there are places where the percent Black is locally related to recreation distancing while percent Hispanic is not. Further, these models show the association of percent Black to recreation and grocery distancing can be locally as strong as 1.057 percent (p< 0.05) and 0.989 percent (p< 0.05), respectively.

It has been proposed that the neuroinvasive potential of the novel SARS-CoV-2 could be due to olfactory bulb invasion, conversely studies suggest it could be a good prognostic factor. The aim of the current study was to investigate the prognosis value of OGD in COVID-19. These symptoms were recorded on admission from a cohort study of 5868 patients with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 infection included in the multicenter international HOPE Registry (NCT04334291). There was statistical relation in multivariate analysis for OGD in gender, more frequent in female 12.41% vs 8.67% in male, related to age, more frequent under 65 years, presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoke, renal insufficiency, lung, heart, cancer and neurological disease. We did not find statistical differences in pregnant (p = 0.505), patient suffering cognitive (p = 0.484), liver (p = 0.1) or immune disease (p = 0.32). There was inverse relation (protective) between OGD and prone positioning (0.005) and death (< 0.0001), but no with ICU (0.165) or mechanical ventilation (0.292). On univariable logistic regression, OGD was found to be inversely related to death in COVID-19 patients. The odds ratio was 0.26 (0.15-0.44) (p < 0.001) and Z was - 5.05.

Patient decision aids (PtDAs) are tools used in clinical practices to facilitate active patient involvement in healthcare decision-making. Nonetheless, PtDA effects have not been systematically evaluated for hip and knee total joint arthroplasty (TJA) decision-making. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the effect of patient decision aids compared to alternative of care on quality and process of decision-making when provided to adults with hip and knee osteoarthritis considering primary elective TJA. METHODS This systematic review will follow the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. This protocol was reported based on the PRISMA-P checklist guidelines. Studies will be searched in CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Eligible studies will be randomized control trial (RCT) evaluating the effect of PtDA on TJA decision-making. Descriptive and meta-analysis of outcomes will include decision quality (knowledge and values-based choice), decisional conflict, patient involvement, decision-making process satisfaction, actual decision made, health outcomes, and harm(s). Risk of bias will be evaluated with Cochrane's risk of bias tool for RCTs. Quality and strength of recommendations will be appraised with Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). DISCUSSION This review will provide a summary of RCT findings on PtDA effect on decision-making quality and process of adults with knee and hip osteoarthritis considering primary elective TJA. Further, it will provide evidence comparing different types of PtDA used for TJA decision-making.

If we detect Covid-19 patients in earlier stage and take required actions, we can save all patients. In this proposal we want to design automated digital screening tool to identify the people in the first week of the pandemic. Based on machine learning techniques, system will be trained as per the day to day symptoms. ASHA workers from Rural Health Centre can collect the all the peoples information related to Covid-19. By using Classification algorithm system will classify the people into different categories like healthy people (no any symptoms), first day of covid-19, second day covid-19, upto fourteenth day of covid-19. Data set required for training the model will be created by studying covid-19 patients per day history. Like first day he had aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea etc., related any symptoms. Similarly, we will prepare dataset of 5000 patients. Using this dataset model will be trained. After training the model whenever such type of pandemic occurs we will detect the infected people in early stage. We will reach to each of the citizen of India through social workers, ASHA worker, Rural Health care staff. Collect information of each person by using attributes which is decided for dataset. We will provide collected dataset (each citizen information) to our designed system. Designed system will classify according to classes mentioned above. If person don't have any symptoms related to covid-19 means he is healthy. If he had any symptoms according to day we have classified then such type of people immediately informed and according to requirement they will be kept in isolation, quarantine or hospitalized immediately. If we able to identify during the first week of pandemic then we can break chain at early stage and we can avoid spreading of coronavirus to large number of people. If we use such type of system then no need of lockdown for long period is required. Time required only for collecting the information, identifying the infected people and take appropriate action as mentioned above. Maximum 1 week of lockdown will be sufficient and we can stop chain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who were referred to our clinic with active CS from 31st March to 15th May 2020 were screened for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Late-night serum cortisol (64-327 nmol/L), late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC) (0.5-9.4 nmol/L), or 24-h urinary free cortisol (24 hUFC) (100-379 nmol/24 h) were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS: Among 22 patients with active CS we found three cases affected by COVID-19. Nonspecific inflammation markers were within the reference range or slightly elevated in these patients. A 71-year-old woman with newly diagnosed CS (late-night serum cortisol >1750 nmol/L, LNSC 908.6 nmol/L) developed dyspnea as an only symptom and died from bilateral polysegmantal hemorrhagic pneumonia 7 days later. A 38-year-old woman with a 5-year medical history of active Cushing's disease (CD) (late-night serum cortisol 581.3 nmol/L, 24 hUFC 959.7 nmol/24-h) suffered from dyspnea, cough, fever (39.3 C) and chest pain. Oxygen therapy, antibiotics and symptomatic treatments lead to full recovery 24 days later. A 66-year-old woman with a 4-year medical history of mild CD (late-night serum cortisol 603.4 nmol/L, LNSC 10.03 nmol/L) tested positive for COVID-19 in routine screening and remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of COVID-19 in patients with CS depends on the severity of hypercortisolism. Thus, severe hypercortisolism is a warning sign that CS affected by COVID-19 could require emergency care despite a lack of clinical presentations and low inflammation biomarkers.","output":"Clinical course and outcome of patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome infected with novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19): case presentations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automatic Identification System (AIS) data represents a rich source of information about maritime traffic and offers a great potential for data analytics and predictive modelling solutions, which can help optimizing logistic chains and reducing environmental impacts.

There have been reports on enucleation for EGJ GISTs in order to avoid gastrectomy. But the number of patients is too small, or the follow-up period is too short to evaluate it. The purpose of this study was to review our experience of 59 patients with EGJ GISTs treated by enucleation by percutaneous endoscopic intragastric surgery (PEIGS) and assess the clinical outcomes. METHODS PEIGS is performed as described below. Access ports are placed through the abdominal wall and the anterior wall of the stomach. Through the access ports, an endoscope and surgical instruments are inserted into the gastric lumen and tumor enucleation and closure of the defect are carried out. In this study, 59 patients with EGJ GISTs treated by PEIGS between 2005 and 2013 were enrolled. Their hospital records were reviewed, and follow-up data for 8 years were collected to analyze the outcomes. RESULTS En-bloc enucleation was achieved without tumor rupture in all. Average operation time was 172.3 min. Postoperative complications occurred in 3 (one localized peritonitis, one bleeding, and one surgical site infection). Average tumor size was 35.6 mm. Pathological findings confirmed negative margin in all specimens. The maximum follow-up period was 101 months. Multiple liver metastases were detected in two patients (at 12 and 29 months). The survival rate was 100 %. The disease-free rate was 98.3 % at 12 months and 96.6 % at 29 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS As far as the short- and long-term outcomes of our experience are reviewed, PEIGS seems as curative as other aggressive resection methods such as proximal gastrectomy. Tumor enucleation by PEIGS, offering a chance to preserve the stomach, can be a preferable option in carefully selected patients with EGJ GISTs, when performed by a skilled surgeon.","output":"Long-term outcomes of percutaneous endoscopic intragastric surgery in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors at the esophagogastric junction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The serious coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

The aim of this study was to assess the spread of dental aerosols on patients and dental providers during aerosol-generating dental procedures. METHODS: This pilot study was conducted with one volunteer. A dental unit used at the dental school for general dental care was the site of the experiment. Before the study, three measurement meters (DustTrak 8534, PTrak 8525 and AeroTrak 9306) were used to measure the ambient distribution of particles in the ambient air surrounding the dental chair. The volunteer wore a bouffant, goggles, and shoe covers and was seated in the dental chair in supine position, and covered with a surgical drape. The dentist and dental assistant donned bouffant, goggles, face shields, N95 masks, surgical gowns and shoe covers. The simulation was conducted by using a high-speed handpiece with a diamond bur operating in the oral cavity for 6 min without touching the teeth. A new set of measurement was obtained while using an ultrasonic scaler to clean all teeth of the volunteer. For both aerosol generating procedures, the aerosol particles were measured with the use of saliva ejector (SE) and high-speed suction (HSS) followed a separate set of measurement with the additional use of an extra oral high-volume suction (HVS) unit that was placed close to the mouth to capture the aerosol in addition to SE and HSS. The distribution of the air particles, including the size and concentration of aerosols, was measured around the patient, dentist, dental assistant, 3 feet above the patient, and the floor. RESULTS: Four locations were identified with elevated aerosol levels compared to the baseline, including the chest of the dentist, the chest of patient, the chest of assistant and 3 feet above the patient. The use of additional extra oral high volume suction reduced aerosol to or below the baseline level. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of the level of aerosol with size less than 10 m was minimal during dental procedures when using SE and HSS.

Life-stage vulnerability can be ranked as larvae > adults > juveniles, based on mortality, tissue pathology and the capacity to employ cellular stress responses, reflecting the different environmental niches of each life stage. While larvae lacked acclimation capacity, which resulted in damage to tissues and elevated mortality, juveniles coped well with elevated temperature. The rapid induction of cytoprotective proteins maintained the integrity of vital organs in juveniles, suggesting adaptive phenotypic plasticity in coastal and estuarine waters. Adults displayed lower plasticity to heatwaves as they transition to deeper habitats for maturation, showing tissue damage in brain, liver and muscle.

This method first adopts a random sampling method based on a potential function. Second, based on a probability value, the nearest neighbour node is selected by the nearest Euclidean distance to the random sampling point and the minimum cost function, and in the expansion of new nodes, twice expansion methods are used to accelerate the search efficiency of the algorithm. The first expansion adopts the goal-biased expansion strategy, and the second expansion adopts the strategy of random sampling in a rectangular area. Then, the parent node of the new node is reselected, and the path is rerouted to obtain a clear path from the initial point to the target point. Redundant node deletion and the maximum curvature constraint are used to remove redundant nodes and minimize the curvature on the generated path to reduce the tortuosity of the path. The Bezier curve is used to fit the processed path and obtain the trajectory planning curve for the manipulator.

However, if this approach is to be adopted widely, it is critical that we understand the perspective of those who will be delivering and receiving DCT. The aim of this qualitative process study embedded in the randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to improve understanding of a range of behavioural factors that could influence implementation. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 63 participants, including staff, students, and parents of students who had been identified as being in close contact with someone with COVID-19. The topic guide explored perceptions of daily testing, understanding of positive and negative test results, and adherence to guidance. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS: Results were organised under three main headings: (1) factors influencing daily testing (2) interpretation of test results (3) behaviour during testing period. Participants recognized that daily testing may allow students to remain in school, which was viewed as necessary for both education and social needs. Whilst some felt safer as a result of daily testing, others raised concerns about safety. Participants did not always understand how to interpret and respond to test results, and although participants reported high levels of adherence to the guidance, improved communications were desired. CONCLUSION: Daily testing may be a feasible and acceptable alternative to self-isolation among close contacts of people who test positive. However, improved communications are needed to ensure that all students and parents have a good understanding of the rationale for testing, what test results mean, how test results should be acted on, and how likely students are to test positive following close contact.

Methods: This study is a follow-up evaluation of changes in HCWs' knowledge, attitudes, and practices as well as anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. Data were collected through an anonymous, predesigned, self-administered questionnaire that was sent online to HCWs in Saudi Arabia. Results: The questionnaire was sent to 1500 HCWs, with a 63.8% response rate (N=957). The majority of respondents were female (83%), and the most common age group was 31-40 years (52.2%). Nurses constituted 86.3% of the respondents. HCWs reported higher anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic which increased from 4.91{+/-}2.84 to 8.6{+/-}2.27 on an 11-point Likert scale compared to other viral outbreaks. HCWs believed that their own preparedness as well as that of their hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) or emergency room (ER) was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus pandemic (2012-2015). About 58% of HCWs attended one or more simulations concerning the management of COVID-19 patients in their ICU/ER, and nearly all had undergone N95 mask fit testing.

Although integrin-targeting clinical trials, especially in cancer, did not meet the high expectations yet, integrins remain highly interesting therapeutic targets. In this article, we analyze the state-of-the-art knowledge on the roles of a subfamily of integrins, which require binding of the tripeptide motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) for cell adhesion and signal transduction, in cancer, in tumor-associated exosomes, in fibrosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we outline the latest achievements in the design and development of synthetic ligands, which are highly selective and affine to single integrin subtypes, i.e., v3, v5, 51, v6, v8, and v1. Lastly, we present the substantial progress in the field of nuclear and optical molecular imaging of integrins, including first-in-human and clinical studies. ABSTRACT: Integrins have been extensively investigated as therapeutic targets over the last decades, which has been inspired by their multiple functions in cancer progression, metastasis, and angiogenesis as well as a continuously expanding number of other diseases, e.g., sepsis, fibrosis, and viral infections, possibly also Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Although integrin-targeted (cancer) therapy trials did not meet the high expectations yet, integrins are still valid and promising targets due to their elevated expression and surface accessibility on diseased cells. Thus, for the future successful clinical translation of integrin-targeted compounds, revisited and innovative treatment strategies have to be explored based on accumulated knowledge of integrin biology. For this, refined approaches are demanded aiming at alternative and improved preclinical models, optimized selectivity and pharmacological properties of integrin ligands, as well as more sophisticated treatment protocols considering dose fine-tuning of compounds. Moreover, integrin ligands exert high accuracy in disease monitoring as diagnostic molecular imaging tools, enabling patient selection for individualized integrin-targeted therapy. The present review comprehensively analyzes the state-of-the-art knowledge on the roles of RGD-binding integrin subtypes in cancer and non-cancerous diseases and outlines the latest achievements in the design and development of synthetic ligands and their application in biomedical, translational, and molecular imaging approaches. Indeed, substantial progress has already been made, including advanced ligand designs, numerous elaborated pre-clinical and first-in-human studies, while the discovery of novel applications for integrin ligands remains to be explored.","output":"RGD-Binding Integrins Revisited: How Recently Discovered Functions and Novel Synthetic Ligands (Re-)Shape an Ever-Evolving Field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have spread to millions of people globally.

In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 received vaccine and 3 received placebo. Groups were distinguished by vaccine candidate, age of participant, and vaccine dose level. Interim safety and immunogenicity data of BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from US and German trials. We now present additional safety and immunogenicity data from the US Phase 1 trial that supported selection of the vaccine candidate advanced to a pivotal Phase 2/3 safety and efficacy evaluation.

Little is known about the changes in the level of experience general people went through during the first few months after the coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared as a Pandemic. This longitudinal qualitative study explores the general publics reports of their experience with the COVID-19 Pandemic during its early stage. An online survey was conducted using a convenience/snowball sampling technique in March and again in May 2020, where North American adults with at least a college-degree, and female majority, shared their experiences with the COVID-19 Pandemic in response to an open-ended question, apart from completing questionnaires assessing transitional impact and psychological well-being. Open responses were first content analyzed to identify themes most commonly reported, and then, the quantitative analysis examined the reliability of the changes of themes between the two-time points. Text-analysis of the open-responses from the two waves identified seven themes, namely emotional response, social contact, virus-infected, financial impact, impact on plans, disease, and non-disease related concern, as well as social-distance. These themes indicated that, (a) people were distressed and having negative affective thoughts; (b) they spoke more about their plans-and-goals that were affected by the Pandemic than their financial condition; (c) people mostly used digital platforms to maintain contact with their social network, although they preferred face-to-face interactions; (d) they spoke more about the infection experienced by people in general than infection experienced by themselves and individuals they know. Surprisingly, (e) people mentioned more about the way the Pandemic had disrupted their day-to-day activities than the disease-related health concern. Finally, (f) most of the respondents approved of the practice of social distancing while some expressed its negative or neutral effect on their social lives. The quantitative measure determined that as time passed, peoples experience with the Pandemic became quite different as people talked more about getting infected, and their affected goals-and-plans. We concluded with a remark that this Pandemic would most likely leave an impression on peoples lives and that these online comment-style responses might provide us with insights into peoples perspectives as the Pandemic unfolds, helping us in understanding the uniqueness of the Pandemic experience of individuals for an effective tailored intervention to protect their well-being during a health-crisis.","output":"Exploring Peoples Reaction and Perceived Issues of the COVID-19 Pandemic at Its Onset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207C222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm(2) of 222-nm light inactivating >95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus.

The present results suggest that duration of the peaking of the second wave is almost same for several countries considered. The growth rate is also on the same order of several countries regardless of the total number of infections in a particular country. Since the decay of the growth rate is self-similar to that during the increase in the second wave of several countries, we can predict the end of the second wave in India.

Much research on this topic focuses on algorithmic bias that disadvantages people based on their gender or racial identity. The related ethical problems are significant and well known. Algorithmic bias against other aspects of peoples social identity, for instance, their political orientation, remains largely unexplored. This paper argues that algorithmic bias against peoples political orientation can arise in some of the same ways in which algorithmic gender and racial biases emerge. However, it differs importantly from them because there are (in a democratic society) strong social norms against gender and racial biases. This does not hold to the same extent for political biases. Political biases can thus more powerfully influence people, which increases the chances that these biases become embedded in algorithms and makes algorithmic political biases harder to detect and eradicate than gender and racial biases even though they all can produce similar harm. Since some algorithms can now also easily identify peoples political orientations against their will, these problems are exacerbated. Algorithmic political bias thus raises substantial and distinctive risks that the AI community should be aware of and examine.","output":"Algorithmic Political Bias in Artificial Intelligence Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: On the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown clearance in Saudi Arabia, the high-profile precautions were applied as a major step to resume the normal life activities and to coexist with the pandemic. One of those resumed activities is the reopening of the gym and fitness centers.

The purpose of this study was to assess the behavior of gym attendees toward preventive precautions prior to the pandemic and the behavioral changes that will be accommodated after the new policy and procedure of attending a gym and fitness centers. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in February 2020, a 1 month prior to the complete lockdown announcement in Saudi Arabia as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. An electronic questionnaire was provided during a personal interview with gym and fitness centers' participants. RESULTS: The majority of participants never use sterile wipes or any sterile product before or after using gym equipment (61.6%), and 35.4% of gym attendants do not use any sterilization materials distributed through fitness centers. In addition, most of the participants have had an episode of skin infections or respiratory infection at the fitness center for the past 12 months (22.2%), whereas 80.8% do not know about tinea microbial that causes athlete's foot, and 65.7% of them utilize the shower in the gym after their workout.

However, it is unclear why the RdRp complex needs proofreading and what the associated trade-offs are. Here we investigate the interplay among the accuracy, speed, and energetic cost of proofreading in the RdRp complex using a kinetic model and bioinformatics analysis. We find that proofreading nearly optimizes the rate of functional virus production. However, we find that further optimization would lead to a significant increase in the proofreading cost. Unexpected importance of the cost minimization is further supported by other global analyses. We speculate that cost optimization could help avoid cell defense responses. Thus, proofreading is essential for the production of functional viruses, but its rate is limited by energy costs.","output":"Theoretical Analysis Reveals the Cost and Benefit of Proofreading in Coronavirus Genome Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Socialising a puppy is a challenge at the best of times, but particularly more so during lockdown.

Multiple similarities between the two conditions were drawn in the past. This article seeks to further clarify potential underlying mechanisms related to hypoxia and pulmonary vascular responses. It does so by looking at perfusion imaging of patients with COVID-19 and comparing them with patterns observed in HAPE and hypoxic exposure. Two separate clinical cases are reviewed. The salient aspect of each case that is emphasized is the perfusion scintigraphy results that revealed heterogeneous perfusion patterns in both patients. Heterogeneous or non-homogeneous perfusion is also observed in HAPE. A detailed clinical course of each patient is described. Medications utilized to treat the conditions are outlined as well as laboratory parameters and clinical findings. Interestingly, both of these patients were treated with calcium channel blockers and this class of medications is utilized to prevent HAPE as well. Discussion following the case presentations attempts to contextualize possible implications of this and other studies on the broader pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease. Findings related to pathophysiologic patterns and treatment strategies are also described. Micro-thrombi formation has been reported in both COVID-19 and HAPE as well and may be an accessory complication of perfusion compromise. In a separate study, vasodilatation with calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy has been associated with improved mortality in COVID-19 and potential pathophysiologic mechanisms were previously presented. This case report provides further clinical findings that support the notion that perfusion deficits are an integral component of hypoxia in COVID-19.

Earlier reports suggest the use of HIV anti-viral drugs for targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in the year 2002C2003. Hence, drug repurposing approach may prove to be useful in targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The high-resolution crystal structure of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6LU7) was used as the target. The Food and Drug Administration approved and SWEETLEAD database of drug molecules were screened. The apo form of the main protease was simulated for a cumulative of 150 ns and 10 s open-source simulation data was used, to obtain conformations for ensemble docking. The representative structures for docking were selected using RMSD-based clustering and Markov State Modeling analysis. This ensemble docking approach for the main protease helped in exploring the conformational variation in the drug-binding site of the main protease leading to the efficient binding of more relevant drug molecules.

Males appeared to be more susceptible than females to COVID-19 induced heart injury, having higher CK and CK-MB in mild cases, and higher HBDH and LDH levels in severe cases. Age is also a susceptible factor to COVID-19, but affected males were younger than females. Conclusions This study reveals that the heart is also a major target of COVID-19 infection, and myocardial enzyme spectrum assays could help the diagnosis, prognosis and guide the treatments to prevent heart failure in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Analysis of myocardial enzyme spectrum in 230 COVID-19 patients of Chongqing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental challenges and has received commensurate widespread attention. Although it is a top priority for policymakers and scientists alike, the knowledge required to guide decisions, implement mitigation actions, and assess their outcomes remains inadequate. We argue that an integrated, global monitoring system for plastic pollution is needed to provide comprehensive, harmonized data for environmental, societal, and economic assessments. The initial focus on marine ecosystems has been expanded here to include atmospheric transport and terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. An earth-system-level plastic observation system is proposed as a hub for collecting and assessing the scale and impacts of plastic pollution across a wide array of particle sizes and ecosystems including air, land, water, and biota and to monitor progress toward ameliorating this problem. The proposed observation system strives to integrate new information and to identify pollution hotspots (i.e., production facilities, cities, roads, ports, etc.) and expands monitoring from marine environments to encompass all ecosystem types.

The induced temperature rise generated at these exposure parameters, hereafter termed thermal gradient, was measured and applied independently to cell suspensions in order to differentiate inactivation triggered by electric field (E-field) from heating. Treated cell suspensions were plated and cellular inactivation was quantified by colony counts after a 24-hour (h) incubation period. Additionally, cells from both exposure conditions were incubated with various antibiotic-soaked discs to determine if nsPEF exposure would induce changes in antibiotic susceptibility. Results indicate that, for both species, the total delivered energy (amplitude, pulse number and pulse duration) determined the magnitude of cell inactivation. Specifically, for 18.5 and 23.5 kV cm(?1) exposures, L. acidophilus was more sensitive to the inactivation effects of nsPEF than E. coli, however, for the 13.5 kV cm(?1) exposures E. coli was more sensitive, suggesting that L. acidophilus may need to meet an E-field threshold before significant inactivation can occur. Results also indicate that antibiotic susceptibility was enhanced by multiple nsPEF exposures, as observed by increased zones of growth inhibition. Moreover, for both species, a temperature increase of  20 C (89% of exposures) was not sufficient to significantly alter cell inactivation, whereas none of the thermal equivalent exposures were sufficient to change antibiotic susceptibility categories.","output":"600-ns pulsed electric fields affect inactivation and antibiotic susceptibilities of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As our understanding of the complications of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) evolve, subclinical cardiac pathology such as myocarditis, pericarditis, and right ventricular dysfunction in the absence of significant clinical symptoms represents a concern.

Low screening rates and limited surveillance led us to conduct a study in Dagahaley camp, located in the Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya to estimate SARS-COV-2 seroprevalence and, mortality and to identify changes in access to care during the pandemic. MethodsTo estimate seroprevalence, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among a sample of individuals (n=587) seeking care at the two main health centres and among all household members (n=619) of community health workers and traditional birth attendants working in the camp. We used a rapid immunologic assay (BIOSYNEX(R) COVID-19 BSS [IgG/IgM]) and adjusted for test performance and mismatch between the sampled population and that of the general camp population. To estimate mortality, we exhaustively interviewed all households (n=12860) in the camp about deaths occurring from January 2019 through March 2021. ResultsWe included 1206 participants in the seroprevalence study. In total, 8% (95% CI: 6.6%-9.7%) had a positive serologic test. After adjusting for test performance and standardizing on age, we estimated a seroprevalence of 5.8% (95% CI: 1.6%-8.4%).

Therefore, it is important to develop methods that will ensure that the COVID vaccine is allocated to the people who are at major risk until there is a sufficient global supply. Herein, I developed a machine-learning tool that could be applied to assess the risk in communities based on social, medical, and lifestyle risk factors. As a proof of concept, I modeled COVID risk in the Massachusetts communities using 29 risk factors, including the prevalence of preexisting comorbid conditions like COPD and social factors such as racial composition. Of the 29 factors, 14 were found to be significant (p < 0.1) indicators: poverty, food insecurity, lack of high school education, lack of health insurance coverage, premature mortality, population, population density, recent population growth, Asian percentage, high-occupancy housing, and preexisting prevalence of cancer, COPD, overweightness, and heart attacks. The machine-learning approach finds the 9 highest risk communities in the state of Massachusetts: Lynn, Brockton, Revere, Randolph, Lowell, New Bedford, Everett, Waltham, and Fitchburg. The 5 most at-risk counties are Suffolk, Middlesex, Bristol, Norfolk, and Plymouth. With appropriate data, the tool could evaluate risk in other communities, or even enumerate individual patient susceptibility. A ranking of communities by risk may help policymakers ensure equitable allocation of limited doses of the COVID vaccine.","output":"Novel Machine-Learned Approach for COVID-19 Resource Allocation: A Tool for EvaluatingCommunity Susceptibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently rare in children and they seem to have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults. However, SARS-Cov-2 pandemic has indirectly caused problems in pediatric medical assistance. In view of this we wanted to draw a picture of what happened during health emergency and analyze future prospects for restarting. METHODS: We involved the Italian pediatric scientific societies institutionally collected in the Italian Federation of Associations and Scientific Societies of the Pediatric Area (FIARPED); We sent a questionnaire to all scientific societies about the pediatric care activity during the COVID-19 emergency and future perspectives for the phase of post-containment. RESULTS: The analysis of the questionnaires showed significant decrease of:admission, outpatient visits and specialist consultancy activities during the COVID-19 emergency, primarily linked to the fear of infection. Instead it was increased the serious degree of diseases admitted. Most of scientific societies maintained the relationship with chronic patients through some form of telemedicine, reporting a strong positive opinion about this modality. Finally showed the need to give life a new approach for hospitalizations and outpatient visits through a greater use of telemedicine, educational programs on families and a more decisive role of family pediatricians. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted many aspects that can be improved in pediatric care. We think that It will be necessary a new shared strategy to improve the management and continuity of care for pediatric patients, primarily developing a network of collaboration between families, family pediatrician and hospitals and by enhancing the use of new methods of telecommunications.","output":"Point of view of the Italians pediatric scientific societies about the pediatric care during the COVID-19 lockdown: what has changed and future prospects for restarting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAt present, the entire world is in a war against COVID-19 pandemic which has gradually led us toward a more compromised new normal life SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenic microorganism liable for the recent COVID-19 outbreak, is extremely contagious in nature resulting in an unusual number of infections and death globally The lack of clinically proven therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 has dragged the worlds healthcare system into the biggest challenge Therefore, development of an efficient treatment scheme is now in great demand Screening of different biologically active plant-based natural compounds could be a useful strategy for combating this pandemic In the present research, a collection of 43 flavonoids of 7 different classes with previously recorded antiviral activity was evaluated via computational and bioinformatics tools for their impeding capacity against SARS-CoV-2 In silico drug likeness, pharmacophore and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) profile analysis of the finest ligands were carried out using DataWarrior, DruLiTo and admetSAR programs, respectively Molecular docking was executed by AutoDock Vina, while molecular dynamics simulation of the target proteinCligand bound complexes was done using nanoscalable molecular dynamics and visual molecular dynamics software package Finally, the molecular target analysis of the selected ligands within Homo sapiens was conducted with SwissTargetPredcition web server ResultsOut of the forty-three flavonoids, luteolin and abyssinone II were found to develop successful docked complex within the binding sites of target proteins in terms of lowest binding free energy and inhibition constant The root mean square deviation and root mean square fluctuation values of the docked complex displayed stable interaction and efficient binding between the ligands and target proteins Both of the flavonoids were found to be safe for human use and possessed good drug likeness properties and target accuracy ConclusionsConclusively, the current study proposes that luteolin and abyssinone II might act as potential therapeutic candidates for SARS-CoV-2 infection In vivo and in vitro experiments, however, should be taken under consideration to determine the efficiency and to demonstrate the mechanism of action","output":"Luteolin and abyssinone II as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2: an in silico molecular modeling approach in battling the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated Cu4On - (n = 1-4) clusters through a synergetic combination of mass-selected anion photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.

It is still debated whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at a higher risk for developing COVID-19 or its complications. AIM: To assess geographical distribution of IBD patients at the highest risk and correlate these data with COVID-19 mortality rates in Brazil. METHODS: The Brazilian IBD Study Group (Grupo de Estudos da Doen?a Inflamatria Intestinal do Brasil) developed a web-based survey adapted from the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. The included categories were demographic data and inquiries related to risk factors for complications from COVID-19. Patients were categorized as highest, moderate or lowest individual risk. The Spearman correlation test was used to identify any association between highest risk and mortality rates for each state of the country. RESULTS: A total of 3568 patients (65.3% females) were included. Most participants were from the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil, and 84.1% were using immunomodulators and/or biologics. Most patients (55.1%) were at moderate risk, 23.4% were at highest risk and 21.5% were at lowest risk of COVID-19 complications.

Some studies do not accept this method of transmission (COVID-19 airborne transmission). The present study aimed to measure the possible exposure of health care personnel to SARS-CoV-2 particles that may have been suspended in the air to respond to the hypothesis of COVID-19 airborne transmission.

The period 2019: q1-2019: q3 represents the pre-pandemic period, while the period 2019: q4-2020: q3 represents the pandemic process. By using cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling analysis, countries that have similar characteristics in terms of the change in macroeconomic indicators for each period were grouped, and it was investigated whether this grouping changed during the pandemic process. Clustering and multidimensional scaling analysis are the most appropriate methods for the purpose of the study. Exports, imports, inflation, unemployment, private consumption and economic growth are macroeconomic indicators used in the model. ResultsAccording to the results of the analysis, although most OECD countries showed similar characteristics in terms of economic impact before the pandemic, countries such as Turkey, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand and Mexico differ significantly from other countries in terms of economic impact during the pandemic process. The separation in question continues throughout the period discussed for Turkey. In addition, it was concluded that Spain, Britain, Mexico and Colombia suffered the most economic losses due to COVID-19 in the second quarter of 2020, when the pandemic was felt the most. Conclusion?The economic variable that has seen the most contraction is the volume of foreign trade. Unemployment rates have increased more slowly in countries where employment is sought to protect with employment packages, while unemployment rates have increased more in other countries.

Method: This paper explores the determinant factors of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on Recife, Pernambuco-Brazil by performing both local and global spatial regression analysis on two types of environmental data-sets. Data were obtained from ten specific days between late April and early July 2020, comprehending the ascending, peaking and descending behaviours of the curve of infections. Results: This study highlights clusters of the most affected neighbourhoods and their determinant effects. We have observed the increasing phase with hotspots of confirmed cases in a well-developed and heavily densely-populated neighbourhood of Recife city, then evolving for hotspots of case-fatality rates into areas characterised by having a precarious provision of public services and low-income population. The results also help to understand the influence of the age, income, level of education of the population and, additionally, the peoples access to public services, on the behaviour of the virus across neighbourhoods. Conclusion: This study supports government measures against the spread of Covid-19 in heterogeneous cities, evidencing social inequality as a driver for a high incidence of fatal cases of the disease.

We tested 888 RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (1302 serum samples) and 350 controls including 200 sera collected before the pandemic, 64 sera known to be associated with nonspecific serological interference, 36 sera from non-coronavirus pneumonia and 50 sera from patient with other common coronavirus to elicit false-positive serology. Incorporating an inactivated clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate as the antigen, the specificity of the assay was measured as 100% for IgA titre &#8805; 1:200, 98.6% for IgM titre &#8805; 1:200 and 96.3% for IgG titre &#8805; 1:100 after testing a series of negative controls. IFA presented substantial agreement (86%) with ELISA EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG kit (Cohen's Kappa = 0.61). The presence of antibodies was then measured at 3% before a 5-day evolution up to 47% after more than 15 days of evolution. We observed that the rates of seropositivity as well as the titre of specific antibodies were both significantly higher in patients with a poor clinical outcome than in patients with a favourable evolution. These data, which have to be integrated into the ongoing understanding of the immunological phase of the infection, suggest that detection anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is useful as a marker associated with COVID-19 severity.

However, the related spatial and temporal patterns and influencing factors are still unclear and there are few studies to analyze the causes of pulmonary tuberculosis in students from the perspective of space. METHODS: We collected data regarding the reported incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) among students at township level in Nanning, from 2012 to 2018. The reported incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis among students in Nanning was analyzed using spatial autocorrelation and spatial scan statistical analysis to depict hotspots of PTB incidence and spatial and temporal clustering. Spatial panel data of the reported incidence rates and influencing factors at district and county levels in Nanning were collected from 2015 to 2018. Then, we analyzed the spatial effects of incidence and influencing factors using the spatial Durbin model to explore the mechanism of each influencing factor in areas with high disease prevalence under spatial effects. RESULTS: From 2012 to 2018, 1609 cases of PTB were reported among students in Nanning, with an average annual reported incidence rate of 14.84/100,000. Through the Joinpoint regression model, We observed a steady trend in the percentage of cases reported each year (P>0.05). There was spatial autocorrelation between the annual reported incidence and the seven-years average reported incidence from 2012 to 2018. The high-incidence area was distributed in the junction of six urban areas and spread to the periphery, with the junction at the center. The population of college students, per capita financial expenditure on health, per capita gross domestic product, and the number of health technicians per 1,000 population were all influencing factors in the reported incidence of PTB among students. CONCLUSION: We identified spatial clustering of the reported incidence of PTB among students in Nanning, mainly located in the urban center and its surrounding areas. The clustering gradually decreased from the urban center to the surrounding areas. Spatial effects influenced the reported incidence of PTB. The population density of college students, per capita health financial expenditure, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the number of health technicians per 1,000 were all influencing factors in the reported incidence of PTB among students.","output":"Spatial analysis and influencing factors of pulmonary tuberculosis among students in Nanning, during 2012C2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chest radiographs are among the most frequently acquired images in radiology and are often the subject of computer vision research.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number Ro. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e. across many nations) to an uncontrolled Ro=4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of Ro=2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation. Implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this uncontrolled Ro are briefly discussed in the context of the maximum possible infected fraction of the population (needed for assessing health care capacity) and mortality (especially in the USA given diverging projections). Model results indicate that if intervention measures still result in Ro > 2.7 within 49 days after first infection, intervention is unlikely to be effective in general for COVID-19. Current optimistic projections place mortality figures in the USA in the range of 100,000 fatalities. For fatalities to be confined to 100,000 requires a reduction in Ro from 4.5 to 2.7 within 17 days of first infection assuming a mortality rate of 3.4%.","output":"Global convergence of COVID-19 basic reproduction number and estimation from early-time SIR dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, the spread of breathing air when playing wind instruments and singing was investigated and visualized using two methods: (1) schlieren imaging with a schlieren mirror and (2) background-oriented schlieren (BOS).

Depending on their fitness, these mutants either become extinct or thrive, spawning variants that escape the immune system. The most important SARS-CoV-2 mutations are those that alter the amino acid sequence in the viral S protein because this protein holds the key for the virus to enter the human cell. The more viruses replicate, the more they mutate, and the more likely it is that dominant resistant variants will appear. In such cases, more stringent measures for community protection will be required. Vaccines and polyclonal antibodies, which induce a response directed towards several sites along the S protein, would maintain effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, vaccines appear to induce an increased helper and cytotoxic T-cell response, which may also be a biomarker of protection. In densely populated areas with insufficient protection measures, the virus spreads freely, thus increasing the likelihood of generating escape mutants. India and Manaus exemplify this situation. Natural evolution selects the mutants that multiply most efficiently without eliminating the host, thus facilitating their spread. Contrastingly, the circulation of viruses of high virulence and lethality (Ebola, hantavirus) that eliminate the host remain limited to certain geographic areas, without further dissemination. Therefore, it would be expected that SARS-CoV-2 will evolve into more infectious and less virulent variants.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variants and the so-called resistance to vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laboratory systems have been largely neglected on the margins of health systems in Africa.

The increasing frequency of the disease as well as the deficiency of specific diagnostic means renders its diagnosis and treatment an area of intense investigation. The purpose of this review is to summarize all the known features of Kawasaki disease and also give an insight to the latest findings. RECENT FINDINGS Kawasaki disease is one of the leading causes of acquired heart disease in children while its cause remains essentially unknown. Viruses, bacterial conventional as well as superantigens, and genetic polymorphisms have been implicated in the etiology of the disease. Markers of inflammation, such as CCL2 and CCXCL10, contribute to the pathology and the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. Intravenous administration of immunoglobulin remains the mainstay of therapy for Kawasaki disease. Nevertheless, forms of the disease refractory to intravenous administration of immunoglobulin therapy may respond to aspirin, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and/or plasmapheresis. SUMMARY The present review covers evidence regarding the history of Kawasaki disease, the epidemiology, etiology, pathology, genetic influences, and long-term sequela. It also includes an evaluation of contemporary diagnostic techniques and optimal therapeutic approaches with an emphasis on recent publications.","output":"Kawasaki disease: an overview."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is still raging worldwide, which attracts great concern about coronavirus originated from animal Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) are newly discovered porcine coronaviruses in recent years, they not only damage pig industry severely but also pose potential threats to public health This article reviews the literature concerning the etiology, origin and evolution, pathogenicity, and diagnostics of PDCoV and SADS-CoV, presenting the prospect of research work We aim to expand understanding on SARS-CoV-2 and provide references for subsequent research on PDCoV and SADS-CoV","output":"Research Advances on Porcine Emerging Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of hypoglycemia and the treatment satisfaction in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using insulin analogues.

The purpose of this study was to examine the predictors of using GLS in Iraqi smart schools. Building on the literature, a framework of GLS is proposed. Data used in this study were collected from 394 teachers and managerial staff in Iraqi smart schools and analysed using Partial Least Square. The findings showed that individuals and organizations are important predictors of using GLS, and their effects on BI are mediated by satisfaction. Readiness and performance expectancy are critical for adopting and using GLS by smart schools. In addition, the findings showed that gamification and self-efficacy are moderating variables. Important implications of the predictability of GLS using a combination of theories as well as the practical suggestions for decision makers to enhance the adoption of GLS among smart schools in Iraq are discussed.

METHODS We searched PubMed and pooled relevant data in meta-analyses using random effects models. Using odds ratios (OR), we quantified the strength of association between the presence and severity of leukoaraiosis and post-thrombolysis sICH or 3- to 6-month modified Rankin Score >2. RESULTS Eleven eligible studies (n=7194) were pooled in meta-analysis. The risk of sICH was higher in patients with leukoaraiosis (OR, 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-2.06; P=0.002) and severe leukoaraiosis (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.92-3.34; P<0.0001) compared with patients without leukoaraiosis. Leukoaraiosis was an independent predictor of sICH in 6 included studies (n=4976; adjusted OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.35-2.27; P<0.0001). OR for leukoaraiosis and poor 3- to 6-month outcome was 2.02 (95% CI, 1.54-2.65; P<0.0001), with significant statistical heterogeneity (I(2), 75.7%; P=0.002). In adjusted analyses, leukoaraiosis was an independent predictor of poor outcome (n=3688; adjusted OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; P<0.0001). In post hoc analyses, including only leukoaraiosis patients in randomized controlled trials (IST-3 [third International Stroke Trial], NINDS [National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke], ECASS-1-2 [European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study]; n=2234), tissue-type plasminogen activator versus control was associated with higher sICH risk (OR, 5.50; 95% CI, 2.49-12.13), but lower poor outcome risk (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.95). CONCLUSIONS Leukoaraiosis might increase post-intravenous thrombolysis sICH risk and poor outcome poststroke.

Given the risk of bias/confounding, these results should be considered hypothesis-generating and do not justify withholding intravenous thrombolysis.","output":"Leukoaraiosis, Cerebral Hemorrhage, and Outcome After Intravenous Thrombolysis for Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Meta-Analysis (v1)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The imbalance of the redox system has been shown to be closely related to the occurrence and progression of many cancers. However, the biological function and clinical significance of redox-related genes (RRGs) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are unclear. In our current study, we downloaded transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database of ccRCC patients and identified the differential expression of RRGs in tumor and normal kidney tissues. Then, we identified a total of 344 differentially expressed RRGs, including 234 upregulated and 110 downregulated RRGs. Fourteen prognosis-related RRGs (ADAM8, CGN, EIF4EBP1, FOXM1, G6PC, HAMP, HTR2C, ITIH4, LTB4R, MMP3, PLG, PRKCG, SAA1, and VWF) were selected out, and a prognosis-related signature was constructed based on these RRGs. Survival analysis showed that overall survival was lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the risk score signature was 0.728 at three years and 0.759 at five years in the TCGA cohort and 0.804 at three years and 0.829 at five years in the E-MTAB-1980 cohort, showing good predictive performance. In addition, we explored the regulatory relationships of these RRGs with upstream miRNA, their biological functions and molecular mechanisms, and their relationship with immune cell infiltration. We also established a nomogram based on these prognostic RRGs and performed internal and external validation in the TCGA and E-MTAB-1980 cohorts, respectively, showing an accurate prediction of ccRCC prognosis.

The pandemic has made a significant impact on the way we behave and interact in our daily life. The past year has witnessed a strong interplay between human behaviors and epidemic spreading. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic framework to study the coupled evolutions of herd behaviors and epidemics. Our framework extends the classical degree-based mean-field epidemic model over complex networks by coupling it with the evolutionary game dynamics. The statistically equivalent individuals in a population choose their social activity intensities based on the fitness or the payoffs that depend on the state of the epidemics. Meanwhile, the spreading of the infectious disease over the complex network is reciprocally influenced by the players' social activities. We analyze the coupled dynamics by studying the stationary properties of the epidemic for a given herd behavior and the structural properties of the game for a given epidemic process. The decisions of the herd turn out to be strategic substitutes. We formulate an equivalent finite-player game and an equivalent network to represent the interactions among the finite populations. We develop structure-preserving approximation techniques to study time-dependent properties of the joint evolution of the behavioral and epidemic dynamics. The resemblance between the simulated coupled dynamics and the real COVID-19 statistics in the numerical experiments indicates the predictive power of our framework.","output":"Herd Behaviors in Epidemics: A Dynamics-Coupled Evolutionary Games Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is now well established that non-communicable diseases (NCD), like diabetes mellitus, hypertension,, respiratory and heart disease, particularly among the elderly, increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 disease. Mortality in 60%-90% of the COVID-19 cases is attributed to either one or more of these comorbidities. However, healthcare management for control of COVID-19 involves public health and policy decisions that may critically undermine the existing health needs of the most vulnerable NCD patients. Temporary closure of outpatient health facilities in some secondary and tertiary care hospitals have deprived millions of NCD patients of their regular medication and diagnostic health needs. The lack of robust primary healthcare facilities in most states, and the failure to maintain physical distancing norms due to inadequate infrastructure is also problematic. In the absence of effective public health interventions, socioeconomically vulnerable patients are likely to become non-adherent increasing manifold their risk of disease complications. In this context, the feasibility of dispensing longer than usual drug refills for chronic NCD conditions at functional government health facilities, home delivery of essential drugs, running dedicated NCD clinics at PHCs, and utilisation of telemedicine opportunities for care and support to patients warrant aggressive exploration.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed. The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95% limit of detection (LOD95%). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was 96% for all assays and the estimated LOD95% varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene.

Severe hypoxia in the absence of visible respiratory distress (silent hypoxia) is increasingly recognised in these patients. There are no published data evaluating lowest recorded pre-hospital oxygen saturation or pre-hospital National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) as a predictor of outcome in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective service evaluation, we included adult inpatients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who were discharged from hospital or who died in hospital between 12 March and 28 April 2020 (n = 143). Pre-hospital and in-hospital data were extracted and analysed to explore risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality to inform local triage and emergency management. RESULTS: The lowest recorded pre-hospital oxygen saturation was an independent predictor of mortality when controlling for age, gender and history of COPD. A 1% reduction in pre-hospital oxygen saturation increased the odds of death by 13% (OR 1.13, p < 0.001). Lower pre-hospital oxygen saturation predicted mortality after adjusting for the pre-hospital NEWS2 (OR for a 1% reduction in pre-hospital oxygen saturation 1.09, p = 0.02). The pre-hospital NEWS2 was higher in those who died (Median 9; IQR 7-10; n = 24) than in those who survived to discharge (Median 6; IQR 5-8; n = 63). CONCLUSION: This service evaluation suggests that the lowest recorded pre-hospital oxygen saturation may be an independent predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients.

About 49% of the sample had decreased their physical activity compared to their self-reported activity level prior to the pandemic, whereas 32% had increased it.

Specifically, individuals who had reduced their physical activity over the last year reported lower life satisfaction than before, and individuals who had increased their physical activity reported higher life satisfaction than before. The amount of complete physical inactivity (sitting) showed a similar pattern as the exercise data, meaning that individuals who reported increasing inactivity per day also reported a greater decline in life satisfaction. Additional analyses showed that the association between daily activity level and life satisfaction was somewhat stronger for men than for women, but there was no difference when comparing individual versus organized activities.

Among the 115 patients, 82 had no bronchiectasis and 33 had bronchiectasis. The bronchodilation-prone layers mainly included the left and right lower lobe of the lung. The probability of branching in the inflamed area was greater than that in the noninflamed area in patients with COVID-19. There were significant differences in gender, CT lesion range, and number of incidents of bronchiectasis between noninflamed and inflamed areas (P < 0.05). Moreover, there were significant differences in age, total proportion of CT lesions, volume of CT lesions, and total number of patients with bronchiectasis among the three groups (P < 0.05).

Thus, concerns about the reducing and management of COVID-19 are on the rise, as there is need to provide diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and follow-ups during the pandemic. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic has radically and quickly altered how medical practitioners provide care to patients. Medical centers are now responding to COVID-19 through rapid adoption of digital tools and technologies such as telemedicine and virtual care which refer to the delivery of healthcare services digital or at a distance using Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for treatment of patients. Telemedicine is expected to deliver timely care while minimizing exposure to protect medical practitioners and patients. Accordingly, a rapid literature review was conducted, and 35 research studies published from 2019 to May 2020 were employed to provide theoretical and practical evidence on the significance of using telemedicine and virtual care for remote treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hence, we aimed to explore this association. METHODS: We explored the outcomes of all adult inpatients with COVID-19 in France, in 2020. We computed adjusted odds ratios to measure the associations between chronic liver disease, alcohol use disorders, mechanical ventilation and day-30, in-hospital, mortality. RESULTS: The sample comprised 259,110 patients (median [IQR] age 70 (54C83) years; 52% men), including 15,476 (6.0%) and 10,006 (3.9%) patients with chronic liver disease and alcohol use disorders, respectively. Death occurred in 38,203 (15%) patients, including 7,475 (28%) after mechanical ventilation, and 2,941 (19%) with chronic liver disease. The adjusted odds ratios for mechanical ventilation and day-30 mortality were 1.54 (95% CI 1.44C1.64, p <0.001) and 1.79 (1.71C1.87, p <0.001) for chronic liver disease; 0.55 (0.47C0.64, p <0.001) and 0.54 (0.48C0.61, p <0.001) for mild liver disease; 0.64 (0.53C0.76; p <0.001) and 0.71 (0.63C0.80, p <0.001) for compensated cirrhosis; 0.65 (0.52C0.81, p <0.001) and 2.21 (1.94C2.51, p <0.001) for decompensated cirrhosis; 0.34 (0.24C0.50; p <0.001) and 1.38 (1.17C1.62, p <0.001) for primary liver cancer; and 0.82 (0.76C0.89; p <0.001) and 1.11 (1.05C1.17; p <0.001) for alcohol use disorders. Chronic viral hepatitis; non-viral, non-alcoholic chronic hepatitis; organ, including liver, transplantation, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were not associated with COVID-19-related death. CONCLUSION: Chronic liver disease increased the risk of COVID-19-related death in France in 2020. Therapeutic effort limitation may have contributed to COVID-19-related death in French residents with a liver-related complication or an alcohol use disorder. LAY SUMMARY: We studied the outcomes, including mechanical ventilation and day-30 mortality, of all adults with COVID-19 who were discharged from acute and post-acute care in France in 2020 (N = 259,110). Patients with mild liver disease; compensated cirrhosis; organ, including liver, transplantation; or acquired immunodepression syndrome were not at increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality. Patients with alcohol use disorders, decompensated cirrhosis, or primary liver cancer were at increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality but were less likely to receive mechanical ventilation.

The CRP was at 35mg/l. A thoracoabdominal CT scan was requested to detect an eventual appendicitis. With three straight frosted glass areas on the thoracic area suggesting COVID 19 infectious pneumopathy, a PCR was requested to detect a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, then the patient was appendectomized. Post-operative follow-up was simple and the patient was transferred to a department dedicated to covid-19-positive patients for further management.

Several variants of the problem have been considered, depending on the fact that the match is exact or approximate and, in this latter case, which edit operations are considered and where are allowed. In this paper we present results on the complexity of the approximate matching problem, where edit operations are symbol substitutions and are allowed only on the graph labels or both on the graph labels and the query string. We introduce a variant of the problem that asks whether there exists a path in a graph that represents a query string with any number of edit operations and we show that is NP-complete, even when labels have length one and in the case the alphabet is binary. Moreover, when it is parameterized by the length of the input string and graph labels have length one, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable and it is unlikely to admit a polynomial kernel. The NP-completeness of this problem leads to the inapproximability (within any factor) of the approximate matching when edit operations are allowed only on the graph labels. Moreover, we show that the variants of approximate string matching to graph we consider are not fixed-parameter tractable, when the parameter is the number of edit operations, even for graphs that have distance one from a DAG. The reduction for this latter result allows us to prove the inapproximability of the variant where edit operations can be applied both on the query string and on graph labels.","output":"Complexity Issues of String to Graph Approximate Matching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) remains a challenging problem to date, largely due to the varying writing styles that exist amongst us. Prior works however generally operate with the assumption that there is a limited number of styles, most of which have already been captured by existing datasets. In this paper, we take a completely different perspective -- we work on the assumption that there is always a new style that is drastically different, and that we will only have very limited data during testing to perform adaptation. This results in a commercially viable solution -- the model has the best shot at adaptation being exposed to the new style, and the few samples nature makes it practical to implement. We achieve this via a novel meta-learning framework which exploits additional new-writer data through a support set, and outputs a writer-adapted model via single gradient step update, all during inference. We discover and leverage on the important insight that there exists few key characters per writer that exhibit relatively larger style discrepancies. For that, we additionally propose to meta-learn instance specific weights for a character-wise cross-entropy loss, which is specifically designed to work with the sequential nature of text data. Our writer-adaptive MetaHTR framework can be easily implemented on the top of most state-of-the-art HTR models. Experiments show an average performance gain of 5-7% can be obtained by observing very few new style data.

Covid-19 lockdown encouraged spatial distance: a public health measure. This measure inadvertently created social distance and social disconnection. Public life, which is frequently a coping mechanism and an escape for some women and girls at risk of domestic violence, was curtailed by the lockdown rules that forbade movements. Informal sources of help for victims of abuse were limited due to closed economic activities, and community-based helping services for domestic violence were not permitted to open. Some victims of domestic violence struggled with public transportation to access informal help, visit the police, social workers and other sources of help.

This study proposes a novel measure for the probable pathogenic virus transmission risk of a high-rise drainage stack with the occurrence of positive air pressure. The proposed approach is based on time-variant positive air pressures measured in a 38 m high drainage stack of a full-scale experimental tower under steady flow conditions of flow rate 1C4 Ls(?1) discharging at a height between 15 m to 33 m above the stack base. The maximum pressure and probabilistic positive air pressures in the discharging stack ventilation section with no water (Zone A of the discharging drainage stack) were determined. It was demonstrated that the positive air pressures were lower in frequency as compared with those in other stack zones and could propagate along the upper 1/3 portion of the ventilation pipe (H  0.63) towards the ventilation opening at the rooftop. As the probabilistic positive pressures at a stack height were found to be related to the water discharging height and flow rate, a risk model of positive air pressure is proposed.

SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, enters into cells through binding to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) homolog-2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a regulator of two contrary pathways in renin angiotensin system (RAS): ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis and ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis. Viral entry process eventuate in downregulation of ACE2 and subsequent activation of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis. ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis increases lipid storage, reduces white-to-beige fat conversion and plays role in obesity. Conversely, adipose tissue is an important source of angiotensin, and obesity results in increased systemic RAS. ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis, which has proinflammatory, profibrotic, prothrombotic and vasoconstrictive effects, is potential mechanism of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The link between obesity and severe COVID-19 may be attributed to ACE2 consumption and subsequent ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis activation. Therefore, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may benefit from therapeutic strategies that activate ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis, such as Ang II reseptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), Mas receptor agonists and ACE2.

However, 46 % of respondents never perform LIHR. Of these, 70 % consider the benefits of laparoscopy to be minimal, 59 % said they lack the requisite training, and 26 % are interested in learning. Surgeons (70 %) and residents (73 %) agreed that the best educational method would be a course followed by expert proctoring. CONCLUSION Surgeons remain divided on the utility of laparoscopic surgery for inguinal hernia repair. Nearly half of responding surgeons never perform LIHR, and the other half offer it selectively. One quarter of surgeons who do not perform LIHR are interested in learning. This reveals a knowledge gap that could be addressed with educational programs.","output":"A survey of general surgeons regarding laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair: practice patterns, barriers, and educational needs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Aside from primary vestibular symptoms such as vertigo and dizziness, persons with vestibular dysfunction frequently express cognitive and motor problems. These symptoms have mainly been assessed in single-task setting, which might not represent activities of daily living accurately. Therefore, a dual-task protocol, consisting of the simultaneous performance of cognitive and motor tasks, was developed. This protocol assesses cognitive and motor performance in general, as well as cognitive-motor interference in specific. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The motor component of the 2BALANCE protocol consists of a static and dynamic postural task. These motor tasks are combined with different cognitive tasks assessing visuospatial cognition, processing speed, working memory and response inhibition. First, test-retest reliability will be assessed with an interval of 2 weeks in a group of young adults. Second, the 2BALANCE protocol will be validated in persons with bilateral vestibulopathy. Finally, the protocol will be implemented in persons with unilateral vestibular loss. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The 2BALANCE project aims to elucidate the impact of vestibular dysfunction on cognitive and motor performance in dual-task setting. This protocol represents everyday situations better than single-task protocols, as dual-tasks such as reading street signs while walking are often encountered during daily activities. Ultimately, this project could enable individualised and holistic clinical care in these patients, taking into account single as well as dual-task performance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The current study was approved by the ethics committee of Ghent University Hospital on 5 July 2019 with registration number B670201940465. All research findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at vestibular as well as multidisciplinary international conferences and meetings.

Its effect and impact are still evolving, with deaths estimated to reach 40 million if unchecked. One effective and complementary strategy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace the primary and secondary contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases using contact tracing technology. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to survey strategies for digital contact tracing for the COVID-19 pandemic and to present how using mobile positioning data conforms with Nigeria's data privacy regulations. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing implemented around the world. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We made recommendations on how Nigeria can adopt this approach while adhering to the guidelines provided by the National Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). RESULTS: Despite the potential of digital contact tracing, it always conflicts with patient data privacy regulations. We found that Nigeria's response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage call detail records to complement current strategies within the NDPR. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that mobile position data contact tracing is important for epidemic control as long as it conforms to relevant data privacy regulations. Implementation guidelines will limit data misuse.","output":"COVID-19 Mobile Positioning Data Contact Tracing and Patient Privacy Regulations: Exploratory Search of Global Response Strategies and the Use of Digital Tools in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La maladie  coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) est apparue en Chine en dcembre 2019 et sest propage dans le monde entier.

Rsultats Nous avons collig 300 patients ; 63 ont eu un dosage de linterleukine 6, soit 21 %. Lage moyen de la population incluse tait de 63 ans avec une prdominance fminine soit un sex-ratio de 2,15. La forme clinique  ladmission tait svre dans 88,9 %, modre dans 9,5 %, et mineure dans uniquement 1,6 % des cas. La symptomatologie tait domine par : la fivre dans 49,2 % des cas, myalgies et arthralgies dans 60,3 % des cas et lasthnie dans 77,8 % des cas. La saturation moyenne  lair ambiant  ladmission tait de 903,17 % avec des extrmes entre 81 et 99 %. Sur le plan des comorbidits, 58,7 % avaient des antcdents mdicaux avec nette prdominance du diabte (36,5 %) et de lhypertension artrielle (33,3 %). La dyslipidmie et la coronaropathie taient notes respectivement dans 22,2 % et 12,75 %. Une obsit grade 1 tait constate chez 7 patients et une obsit morbide avec BMI  40kg/m2 chez un seul patient. La dure moyenne dhospitalisation tait de 12jours avec un minimum de 4jours et un maximum de 35jours. Sur le plan respiratoire, 73 % des patients ont prsent une toux sche, et une dyspne tait retrouve dans 60,3 % des cas. Une TDM thoracique a t faite pour 63 patients et a montr un aspect typique dinfection SARS cov19 dans 98,4 % des cas, soit 62 patients. Laspect tait atypique dans un seul cas (1,6 %). Latteinte la plus frquente tait entre 25 et 50 %, soit 31,7 % des cas, suivie dune atteinte Entre 50 et 75 % (30,2 % des cas) puis entre 10 et 25 % (22,2 % des cas). Sur le plan biologique, la valeur moyenne de la CRP tait de 100,06mg/l (4 et 231mg/l), et des D-dimres tait de 1732,71g/L (251C16616).

Group 1 comprised 743 patients who were treated during no lockdown period, whereas Group 2 comprised 615 patients who were treated during lockdown period. Patients' medical records and radiographs were reviewed through our hospital's computer database. In addition, we recorded each patients' age and gender, their definite diagnosis, the anatomic location of the trauma, the type of trauma (fracture, dislocation, tendon injury, ligament injury, fracture dislocation, open fracture, etc.), the type of pediatric fracture (displaced fracture, torus fracture, epiphyseal fracture, pathological fracture, etc.), and the treatment method (non-operative/operative). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was significantly lower in Group 2 (p<0.001). There were significant differences between the groups in terms of anatomic locations of the traumas (p<0.001). The types of the traumas, pediatric traumas, and treatment were significantly different between the groups (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively).

We fit a set of probability distribution functions and estimate a symptom-onset-to-death mean of $15.2$ days for Brazil, which is lower than earlier estimates of 17.8 days based on early Chinese data. A joint Bayesian subnational model is used to simultaneously describe the $26$ states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between $11.2-17.8$ days across the different states. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability distribution function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalised log-normal for onset-to-hospital-discharge. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.","output":"Inference of COVID-19 epidemiological distributions from Brazilian hospital data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Complications following COVID-19 are starting to emerge; neurological disorders are already described in the literature. CASE REPORT: This case is about a 20-year old male with a severe COVID-19, hospitalized in a Reanimation and Intensive Care Unit with an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, thromboembolic complication and secondary bacterial infection. This patient had a non-specific neurological disorder with a pseudobulbar palsy, (MRI, ENMG and lumbar puncture were normal), associated 4 months later with persistent left shoulder motor deficit and respiratory failure. Respiratory and neurological check-up led to a diagnosis of the Parsonage-Turner syndrome or neuralgic amyotrophy affecting C5-C6 nerve roots, the lateral pectoral and phrenic nerves at the origin of the scapular belt, amyotrophy and left diaphragm paralysis. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that persistant dyspnoea after COVID 19 infection should lead to a search for a diaphragmatic cause which is not always the result of Reanimation Neuropathy but may also indicate a neuralgic amyotrophy. It is the fourth case of neuralgic amyotrophy following COVID-19. This brings the medical community to consider the risk of diaphragm paralysis apart from critical illness polyneuropathy.

The behavioral factors of vaccine hesitancy or refusal are a crucial dimension that need to be understood in order to design appropriate interventions. The aim of this study was to explore the behavioral determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and to provide recommendations to increase the acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Bangladesh. METHODS: We employed a Barrier Analysis (BA) approach to examine twelve potential behavioral determinants (drawn from the Health Belief Model [HBM] and Theory of Reasoned Action [TRA]) of intended vaccine acceptance. We conducted 45 interviews with those who intended to take the vaccine (Acceptors) and another 45 interviews with those who did not have that intention (Non-acceptors). We performed data analysis to find statistically significant differences and to identify which beliefs were most highly associated with acceptance and non-acceptance with COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: The behavioral determinants associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Dhaka included perceived social norms, perceived safety of COVID-19 vaccines and trust in them, perceived risk/susceptibility, perceived self-efficacy, perceived positive and negative consequences, perceived action efficacy, perceived severity of COVID-19, access, and perceived divine will. In line with the HBM, beliefs about the disease itself were highly predictive of vaccine acceptance, and some of the strongest statistically-significant (p<0.001) predictors of vaccine acceptance in this population are beliefs around both injunctive and descriptive social norms. Specifically, Acceptors were 3.2 times more likely to say they would be very likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine if a doctor or nurse recommended it, twice as likely to say that most people they know will get a vaccine, and 1.3 times more likely to say that most close family and friends will get a vaccine. The perceived safety of vaccines was found to be important since Non-acceptors were 1.8 times more likely to say that COVID-19 vaccines are not safe at all. Beliefs about ones risk of getting COVID-19 disease and the severity of it were predictive of being a vaccine acceptor: Acceptors were 1.4 times more likely to say that it was very likely that someone in their household would get COVID-19, 1.3 times more likely to say that they were very concerned about getting COVID-19, and 1.3 times more likely to say that it would be very serious if someone in their household contracted COVID-19. Other responses of Acceptors on what makes immunization easier may be helpful in programming to boost acceptance, such as providing vaccination through government health facilities, schools, and kiosks, and having vaccinators maintain proper COVID-19 health and safety protocols. CONCLUSION: An effective behavior change strategy for COVID-19 vaccines uptake will need to address multiple beliefs and behavioral determinants, reducing barriers and leveraging enablers identified in this study. National plans for promoting COVID-19 vaccination should address the barriers, enablers, and behavioral determinants found in this study in order to maximize the impact on COVID-19 vaccination

A multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the predictors of stress. The highest adaptive and maladaptive coping styles were reported for religion and self-distraction. Certain groups were independently more vulnerable to experience stress, including young-and middle-aged adults, females, students, and those with a low-to-middle income, with a personal or familial history of mental conditions, and living with someone with COVID-19 in their close circle. Higher levels of stress were also predicted by lower levels of using positive coping styles, particularly positive reframing, planning, and returning to religion, and higher levels of negative coping styles, such as venting, self-blame, and denial.

We studied the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 on a group and individual level in intubated ICU patients. METHODS: In a cohort of 86 patients, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results on nasopharyngeal and sputum samples (obtained as part of clinical care twice a week) according to time after intubation. Subsequently, we performed survival analyses. RESULTS: 870 samples were tested by RT-PCR. Overall viral load was highest in the first week (median nasopharynx 3.5, IQR 1.5-4.3; median sputum 4.3, IQR 3.3-5.6) and decreased over time. In 20% of patients a relapsing pattern was observed. Nasopharyngeal and sputum PCR status on day 14 was not significantly associated with survival up to day 60 in this small cohort. CONCLUSION: In general SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in respiratory samples in patients with severe COVID-19 decrease after the first week after intubation, but individual SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels can show a relapsing pattern. Larger studies are needed to address the association of clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory samples with survival, because we observed a trend towards better survival in patients with early clearance from sputum.","output":"Viral load dynamics in intubated patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Concern about getting sick could help prevent disease.

METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent at the end of the semester. A total of 301 students participated in the study. RESULTS: Duration of study influenced student preference. Higher number of first-year students preferred DL compared to their seniors (p < 0.001). Students preferred CL for group discussion, as DL resulted in more difficult communication and gave less learning satisfaction. Only 44.2% students preferred DL over CL, although they agreed that DL gave a more efficient learning method (52.6%), it provided more time to study (87.9%) and to review study materials (87.3%).

Then, variables with a P-value of 0.1 were included in the log-binomial model, and merely these independent risk factors were used to establish the nomogram model. The discrimination of the nomogram was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and internally verified using the Bootstrap method. RESULTS: A total of 262 patients (134 surviving and 128 non-surviving patients) were included in the analysis. Seven variables, which included age (relative risk [RR]: 0.905, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.868C0.944; P < 0.001), chronic heart disease (CHD, RR: 0.045, 95% CI: 0.0097C0.205; P < 0.001, the percentage of lymphocytes (Lym%, RR: 1.125, 95% CI: 1.041C1.216; P = 0.0029), platelets (RR: 1.008, 95% CI: 1.003C1.012; P = 0.001), C-reaction protein (RR: 0.982, 95% CI: 0.973C0.991; P < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, RR: 0.993, 95% CI: 0.990C0.997; P < 0.001) and D-dimer (RR: 0.734, 95% CI: 0.617C0.879; P < 0.001), were identified as the independent risk factors. The nomogram model based on these factors exhibited a good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.948 (95% CI: 0.923C0.973). CONCLUSIONS: A nomogram based on age, CHD, Lym%, platelets, C-reaction protein, LDH and D-dimer was established to accurately predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. This can be used as an alerting tool for clinicians to take early intervention measures, when necessary.","output":"A nomogramic model based on clinical and laboratory parameters at admission for predicting the survival of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bioactive fractions obtained from medicinal plants which have been used for the treatment of multiple diseases could exert their effects by targeting common pathways.

Transcriptomic studies on MCF7 cell lines treated with Cipa extract carried out using Affymetrix arrays revealed a downregulation of signatures of estrogen response potentially modulated through estrogen receptor  (ER). Molecular docking analysis identified 38 Cipa constituents that potentially bind (G < ? 7.5) with ER at the same site as estrogen. The expression signatures in the connectivity map (https://clue.io/;) revealed high positive scores with translation inhibitors such as emetine (score: 99.61) and knockdown signatures of genes linked to the antiviral response such as ribosomal protein RPL7 (score: 99.92), which is a reported ER coactivator. Further, gene knockdown experiments revealed that Cipa exhibits antiviral activity in dengue infected MCF7 cells potentially modulated through estrogen receptor 1.

We evaluated patients with MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah to explore reasons for this increase and to assess the epidemiologic and clinical features of this disease. METHODS We identified all cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah that were reported to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health from January 1 through May 16, 2014. We conducted telephone interviews with symptomatic patients who were not health care personnel, and we reviewed hospital records. We identified patients who were reported as being asymptomatic and interviewed them regarding a history of symptoms in the month before testing. Descriptive analyses were performed. RESULTS Of 255 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection, 93 died (case fatality rate, 36.5%). The median age of all patients was 45 years (interquartile range, 30 to 59), and 174 patients (68.2%) were male. A total of 64 patients (25.1%) were reported to be asymptomatic. Of the 191 symptomatic patients, 40 (20.9%) were health care personnel. Among the 151 symptomatic patients who were not health care personnel, 112 (74.2%) had data that could be assessed, and 109 (97.3%) of these patients had had contact with a health care facility, a person with a confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection, or someone with severe respiratory illness in the 14 days before the onset of illness. The remaining 3 patients (2.7%) reported no such contacts. Of the 64 patients who had been reported as asymptomatic, 33 (52%) were interviewed, and 26 of these 33 (79%) reported at least one symptom that was consistent with a viral respiratory illness.

However, the assumption of local linearity in a neighborhood does not always hold true. Hence, the Euclidean distance based affinity that determines the graph edges may fail to represent the true connectivity strength between data points. Moreover, the affinity between data points is influenced by the distribution of the data around them and must be considered in the affinity measure. In this paper, we propose two techniques, CCGA(L) and CCGA(N) that use cross-covariance based graph affinity (CCGA) to represent the relation between data points in a local region. CCGA(L) also explores the additional connectivity between data points which share a common local neighborhood. CCGA(N) considers the influence of respective neighborhoods of the two immediately connected data points, which further enhance the affinity measure. Experimental results of manifold learning on synthetic datasets show that CCGA is able to represent the affinity measure between data points more accurately. This results in better low dimensional representation. Manifold regularization experiments on standard image dataset further indicate that the proposed CCGA based affinity is able to accurately identify and include the influence of the data points and its common neighborhood that increase the classification accuracy.

When the horizontal distance between spiked edges was increased to 36 mm, the vertical distance between spiked edges increased to 54 mm, and when the height of the discharge pin support was increased to 76 mm, the removal efficiency of PM10was maintained at approximately 60.0%. Furthermore, the removal efficiency of particles over 5 m was about 80% or greater. When the flow rate was 4 m sC1, the gap between collection plates was 60 mm, and C14 kV was applied to the discharge electrode. The particle removal efficiency of the flat plate-type electrostatic precipitator was maintained when the horizontal and vertical distances between spiked edges and the height of the discharge pin support were below threshold levels. Those variables may be important factors for designing the shape of the discharge electrode.

It was designed as a descriptive and correlational survey study, with non-probabilistic snowball sampling, using two online questionnaires for teachers and families. The study presented in this article focuses on data from teachers in the Valencian Community. It starts from the concept of teacher learning ecologies as the elements that teachers themselves use to train and observe new learning opportunities. From there, the study analyzes how teachers' learning ecologies were configured to cope with the supervening need to teach from home, and the role of ICT in this process. It studies the association between the learning expectation that teachers had for their students, with other variables linked to these ecologies (training and previous experience in ICTs, support in this process, online methodologies used), using both simple and multiple Correspondence Analysis and decision trees. The results show that, despite the difficulties, some teachers had a higher expectation of student learning. There are the teachers with better training and more previous experience in ICT tools for teaching, the teachers who used more support for their own performance and those who used more online strategies. The use of video tutorials is the main explanatory variable in the three analysis. It also shows that self-taught learning prevailed through networks and platforms, and also the support of colleagues. The study concludes that it is necessary to open the perspective regarding teachers' learning ecologies, including ICT as a training object and as a strategy. It's also important to reinforce the dynamizing role of the administration and the schools in this process. ? 2021 University of Granada.

Oxford Placement Test (OPT) was run to homogenize the participants, and 100 intermediate learners out of 235 were selected. Then, two valid questionnaires of Ricketts Critical Thinking Disposition and Oxfords Strategy Inventory for Language Learning were administered. Having administered the questionnaires, the researchers asked the participants to sit for a writing test. The data collected from the questionnaires and as well as the scores of their writing performances were analyzed through SPSS (25.00). The results showed a significant relationship between (a) learning strategies and learners writing performances, (b) the sub-sets of learning strategies and learners writing performances, and (c) CTA and learners learning strategies. However, CTA did not play a mediating role in the relationship between intermediate EFL learners learning strategies and writing performance. Based on the results of the study, one might also conclude that strategies seemed to play a more important role in the performance of learners especially their writing performances. Therefore, this study had useful contributions for students, teachers, and curriculum designers. Findings of this research could assist teachers to be aware of learners strategies in learning writing and help their students to be responsive to using learning strategies in their learning process and create a satisfactory learning context for using learning strategies. Therefore, learners were able to become independent and feel responsibility for their own learning. Secondly, curriculum developers could take advantage of the findings to include learning strategies training into the curriculum.

This study examined changes in depression and anxiety symptoms before and during the pandemic, and assessed their association with different elements of capital. METHODS: Data from 65,854 individuals (M(age)=50.4, SD(age)=12.0) from the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort were used. Baseline mental health symptoms were on average measured 4.7 (SD = 1.1) years before the first COVID-19 measurement wave (T1), and subsequent waves were (bi)weekly (March 30  August 05, 2020). Mental health symptom trajectories were estimated using a two-part Latent Class Growth Analysis (cutoff=2 symptoms), and class membership was predicted by several elements of economic (education, income, and occupation) and person capital (neuroticism). RESULTS: Most individuals were unlikely to report 2 symptoms of depression (80.6%) and anxiety (75.9%), but small stable-high classes for both conditions were identified (1.6% and 6.7%, respectively). Compared to T0, T1 showed increases in the mean number of symptoms (M(dep_t0)=4.1 vs M(dep_t1)=4.7, M(anx_t0)=4.2 vs M(anx_t1)=4.3) and probability of reporting symptoms (Prob(dep_t0)=0.65 vs Prob(dep_t1)=0.96, Prob(anx_t0)=0.70 vs Prob(anx_t1)=0.92). Lower income (OR(dep)=1.10; 95%CI:1.05-1.16; OR(anx)=1.05; 95%CI:1.02-1.07) and higher neuroticism (OR(dep)=1.10; 95%CI:1.09-1.11; OR(anx)=1.08; 95%CI:1.08-1.09) increased the odds of being in both stable-high classes.

We identified overlapping 99.39% conserved 1 CD8 + T-cell epitope (MMHPSFAGM) from N protein and 100% conserved 7 epitopes (AVFALAPVV, LAVFALAPV, FALAPVVFA, VFALAPVVF, IAMTVLPAL, FFDWFSGLM, and FLLIYLGRT) from G protein and also identified IL-4 and IFN- induced (99.39% conserved) 1 N protein CD4 + T-cell epitope (HMMHPSFAGMVDPSL) and 100% conserved 5 G protein CD4 + T-cell epitopes (LPALAVFALAPVVFA, PALAVFALAPVVFAE, GIAMTVLPALAVFAL, GSWNFFDWFSGLMSW, and FFLLIYLGRTGLSKM). The overlapping CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell epitopes were bound with most conserved HLA-C*12:03 and HLA-DRB1*01:01, respectively with the high binding affinity (kcal/mol). The combined population coverage analysis revealed that the allele frequencies of these epitopes are high in endemic and non-endemic regions. Besides, we found 100% conserved and non-allergenic 2 decamer B-cell epitopes, GVCEVGVQAL and RVFNCIDWVH of G protein had the sequence similarity with the nonamer CD8 + T-cell epitopes, VCEVGVQAL and RVFNCIDWV, respectively. Consequently, these epitopes may be used for the development of epitope-based peptide vaccine against emerging RVFV. However, in vivo and in vitro experiments are required for their efficient use as a vaccine.","output":"Overlapping CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell epitopes identification for the progression of epitope-based peptide vaccine from nucleocapsid and glycoprotein of emerging Rift Valley fever virus using immunoinformatics approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prophylaxis with high doses of neutralizing antibody typically offers protection against challenge with viruses producing acute infections. In this study, we have investigated the ability of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, KZ52, to protect against Ebola virus in rhesus macaques. This antibody was previously shown to fully protect guinea pigs from infection. Four rhesus macaques were given 50 mg/kg of neutralizing human monoclonal antibody KZ52 intravenously 1 d before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units of Ebola virus, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg antibody 4 d after challenge. A control animal was exposed to virus in the absence of antibody treatment. Passive transfer of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody not only failed to protect macaques against challenge with Ebola virus but also had a minimal effect on the explosive viral replication following infection. We show that the inability of antibody to impact infection was not due to neutralization escape.

Research on the COVID-19 pandemic benefiting from open-access data and machine learning algorithms is still scarce yet can produce relevant and pragmatic information. With country-level pre-COVID-19-pandemic variables, we aimed to cluster countries in groups with shared profiles of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means) were used to define data-driven clusters of countries; the algorithm was informed by disease prevalence estimates, metrics of air pollution, socio-economic status and health system coverage. Using the one-way ANOVA test, we compared the clusters in terms of number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, case fatality rate and order in which the country reported the first case. Results: The model to define the clusters was developed with 155 countries. The model with three principal component analysis parameters and five or six clusters showed the best ability to group countries in relevant sets. There was strong evidence that the model with five or six clusters could stratify countries according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (p<0.001). However, the model could not stratify countries in terms of number of deaths or case fatality rate.

BACKGROUND: HCQ/AZM is being widely used to treat COVID-19 despite the known risk of QT interval prolongation and the unknown risk of arrhythmogenesis in this population. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients treated with HCQ/AZM was reviewed. The QTc interval was calculated before drug administration and for the first 5 days following initiation. The primary endpoint was the magnitude of QTc prolongation, and factors associated with QTc prolongation. Secondary endpoints were incidences of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among 415 patients who received concomitant HCQ/AZM, the mean QTc increased from 443  25 ms to a maximum of 473  40 ms (87 [21%] patients had a QTc &#8805;500 ms). Factors associated with QTc prolongation &#8805;500 ms were age (p < 0.001), body mass index <30 kg/m2 (p = 0.005), heart failure (p < 0.001), elevated creatinine (p = 0.005), and peak troponin (p < 0.001). The change in QTc was not associated with death over the short period of the study in a population in which mortality was already high (hazard ratio: 0.998; p = 0.607).

The lung is a prime target for gene delivery due to a host of genetic, acquired, and infectious diseases that manifest themselves there, resulting in many pathologies. However, the in vivo delivery of genetic material to the lung remains a practical problem clinically and is considered the major obstacle needed to be overcome for gene therapy. Currently there are four main strategies for in vivo gene delivery to the lung: viral vectors, liposomes, nanoparticles, and electroporation. Viral delivery uses several different genetically modified viruses that enter the cell and express desired genes that have been inserted to the viral genome. Liposomes use combinations of charged and neutral lipids that can encapsulate genetic cargo and enter cells through endogenous mechanisms, thereby delivering their cargoes. Nanoparticles are defined by their size (typically less than 100 nm) and are made up of many different classes of building blocks, including biological and synthetic polymers, cell penetrant and other peptides, and dendrimers, that also enter cells through endogenous mechanisms. Electroporation uses mild to moderate electrical pulses to create pores in the cell membrane through which delivered genetic material can enter a cell. An emerging fifth category, exosomes and extracellular vesicles, may have advantages of both viral and non-viral approaches. These extracellular vesicles bud from cellular membranes containing receptors and ligands that may aid cell targeting and which can be loaded with genetic material for efficient transfer.

We found a clear similarity between the spectra of single base substitutions in rubella and in SARS-CoV-2, with C to U as well as A to G and U to C being the most prominent in plus strand genomic RNA of each virus. Of those, U to C changes universally showed preference for loops versus stems in predicted RNA secondary structure.

Fungus-specific cultures were negative for gutta-percha samples and only one plaque sample had growth of a fungus. In total, 36/42 plaque samples were positive in bacterial Pan-PCRs. In bacterial Pan-PCRs of 31/42 gutta-percha samples dominant microorganisms were identified including Streptococcus spp. (5/42) and E. faecalis (4/42). Moreover, in 7/42 gutta-percha samples DNA of bacteria which are difficult-to-cultivate in microbiology routine culture (Acinetobacter, Pyramidobacter, Bacteroidetes, Synergistes, Atopobium, Pseudoramibacter) were found. DNA of Candida spp. was detected in 5/42 root canals by fungal Pan-PCR (1/5) and genus-specific Candida-PCR (5/5). CONCLUSIONS Pan-PCR assays remain appropriate as a broad-range approach for the detection of a dominant pathogen in gutta-percha samples which have less diverse microbial composition. The molecular genetic Pan-PCR approach has the advantage of detecting microorganisms that are as-yet-uncultivable or difficult-to-cultivate and should be therefore complementary to conventional microbiological diagnostics.","output":"The benefit of culture-independent methods to detect bacteria and fungi in reinfected root-filled teeth - A pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has become a global pandemic.

This study describes demographic, clinical, and functional characteristics of veterans in MFHs. Methods Findings from in-home assessments of veterans in MFHs tied to 4 VHA medical centers for  90 days between April 2014 and December 2015 were collected. Trained nurses completed Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 assessments for 92 veterans in MFHs. The assessment included demographic characteristics, cognition, behaviors, depression, pain, functional status, mobility, and morbidity. Results MFH veterans were primarily male (85%), aged > 65 years (83%), cognitively impaired (55%), and had a diagnosis of depression (52%). Overall, 22% had caregiverreported aggressive behaviors and 45% self-reported pain. More than half used a wheelchair (56%). Of the 11 activities of daily living (ADLs) assessed, MFH residents were most likely to require assistance with bathing and least likely to require assistance with bed mobility and eating, although more than half required eating assistance. Conclusions Veterans residing in MFHs have a wide range of care needs, including some veterans with high needs for help with ADLs and others who are completely independent in performing ADLs. These results provide insights about which veterans are staying in MFH care. Future studies should explore how VHA care providers refer veterans to LTC settings.","output":"Who Receives Care in VA Medical Foster Homes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Work-related exposures play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, yet few studies have measured the risk of COVID-19 across occupations and industries. Methods: During September 2020 C May 2021, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services collected occupation and industry data as part of routine COVID-19 case investigations. Adults aged 18-64 years with confirmed or probable COVID-19 in Wisconsin were assigned standardized occupation and industry codes. Cumulative incidence rates were weighted for non-response and calculated using full-time equivalent (FTE) workforce denominators from the 2020 American Community Survey. Findings: An estimated 11.6% of workers (347,013 of 2.98 million) in Wisconsin, ages 18-64 years, had COVID-19 from September 2020 to May 2021. The highest incidence by occupation (per 100 full-time equivalents) occurred among personal care and services workers (22.4), healthcare practitioners and support staff (20.7), and protective services workers (20.7). High risk sub-groups included nursing assistants and personal care aides (28.8), childcare workers (25.8), food and beverage service workers (25.3), personal appearance workers (24.4), and law enforcement workers (24.1). By industry, incidence was highest in healthcare (18.6);the highest risk sub-sectors were nursing care facilities (30.5) and warehousing (28.5). Interpretation: This analysis represents one of the most complete examinations to date of COVID-19 incidence by occupation and industry. Our approach demonstrates the value of standardized occupational data collection by public health, and may be a model for improved occupational surveillance elsewhere. Workers at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure may benefit from targeted workplace COVID-19 vaccination and mitigation efforts.","output":"Measuring Work-Related Risk of COVID-19: Comparison of COVID-19 Incidence by Occupation and Industry C Wisconsin, September 2020-May 2021 (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nCOVID-19 pandemic initiated its course of contagion from the city of Wuhan and now it has spread all over the globe. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative virus and the infection as well as its symptoms are distributed across the multi-organ perimeters.

This article presents a comprehensive overview on the two most promising remedial approaches that are being attempted for the management, treatment, and plausible cure of nCOVID-19. In this context, chemotherapeutic approach primarily aims to interrupt the interactions between the host and the virus causing inhibition of its entry into the host cell and/or its proliferation and suppressing the inflammatory milieu in the infected patients. On the other side, immunotherapeutic approaches aim to modulate the host immunity by fine tuning the inflammatory signaling cascades to achieve phylaxis from the virus and restoring immune-homeostasis.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the perception, knowledge, and application of the preventive measures taken by physiotherapists in managing issues with confirmed or suspected patients suffering from COVID-19. METHODS A self-administered survey comprising 15 questions was divided into four sections related to precautions when interacting with patients with COVID-19: (1) knowledge of the physiotherapy role, (2) knowledge of preventive measures to limit transmission of the virus, (3) practicing these measures, and (4) managing patients with COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 456 physiotherapists from 139 countries participated in the study. Most physiotherapists were knowledgeable regarding their role in the management of COVID-19 patients (M = 94.3%; SD = 15.4) and the management of potential COVID-19 patients (M = 84.5%; SD = 20.1). The rating of knowledge and practices of preventive measures to limit transmission of COVID-19 were lower (M = 74.3%; SD = 25.7, and M = 62.5%; SD = 31.3, respectively). Participants from the European region (M = 83; SD = 15.8) had a higher score than participants from the Asia Western Pacific region (M = 78; SD = 18.49; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Physiotherapists are highly knowledgeable about their role in managing COVID-19 patients. Most of them are adopting preventive measures to limit the transmission of the disease.

The Internet has become a significant source of knowledge. Owing to the widespread damage caused by fake news, it is important to build computerized systems to detect fake news. The paper proposes an updated deep neural network for identification of false news. The deep learning techniques are The Modified-LSTM (one to three layers) and The Modified GRU (one to three layers). In particular, we carry out investigations of a large dataset of tweets passing on data with respect to COVID-19. In our study, we separate the dubious claims into two categories: true and false. We compare the performance of the various algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. The six machine learning techniques are decision trees, logistic regression, k nearest neighbors, random forests, support vector machines, and na?ve Bayes (NB). The parameters of deep learning techniques are optimized using Keras-tuner. Four Benchmark datasets were used. Two feature extraction methods were used (TF-ID with N-gram) to extract essential features from the four benchmark datasets for the baseline machine learning model and word embedding feature extraction method for the proposed deep neural network methods. The results obtained with the proposed framework reveal high accuracy in detecting Fake and non-Fake tweets containing COVID-19 information.

Fentanyl-related overdose is rising in new geographic areas e.g. the western USA. Stimulant-related overdose is also increasing nationwide driven by methamphetamine and cocaine. Polysubstance use, e.g. the use of a stimulant along with an opioid is driving stimulant-related overdose. Other medical consequences of injection drug use are rising including HIV and hepatitis C infections. Medication approaches to treating opioid use disorder remain the standard of care and there are new promising pharmacological approaches to treating methamphetamine use disorder. SUMMARY A 'fourth wave' of high mortality involving methamphetamine and cocaine use has been gathering force in the USA.

MethodsBritish participants (18-59y) completed a cross-sectional web survey one year (March to April 2021) after the initial lockdown in Britain. Quota-based sampling and weighting resulted in a quasi-representative population sample. We compared Natsal-COVID data with Natsal-3, a household-based probability sample cross-sectional survey (16-74y) conducted in 2010-12. Reported unmet need for condoms because of the pandemic and uptake of chlamydia testing/HIV testing/cervical cancer screening were analysed among sexually-experienced participants (18-44y) (n=2869, Natsal-COVID; n=8551, Natsal-3). Odds ratios adjusted for age (aOR) and other potential confounders (AOR) describe associations with demographic and behavioural factors. ResultsIn 2021, 6.9% of women and 16.2% of men reported unmet need for condoms because of the pandemic. This was more likely among participants: aged 18-24 years, of Black or Black British ethnicity, and reporting same-sex sex (past five years) or one or more new relationships (past year). Chlamydia and HIV testing were more commonly reported by younger participants, those reporting condomless sex with new sexual partners, and men reporting same-sex partners; a very similar distribution to 10 years previously (Natsal-3). However, there were differences during the pandemic, including stronger associations with chlamydia testing for men reporting same-sex partners; with HIV testing for women reporting new sexual partners; and with cervical screening among smokers. ConclusionsOur study suggests differential access to key primary and secondary STI/HIV prevention interventions continued during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the available evidence does not suggest substantial changes in inequalities in since 2010-12. While the pandemic might not have exacerbated inequalities in access to primary and secondary prevention, it is clear that large inequalities persisted, typically among those at greatest STI/HIV risk.

Many of these mutations have been identified as oncogenic drivers in a wide array of cancer types and can be classified into three Classes according to molecular characteristics. Consensus treatment strategies for Class 2 and 3 BRAF mutations have not yet been established. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data to assess treatment outcomes with FDA-approved mitogen activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) targeted therapy according to BRAF Class, cancer type and MAPK targeted therapy type. A search was conducted on literature from 2010-2021. Individual patient data was collected and analyzed from published reports of patients with cancer harboring Class 2 or 3 BRAF mutations and who received MAPK targeted therapy with available treatment response data. Co-primary outcomes were response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: 18167 studies were screened, identifying 80 studies with 238 patients that met inclusion criteria. This included 167 patients with Class 2 and 71 patients with Class 3 BRAF mutations. Overall, 77 patients achieved a treatment response. In both univariate and multivariable analyses, RR and PFS were higher among patients with Class 2 compared to Class 3 mutations, findings that remain when analyses are restricted to patients with melanoma or lung primary cancers. MEK +/- BRAF inhibitors demonstrated greater clinical activity in Class 2 compared to Class 3 BRAF mutant tumors than BRAF or EGFR inhibitors. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that MAPK targeted therapies have clinical activity in some Class 2 and 3 BRAF mutant cancers. BRAF Class may dictate responsiveness to current and emerging treatment strategies, particularly in metastatic melanoma and lung cancers. Together, this analysis provides clinical validation of predictions made based on a mutation classification system established in the preclinical literature.

Appropriate HF management extensively relies upon patient-reported symptoms. With the growing attention towards patient-centered care, our team recognized an invaluable opportunity to solicit patient-reported subjective experiences regarding telehealth. METHODS: In total, 127 patients with a known diagnosis of HF were contacted by phone for participation in an online questionnaire. The tool consisted of questions generated by the investigators and from prior validated patient-reported experience measures. The intention was to assess the quality of care in our HF clinic and to solicit feedback regarding telehealth. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients provided a response. Questions with the most favorable outcomes were in line with our predetermined themes of interpersonal matter, communication, and perceived quality of care. The worst performing questions exhibited a lack of satisfaction with and perceived quality of telehealth. Only 9% (n = 3) preferred follow-up via telehealth, 69% (n = 22) preferred in-person, and 22% (n = 7) were indifferent. CONCLUSIONS: Given the multitude of benefits of telehealth, especially appropriate social distancing, telehealth is quite likely here to stay. In sum, with the rapid change in care delivery, patients currently perceive the care delivered via telehealth to be of inferior quality. This lack of quality can be largely attributed to the lack of physical examination, depersonalization of healthcare, and likely, a lack of familiarity with the platform.

A recent analysis in IBD patients from the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) registry showed older age, steroid medication, and comorbidities as risk factors for severe evolution, and the same study showed that the 29 IBD patients younger than age 20 had only mild disease courses.3 This report describes the disease course of COVID-19 in an expanded sample of pediatric IBD patients from 2 international databases.","output":"Benign Evolution of SARS-Cov2 Infections in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results From Two International Databases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Educational interventions were necessary to clarify COVID-19 related misconceptions among Hong Kong older adults. Yet, face-to-face interventions were infeasible under the pandemic. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a healthcare student-led, telephone-delivered intervention in educating older adults on COVID-19 related health topics. Feasibility, satisfaction level in subjects and impacts on volunteer students of the intervention were also explored. Methods: Subjects aged 65 or above were recruited from a community center in Yuen Long, Hong Kong. The telephone-delivered intervention consisted of 5 phone call sessions conducted by student volunteers. The first four sessions included pre-tests covering three COVID-19 related health topics. Standardized explanations were offered to all subjects during phone call. In the last session, post-tests on all themes were conducted. Paired t-test and McNemars test were used to measure the efficacy of intervention based on the differences in pre-tests and post-tests scores. The level of significance was 0.05. Subject satisfaction surveys and student feedback surveys were analyzed. This was a longitudinal study with no control group. Results: Twenty-five subjects were recruited. Paired t-test results showed statistically significant improvement in test scores for all themes: from 76.0% to 95.3% (p<0.01) on Medication Safety, from 64.0% to 88.9% (p<0.01) on Healthcare Voucher, and from 78.0% to 93.0% (p<0.01) on COVID-19 Myth busting. McNemars test results showed an increase in correct rate for all questions. However, the improvement was not statistically significant in 65% of the questions due to small sample size and ceiling effect. Most subjects were satisfied with the program and improvement in mood after the program were reported. Student feedback survey suggested that the intervention enhanced students communication skills and understanding about older adults in Hong Kong.

Currently, neither vaccines nor therapeutic drugs are available against this agent. Considering that the disease progresses very fast with a high mortality rate, working towards the development of potential therapeutics against it will have a public health impact. Although the use of viral inhibitors as antiviral agents is the most common way to curb virus replication, the mutation-prone nature of viruses results in the development of resistance to antiviral agents. The recent development of proteomic platforms for analysis of purified viral agents has allowed certain upregulated host proteins that are involved in the morphogenesis and replication of viruses to be identified. Thus, the alternative approach of inhibition of host proteins involved in the regulation of virus replication could be explored for their therapeutic effectiveness. In the current study, we have evaluated the effect of inhibition of cyclophilin A (CypA), an immunophilin with peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase activity, on the replication of CHPV. Treatment with cyclosporin A, used in vitro for the inhibition of CypA, resulted in a 3-log reduction in CHPV titer and an undetectable level of CypA in comparison to an untreated control. An in silico analysis of the interaction of the CHPV nucleoprotein with the human CypA protein showed stable interaction in molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the results of this study suggest a possible role of CypA in facilitating CHPV replication, thus making it one of the potential host factors to be explored in future antiviral studies.

As children and teenagers spend most of their time in the classroom, schools may have the opportunity to positively influence students quality of life, playing a crucial role in fostering their health. The aim of this review was to analyze evidence that demonstrated why school is the ideal setting for thepromotion of young generations wellbeing. Methods: We have reviewed the available literature about health promotion in school setting, searching for articles and books published from 1977 to 2020. A total of 74 articles and 17books were selected and assessed. Results: The promotion of students wellbeing could reduce the prevalence of measurable unhealthy outcomes and improve their academic achievements. At least 80% of all cases of heart diseases, strokes, type 2 diabetes and one third of all cancers can be prevented through health education. In this perspective, primary prevention and health promotion should start as early as possible, finding in the school the ideal setting of action. Effective school-based preventive approaches should raise students motivation towards a personal interiorization of health knowledge and develop in young people a critical thinking about harmful consequences of the most common risky behaviours. Educators should receive adequate training concerning health topics and become expert in the most innovative approaches to effectively engage students in adopting healthy lifestyles.

A large percentage of the media posted through the COVID-19 crisis has been graphical, which raised the question of whether Arabic-speaking blind and deaf persons were able to independently access reliable information. This article presents the results of two studies. The first study involves a content analysis of official social media posts about COVID-19 during critical phases of the outbreak via heuristic evaluation of WCAG2.1 on an iOS smartphone and an iPad. The second study explores the experiences of native Arabic-speaking blind and deaf persons on social media during the pandemic and curfew or lockdown periods in the State of Kuwait using a semi-structured interview (11 people who are blind/low vision and 7 people who are deaf). Overall, our findings highlight the accessibility gaps in the current government social media information content and its dissemination practices and barriers in providing information and services.

Information about the frequency and seriousness of COVID-19 infection among immuno- compromised HIV patients is still unclear. To our knowledge till date, clinical data about COVID -19 in HIV infected pa- tients are limited with only few case series. Here, we present cases of two HIV patient with COVID-19 infection admitted at Silchar Medical College & Hospital (SMCH), Silchar, south-eastern Assam, India. Methods:This retrospective study was conducted in VRDL, Silchar Medical College, Silchar among COVID -19 positive patient for the duration of three months from 30th March to 29th June 2020. The aim of the study was to evaluate the scenario of HIV reactive cases among COVID-19 positive population. Results:Between 30th March to 29th June 2020, a total of 727 COVID-19 positive cases were diagnosed at VRDL, SMCH. During these three months only two HIV patients were diagnosed with SARS-COV-2 infection. Patient-1 was 20-year old male (unaware of his HIV status) while Patient-2 was 52 year old army personnel (on ART therapy). In patient-2 HIV was well suppressed with sufficiently high CD4 counts. Fortunately, both the patients were asymptomatic and healthy. The mainstay of treatment given for the patients consisted of hydroxychloroquine, multi-vitamins in addition to the ART drugs (only patient 2). Both patients had stable health conditions, did not have any complications during their entire stay in health care facility for COVID-19. Both were treated and were tested negative by RTPCR within 14-15 days like any other general patient. Conclusions:Although, HIV patients are considered as immunocompromised, but our experience suggests that well con- trolled HIV patients with COVID-19 may have satisfactory prognosis following proper medical care. Further, enlarged cohort studies are needed to better understand risk and clinical course of COVID-19 among HIV-infected people.","output":"Scenario of COVID-19 among HIV infected patients: Case studies from south eastern Assam, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microsporum canis sensitive to itraconazole and terbinafine was isolated from two cats presented with generalized dermatophytosis and dermatophyte mycetoma.

Next generation sequencing methods rely on significantly larger numbers of reads than previous sequencing methods in exchange for a loss of accuracy in each individual read. Still, the coverage of such machines is imperfect and leaves uncertainty in many of the base calls. On top of this machine-level uncertainty, there is uncertainty induced by human error, such as errors in data entry or incorrect parameter settings. In this work, we demonstrate that the uncertainty in sequencing techniques will affect downstream analysis and propose a straightforward method to propagate the uncertainty. Our method uses a probabilistic matrix representation of individual sequences which incorporates base quality scores as a measure of uncertainty that naturally lead to resampling and replication as a framework for uncertainty propagation. With the matrix representation, resampling possible base calls according to quality scores provides a bootstrap- or prior distribution-like first step towards genetic analysis. Analyses based on these re-sampled sequences will include a more complete evaluation of the error involved in such analyses. We demonstrate our resampling method on SARS-CoV-2 data. The resampling procedures adds a linear computational cost to the analyses, but the large impact on the variance in downstream estimates makes it clear that ignoring this uncertainty may lead to overly confident conclusions. We show that SARS-CoV-2 lineage designations via Pangolin are much less certain than the bootstrap support reported by Pangolin would imply and the clock rate estimates for SARS-CoV-2 are much more variable than reported.","output":"Variance in Variants: Propagating Genome Sequence Uncertainty into Phylogenetic Lineage Assignment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Intergenerational support between aging parents and adult children is important to the well-being of both groups, especially during public health emergencies. However, few previous studies have examined the effects of daily support between parents and children on their well-being during public health emergencies. To fill in this gap, we examined the association between daily support and well-being in mothers and their adult children during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Seventy-seven pairs of mothers (aged 44C80 years, M = 53.78, SD = 9.57) and adult children (aged 18C54 years, M = 26.61, SD = 9.46; 19% male) in mainland China participated in a 14-day daily diary study during a 14-day stay-at-home period. All of the participants reported the daily emotional and instrumental support they had given to and received from their mother/child each day for 14 consecutive days. Their daily positive affect and negative affect were also measured. RESULTS: Receiving more support on a given day was associated with providing more support on that day, suggesting a daily reciprocity. This finding was consistent across mothers and children. A lower level of being under-benefitted on a day was associated with better daily well-being of children, but not that of mothers. Providing support, but not receiving support, was positively associated with mothers daily well-being, whereas receiving support, but not providing support, was positively associated with childrens daily well-being. DISCUSSION: This study provides evidence of daily intergenerational support during a global public health emergency.

Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity and relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells of vaccinated volunteers were equivalent to those of individuals who had recovered from natural infection5,6.

However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most-potent monoclonal antibodies that we tested was reduced or abolished by the K417N, E484K or N501Y mutation. Notably, these mutations were selected when we cultured recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing SARS-CoV-2 S in the presence of the monoclonal antibodies elicited by the vaccines.

The main objectives of this paper were to review the regulatory measures for plastic waste reduction and recycling, analyse the trend changes on the recycled amounts of regulated plastic containers and also address the discussions on the impacts of COVID-19 on the expected increase in plastic waste. In the past two decades, the central competent authority (i.e. Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)) in Taiwan has promulgated some regulations governing plastic waste reduction and recycling, especially plastic containers. Based on the official statistics, it showed that total certified amounts of regulated plastic containers have increased from 45,552 tonnes in 1998 to 194,133 tonnes in 2019. This shift was in line with circular economy policies by the Zero Waste Program and Resource Recycling and Reuse Plan launched by the Taiwan EPA during this period. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic will impact on the regulatory policies for plastic waste management because the excess use of regulated plastic products will be temporarily permitted due to the epidemic prevention and control measures. Although the increased proportion of plastic waste in municipal solid waste (MSW) will be beneficial for the energy efficiencies of waste-to-power systems in MSW incineration plants, the recycling and reduction rates of regulated plastic containers or products could decline during the COVID-19 breakout.","output":"Analysis of plastic waste reduction and recycling in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The demands posed during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic have led to greater stress and frustration, which in turn can fuel exhaustion, cynicism, secondary traumatic stress (STS), and burnout.

Emergence and continuous reporting of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia emphasize the need for surveillance of MERS-CoV in returning pilgrims or travelers from the Middle East and capacity building of health care providers for disease containment. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control & Research (IEDCR) under the Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family welfare (MoHFW), is responsible for MERS-CoV screening of pilgrims/ travelers returning from the Middle East with respiratory illness as part of its outbreak investigation and surveillance activities. METHODS: Bangladeshi travelers/pilgrims who returned from the Middle East and presented with fever and respiratory symptoms were studied over the period from October 2013 to June 2016. Patients with respiratory symptoms that fulfilled the WHO MERS-CoV case algorithm were tested for MERS-CoV and other respiratory tract viruses. Beside surveillance, case recognition training was conducted at multiple levels of health care facilities across the country in support of early detection and containment of the disease. RESULTS: Eighty one suspected cases tested by real time PCR resulted in zero detection of MERS-CoV infection. Viral etiology detected in 29.6% of the cases was predominantly influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and influenza B infection (22%). Peak testing occurred mostly following the annual Hajj season. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory tract infections in travelers/pilgrims returning to Bangladesh from the Middle East are mainly due to influenza A and influenza B. Though MERS-CoV was not detected in the 81 patients tested, continuous screening and surveillance are essential for early detection of MERS-CoV infection and other respiratory pathogens to prevent transmissions in hospital settings and within communities.

Hospitals throughout the world made life-altering resource allocation decisions and prioritised the care of COVID-19 patients. Without effective models to evaluate resource allocation strategies encompassing COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care, hospitals face the risk of making sub-optimal local resource allocation decisions. A discrete-event-simulation model is proposed in this paper to describe COVID-19, elective surgery, and emergency surgery patient flows. COVID-19-specific patient flows and a surgical patient flow network were constructed based on data of 475 COVID-19 patients and 28,831 non-COVID-19 patients in Addenbrooke's hospital in the UK. The model enabled the evaluation of three resource allocation strategies, for two COVID-19 wave scenarios: proactive cancellation of elective surgery, reactive cancellation of elective surgery, and ring-fencing operating theatre capacity. The results suggest that a ring-fencing strategy outperforms the other strategies, regardless of the COVID-19 scenario, in terms of total direct deaths and the number of surgeries performed. However, this does come at the cost of 50% more critical care rejections. In terms of aggregate hospital performance, a reactive cancellation strategy prioritising COVID-19 is no longer favourable if more than 7.3% of elective surgeries can be considered life-saving. Additionally, the model demonstrates the impact of timely hospital preparation and staff availability, on the ability to treat patients during a pandemic. The model can aid hospitals worldwide during pandemics and disasters, to evaluate their resource allocation strategies and identify the effect of redefining the prioritisation of patients.","output":"Balancing Scarce Hospital Resources During a Pandemic: A Case-Study of COVID-19 at Addenbrookes Hospital (UK)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Pharmacovigilance data are primarily used to identify adverse drug reactions by screening for disproportionate reporting, i.e. more reports of certain combinations of adverse events and drugs than expected. However, scanning for associations of drugs and adverse events that occur less frequently than expected provides hypotheses for drug repurposing, i.e. a known drug could be therapeutically beneficial for a new indication like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As coronavirus related adverse events are scarce in pharmacovigilance data prior to 2020, we searched for drugs suitable against similar viral diseases. METHODS In this observational, retrospective, pharmacovigilance study, drugs associated with viral respiratory tract infections and/or diseases caused by RNA-viruses, which are phylogenetically similar to SARS-CoV-2, were extracted from the U.S. FAERS pharmacovigilance data 2004Q1 to 2020Q2 using OpenVigil 2.1-MedDRA17, filtered for significant inverse associations (ROR<1 and padj <0.05), checked for implausibility (e.g., only topically) or clinical infeasibility (e.g., strong cytotoxic effects), and categorised by their WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code. RESULTS A total of 126 drugs were identified. ATC clustering of the manually curated list of 112 candidate drugs revealed female sex hormones, anti-diabetics, neuropharmacological sigma-receptor modulators, peptidase inhibitors, antiviral drugs, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors as putatively antiviral. CONCLUSION Scanning for inverse signals in pharmacovigilance data provides new hypotheses for drug repurposing, theoretically for all indications. Concerning the treatment of viral respiratory infections, there is affirmative data for some candidate drugs; the remaining proposed candidate drugs without already known antiviral mechanism of action should stimulate further exploration.","output":"Pharmacovigilance-based drug repurposing: The search for inverse signals via OpenVigil identifies putative drugs against viral respiratory infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Articular cartilage lesion is a common disease to be treated by arthroscopic surgery.

As of March 26, 2020, there are more than 500,000 cases and more than 25,000 deaths related to COVID-19, and the numbers are increasing by the hour. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, and to understand patterns in virtual visits related to symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 cases and patients using an on-demand, statewide virtual urgent care center. We collected data from February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. Institutional Review Board exemption was obtained prior to the study. RESULTS: As of March, 18 2020, there were 92 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 733 total virtual visits. Of the total visits, 257 (35.1%) were related to COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the COVID-19-like visits, the number of females was 178 (69.2%). People in the age groups of 30-39 years (n=67, 26.1%) and 40-49 years (n=64, 24.9%) were half of the total patients. Additionally, approximately 96.9% (n=249) of the COVID-like encounters came from within the state of North Carolina. Our study shows that virtual care can provide efficient triaging in the counties with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. We also confirmed that the largest spread of the disease occurs in areas with a high population density as well as in areas with major airports. CONCLUSIONS: The use of virtual care presents promising potential in the fight against COVID-19. Virtual care is capable of reducing emergency room visits, conserving health care resources, and avoiding the spread of COVID-19 by treating patients remotely. We call for further adoption of virtual care by health systems across the United States and the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Interpreting COVID-19 and Virtual Care Trends: Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world; however, there are several groups of viruses that are insufficiently routinely sought for, and can thus be considered neglected from a diagnostic and clinical standpoint. Timely detection of seasonality of certain respiratory viruses (e.g., enveloped viruses such as seasonal coronaviruses) in the local context can aid substantially in targeted and cost-effective utilization of viral diagnostic approaches. For the other, non-enveloped and year-round viruses (i.e., rhinovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus), a continuous virological diagnosis needs to be implemented in clinical laboratories to more effectively address the aetiology of respiratory infections, and assess the overall impact of these viruses on disease burden. While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still actively unfolding, we aimed to emphasize the persistent role of seasonal coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and bocaviruses in the aetiology of respiratory infections. Consequently, this paper concentrates on the burden and epidemiological trends of aforementioned viral groups on a global level, but also provides a snapshot of their prevalence patterns in Croatia in order to underscore the potential implications of viral seasonality. An overall global prevalence in respiratory tract infections was found to be between 0.5 and 18.4% for seasonal coronaviruses, between 13 and 59% for rhinoviruses, between 1 and 36% for human adenoviruses, and between 1 and 56.8% for human bocaviruses. A Croatian dataset on patients with respiratory tract infection and younger than 18 years of age has revealed a fairly high prevalence of rhinoviruses (33.4%), with much lower prevalence of adenoviruses (15.6%), seasonal coronaviruses (7.1%), and bocaviruses (5.3%). These insights represent a relevant discussion point in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where the testing of non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses has been limited in many settings, making the monitoring of disease burden associated with other respiratory viruses rather difficult.","output":"Seasonal Coronaviruses and Other Neglected Respiratory Viruses: A Global Perspective and a Local Snapshot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past century, vaccines have made a large impact on public health.

This phenomenon is known as the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are pathogens that are frequently involved in PRDC. The main objective of this project was to study the in vitro interactions between these two pathogens and the host cells in the context of mixed infections. To fulfill this objective, PRRSV permissive cell lines such as MARC-145, SJPL, and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) were used. A pre-infection with PRRSV was performed at 0.5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) followed by an infection with App at 10 MOI. Bacterial adherence and cell death were compared. Results showed that PRRSV pre-infection did not affect bacterial adherence to the cells. PRRSV and App co-infection produced an additive cytotoxicity effect. Interestingly, a pre-infection of SJPL and PAM cells with App blocked completely PRRSV infection. Incubation of SJPL and PAM cells with an App cell-free culture supernatant is also sufficient to significantly block PRRSV infection. This antiviral activity is not due to LPS but rather by small molecular weight, heat-resistant App metabolites (<1 kDa). The antiviral activity was also observed in SJPL cells infected with swine influenza virus but to a much lower extent compared to PRRSV. More importantly, the PRRSV antiviral activity of App was also seen with PAM, the cells targeted by the virus in vivo during infection in pigs. The antiviral activity might be due, at least in part, to the production of interferon . The use of in vitro experimental models to study viral and bacterial co-infections will lead to a better understanding of the interactions between pathogens and their host cells, and could allow the development of novel prophylactic and therapeutic tools.","output":"Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae Possesses an Antiviral Activity against Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify ethnic differences in proportion positive for SARS-CoV-2, and proportion hospitalised, proportion admitted to intensive care and proportion died in hospital with COVID-19 during the first epidemic wave in Wales. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of 76 503 SARS-CoV-2 tests carried out in Wales to 31 May 2020. Cohort study of 4046 individuals hospitalised with confirmed COVID-19 between 1 March and 31 May. In both analyses, ethnicity was assigned using a name-based classifier. SETTING: Wales (UK). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Admission to an intensive care unit following hospitalisation with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Death within 28 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. RESULTS: Using a name-based ethnicity classifier, we found a higher proportion of black, Asian and ethnic minority people tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR tested positive, compared with those classified as white. Hospitalised black, Asian and minority ethnic cases were younger (median age 53 compared with 76 years; p<0.01) and more likely to be admitted to intensive care. Bangladeshi (adjusted OR (aOR): 9.80, 95% CI 1.21 to 79.40) and white C other than British or Irish (aOR: 1.99, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.44) ethnic groups were most likely to be admitted to intensive care unit.

CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the growing evidence that ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. During the first COVID-19 epidemic wave in Wales, although ethnic minority populations were less likely to be tested and less likely to be hospitalised, those that did attend hospital were younger and more likely to be admitted to intensive care.

In the short term, quality of life (QoL) is restored by IHR. Two centers pioneered the IHR in Sweden with the highly standardized Rives-Stoppa technique using a retromuscular mesh. We assessed long-term follow-up of recurrence rate and QoL. METHODS Medical records were searched for IHRs performed from 1998 to 2006 and included living patients with midline repairs. Questionnaires about physical status, complaints, and QoL (SF-36) were mailed, offering a clinical examination. Assessment of medical records of later surgery was performed in 2015. RESULTS Three hundred and one patients with midline incisional repairs were identified, and 217 accepted participation. Of these, 103 attended a clinical examination. Follow-up was 7 years until examination and 11 years to reassessment of medical records. In 26%, recurrent hernias were repaired. Postoperative complications were 26% Clavien-Dindo grade I-II and 1% grade III-IV. Mesh infections occurred in 1.4% without mesh removals, and 4% were reoperated because of complications. Overall recurrence rate was 8.1% and two-third of which were diagnosed at clinical examination. Recurrence after primary and recurrent hernia repair was 7.1 and 10.9%, respectively. Of all patients, 80% were satisfied; dissatisfaction was primarily caused by recurrence and chronic pain.

Understanding the importance of stem cells on skin wound healing, here we evaluate the biological significance of M-CSF on skin wound healing. In an in vivo mouse skin excisional wound model, we found that SSEA-positive stem cells were present in wounded but not normal skin. After isolating skin cells from either normal or wounded skin by collagenase digestion, and analyzing the SSEA-1 positive cells by flow cytometry, we found a significant increase in the number of SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin. Topical application of M-CSF in skin wounds accelerated healing remarkably, while application of M-CSF-neutralizing antibody slowed wound healing. Furthermore, injection of EGFP-labeled hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells generated from M-CSF treated splenocytes resulted in EGFP-labeled cells being enriched in the skin wound site and further differentiated into functional organ-specific cells. Together, these data demonstrated that M-CSF makes a significant contribution to the healing process by inducing hematopoietic cell dedifferentiation into stem cells.","output":"Accelerating skin wound healing by M-CSF through generating SSEA-1 and -3 stem cells in the injured sites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Currently, there is an urgent need for efficient tools to assess the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In this paper, we present feasible solutions for detecting and labeling infected tissues on CT lung images of such patients. Two structurally-different deep learning techniques, SegNet and UNET, are investigated for semantically segmenting infected tissue regions in CT lung images. Methods: : We propose to use two known deep learning networks, SegNet and UNET, for image tissue classification. SegNet is characterized as a scene segmentation network and UNET as a medical segmentation tool. Both networks were exploited as binary segmentors to discriminate between infected and healthy lung tissue, also as multi-class segmentors to learn the infection type on the lung. Each network is trained using seventy-two data images, validated on ten images, and tested against the left eighteen images. Severalstatistical scores are calculated for the results and tabulated accordingly. Results: : The results show the superior ability of SegNet in classifying infected/non-infected tissues compared to the other methods (with 0.95 mean accuracy), while the UNET shows better results as a multi-class segmentor (with 0.91 mean accuracy). Conclusion: Semantically segmenting CT scan images of COVID-19 patients is a crucial goal because it would not only assist in disease diagnosis, also help in quantifying the severity of the illness, and hence, prioritize the population treatment accordingly. We propose computer-based techniques that prove to be reliable as detectors for infected tissue in lung CT scans. The availability of such a method in todays pandemic wouldhelp automate, prioritize, fasten, and broaden the treatment of COVID-19 patients globally.","output":"COVID-19 Lung CT Image Segmentation Using Deep Learning Methods: UNET Vs.

MATERIAL/METHODS: From January 2012 to June 2013, 112 patients with virus-induced encephalitis (the case group and 109 healthy individuals (the control group) were recruited for the purposes of this study. The functional variations that IL-4 and IL-10 genes exhibit were detected through the use of a function analysis and selection tool for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (FASTSNP). The genotypes of IL-4 were rs2227283 and IL-4 rs2227288, and the genotypes of IL-10 were rs1800871 and IL-10 rs1800872. These genotypes were respectively assessed using direct sequencing. RESULTS: IL-4 rs2227283 and IL-10 rs1800871 have no correlation in with risk of virus-induced encephalitis (both P>0.05) GA and AA genotypes were related to IL-4 rs2227288 and GT, while TT and GT + TT genotypes were related to IL-10 rs1800872. These were highlighted as being risk factors in virus-induced encephalitis (all P<0.05). However, the duration of fever, white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, and lymphocytes and monocytes of virus-induced encephalitis patients with IL-4 rs2227288 and IL-10 rs1800872 all displayed significant differences (all P<0.05). Frequencies of GAGT and CAGT haplotypes were evaluated and deemed to be of statistical significance and subsequently were highlighted as being risk factors in virus-induced encephalitis (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IL-4 rs2227288 and IL-10 rs1800872 may contribute to an increased risk for virus-induced encephalitis. Through use of direct sequencing, we showed that genotypes of IL-4 rs2227288 and IL-10 rs1800872 may have particular host susceptibility to virus-induced encephalitis.","output":"Cytokines Interleukin 4 (IL-4) and Interleukin 10 (IL-10) Gene Polymorphisms as Potential Host Susceptibility Factors in Virus-Induced Encephalitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the lives of millions of people worldwide and damaged the economy of many countries.

The effect of primary C-source and fresh soil addition, soil aeration, and humidity maintenance has been monitored by means of microbiological and respirometric analysis, dry weight loss determinations, and SEM micrographs. During the incubation, in biodegradation microcosms (BD), containing NR samples, the produced CO(2) was significantly higher than that of biotic controls (BC). Furthermore, after 236 days, a NR dry weight loss of 15.6%, in BD microcosms, was registered, about four-fold higher than that registered in BC control (3.7%). Obtained results confirmed that the naturally selected microbial consortium was able to use NR as the only C-source and to biodegrade it. The positive effect of soil mixing evidenced that the biodegradation process was mainly carried out by aerobic biomass, especially filamentous fungi, as confirmed by microbial counts and SEM observations.

Although antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike have been shown prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients, and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) dramatically enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2, and thus increased SARS-CoV2 infectivity. Surprisingly, mutational analysis revealed that all the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the surface of the NTD. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected in all samples of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the study. However, the ratio of infectivity-enhancing antibodies to neutralizing antibodies differed among patients. Furthermore, the antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site were detected in 3 out of 48 uninfected donors, albeit at low levels. These findings suggest that the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity-enhancing site could be considered as a possible exacerbating factors for COVID-19 and that a spike protein lacking such antibody epitopes may be required for safe vaccine development, especially for individuals with pre-existing enhancing antibodies.","output":"An infectivity-enhancing site on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is targeted by COVID-19 patient antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is a communicable disease caused by a novel coronavirus. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess self-reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders in nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Poland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 17 and 18, 2020, in 4516 nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Poland. The questionnaire included 8 questions related to the health status, symptoms of COVID-19, comorbidities, and smoking status. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were obtained from 1942 patients with COVID-19 with a response rate of 43%. The median age of the respondents was 50 years; 60.2% were women. Among nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19, 21.3% had hypertension, 4.5% had diabetes, and 3.1% had a chronic respiratory disease. Regular tobacco use was declared by 11.2% of patients with COVID-19. At least one gastrointestinal symptom was reported by 53.6% of patients.

Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in two pandemic hospitals with a total of 557 participants, which included healthcare professionals of all occupations and all hospital units. Socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19 attitude and knowledge were evaluated with the data form. The hospital anxiety-depression scale (HADS), beck hopelessness scale (BHS), maslach burnout inventory (MBI), fear of COVID-19 scale (FC-19S), and multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) were used to assess psychosocial adjustment and social support. Results: Females had higher levels of HADS-anxiety, FC-19S, MBI-emotional exhaustion, and MSPSS-friend and MSPSS-significant other subscales (p<0.05). Scores of BHS (highest in resident doctors and caregivers), HADS-anxiety (highest in resident doctor), HADS-depression (highest in caregivers), and MBI-emotional exhaustion and MBI-depersonalization (highest in the resident doctors) were seen to differ with occupation (p<0.05). Scores of HADS-Depression, FC-19S, and MBI-emotional exhaustion were higher in participants working at the intensive care unit (p<0.05). Having COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction examination history was related to higher scores of BHS, HADS-anxiety, HADSdepression, and FC-19S, and lower scores of MSPSS scores (p<0.05).

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated patients preference for SLIT-tablets vs monthly or weekly SCIT from a US patient perspective. METHODS: We carried out a discrete choice experiment (DCE) consisting of two blocks with eight choice sets. Adults and caregivers of children with moderate-to-severe AR were included if they had not previously or were not currently receiving AIT. Three attributes were included in the design: the mode and frequency of administration, the risk of systemic reactions and the co-payment. RESULTS: A total of 724 adults with AR and 665 caregivers of children with AR were included in the study. Both adults and caregivers had a significant preference for SLIT-tablets compared with both weekly and monthly injections and for less risk of anaphylactic shock. Caregivers were more risk-averse than adults when choosing their treatment, and the younger the child, the more risk-averse the caregiver. The preference for SLIT-tablets was found for both monoallergic and polyallergic adults and caregivers of monoallergic and polyallergic children. Respondents not wanting AIT for free were more risk-averse than those indicating that they wanted AIT for free.

Sanger sequencing showed that PRV DNA in the CSF and PRV antibodies in both the CSF and blood were positive. MRI results revealed multiple inflammatory lesions in the bilateral hemisphere.

Influenza virus infection is initiated by the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) through receptor binding and fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. HA is synthesized as a precursor protein and requires cleavage by host cell proteases to gain its fusion capacity. Although cleavage of HA is crucial for virus infectivity, little was known about relevant proteases in the human airways for a long time. Recent progress in the identification and characterization of HA-activating host cell proteases has been considerable however and supports the idea of targeting HA cleavage as a novel approach for influenza treatment. Interestingly, certain bacteria have been demonstrated to support HA activation either by secreting proteases that cleave HA or due to activation of cellular proteases and thereby may contribute to virus spread and enhanced pathogenicity. In this review, we give an overview on activation of influenza viruses by proteases from host cells and bacteria with the main focus on recent progress on HA cleavage by proteases HAT and TMPRSS2 in the human airway epithelium.

Older and more sensitive hosts should be vaccinated first to minimize the disease burden. But what are the evolutionary consequences of targeted vaccination? We clarify the consequences of different vaccination strategies through the analysis of the speed of viral adaptation measured as the rate of change of the frequency of vaccine-escape mutations. We show that a vaccine-escape mutant is expected to spread faster if vaccination targets individuals which are likely to be involved in a higher number of contacts. We also discuss the pros and cons of dose-sparing strategies. Because delaying the second dose increases the proportion of the population vaccinated with a single dose, this strategy can both speed-up the spread of the vaccine-escape mutant and reduce the cumulated number of deaths. Hence, slowing down viral adaptation may not always be the optimal vaccination strategy. We contend that a careful assessment of the consequences of alternative vaccination strategies on both (i) the speed of adaptation and (ii) the mortality is required to determine which individuals should be vaccinated first.","output":"Targeted vaccination and the speed of SARS-CoV-2 adaptation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intensive worldwide efforts are underway to determine both the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immune responses in COVID-19 patients in order to develop effective therapeutics and vaccines.

The absolute lymphocyte count for these patients was used to calculate sensitivities at various cut-off values. The relationships between absolute lymphocyte count and variables, including age, sex, need for intubation, and mortality, were also explored. RESULTS: Cut-off values for absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 1.1 K/uL to 2.0 K/uL, with sensitivities of 72% and 94%, respectively. Additionally, lower mean absolute lymphocyte counts were identified in males, patients who required intubation, and patients who died.

In order to re-open parts of society, policy-makers need to consider how combinations of measures will affect transmission and understand the trade-offs between them. We use age-specific social contact data, together with epidemiological data, to quantify the components of the COVID-19 reproduction number. We estimate the impact of social distancing policies on the reproduction number by turning contacts on and off based on context and age. We focus on the impact of re-opening schools against a background of wider social distancing measures. We demonstrate that pre-collected social contact data can be used to provide a time-varying estimate of the reproduction number (R). We find that following lockdown (when R = 0.7, 95% CI 0.6, 0.8), opening primary schools has a modest impact on transmission (R = 0.89, 95% CI 0.82?0.97) as long as other social interactions are not increased.

Here we investigate the impact of colloidal aggregation, a common artifact in early drug discovery, in these repurposing screens. We selected 56 drugs reported to be active in biochemical assays and tested them for aggregation by both dynamic light scattering and by enzyme counter screening with and without detergent; seventeen of these drugs formed colloids at concentrations similar to their literature reported IC50s. To investigate the occurrence of colloidal aggregators more generally in repurposing libraries, we further selected 15 drugs that had physical properties resembling known aggregators from a common repurposing library, and found that 6 of these aggregated at micromolar concentrations. An attraction of repurposing is that drugs active on one target are considered de-risked on another. This study suggests not only that many of the drugs repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 in biochemical assays are artifacts, but that, more generally, when screened at relevant concentrations, drugs can act artifactually via colloidal aggregation. Understanding the role of aggregation, and detecting its effects rapidly, will allow the community to focus on those drugs and leads that genuinely have potential for treating COVID-19.

The study comprised samples from 3,500 blood donors collected in Scotland between 17 March and 18 May 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019.ResultsAll samples collected on 17 March 2020 (n = 500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in six of 500 donors from 23 to 26 March. The number of samples containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after 5-6 April until the end of the study on 18 May. We found that infections were concentrated in certain postcodes, indicating that outbreaks of infection were extremely localised. In contrast, other areas remained comparatively untouched by the epidemic.ConclusionAlthough blood donors are not representative of the overall population, we demonstrated that serosurveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic such as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","output":"Detection of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to determine population exposure in Scottish blood donors between March and May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the cloning of the first mammalian p21-activated kinases (PAKs) (RAC/CDC42-activated kinases) by Ed Manser, the first international PAK symposium was held in NYC in October 2019.

Antibiotic administration and fluid resuscitation provide necessary secondary levels of treatment. Most young physicians have never treated septic abortion. Many obstetrician-gynecologists experience, or plan to experience, global health activities and will likely care for women with septic abortion. Thus, updated knowledge of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, microbes, and proper treatment is needed to optimally treat this emergency condition when it exists. The pathophysiology of septic abortion involves infection of the placenta, especially the maternal villous space that leads to a high frequency of bacteremia. Symptoms and signs range from mild to severe. The microbes involved are usually common vaginal bacteria, including anaerobes, but occasionally potentially very serious and lethal infection is caused by bacteria that produce toxins. The primary treatment is early curettage to remove infected and devitalized tissue even in the face of continued fetal heart tones.

Initial mortality was extremely high, but dropped exponentially over time. Influenza viruses have high mutation rates, and H1N1 has undergone significant genetic changes since 1918. The exact nature of H1N1 mutation accumulation over time has not been fully explored. METHODS: We have made a comprehensive historical analysis of mutational changes within H1N1 by examining over 4100 fully-sequenced H1N1 genomes. This has allowed us to examine the genetic changes arising within H1N1 from 1918 to the present. RESULTS: We document multiple extinction events, including the previously known extinction of the human H1N1 lineage in the 1950s, and an apparent second extinction of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009. These extinctions appear to be due to a continuous accumulation of mutations. At the time of its disappearance in 2009, the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated over 1400 point mutations (more than 10% of the genome), including approximately 330 non-synonymous changes (7.4% of all codons). The accumulation of both point mutations and non-synonymous amino acid changes occurred at constant rates ( = 14.4 and 2.4 new mutations/year, respectively), and mutations accumulated uniformly across the entire influenza genome. We observed a continuous erosion over time of codon-specificity in H1N1, including a shift away from host (human, swine, and bird [duck]) codon preference patterns. CONCLUSIONS: While there have been numerous adaptations within the H1N1 genome, most of the genetic changes we document here appear to be non-adaptive, and much of the change appears to be degenerative. We suggest H1N1 has been undergoing natural genetic attenuation, and that significant attenuation may even occur during a single pandemic. This process may play a role in natural pandemic cessation and has apparently contributed to the exponential decline in mortality rates over time, as seen in all major human influenza strains. These findings may be relevant to the development of strategies for managing influenza pandemics and strain evolution.","output":"A new look at an old virus: patterns of mutation accumulation in the human H1N1 influenza virus since 1918"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pregnant women are one of the most important groups who need special attention during this Covid-19 pandemic.

METHODS Eleven fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were loaded to 1000 N of axial load at 0, 30, 60, and 90 of flexion with use of a custom testing apparatus attached to a materials testing machine. Tibiofemoral translations and internal-external and varus-valgus rotations were unconstrained. The knees were tested under four conditions: intact, medial meniscal tear, repaired meniscal tear, and total medial meniscectomy. Radial split tears were created in six knees, and vertical tears were created in five knees. Pressure-sensitive film was used to measure tibiofemoral contact pressure and area. RESULTS Radial split tears of the medial meniscus did not cause significant changes in tibiofemoral joint contact pressure and area. Vertical tears of the medial meniscus caused increases in tibiofemoral joint contact pressure and reductions in contact area in the medial and lateral compartments that were not significantly different from those associated with total medial meniscectomy. The exception was at 90, where the lateral compartment pressure associated with the vertical tear of the medial meniscus was higher than that associated with total medial meniscectomy. In general, after repair of the vertical tear, contact pressure and area values were similar to those in the intact condition. CONCLUSIONS Radial split tears of the medial meniscus that extend from the inner rim to the peripheral third of the meniscus do not cause significant changes in joint contact area and pressure.

This systematic review of the literature aims to identify the evidence basis for using telemedicine in otolaryngology practice to limit person-to-person interactions while achieving comparable quality to in-person services. METHODS: The authors gathered articles from three databases (Embase, PubMed and Web of Science), performed a comprehensive literature review of articles published on telemedicine since 2002, and selected articles for inclusion based on their relevance to otolaryngology and the potential of the intervention to improve patient social distancing. RESULTS: A total of 7153 articles were identified from the initial query. After review, 35 met the inclusion criteria.

Fifteen patients were hospitalized, including 7 asymptomatic patients. Nine patients (including 5 with no symptoms) were given hydroxychloroquine, and 3 of them were also given lopinavir/ritonavir. Among the 26 patients on chemotherapy/immunotherapy, the treatment was suspended in 16 cases for a median of 26 days (range, 15C68 days), whereas 8 patients continued their chemotherapy and 2 had minor modifications to their treatment regimen. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to take a milder clinical course in children than in adults with cancer. Specific SARS-CoV-2 treatment seems unnecessary for most children. In light of our findings, and albeit with the necessary caution, we suggest avoiding major changes to planned anticancer treatments in pediatric patients acquiring COVID-19.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Italian Pediatric Oncology Patients: A Study From the Infectious Diseases Working Group of the Associazione Italiana di Oncologia e Ematologia Pediatrica"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper is to explore these effects and the role that I-O psychology could play in enhancing the quality of life of PWDs in the workplace during this period of crisis According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2016), one in four adults has a disability The stay-at-home orders and other physical isolation strategies, although critically important to saving lives, can have significant negative effects on the mental health of people with such disabilities Crisis is not new to this population, as has been illustrated in our study [ ]they may have developed strengths that could give them the ability to successfully navigate through and overcome continuous challenges through the lifetime of a pandemic","output":"Making pandemic response disability inclusive: Challenges and opportunities for organizations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is also known as acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) is a transmissible disease, has phenotypes varying from asymptomatic to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and ultimately death in certain cases.

The corona pandemic is a phase of uncertainty that is accompanied by the need for action and decision-making. To cope with uncertainties and prepare for decision-making interpersonal communication and information-seeking behavior play an important role. Depending on situational factors, individuals prefer certain sources to others and, for example, place more weight on interpersonal exchange instead of seeking information using media channels. This paper aims to identify different types of interpersonal communication and media information seeking about the Corona pandemic. Based on 21 semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed by qualitative content analysis, six content-related and two strategy-related types of interpersonal communication and information-seeking behavior using media channels were identified. The focus of the identified types of interpersonal communication was on coping with emotions and on exchanging experiences or information as types of social support and was further characterized by different degrees of openness to the topic. In contrast, the types of information-seeking behaviors using media channels were characterized by concrete fields of interest and by strategies of both active, targeted seeking, and passive forms of scanning. The findings illustrate that the early phase of the pandemic revealed a high need for information and a comprehensive, also selective, and critical reception of media content, whereas interpersonal communication was characterized by emotional and informational support.","output":"Typen des interpersonalen und medialen Kommunikations- und Informationshandelns w?hrend der Corona-Pandemie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents data on Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related learning, health, and mental health concerns of 134 families of children with heart disease (HD), the most common birth defect, who are followed by a unique hospital-based Educational Achievement Partnership Program (EAPP) designed to serve as a liaison across the family, the child's medical team, and school. At-school, remote, and hybrid learning alternatives prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic presented families with an especially complex decision to make for children with HD due to competing complications in this population: Increased susceptibility to illness, greater risk of neuropsychological problems, and higher level of individualized education services that are not readily transferable to a home learning platform. Parents of school-aged children with HD completed a survey about COVID-19-related school support needs as part of a quality improvement project.

The neural network takes a sequence of production tasks as inputs to predict a distribution over different schedules, employs reinforcement learning to optimize network parameters using the negative total tardiness as the reward signal, and finally produces a high-quality solution to the scheduling problem. We applied the proposed approach to schedule emergency production tasks for a medical mask manufacturer during the peak of COVID-19 in China. Computational results show that the neural network scheduler can solve problem instances with hundreds of tasks within seconds.

Upon the appearance of clinical signs, a cure for the infected animal is impossible. Therefore rapid and proper diagnosis for both the presence of the causative agent, feline coronavirus (FCoV) and the manifestation of feline infectious peritonitis is of paramount importance. In the present work, a novel real-time RT-PCR method is described which is able to detect FCoV and to determine simultaneously the quantity of the viral RNA. The new assay combines the M gene subgenomic messenger RNA (sg-mRNA) detection and the quantitation of the genome copies of FCoV. In order to detect the broadest spectrum of potential FCoV variants and to achieve the most accurate results in the detection ability the new assay is applying the primer-probe energy transfer (PriProET) principle. This technology was chosen since PriProET is very robust to tolerate the nucleotide substitutions in the target area. Therefore, this technology provides a very broad-range system, which is able to detect simultaneously many variants of the virus(es) even if the target genomic regions show large scale of variations. The detection specificity of the new assay was proven by positive amplification from a set of nine different FCoV strains and negative from the tested non-coronaviral targets. Examination of faecal samples of healthy young cats, organ samples of perished animals, which suffered from feline infectious peritonitis, and cat leukocytes from uncertain clinical cases were also subjected to the assay. The sensitivity of the P-sg-QPCR method was high, since as few as 10 genome copies of FCoV were detected. The quantitative sg-mRNA detection method revealed more than 10C50,000 times increase of the M gene sg-mRNA in organ materials of feline infectious peritonitis cases, compared to those of the enteric FCoV variants present in the faeces of normal, healthy cats.

There is no determined origin to any animal or plant species, simply an evolutionary and selective process in which chance and environment play a key role. The very same is true for viruses. There is no determined origin to viruses, simply also an evolutionary and selective process in which chance and environment play a key role. However, in the case of viruses the process is slightly more complex because the environment is another living organism. Pandemic viruses already circulate in humans prior to the emergence of a disease. They are simply not capable of triggering an epidemic yet. They must evolve in-host, i.e. in-humans, for that.

The current study employs state of art computational methods to design novel molecules by linking molecular fragments which specifically bind to different constituent sub-pockets of the SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro) binding site. A huge library of 191678 fragments was screened against the binding cavity of SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro) and high affinity fragments binding to adjacent sub-pockets were tailored to generate new molecules. These newly formed molecules were further subjected to molecular docking, ADMET filters and MM-GBSA binding energy calculations to select 17 best molecules (named as MP-In1 to MP-In17), which showed comparable binding affinities and interactions with the key binding site residues as the reference ligand. The complexes of these 17 molecules and the reference molecule with SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro), were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations, which assessed the stabilities of their binding with SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro).

Here, we reveal a role for NF-B in human lung cell expression of ACE2, and we further explore the potential utility of repurposing NF-B inhibitors to downregulate ACE2. MAIN METHODS: Expression of ACE2 was assessed by Western blotting and RT-qPCR in multiple human lung cell lines with or without NF-B inhibitor treatment. Surface ACE2 expression and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured with flow cytometry. p50 was knocked down with siRNA. Cytotoxicity was monitored by PARP cleavage and MTS assay. KEY FINDINGS: Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-B inhibitor, suppressed endogenous ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in H322M and Calu-3 cells. The ROS level in H322M cells was increased after PDTC treatment, and pretreatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reversed PDTC-induced ACE2 suppression. Meanwhile, treatment with hydrogen peroxide augmented ACE2 suppression in H322M cells with p50 knockdown. Two repurposed NF-B inhibitors, the anthelmintic drug triclabendazole and the antiprotozoal drug emetine, also reduced ACE2 mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, zinc supplementation augmented the suppressive effects of triclabendazole and emetine on ACE2 expression in H322M and Calu-3 cells. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that ACE2 expression is modulated by ROS and NF-B signaling in human lung cells, and the combination of zinc with triclabendazole or emetine shows promise for clinical treatment of ACE2-related disease.","output":"Zinc supplementation augments the suppressive effects of repurposed NF-B inhibitors on ACE2 expression in human lung cell lines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biomedical named entity recognition from clinical texts is a fundamental task for clinical data analysis due to the availability of large volume of electronic medical record data, which are mostly in free text format, in real-world clinical settings. Clinical text data incorporates significant phenotypic medical entities, which could be used for profiling the clinical characteristics of patients in specific disease conditions. However, general approaches mostly rely on the coarse-grained annotations (e.g. mentions of symptom terms) of phenotypic entities in benchmark text dataset. Owing to the numerous negation expressions of phenotypic entities (e.g. 'no fever', 'no cough' and 'no hypertension') in clinical texts, this could not feed the subsequent data analysis process with well-prepared structured clinical data. Thus, we constructed a fine-grained Chinese clinical corpus. Thereafter, we proposed a phenotypic named entity recognizer (Phenonizer). The results on the test set show that Phenonizer outperform those methods based on Word2Vec with Fl-score of 0.896. By comparing character embeddings from different data, it is found that character embeddings trained by clinical corpora can improve F-score by 0.0103. Furthermore, the fine-grained dataset enables methods to distinguish between negated symptoms and presented symptoms, and avoids the interference of negated symptoms. Finally, we tested the generalization performance of Phenonier, achieving a superior F1-score of 0.8389.

In December 2018, CPX-351 (Vyxeos ? Liposomal) received a positive reimbursement decision in England for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. The objective of this retrospective study was to utilize the Cancer Analysis System (CAS) database available through the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS) to describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment pathways for patients with t-AML or AML-MRC in England from 2013 to 2020, including the use of CPX-351. Methods: The NCRAS systematically collects and curates population-level data about cancer diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes across England. Adults (aged 18 years) diagnosed with t-AML or AML-MRC between January 2013 and March 2020 were identified either directly using International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition(ICD-O-3) codes or indirectly using non-specific ICD-O-2, ICD-O-3, or ICD-10 AML codes in combination with a record of prior systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy (t-AML) or a prior diagnosis of MDS or CMML (AML-MRC;other AML-MRC subtypes could not be distinguished from de novo AML). First-line and second-line treatments identified included clinical trials, intensive chemotherapy (IC) treatments (CPX-351;daunorubicin plus cytarabine [DA];fludarabine, cytarabine, idarubicin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [FLAG-Ida];or other IC consisting of mitoxantrone-based therapy or high-dose cytarabine alone), or less-intensive therapies (azacitidine, low-dose cytarabine [LDAC], or hydroxycarbamide alone). Patients who did not receive active systemic therapy (ie, those who received best supportive care alone) were not included. Results: A total of 2,891 patients with t-AML or AML-MRC were identified. Most patients were male (62%), white (91%), and aged 60 years (80%). Overall, 590 (20%) patients received first-line treatment in a clinical trial, 1,474 (51%) received less-intensive therapy, and 827 (29%) received an IC regimen. Patients aged 60 years at diagnosis were less likely than those aged <60 years to either enter a clinical trial (18% vs 32%, respectively) or receive IC (22% vs 54%). In patients treated with IC, those who received CPX-351 were slightly older (mean [standard deviation] age: 63.9 years [8.3]) than those who received DA (60.5 years [11.4]) or FLAG-Ida (55.6 years [12.6]);28% of patients treated with CPX-351 were aged <60 years compared to 37% for DA and 55% for FLAG-Ida. When treatment patterns were analyzed per annum, utilization of less-intensive therapies remained stable over time (Figure 1A). Azacitidine was the most common less-intensive therapy both overall (64%) and across all yearly time points, followed overall by LDAC (22%) then hydroxycarbamide alone (14%). In contrast, the IC treatment patterns were more dynamic over time (Figure 1B). DA chemotherapy was the most common IC overall (48%), followed by FLAG-Ida (23%) and other ICs (18%). However, CPX-351 uptake started in 2018 (5% of all IC) and by the end of 2019 had displaced DA chemotherapy as standard-of-care IC (40% vs 22%, respectively). Excluding patients who were alive but had not received subsequent therapy (ie, censored), most patients who received front-line azacitidine or LDAC died without receiving salvage therapy (89% and 92%, respectively). In comparison, non-censored patients who received front-line DA chemotherapy or FLAG-Ida were more likely to receive salvage treatment (52% and 34%, respectively). Key salvage treatments following DA included azacitidine alone and FLAG-based therapy. Key salvage treatments following front-line CPX-351 included FLAG-Ida or DA  hematopoietic cell transplant and azacitidine. Conclusions: This large population-level, retrospective analysis of CAS data provides a detailed overview of the management of patients with t-AML and AML-MRC. Historically a high proportion of these high-risk patients have received less-intensive treatment. Since 2018, CPX-351 has been rapidly adopted into the IC treatment pathway, displacing DA chemotherapy. These analyses will be repeated after the CAS database has been updated to determine the impact of COVID-19.

METHODS We conducted a prospective birth cohort study of healthy term newborns, born after uncomplicated pregnancy. Amniotic fluid was collected during labor. In case of medical attention for respiratory symptoms during the first year of life, a nose-throat swab was taken to establish the presence of respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Physician-attended RSV infection was observed in 27 (9.3%) of 292 children at median age 6 months. Amniotic fluid concentrations of IL-8 were higher in children without physician-attended RSV infection than in children with physician-attended RSV infection (11.1 versus 5.5 ng/mL; P = 0.002). Similarly, in children without physician-attended RSV, the proportion of detectable amniotic fluid tumor necrosis factor- was higher (159/265 [60%] versus 8/27 [30%]; P = 0.002).

Nonetheless, we continue to see children and adolescents with HIVAN all over the world. Furthermore, once HIVAN is established in children, it is difficult to revert its long-term progression, and we need better animal models of childhood HIVAN to test new treatments. Objectives To define whether the HIV-1 trans-activator (Tat) gene precipitates HIVAN in young mice, and to develop an inducible mouse model of childhood HIVAN. Design/Methods An HIV-Tat gene cloned from a child with HIVAN was used to generate recombinant adenoviral vectors (rAd-Tat). rAd-Tat and LacZ control vectors (2  109) were expressed in the kidney of newborn wild type and HIV-transgenic (Tg26) FVB/N mice without significant proteinuria (n = 5 - 8 per group). Mice were sacrificed 7 and 35 days later to assess their renal outcome, the expression of HIV-genes and growth factors, and markers of cell growth and differentiation by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and/or Western blots. Results HIV-Tat induced the expression of HIV-1 genes (env) and heparin binding growth factors in the kidney of HIV-Tg26 mice, and precipitated HIVAN in the first month of life. No significant renal changes were detected in wild type mice infected with rAd-Tat vectors, suggesting that HIV-Tat alone does not induce renal disease. Conclusion This new mouse model of childhood HIVAN highlights the critical role that HIV-Tat plays in the pathogenesis of HIVAN, and could be used to study the pathogenesis and treatment of HIVAN in children and adolescents.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has taken humanity off guard. Following an outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002, and MERS-CoV about 10 years later, SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus in less than 20 years to cross the species barrier and start spreading by human-to-human transmission. It is the most infectious of the three, currently causing the COVID-19 pandemic. No treatment has been approved for COVID-19. We previously proposed targets that can serve as binding sites for antiviral drugs for multiple coronaviruses, and here we set out to find current drugs that can be repurposed as COVID-19 therapeutics. AIM. To identify drugs against COVID-19, we performed an in silico virtual screen with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a critical enzyme for coronavirus replication. METHODOLOGY. Initially, no RdRP structure of SARS-CoV-2 was available. We performed basic sequence and structural analysis to determine if RdRP from SARS-CoV was a suitable replacement. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to generate multiple starting conformations that were used for the in silico virtual screen. During this work, a structure of RdRP from SARS-CoV-2 became available and was also included in the in silico virtual screen. RESULTS. The virtual screen identified several drugs predicted to bind in the conserved RNA tunnel of RdRP, where many of the proposed targets were located. Among these candidates, quinupristin is particularly interesting because it is expected to bind across the RNA tunnel, blocking access from both sides and suggesting that it has the potential to arrest viral replication by preventing viral RNA synthesis. Quinupristin is an antibiotic that has been in clinical use for two decades and is known to cause relatively minor side effects. CONCLUSION. Quinupristin represents a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic. At present, we have no evidence that this drug is effective against SARS-CoV-2 but expect that the biomedical community will expeditiously follow up on our in silico findings.","output":"Potential RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors as prospective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the impact of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) outbreak on prices of maize, sorghum, imported rice and local rice in sub\\\\Saharan Africa (SSA).

Because of the specific training that CC RNs receive, the ability to identify and redeploy registered nurses (RNs) with prior critical care (CC) experience is important knowledge for organizational leaders and policymakers during these times of acute need. Using life course theory, we used state nurse licensure data to identify the specialty areas that CC RNs transition into, the prevalence of transitions, and predictors of transition.Study DesignThis was a secondary analysis of longitudinal RN state licensure data from 2001 to 2013. The annual records of all active licenses were combined and linked to follow individual RNs over time (n = 129,058). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to examine the CC RN workforce and identify predictors of CC RN transitions in the first year they reported their primary employment to be in non\\\\CC or missing specialty areas.Population StudiedThe sample consisted of unique RNs in NC who identified CC as their primary employment specialty in any of the study years (n = 12,969). To allow enough time for a CC RN transition to occur, a CC RN sub\\\\sample was constructed of RNs (n = 8408) whose first years observed in CC were between 2001 and 2008.Principal FindingsThe CC RN workforce represented 6C7% of all licensed, actively practicing RNs in NC each year, was the third most frequently reported RN specialty area, and increased in numbers annually. In this 13\\\\year period, more than a third of CC RNs were observed to transition to another specialty area and nearly a quarter became inactive or non\\\\licensed.Those CC RNs who transitioned out of CC remained primarily in acute care\\\\related specialty areas, such as emergency, peri\\\\operative care, and cardiology. CC RNs who made transitions primarily reported working in hospital inpatient settings and urban areas, ranged in age between 30C39, and had a mean of 8.1 years of RN experience and 3.4 years of CC experience.Higher education and rural employment increased the likelihood of CC RNs making transitions out of CC. RNs with masters or doctoral degrees were almost twice as likely to have made specialty transitions than those with bachelors degrees (OR = 1.80;p = 0.006). Being employed in a rural area increased CC RNs' likelihood of making specialty transitions by 1.24 times (p = 0.010). Male CC RNs were less likely to have made a specialty transition than females (OR = 0.76;p < 0.001).ConclusionsFindings indicate that CC RNs are quite mobile within and out of the RN workforce. CC RNs transition into specialty areas that are similarly related to CC. Education and employment location influence RNs' transitions.Implications for Policy or PracticeIt is imperative to consider how highly prepared and skilled segments of the RN workforce can be identified and incentivized to transition into needed areas of healthcare and meet changing care demands.

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its NSP6 and Orf9c proteins to interact with sigma receptors that are implicated in lipid remodeling and ER stress response, to infect cells. The drugs targeting the sigma receptors, sigma-1 and sigma-2, have emerged as effective candidates to reduce viral infectivity, and some of them are in clinical trials against COVID-19. The antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, exerts remarkable antiviral activity, but, at the same time, the sigma-1 benzomorphan agonist, dextromethorphan, showed pro-viral activity. To explore the potential mechanisms of biased binding and activity of the two drugs, haloperidol and dextromethorphan towards NSP6, we herein utilized molecular dockingCbased molecular dynamics simulation studies. Our extensive analysis of the protein-drug interactions, structural and conformational dynamics, residual frustrations, and molecular switches of NSP6-drug complexes indicates that dextromethorphan binding leads to structural destabilization and increase in conformational dynamics and energetic frustrations. On the other hand, the strong binding of haloperidol leads to minimal structural and dynamical perturbations to NSP6. Thus, the structural insights of stronger binding affinity and favorable molecular interactions of haloperidol towards viral NSP6 suggests that haloperidol can be potentially explored as a candidate drug against COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: ?Inhibitors of sigma receptors are considered as potent drugs against COVID-19. ?Antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, binds strongly to NSP6 and induces the minimal changes in structure and dynamics of NSP6. ?Dextromethorphan, agonist of sigma receptors, binding leads to overall destabilization of NSP6. ?These two drugs bind with NSP6 differently and also induce differences in the structural and conformational changes that explain their different mechanisms of action. ?Haloperidol can be explored as a candidate drug against COVID-19.

Humans are the only primate species known to be infected with two distinct herpes simplex viruses: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Human herpes simplex viruses are ubiquitous, with over two-thirds of the human population infected by at least one virus. Here, we investigated whether the additional human simplex virus is the result of ancient viral lineage duplication or cross-species transmission. We found that standard phylogenetic models of nucleotide substitution are inadequate for distinguishing among these competing hypotheses; the extent of synonymous substitutions causes a substantial underestimation of the lengths of some of the branches in the phylogeny, consistent with observations in other viruses (e.g., avian influenza, Ebola, and coronaviruses). To more accurately estimate ancient viral divergence times, we applied a branch-site random effects likelihood model of molecular evolution that allows the strength of natural selection to vary across both the viral phylogeny and the gene alignment. This selection-informed model favored a scenario in which HSV-1 is the result of ancient codivergence and HSV-2 arose from a cross-species transmission event from the ancestor of modern chimpanzees to an extinct Homo precursor of modern humans, around 1.6 Ma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was constructed using Google Forms. The link was distributed to consultant upper gastrointestinal surgeons via the Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons' membership database. Results were collated and analysed using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: A total of 55 responses were received from 28 units across the UK; 27 respondents (49.1%) no longer routinely use feeding jejunostomy in upper gastrointestinal resections, oesophagectomy or gastrectomy. The most common primary feeding modality used by these respondents was oral diet 17 (65.4%), with total parenteral nutrition (19.2%) and nasojejunal (11.5%) routes also being used. Respondents who used feeding jejunostomies inserted them primarily for oesophagectomy (n = 27; 96.4%), with fewer surgeons using them in extended total gastrectomy (n = 12; 42.9%) and total gastrectomy (n = 11; 39.3%).

Control group consisted of patients with new fractures admitted to the hospital in the same date range in 2018 and 2019. The patients were divided into two groups as 16 years old (group 1) and >16 years old (group 2). The evaluation was based on the age and gender of the patients and localization of the fractures. Hospitalized and surgically treated patients were evaluated as well. RESULTS A total of 1794, 1747, and 670 fractures were observed in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Mean age of the patients in group 1 was found to have decreased in the pandemic period (p<0.001). The most common fracture sites in the pediatric population were the distal forearm and distal arm, whereas hand, distal forearm, and foot were most common fracture sites in adults, in both pandemic and non-pandemic periods. The proportional increase in femoral and tibial shaft fractures in group 1, and toe, tibial shaft, and metacarpal fractures in group 2 was found to be statistically significantly (p<0.05).

These teenagers have been shown to have significantly worse health outcomes than their cisgender peers. Hypotheses to explain this discrepancy are based on increased stress levels surrounding the societal acceptance of gender identity. In this context, elevated allostatic load (AL), which describes the wear and tear sustained by the body in response to repeated exposure to stress, has been associated with adverse long-term health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to measure AL among TGE adolescents compared with their cisgender peers and assess how AL varies depending on psychological stress and perceived societal acceptance. METHODS: This is an observational proof-of-concept pilot study in which AL will be measured by assaying an array of inflammatory cytokines and cortisol in urine, saliva, and hair samples of TGE youth, and these parameters will be compared with those of age-matched control participants. A questionnaire will assess 4 aspects of psychosocial well-being: presence and management of depression and anxiety, gender identity support by family members, gender minority stress, and degree of perceived safety in the surrounding community. Samples and surveys will be collected at 3 visits (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months). This study will incorporate TGE coinvestigators to inform all aspects of design, data collection, and analysis and ensure that practices are carried out in a respectful and sensitive manner. RESULTS: As of May 2021, the start of data collection for this project has continued to be postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has both impacted the functioning of the clinic and funding requests. We hope to begin participant recruitment and interviews with coinvestigators soon. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that AL will be primarily influenced by psychological well-being and perceived support and that it will be similar in TGE adolescents and in age-matched cisgender control participants when acceptance and perceived support are high.

While the analogous event in China appears to be under control at the moment, the outbreaks in western countries are still at an early stage of development. Italy, at present, is playing a major role in understanding the transmission dynamics of these new infections and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures in a western social context. METHODS We combined a quarantined model with early-stage development data in Italy (during the period February 20th-March 30th) to predict longer-term progression (from March 30th, till June 25th, 2020 in a long-term view) with different control measures. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies leading to faster confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, we made use of time-dependent contact and diagnosis rates to estimate when the effective daily reproduction ratio can fall below 1. Within the same framework, we analyze the possible secondary infection event after relaxing the isolation measures. OUTCOMES AND INTERPRETATION We study two simplified scenarios compatible with the observation data and the effects of two stringent measures on the evolution of the epidemic. On one side, the contact rate must be kept as low as possible, but it is also clear that, in a modern developed country, it cannot fall under certain minimum levels and for a long time. The complementary parameter tuned is the transition rate of the symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined class, a parameter [Formula: see text] I connected with the time t I = 1/I [Formula: see text] needed to perform diagnostic tests. Within the conditions of the outbreak in Italy, this time must fall under 12-8 h in order to make the reproduction number less than 1 to minimize the case numbers. Moreover, we show how the same parameter plays an even more important role in mitigating the effects of a possible secondary infection event.","output":"A study of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in Italy: from early days to secondary effects after social distancing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atmospheric NO(2) is of great concern due to its adverse effects on human health and the environment, motivating research on NO(2) detection and remediation.

Here, we report an atomically dispersed metal ion strategy to address it. We discover that bimetallic PbCdSe quantum dot (QD) gels containing atomically dispersed Pb ionic sites achieve the optimal combination of strong sensor response and fast recovery, leading to a high-performance room-temperature p-type semiconductor NO(2) sensor as characterized by a combination of ultraClow limit of detection, high sensitivity and stability, fast response and recovery. With the help of theoretical calculations, we reveal the high performance of the PbCdSe QD gel arises from the unique tuning effects of Pb ionic sites on NO(2) binding at their neighboring Cd sites.","output":"Atomically dispersed Pb ionic sites in PbCdSe quantum dot gels enhance room-temperature NO(2) sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim: to observe the contribution of authors and the collaboration of institutes functioning in Saudi Arabia through the bibliometric review of literature in Coronaviruses.

Such journalism also shapes the publics view of the current state of scientific findings and legitimizes experts. Those covering science can only cite and quote a limited number of sources. Sources may be identified by the journalists research or by recommendations by other scientists. In both cases, biases may influence who is identified and ultimately included as an expert. We analyzed 22,001 non-research articles published by Nature to quantify possible disparities. Our analysis considered three possible sources of disparity: gender, name origin, and country affiliation. To explore these sources of disparity, we extracted cited authors names and affiliations, as well as extracted names of quoted speakers. While citations and quotations within a piece do not reflect the entire information-gathering process, they can provide insight into the demographics of visible sources. We then used the extracted names to predict gender and name origin of the cited authors and speakers. In order to appropriately quantify the level of difference, we must identify a suitable reference set for comparison. We chose first and last authors within primary research articles in Nature and a subset of Springer Nature articles in the same time period as our comparator. In our analysis, we found a skew towards male quotation in Nature journalism-related articles, but quotation is trending toward equal representation at a faster rate than first and last authorship in academic publishing. Interestingly, we found that the gender disparity in quotes was column-dependent, with the Career Features column reaching gender parity. Our name origin analysis found a significant over-representation of names with predicted Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with a predicted East Asian origin. This finding was observed both in extracted quotes and journal citations, but dampened in citations. Finally, we performed an analysis to identify how countries vary in the way that theyre described in scientific journalism. We focused on two groups of countries: countries that are often mentioned in articles, but do not often have affiliated authors cited, and countries that have affiliated authors that are often cited, but the country is not typically mentioned. We found that the articles in which the less cited countries occur tend to have more agricultural, extraction-related, and political terms, whereas articles including highly cited countries have broader scientific terms. This discrepancy indicates a possible lack of regional diversity in the reporting of scientific output.","output":"Analysis of scientific journalism in Nature reveals gender and regional disparities in coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:The gold standard for diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is reverse transcriptase real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using respiratory samples. Collection of oro- nasopharyngeal swab (OP/NP) requires a trained health care worker (HCW) and appropriate biosafety conditions. There is need for a simpler strategy for sample collection without compromising the sensitivity. Saliva sample can be collected without any intervention of HCW. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to evaluate efficacy of SARS -CoV-2 RT-PCR using self-collected saliva specimen. Methods:This pilot study was carried out at an ICMR approved molecular laboratory. The study population consisted of adults reporting to Flu OPD and hospitalized suspected COVID-19 cases. After obtaining consent, 3-5 ml of saliva was submitted in a universal sterile container by participants. Parallel (OP/NP) swab in viral transport medium (VTM) was also collected as per national guidelines. Both specimens were subjected to RNA extraction and SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR us- ing ICMR approved kit. Cycle threshold value of Envelope_Sarbeco gene (E), HKU Orf 1b gene (HKU) and Actin (Internal control) obtained for saliva and OP/NP swab were tabulated. Results:Saliva and OP/NP swab in parallel were collected from 85 individuals. The mean age of study population was 35.2 yr and 81% were male. The overall sensitivity and specificity of RT PCR on saliva sample was 95.6% and 92.5%. The concordance between E and HKU Ct value obtained by OP/NP and Saliva RT-PCR was 97.64% and 95.29%. The posi- tive and negative predictive value of the novel method was 93.5% and 94.9% respectively. Conclusions:Saliva collection requires lesser logistic requirement and saves VTM.

In patients with Type-2 mediated biology, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has a role in assessment and monitoring of adherence to inhaled corticosteroids. RECENT FINDINGS Asthmatic patients with elevated FeNO are at an increased risk of exacerbation. High FeNO is often secondary to suboptimal adherence to inhaled corticosteroid treatment, whether intentional or nonintentional. FENO-suppression can 'unmask' underlying adherence issues and is a useful test in the presence of Type-2 biology in the 'difficult-to-control' asthma population. Identification of nonadherence can improve asthma control and prevent inappropriate commencement of costly biologic therapies. SUMMARY Assessment of adherence and FeNO response to monitored inhaled corticosteroid in Type-2 biomarker high asthmatic individuals may prevent unnecessary escalation to biologic therapy. Establishing an 'optimised' FeNO may alert clinicians to the possibility of underlying nonadherence at future clinical assessments.","output":"Fractional exhaled nitric oxide and asthma treatment adherence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The objectives were to prepare, characterize and in vivo evaluate different ibuprofen (IBU) nanosuspensions prepared by ultra-homogenization, after oral administration to rabbits. METHODS The nanosuspensions produced by ultra-homogenization were tested and compared with a marketed IBU suspension for particle size, in vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption. Five groups of rabbits received orally 25 mg/kg of IBU nanosuspension, nanoparticles, unhomogenized suspension, marketed product and untreated suspension. A sixth group received 5 mg/kg IBU intravenously. Serial blood samples were obtained after IBU administration. RESULTS The formulated nanosuspensions showed significant decrease in particle size. Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone K30 (PP) was found to improve IBU aqueous solubility much better than the other tested polymers. Addition of Tween 80 (TW), in equal amount as PP (IBU: PP:TW, 1:2:2 w/w) resulted in much smaller particle size and better dissolution rate. The Cmax achieved were 14.81.64, 11.11.37, 9.010.761, 7.031.38 and 3.231.03 g/ml and the tmax were 368.2, 398.2, 10017.3, 11215 and 10517 min for the nanosuspension, nanoparticle, unhomogenized suspension, marketed IBU suspension and untreated IBU suspension in water, respectively. Bioavailability of the different formulations relative to the marketed suspension were the highest for nanosuspension> unhomogenized suspension> nanoparticles> untreated IBU suspension. CONCLUSION IBU/PP/TW nanosuspensions showed enhanced in vitro dissolution as well as faster rate and higher extent of absorption as indicated from the higher Cmax, shorter tmax and larger AUC. The in vivo data supported the in vitro results.

This trial investigated whether computer-assisted cryotherapy (CAC) is effective in reduction of pain and consumption of opioids in patients operated for TKA following an outpatient surgery pathway. METHODS Sixty patients scheduled for primary TKA were included in this prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial receiving CAC at 10-12 C (Cold-group, n = 30) or at 21 C (Warm-group, n = 30) during the first 7 days after TKA according to a fixed schedule. All patients received the same pre-, peri- and postoperative care with a multimodal pain protocol. Pain was assessed before and after every session of cryotherapy using the numerical rating scale for pain (NRS-pain). The consumption of opioids was strictly noted during the first 4 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes were knee swelling, visual hematoma and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs). These parameters were measured pre-, 1, 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS In both study groups, a reduction in NRS-pain after every CAC session were seen during the postoperative period of 7 days. A mean reduction of 0.9 and 0.7 on the NRS-pain was seen for respectively the Cold- (P = 0.008) and Warm-group (n.s.). A significant (P = 0.001) lower number of opioids were used by the Cold-group during the acute postoperative phase of 4 days, 47 and 83 tablets for respectively the Cold and Warm-group.

OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based estimates of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and projected cumulative numbers of severely ill pediatric COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the US 2020 pandemic. DESIGN: Empirical case projection study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted pediatric severity proportions and adjusted pediatric criticality proportions were derived from clinical and spatiotemporal modeling studies of the COVID-19 epidemic in China for the period January-February 2020. Estimates of total children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States through April 6, 2020, were calculated using US pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) cases and the adjusted pediatric criticality proportion. Projected numbers of severely and critically ill children with COVID-19 were derived by applying the adjusted severity and criticality proportions to US population data, under several scenarios of cumulative pediatric infection proportion (CPIP). RESULTS: By April 6, 2020, there were 74 children who had been reported admitted to PICUs in 19 states, reflecting an estimated 176 190 children nationwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 (52 381 infants and toddlers younger than 2 years, 42 857 children aged 2-11 years, and 80 952 children aged 12-17 years). Under a CPIP scenario of 5%, there would be 3.7 million children infected with SARS-CoV-2, 9907 severely ill children requiring hospitalization, and 1086 critically ill children requiring PICU admission. Under a CPIP scenario of 50%, 10 865 children would require PICU admission, 99 073 would require hospitalization for severe pneumonia, and 37.0 million would be infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Because there are 74.0 million children 0 to 17 years old in the United States, the projected numbers of severe cases could overextend available pediatric hospital care resources under several moderate CPIP scenarios for 2020 despite lower severity of COVID-19 in children than in adults.","output":"COVID-19 in Children in the United States: Intensive Care Admissions, Estimated Total Infected, and Projected Numbers of Severe Pediatric Cases in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Based on theoretical predictions from human capital theory, the aim of this exploratory study is to analyze the relationship between experimentally elicited, incentivized economic preference parameters, Big Five and Grit personality traits, cognitive ability, and the Alameda Seven lifestyles: smoking, drinking excessively, being overweight or obese, experiencing stress, following a healthy diet, exercising, and sleeping enough.

This article describes the results from a survey of geriatric mental health clinicians who used the COVID group manual to determine its acceptability and feasibility in these settings.Methods: Clinicians across three VA integrated care settings (home-based primary care, community living centers, and geriatric primary care) were surveyed about their experiences implementing this treatment (n = 21).Results: Clinicians found this intervention to be effective with their patients and useful and adaptable beyond the early pandemic period.Conclusions: This group teletherapy intervention was feasible and acceptable when treating Veterans in integrated geriatric healthcare settings. Despite technical challenges experienced by older Veterans, clinicians found this manual to be effective in addressing COVID-related worry and social isolation.Clinical Implications: This rapid response manual has remained clinically useful in geriatric mental health care settings beyond the initial weeks of the pandemic.","output":"Feasibility of a COVID-19 Rapid Response Telehealth Group Addressing Older Adult Worry and Social Isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Part of the role of the media is to report any issue affecting the society to the masses. Coronavirus has become an issue of transnational concern. The importance of the media in the coverage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nigeria and its implications among Nigerian populace cannot be overestimated. This study evaluates how Nigerian media depict the coronavirus pandemic and how the depictions shape people's perception and response to the pandemic. Methods: The study employed a quantitative design (newspaper content analysis and questionnaire). The content analysis examines the nature of media coverage of coronavirus in Nigeria and China using four major national newspapers (The Sun, The Vanguard, The Guardian and The Punch). The period of study ranged from January 2020 to March 2020. A total of 1070newspaper items on coronavirus outbreak were identified across the four newspapers and content-analysed. Results: The finding shows that the coverage of the pandemic was dominated by straight news reports accounting for 763 or (71.3%) of all analysed items. This was followed by opinions 169(15.8%), features 120 (11.2%) and editorials 18 (1.7%) respectively. The Punch 309 (28.9%)reported the outbreak more frequently than The Sun 266 (24.9%), The Guardian 258 (24.1%), and Vanguard 237 (22.1%). Finding further suggests that the framing pattern adopted by the newspapers helped Nigerians to take precautionary measures. Conclusion: Continuous reportage of COVID-19 has proved effective in creating awareness about safety and preventive measures thereby helping to 'flatten the curve' and contain the spread of the virus. However, the newspapers should avoid creating fear/panic in reporting the pandemic.","output":"Nigeria media framing of coronavirus pandemic and audience response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent with poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability. [...]the generation of new solid forms of NTZ is relevant to improve its unfavorable properties. Methods: NTZ-SAC mixtures were prepared by neat and liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) and characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), hot stage microscopy (HSM), X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), 13C Solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. Introduction Nitazoxanide [2-(acetyloxy)-N-(5-nitro-2-thiazolyl) benzamide, NTZ] (Figure 1) is a nitrothiazole derivative used in the treatment of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis in adults and children at least 12 months of age.1 NTZ is also active against numerous other parasitic pathogens and viruses, including Trypanosoma cruzi (the causative agent of American trypanosomiasis),2 Leishmania mexicana,2 the ulcer-causing pathogen Helicobacter pylori,3 multidrug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,1 as well as respiratory viruses, rotavirus, norovirus, coronavirus, hepatitis B and C, dengue-2, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and human immunodeficiency viruses.4 Moreover, NTZ has shown anticancer activity,4 and is a promising compound for the treatment of neuropathic pain,4 the Ebola virus disease4 and is also under investigation for potential use in COVID-19 treatment.5 Although NTZ is an agent with diverse pharmacological activities and minimal toxicity, it has unfavorable physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties, in particular very poor aqueous solubility6 and low bioavailability,4 and this provided the motivation for discovering new solid forms which may improve its solubility, dissolution rate, and bioavailability, and thus provide improved therapeutic options for patients. [...]NTZ has been in the focus of pharmaceutical research to discover and prepare alternative solid forms such as cyclodextrin complexes,7,8 solid dispersions,9 cocrystals10 and cocrystal alloys.11 Regarding NTZ cocrystals, it was found that it cocrystallized with five organic acids [succinic acid,10 glutaric acid,10 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid,10 p-aminobenzoic acid and p-aminosalicylic acid11], showing a common heterodimeric synthon formed between the carboxyl group of the acid coformer and the carboxamidine group of NTZ (Figure 1), namely the carboxyl-carboxamidine synthon.10,11 Pursuing our interest in discovering new solid forms of NTZ, the aim of this study was to determine if NTZ can be partnered with a non-carboxylic acid coformer such as saccharine (SAC, pKa = 2.212, Figure 1) which cannot form the above-mentioned carboxyl-carboxamidine synthon with NTZ, but is able to generate N-HO, S=OH-N, O-H-O and N-H-N hydrogen bonds with drugs possessing OH, NH or carbonyl groups12,13 such as NTZ, leading to cocrystals, salts or eutectics, with the last representing a whole new paradigm of noncovalent derivatives14 and technology at par with other crystal engineering techniques in improving clinically significant attributes of a drug14 such as solubility, stability, and bioavailability, as demonstrated for curcurmin,15 hesperetin,14 and leflunomide.16 In effect, depending upon various factors, during cocrystallization, an amalgamation of two complementary interacting materials lead to the formation of a specific product which can be any of the multicomponent organic adduct (solvate, molecular salt, eutectic or a cocrystal).16 The formation of either cocrystal or eutectic during cocrystallization is mutually exclusive and a win-win situation.16 According to Cherukuvada and Nangia,17 the materials with strong adhesive (hetero) interactions between the unlike components will lead to cocrystals whereas those having stronger cohesive (homo/self) interactions will more often give rise to solid solutions (for similar structures of components) and eutectics (for different structures of components).","output":"Mechanochemical Synthesis of A Novel Eutectic of the Antimicrobial Nitazoxanide with Improved Dissolution Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Next generation influenza vaccines that target conserved epitopes are becoming a clinical reality but still have challenges to overcome. Universal next generation vaccines are considered a vital tool to combat future pandemic viruses and have the potential to vastly improve long-term protection against seasonal influenza viruses. Key vaccine strategies include HA-stem and T cell activating vaccines; however, they could have unintended effects for virus adaptation as they recognise the virus after cell entry and do not directly block infection. This may lead to immune pressure on residual viruses. The potential for immune escape is already evident, for both the HA stem and T cell epitopes, and mosaic approaches for pre-emptive immune priming may be needed to circumvent key variants. Live attenuated influenza vaccines have not been immunogenic enough to boost T cells in adults with established prior immunity. Therefore, viral vectors or peptide approaches are key to harnessing T cell responses.

This studys objective was to determine associations between BE features and infectious disease incidence rates in remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory (NT), Australia. Remote Indigenous communities (n = 110) were spatially joined to 93 Indigenous Locations (ILOC). Outcomes data were extracted (NT Notifiable Diseases System) and expressed as ILOC-specific incidence rates. Counts of buildings were extracted from community asset maps and grouped by function. Age-adjusted infectious disease rates were dichotomised, and bivariate binomial regression used to determine the relationships between BE variables and infectious disease. Infrastructure Shelter BE features were universally associated with significantly elevated disease outcomes (relative risk 1.67 to 2.03). Significant associations were observed for Services, Arena, Community, Childcare, Oval, and Sports and recreation BE features. BE groupings associated with disease outcomes were those with communal and/or social design intent or use. Comparable BE groupings without this intent or use did not associate with disease outcomes. While discouraging use of communal BE features during infectious disease outbreaks is a conceptually valid countermeasure, communal activities have additional health benefits themselves, and infectious disease transmission could instead be reduced through repairs to infrastructure, and more infrastructure.

Thus, the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the vaccines in LTX recipients compared to controls. METHODS: An open-label, nonrandomized prospective study was conducted at Tohoku University Hospital. LTX recipients and controls who received either the BNT162b2 vaccine or the mRNA-1273 vaccine were recruited, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG was measured before and after vaccination. The adverse events were reviewed. Predictors of negative serology after vaccination were evaluated with logistic regression. RESULTS: Forty-one LTX recipients and 24 controls were analyzed. Although all controls had a positive antibody response to a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, antibody response was found in 24.4% of LTX recipients (p < .0001). The amount of SARS-CoV-2 IgG following the 2nd dose significantly climbed to 6557 AU/mL in controls, whereas the increase in IgG in LTX recipients was 8.3 AU/mL (p < .0001). Fewer LTX recipients developed systemic fever than controls (p < .0001) despite equivalent overall adverse event percentages in both groups. A higher plasma concentration of mycophenolate was a significant predictor of negative serology (p = .032). CONCLUSIONS: An impaired antibody response to mRNA vaccines was significantly found in LTX recipients compared to controls and was associated with the plasma concentration of mycophenolate. While repeating mRNA vaccination may be one of the strategies to improve antibody response given the safety of the vaccines, emerging data on humoral immune responses based on immunosuppression regimens in LTX recipients should be studied (jRCT1021210009).","output":"Efficacy and safety of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in lung transplant recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considerable attention has been recently given to possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via water media.

The methods for the determination of viable virus particles and quantification of CoVs and, in particular, of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater are discussed with particular regard to the methods of concentration and to the emerging methods of detection. The analysis of the environmental stability of CoVs, with particular regard of SARS-CoV-2, and the efficacy of the disinfection methods are extensively reviewed as well. This information provides a broad view of the state-of-the-art for researchers involved in the investigation of CoVs in aquatic systems, and poses the basis for further analyses and discussions on the risk associated to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in water media. The examined data indicates that detection of the virus in wastewater and natural water bodies provides a potentially powerful tool for quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) and for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for the evaluation of the level of circulation of the virus in a population. Assays of the viable virions in water media provide information on the integrity, capability of replication (in suitable host species) and on the potential infectivity.

The spike glycoprotein, S, which mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion, plays a critical role in MHV pathogenesis. However, viral proteins other than S also contribute to pathogenicity. The JHM strain of MHV is highly neurovirulent and expresses a second spike glycoprotein, the hemagglutinin esterase (HE), which is not produced by MHV-A59, a hepatotropic but only mildly neurovirulent strain. To investigate a possible role for HE in MHV-induced neurovirulence, isogenic recombinant MHV-A59 viruses were generated that produced either (i) the wild-type protein, (ii) an enzymatically inactive HE protein, or (iii) no HE at all (A. Lissenberg, M. M. Vrolijk, A. L. W. van Vliet, M. A. Langereis, J. D. F. de Groot-Mijnes, P. J. M. Rottier, and R. J. de Groot, J. Virol. 79:15054-15063, 2005 [accompanying paper]). A second, mirror set of recombinant viruses was constructed in which, in addition, the MHV-A59 S gene had been replaced with that from MHV-JHM. The expression of HE in combination with A59 S did not affect the tropism, pathogenicity, or spread of the virus in vivo. However, in combination with JHM S, the expression of HE, regardless of whether it retained esterase activity or not, resulted in increased viral spread within the central nervous system and in increased neurovirulence. Our findings suggest that the properties of S receptor utilization and/or fusogenicity mainly determine organ and host cell tropism but that HE enhances the efficiency of infection and promotes viral dissemination, at least in some tissues, presumably by serving as a second receptor-binding protein.","output":"Expression of hemagglutinin esterase protein from recombinant mouse hepatitis virus enhances neurovirulence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We isolated a replication-competent, neurotropic retrovirus (FrC6 virus) and its molecular clone A8 from the NB-tropic Friend murine leukemia virus (FLV) complex.

Animals were randomized into three groups based on treatment delivered 24-48 hours after hepatectomy: Group1-standard medical therapy (SMT, n = 6); Group2-SMT plus bio-artificial liver treatment using no hepatocytes (0 g, n = 6); and Group3-SMT plus SRBAL treatment using 200 g of primary porcine hepatocyte spheroids (200 g, n = 6). The primary endpoint was survival to 90 hours following hepatectomy. Death equivalent was defined as unresponsive grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy or ICP greater than 20 mmHg with clinical evidence of brain herniation. All animals in both (SMT and 0 g) control groups met the death equivalent before 51 hours following hepatectomy. Five of 6 animals in the 200-g group survived to 90 hours (P < 0.01).

In a country like India, where women form nearly 50% of the population, the sheer volume of periodic menstrual non-biodegradable waste generated has significant environmental implications. With majority of the country hailing from low-middle class backgrounds, observing healthy menstrual hygiene practices with environmentally friendly products necessitates the consideration of affordable and highly sustainable alternatives. Further, during the COVID-19 pandemic, period poverty is higher than ever, causing women to turn to the reusable product market for affordable and long lasting alternatives. Hence, we studied the Feasibility and Acceptability (FA) of a novel banana fiber based menstrual pad (BFP) amongst women living in rural and urban environments. METHODS: The quantitative study of FA of the BFP was conducted amongst 155 rural and 216 urban participants in India. For greater authenticity of the FA study, we considered participants who used BFP for more than 4 months (Rural = 111 and Urban = 186) in the study. The survey data included responses from participants from Bihar, Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. A 22-item survey instrument was developed and validated using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and reliability test (Cronbacks [Formula: see text] ). Binomial logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the factors that affect the FA of BFP based on the survey responses. In addition to survey analysis, environmental sustainability through [Formula: see text] footprint analysis, microbial load, pH and the ability of the BFP to withstand pressure after absorption were also studied. RESULTS: The results indicated high levels of feasibility (rural [Formula: see text] , urban [Formula: see text] and acceptability (rural [Formula: see text] , urban [Formula: see text] ) of BFPs across both participant groups. Comparing key BFP characteristics such as leakage and comfort to participants prior practices revealed general satisfaction on the performance of BFP, leading to them recommending BFPs to others. User perception on the reasons for their preference of BFP highlighted their concern for environment, health and cost as decisive factors. The microbial load on a 3 year reused BFP was found to be similar to an unused BFP. Regression analysis showed cost as an important indicator for feasibility ([Formula: see text] ; 95% CI = 1.083C3.248) and acceptability ([Formula: see text] ; 95% CI = 1.203C3.748) amongst rural participants. CONCLUSION: Based on feasibility and acceptability results, BFP is a promising consideration as an environmentally sound, non-invasive; yet reusable alternative to fulfil MHM needs in populous countries such as India. Longer term studies in larger samples are necessary to validate these findings.

What constitutes older age is subjective and flexible, and how one defines older age is influenced by everchanging individual, generational, and cultural expectations. As the global population ages at an unprecedented rate, we are increasingly confronted with a myriad of challenges associated with aging, including increased healthcare needs and the far-reaching negative consequences of individual and structural agism. However, the shift in world demographics toward an older population is not a growing burden, but an opportunity to reshape our view of older life and proactively embrace healthy aging. Indeed, a healthy person is not defined by the absence of illness, but by the potential for meaningful work, positive relationships, and longevity. Simple preventive measures, such as improved diet and increased exercise, can enhance overall health and quality of life, and growing evidence highlights the potential of positive psychology for improving psychological well-being and overall quality of life. Now more than ever, technological innovation including artificial intelligence can be leveraged to improve our understanding of the causes and consequences of aging, as well as the most effective interventions to enhance resilience and extend healthy longevity. Good health is our greatest asset.

OBJECTIVE: This study used data collected from the online survey study on COVID-19 in Taiwan to examine what major COVID-19 information sources are available and which sources are significantly related to the self-confidence of people in coping with COVID-19 in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 1904 participants (1270 non-health-care workers and 634 health care workers) were recruited from the Facebook advertisement. Their major sources of information about COVID-19, the relationships between the sources and demographic factors, and the relationships between the sources and the self-confidence in coping with COVID-19 were surveyed. RESULTS: Most Taiwanese people relied on the internet for COVID-19 information. Many respondents also used a variety of sources of information on COVID-19; such variety was associated with sex, age, and the level of worry toward COVID-19, as well as if one was a health care worker. For health care workers, the use of formal lessons as an information source was significantly associated with better self-confidence in coping with COVID-19. The significant association between receiving information from more sources and greater self-confidence was found only in health care workers but not in non-health-care workers.

Yet, the impact of the enforcement and subsequent loosening of these policies on the spread of COVID-19 is not well understood. Accordingly, we measure the impact of NPI on mitigating disease spread by exploiting the spatio-temporal variations in policy measures across the 16 states of Germany. This quasi-experiment identifies each policy's effect on reducing disease spread. We adapt the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model for disease propagation to include data on daily confirmed cases, intra- and inter-state movement, and social distancing. By combining the model with measures of policy contributions on mobility reduction, we forecast scenarios for relaxing various types of NPIs. Our model finds that, in Germany, policies that mandated contact restrictions (e.g., movement in public space limited to two persons or people co-living), initial business closures (e.g., restaurant closures), stay-at-home orders (e.g., prohibition of non-essential trips), non-essential services (e.g., florists, museums) and retail outlet closures led to the sharpest drops in movement within and across states. Contact restrictions were the most effective at lowering infection rates, while border closures had only minimal effects at mitigating the spread of the disease, even though cross-border travel might have played a role in seeding the disease in the population. We believe that a deeper understanding of the policy effects on mitigating the spread of COVID-19 allows a more accurate forecast of the disease spread when NPIs are (partially) loosened, and thus also better informs policymakers towards making appropriate decisions.","output":"Restarting after COVID-19: A Data-driven Evaluation of Opening Scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research addresses a lack of evidence on the positive and negative health outcomes of competitive online gaming and esports, particularly among young people and adolescents Well-being outcomes, along with mitigation strategies were measured through a cross sectional survey of Australian gamers and non-gamers aged between 12 and 24 years, and parents of the 12-17-year-olds surveyed Adverse health consequences were associated with heavy gaming, more so than light/casual gaming, suggesting that interventions that target moderated engagement could be effective It provides timely insights in an online gaming landscape that has rapidly evolved over the past decade, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, to include the hyper-connected, highly commercialized and rapidly growing online gaming and esports sector","output":"The Pros and Cons of Online Competitive Gaming: An Evidence-Based Approach to Assessing Young Players' Well-Being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited data exist on antibody responses to mixed vaccination strategies involving inactivated COVID-19 vaccines, particularly in the context of emerging variants.

Resultados: Las estatinas se deben seguir utilizando en los pacientes con COVID-19 en base a su eficacia, seguridad, efectos inmunosupresores, antiinflamatorios disponibilidad y accesibilidad. En funcin de los niveles de riesgo cardiovascular de estos pacientes, puede ser necesario el empleo de estatinas de alta potencia y/o ezetimiba y/o inhibidores de la proprotena convertasa subtilisina (iPCSK9) en pacientes de alto y muy alto riesgo cardiovascular. Los pacientes tratados con iPCSK9 deben seguir con el tratamiento por sus efectos beneficiosos sobre la prevencin de la enfermedad cardiovascular. Los pacientes con hipercolesterolemia familiar y COVID-19 son especialmente vulnerables a la enfermedad cardiovascular precoz y deben seguir recibiendo el tratamiento hipolipemiante intensivo. Conclusiones: En los pacientes con COVID-19, la mayora de las enfermedades cardiovasculares basales son de origen aterosclertico, con peor pronstico para los pacientes con alto riesgo y muy alto riesgo de enfermedad cardiovascular.

Abstract Background and objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that cardiovascular diseases carry a higher risk of mortality. Doubts have been raised regarding lipid therapy in these patients. The objectives are to analyze the efficacy and safety of lipid lowering therapy in patients with COVID-19 Material and Methods: A review of the scientific literature was conducted in PubMed, CDC Reports, NIH, and NCBI SARS-CoV-2 using the keywords: COVID-2; statins; ezetimibe; PCSK9 inhibitors; hypercholesterolemia; and hypolipidemic drugs. Results: The stations should continue to use patients with COVID-19 based on their efficacy, safety, immunosuppressive effects, anti-inflammatory availability and accessibility. Depending on the cardiovascular risk levels of these patients, the use of high potency statins and / or ezetimibe and / or iPCSK9 may be necessary in patients with high and very high cardiovascular risk. Patients treated with iPCSK9 should continue treatment for its beneficial effects in preventing cardiovascular disease. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and COVID-19 are especially vulnerable to cardiovascular disease and should continue to receive severe lipid lowering therapy. Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19, the majority of baseline CVDs are of atherosclerotic origin, with the worst prediction for patients with high risk and very high risk of CVD.

Here, we applied integrated bioinformatics to identify potential key genes and cytokine pathways after RV infection in asthma, and analyzed changes in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor of SARS-COV-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS The gene expression profile dataset GSE149273 was downloaded from NCBI-GEO, which included 90 samples of non-infected, RVA, and RVC. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using t tests in the limma R package, and subsequently investigated by GO, KEGG, and DO analysis. Moreover, the expression of ACE2 and the proportion of immune cells were further analyzed to determine the effects of RV on cytokines. RESULTS A total of 555 DEGs of RVA and 421 of RVC were identified. There were 415 DEGs in RVA and RVC, of which 406 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. The functional enrichment analysis showed that most DEGs were obviously enriched in cytokines, and were mainly enriched in \\"influenza\\" and \\"hepatitis C, chronic\\". In addition, the expression of ACE2 increased significantly and the proportion of immune cytokines significantly changed after RV infection.

A number of drugs have been found to possess potent antimicrobial action during the past several years and have the potential to supplement or even replace the antibiotics. Many of these non-antibiotics, as they are referred to, belong to the widely used class of neuroleptics, the phenothiazines. Another chemically and pharmacologically related class is the thioxanthenes, differing in that the aromatic N of the central phenothiazine ring has been replaced by a C atom. Such carbon-analogues were primarily synthesized with the hope that these would be devoid of some of the toxic effects of phenothiazines. Intensive studies on syntheses, as well as chemical and pharmacological properties of thioxanthenes, were initiated in the late 1950s. Although a rather close parallelism with respect to structure activity relationships could be observed between phenothiazines and thioxanthenes; several thioxanthenes were synthesized in pharmaceutical industries and applied for human use as neuroleptics. Antibacterial activities of thioxanthenes came to be recognized in the early 1980s in Europe. During the following years, many of these drugs were found not only to be antibacterial agents but also to possess anti-mycobacterial, antiviral (including anti-HIV and anti-SARS-CoV-2) and anti-parasitic properties. Thus, this group of drugs, which has an inhibitory effect on the growth of a wide variety of microorganisms, needs to be explored for syntheses of novel antimicrobial agents.

Implementing either approach is straightforward. In addition to its analytical results the paper considers several policy contexts in which such considerations arise.

PEDV was identified as the isolated virus by cytopathology, immunofluorescence assay, western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, and sequence analysis. The full-length genome of the JS-A isolate and the S gene were systematically analyzed, indicating that PEDV JS-A belongs to the G2a subtype, which is closely related to the prevalent PEDV in many countries and different from many current vaccines. Animal regression tests showed that piglets that are orally infected with the virus continue to develop diarrhea with yellowish and unpleasant odors. Further, piglets showed reduced food consumption and weight loss in the challenged group, while there were no abnormalities in the control group. In addition, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I, and the downstream medium gene in the intestinal mucosa of newborn pigs infected with PEDV JS-A strain were studied. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) was the only IgG transport receptor and protected IgG from degradation. Therefore, PEDV JS-A infection might inhibit FcRn expression by down-regulating TLRs and downstream signaling molecules. Taken together, isolation of the JS-A variant contributes to evolutionary analysis of the diarrhea virus.

In particular, we study how the COVID-19 epidemics evolves and how it is contained by different vaccination scenarios by taking into account data showing that older people, as well as individuals with comorbidities and poor metabolic health, and people coming from economically depressed areas with lower quality of life in general, are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms, and quicker loss of immunity and are therefore more prone to reinfection. Our results reveal that the structure and the spatial arrangement of subpopulations are important epidemiological determinants. In a healthier society the disease spreads more rapidly but the consequences are less disastrous as in a society with more prevalent chronic comorbidities. If individuals with poor health are segregated within one community, the epidemic outcome is less favorable. Moreover, we show that, contrary to currently widely adopted vaccination policies, prioritizing elderly and other higher-risk groups is beneficial only if the supply of vaccine is high. If, however, the vaccination availability is limited, and if the demographic distribution across the social network is homogeneous, better epidemic outcomes are achieved if healthy people are vaccinated first. Only when higher-risk groups are segregated, like in elderly homes, their prioritization will lead to lower COVID-19 related deaths. Accordingly, young and healthy individuals should view vaccine uptake as not only protecting them, but perhaps even more so protecting the more vulnerable socio-demographic groups.","output":"Socio-demographic and health factors drive the epidemic progression and should guide vaccination strategies for best COVID-19 containment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work describes the reaction of triplet dioxygen with the porphyrinogenic calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates to alkylperoxido aluminates in high selectivity.

We find that the platform is more likely to provide a uniform (differential) pricing strategy with new products when the revenue sharing portion of the consignment contract is sufficiently low (high). Moreover, surprisingly, without blockchain, the platform prefers moderately perceived and true quality secondhand products, instead of extremely high or low quality. With blockchain, the platform prefers selling low-uniqueness and low-quality (or high-uniqueness and high-quality) secondhand products. Furthermore, we find that with blockchain, horizontal integration is more effective in improving the supply chains total profit.

To safeguard their operations against disruption in order quantities, supply chain members have been looking for alternate suppliers. This paper considers a two-level supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and two suppliers of a certain type of components required for the production of a finished product. The primary supplier (supplier A) is unreliable, in the sense that the quantity delivered is usually less than the ordered quantity. The proportion of the ordered quantity delivered by supplier A is a random variable with a known probability distribution. The secondary supplier (supplier B) always delivers the order in its entirety at a higher cost and can respond instantaneously. In order for supplier B to respond instantaneously, the manufacturer is required to reserve a certain quantity at an additional cost. Once the quantity received from the main supplier is observed, the manufacturer may place an order not exceeding the reserved quantity. Design/methodology/approach: A mathematical model describing the production/inventory situation of the supply chain is formulated. The model allows the determination of the manufacturer's optimal ordering policy. Findings: An expression for the expected total cost per unit time function is derived. The optimal solution is determined by solving a system of nonlinear equations obtained by minimizing the expected total cost function. Practical implications: The proposed model can be used by supply chain managers aiming at identifying various ways of handling the uncertainty in the flow of supplies across the chain. Originality/value: This proposed model addresses a gap in the production/inventory literature. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Inventory planning under supplier uncertainty in a two-level supply chain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study implements a computer-assisted content analysis to identify which social grooming factors reduce social media users' incivility when commenting or posting about the COVID-19 situation in South Korea.

However, the development of a new, effective, and safe vaccine or drug often requires years and poses great risks. At this critical stage, there is an advantage in using existing clinically approved drugs to treat COVID-19. In this study, in vitro severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike pseudotyped viral infection experiments indicated that histamine H(1) antagonists loratadine (LOR) and desloratadine (DES) could prevent entry of the pseudotyped virus into ACE2-overexpressing HEK293T cells and showed that DES was more effective. Further binding experiments using cell membrane chromatography and surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that both antagonists could bind to ACE2 and that the binding affinity of DES was much stronger than that of LOR. Molecular docking results elucidated that LOR and DES could bind to ACE2 on the interface of the SARS-CoV-2-binding area. Additionally, DES could form one hydrogen bond with LYS31 but LOR binding relied on non-hydrogen bonds. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of LOR and DES on SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus viropexis by blocking spike proteinCACE2 interaction.

Because of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, naloxone has limited utility under some conditions and would not be effective to counteract mass casualties involving large-scale deployment of weaponized synthetic opioids. To address shortcomings of current medical countermeasures for opioid toxicity, a trans-agency scientific meeting was convened by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/National Institutes of Health (NIAID/NIH) on August 6 and 7, 2019, to explore emerging alternative approaches for treating opioid overdose in the event of weaponization of synthetic opioids. The meeting was initiated by the Chemical Countermeasures Research Program (CCRP), was organized by NIAID, and was a collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse/NIH (NIDA/NIH), the FDA, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). This paper provides an overview of several presentations at that meeting that discussed emerging new approaches for treating opioid overdose, including the following: (1) intranasal nalmefene, a competitive, reversible opioid receptor antagonist with a longer duration of action than naloxone; (2) methocinnamox, a novel opioid receptor antagonist; (3) covalent naloxone nanoparticles; (4) serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor agonists; (5) fentanyl-binding cyclodextrin scaffolds; (6) detoxifying biomimetic \\"nanosponge\\" decoy receptors; and (7) antibody-based strategies.

In this study, we established a SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP) including an SP mutant D614G pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which is valuable information for the design of SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies. Also, based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris (CHPV) displayed potent inhibitory effects on both SCoV-2 SP (including SPG614 mutant) pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs) and SARS CoV SP-pseudotyped virus-mediated infections. Moreover, we have compared CHPV with another compound, Suramin, for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities and the mode of their actions, and found that both CHPV and Suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2CSP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, our results also revealed that CHPV and Suramin were able to efficiently inhibit the wild type SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) virus infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results also demonstrated that the combination of CHPV/Suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated a more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs.

This study aimed to evaluate radiomics features of the whole lung for predicting new coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) from different views, and to investigate new radiomics features. 75 patients were retrospectively enrolled from December 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Both lungs were segmented by an unsupervised hybrid image segmentation approach. Radiomics features of the transverse plane, coronal plane and sagittal plane were separately extracted. After utilizing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), three radiomics models based on key radiomics features were built by machine learning. Meanwhile, the different categories radiomics models were constructed by the particle swarm optimization-deep extreme learning machine(PSO-DELM). Predictive accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were evaluated performances of these radiomics models. Results: : Training and test cohorts had similar distributions of age and pneumonia type. 13 (transverse plane), 4 (coronal plane) and 8 (sagittal plane) selected features were constructed radiomics models in training cohort. Radiomics models based on PSO-DELM in the transverse plane, coronal plane and sagittal plane showed the favorable performance in the testing cohort(AUC=0.9444, 0.8636 and 0.9444, respectively). The phase congruency feature showed the stable predictive performance (AUC>0.9) among these radiomics features on the three different plane. Conclusions: : Multi-view whole lung radiomics features could effectively differentiate COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia.

Healthcare workers are a vulnerable cohort for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to frequent and close contact to patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Serum samples from 316 healthcare workers of the University Hospital Essen, Germany were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data. Healthcare workers were grouped depending on the frequency of contact to COVID-19 patients in high-risk-group (n = 244) with daily contact to known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, intermediated-risk-group (n = 37) with daily contact to patients without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission and low-risk-group (n = 35) without patient contact. RESULTS: In 5 of 316 (1.6 %) healthcare workers SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies could be detected. The seroprevalence was higher in the intermediate-risk-group vs. high-risk-group (2/37 (5.4 %) vs. 3/244 (1.2 %), p = 0.13). Four of the five subject were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR.

This study evaluated the impact of restrictions on in-person care on opioid prescribing in the outpatient setting. The hypothesis was that after restrictions to in-person care were implemented, there would be a reduction in the number of chronic and non-chronic opioid prescriptions. METHODS: An interrupted time series analysis was conducted to compare the number of weekly opioid prescriptions between baseline (1/1/2019-3/14/2020), restriction (3/15/2020-6/6/2020), and reopening (6/7/2020-10/31/2020) periods at outpatient practices within a health system in Bronx, NY. Analyses were stratified by prescription type (chronic if the patient had been prescribed opioids for >90 days, or non-chronic). RESULTS: For chronic opioid prescriptions, the week restrictions were implemented, there was an increase in the number of prescriptions compared to what was predicted if there had been no interruption (34.8 prescriptions, 95% CI: 8.0, 61.7). Subsequently, the weekly trend in prescribing was not different in the restriction period or in the reopening period compared to the previous time periods. For non-chronic opioid prescriptions, during the restriction period, the weekly trend in prescribing decreased compared to baseline (?5.0 prescriptions/week, 95% CI: ?9.0, ?1.0). Subsequently, during the reopening period, the weekly trend in prescribing increased compared to the restriction period (6.4 prescriptions/week, 95% CI: 2.2, 10.7). CONCLUSIONS: Despite abrupt restrictions on in-person care, chronic opioid prescriptions did not decrease, which is evidence that providers evolved to meet patient needs. Changes in non-chronic prescriptions are likely related to patients electing not to pursue care for acute pain or challenges with appointment availability.","output":"Changes in Outpatient Opioid Prescribing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Interrupted Time Series Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cool and dry gas insufflation during laparoscopy induces hypothermia and cytokine increase, with significant perioperative morbidity.

Sixty-four patients with prostate cancer undergoing RARP were randomized to receive warmed and humidified CO2 insufflation with HumiGard device, plus hot air warming blanket (treatment group, H + WB), or standard CO2 insufflation, plus hot air warming blanket (control group, WB). Body core temperature (BCT), plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-, pain scores, and intraoperative parameters were recorded. The data were analyzed according to the Bayesian paradigm. RESULTS: Intraoperative BCT increased in both groups during surgery, with a statistically significant difference favoring group H + WB, ending at 0.2C higher on average than group WB. No difference across groups was shown for cytokine levels. Blood gas parameters were not affected by warmed CO2 insufflation. No statistical differences were noted for pain scores and the other intra- and postoperative parameters. CONCLUSIONS: During RARP, warm and humidified CO2 insufflation with the HumiGard device was more effective than the standard CO2 insufflation in maintaining the patient's heat homeostasis, even if the difference was minimal. No imbalances were detected on blood gas analyses. No benefit could be shown in terms of cytokine levels and pain scores.","output":"The impact of warmed and humidified CO2 insufflation during robotic radical prostatectomy: Results of a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The characteristics and clinical course of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been widely described, while long-term data are still poor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcome and its association with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective multicenter study of consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized at seven Italian Hospitals from 28 February to 20 April 2020. The study population was divided into two groups according to echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction. The primary study outcome was 1-year mortality. The propensity score matching was performed to balance for potential baseline confounders. The study population consisted of 224 patients (mean age 69  14, male sex 62%); RV dysfunction was diagnosed in 63 cases (28%). Patients with RV dysfunction were older (75 vs. 67 years, p < 0.001), had higher prevenance of coronary artery disease (27% vs. 11%, p = 0.003), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (50% vs. 55%, p < 0.001). The rate of 1-year mortality (67% vs. 28%; p  0.001) was significantly higher in patients with RV dysfunction compared with patients without. After propensity score matching, patients with RV dysfunction showed a worse long-term survival (62% vs. 29%, p < 0.001). The multivariable Cox regression model showed an independent association of RV dysfunction with 1-year mortality. RV dysfunction is a relatively common finding in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and it is independently associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality.","output":"Long-Term Prognostic Impact of Right Ventricular Dysfunction in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patient-reported outcomes (pros) are essential to capture the patient's perspective and to influence care. Although pros and pro measures are known to have many important benefits, they are not consistently being used and there is there no Canadian pros oversight. The Position Statement presented here is the first step toward supporting the implementation of pros in the Canadian health care setting. Methods: The Canadian pros National Steering Committee drafted position statements, which were submitted for stakeholder feedback before, during, and after the first National Canadian Patient Reported Outcomes (canpros) scientific conference, 14-15 November 2019 in Calgary, Alberta. In addition to the stakeholder feedback cycle, a patient advocate group submitted a section to capture the patient voice. Results: The canpros Position Statement is an outcome of the 2019 canpros scientific conference, with an oncology focus. The Position Statement is categorized into 6 sections covering 4 theme areas: Patient and Families, Health Policy, Clinical Implementation, and Research. The patient voice perfectly mirrors the recommendations that the experts reached by consensus and provides an overriding impetus for the use of pros in health care. Conclusions: Although our vision of pros transforming the health care system to be more patient-centred is still aspirational, the Position Statement presented here takes a first step toward providing recommendations in key areas to align Canadian efforts. The Position Statement is directed toward a health policy audience; future iterations will target other audiences, including researchers, clinicians, and patients.

Here, we analyse the supply-chain effects of a set of idealized lockdown scenarios, using the latest global trade modelling framework. We find that supply-chain losses that are related to initial COVID-19 lockdowns are largely dependent on the number of countries imposing restrictions and that losses are more sensitive to the duration of a lockdown than its strictness. However, a longer containment that can eradicate the disease imposes a smaller loss than shorter ones. Earlier, stricter and shorter lockdowns can minimize overall losses. A 'go-slow' approach to lifting restrictions may reduce overall damages if it avoids the need for further lockdowns. Regardless of the strategy, the complexity of global supply chains will magnify losses beyond the direct effects of COVID-19. Thus, pandemic control is a public good that requires collective efforts and support to lower-capacity countries.","output":"Global supply-chain effects of COVID-19 control measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study will test the performance of the anal swab PCR test when compared with the nasopharyngeal swab PCR test as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19. DESIGN: An observational descriptive study which included hospitalised suspected, or probable cases of hopitalised COVID-19 patients, conducted in Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital, Ciputra Hospital, Mitra Keluarga Depok Hospital and Mitra Keluarga Kelapa Gading Hospital, Indonesia. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were obtained. Nasopharyngeal and anal swabs specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. RESULTS: We analysed 136 subjects as part of this study. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 manifesation in this study was typical of hospitalised patients, with 25% classified as mild cases, 14.7% in severe condition and 12.5% of subjects classified as having acute respiratory distress syndrome. When compared with nasopharyngeal swab as the standard specimen for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, the sensitivity and specificity of the anal swab was 36.7% and 93.8%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value were 97.8% and 16.5 %, respectively. The performance of the anal swab remained similar when only the subgroup of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (n=92, 67.6%) was analysed (sensitivity 40% and specificity 91.7%). Out of all the subjects included in analysis, 67.6% had gastrointestinal symptoms. Similarly, 73.3% of patients in the anal swab-positive group had gastrointestinal symptoms. The two most common gastrointestinal symptoms in the subjects' population were nausea and anorexia. CONCLUSION: Anal swab specimen has low sensitivity (36.7%) but high specificity (93.8%) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen by RT-PCR. Only one additional positive result was found by anal swab among the nasopharyngeal swab-negative group. Anal swab may not be needed as an additional test at the beginning of a patient's diagnostic investigation and nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR remains as the standard diagnostic test for COVID-19.","output":"The value of anal swab RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis in adult Indonesian patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Finding answers related to a pandemic of a novel disease raises new challenges for information seeking and retrieval, as the new information becomes available gradually.

However, occupational violence is so prevalent among pre-hospital paramedic personnel that some experts claim that it is impossible to find pre-hospital personnel without an experience of violence in the workplace. Therefore, it seems necessary to investigate the causes of violence among this population group and find ways to control it. AIM: The present study aimed to investigate the Violence and influencing factors among paramedic pre-hospital personnel. METHOD: This qualitative study was conducted to explore the views of a group of pre-hospital paramedic personnel (n = 45) selected through purposive sampling. The data was collected through in-depth and semi-structured interviews and analyzed using Graneheim and Lundmans conventional content analysis methods. The trial version of MAXQDA 16 software was used to manage the coding process. RESULTS: Based on the results of the analysis of data collected from prehospital paramedic personnel, three main categories including: human factors, organizational factors, and environmental factors and 20 subcategories were detected. CONCLUSION: If authorities neglect violence in the workplace and do not take serious actions to prevent it, violence and, more importantly, hostility will gradually prevail in the workplace. It also increases the stress and anxiety of staff and consequently severely deteriorates their job performance. Hence, authorities are strongly recommended not to ignore this issue and, instead, take measures, for instance hold workshops, to train personnel about the techniques of anger and violence control.","output":"Workplace violence and influencing factors among paramedic pre hospital paramedic personnel (city and road) in Iran: a quality content analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the key patient attributes important to members of the Australian general population when prioritizing patients for the final intensive care unit (ICU) bed in a pandemic over-capacity scenario. METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment administered online asked respondents (N = 306) to imagine the COVID-19 caseload had surged and that they were lay members of a panel tasked to allocate the final ICU bed. They had to decide which patient was more deserving for each of 14 patient pairs. Patients were characterized by 5 attributes: age, occupation, caregiver status, health prior to being infected, and prognosis. Respondents were randomly allocated to one of 7 sets of 14 pairs. Multinomial, mixed logit, and latent class models were used to model the observed choice behavior. RESULTS: A latent class model with 3 classes was found to be the most informative. Two classes valued active decision making and were slightly more likely to choose patients with caregiving responsibilities over those without. One of these classes valued prognosis most strongly, with a decreasing probability of bed allocation for those 65 y and older. The other valued both prognosis and age highly, with decreasing probability of bed allocation for those 45 y and older and a slight preference in favor of frontline health care workers. The third class preferred more random decision-making strategies.

The study population for this review included asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in original articles published up to 30 April 2020. A random effects model was applied to analyze pooled data on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases among all COVID-19 patients and also by age and gender. From the meta-analysis of 16 studies, comprising 2,788 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, the pooled prevalence according to the random effect size of asymptomatic cases was 48.2% (95% CI, 30-67%). Of the asymptomatic cases, 55.5% (95% CI, 43.6-66.8%) were female and 49.6% (95% CI, 20.5-79.1%) were children.

Therefore, this study aims to determine the quality of apple vinegar samples from different varieties (Red Delicious, Gala, Golden Delicious, and Starking Delicious) prepared by three methods using small apple pieces, apple juice, and crushed apple, through determining the physicochemical properties and antibacterial activity of these samples. The antibacterial activity was studied against five pathogenic bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli (ATB: 57), Escherichia coli (ATB: 97), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, using two methods, disk diffusion and microdilution, for determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations and the minimum bactericidal concentrations. The results of this study showed that the lowest pH value was 3.6 for Stark Delicious, obtained by liquid fermentation, and the highest acetic acid values were 4.7 and 4% for the vinegar of Red Delicious and Golden Delicious, prepared by solid fermentation, respectively. The results of the antibacterial activity showed considerable activity of apple vinegar on the tested strains. Generally, the Staphylococcus aureus strain appears less sensitive and Pseudomonas aeruginosa seems to be very sensitive against all samples, while the other strains have distinct sensitivities depending on the variety studied and the method used. A higher antibacterial activity was found in vinegar obtained by the apple pieces method and the Red Delicious variety, with a low MIC and MBC recorded, at 1.95 and 3.90 L/mL, respectively.

The timing of definitive management is not standardized in the cerebrovascular community. This study was designed to evaluate the safety of delaying AVM treatment in clinically stable patients with a new hemorrhagic presentation. The authors examined the rate of rehemorrhage or neurological decline in a cohort of patients with ruptured brain AVMs during a period of time posthemorrhage. METHODS Patients presenting to the authors' institution from January 2000 to December 2015 with ruptured brain AVMs treated at least 4 weeks posthemorrhage were included in this analysis. Exclusion criteria were ruptured AVMs that required emergency surgery involving resection of the AVM, prior treatment of AVM at another institution, or treatment of lesions within 4 weeks for other reasons (subacute surgery). The primary outcome measure was time from initial hemorrhage to treatment failure (defined as rehemorrhage or neurological decline as a direct result of the AVM). Patient-days were calculated from the day of initial rupture until the day AVM treatment was initiated or treatment failed. RESULTS Of 102 ruptured AVMs in 102 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 7 (6.9%) failed the treatment paradigm. Six patients (5.8%) had a new hemorrhage within a median of 248 days (interquartile range 33-1364 days). The total \\"at risk\\" period was 18,740 patient-days, yielding a rehemorrhage rate of 11.5% per patient-year, or 0.96% per patient-month. Twelve (11.8%) of 102 patients were found to have an associated aneurysm. In this group there was a single (8.3%) new hemorrhage during a total at-risk period of 263 patient-days until the aneurysm was secured, yielding a rehemorrhage risk of 11.4% per patient-month. CONCLUSIONS It is the authors' practice to rehabilitate patients after brain AVM rupture with a plan for elective treatment of the AVM. The present data are useful in that the findings quantify the risk of the authors' treatment strategy. These findings indicate that delaying intervention for at least 4 weeks after the initial hemorrhage subjects the patient to a low (< 1%) risk of rehemorrhage.

To study the determinants of IAV pathogenicity and their functional co-evolution, we evaluated amino acid differences in the PA-X and NS1 proteins of early (1996C1997) and more recent (since 2016) H5N1 IAV. H5N1 IAV have zoonotic and pandemic potential and represent an important challenge both in poultry farming and human health. The results indicate that amino acid changes occurred over time, affecting the ability of these two non-structural H5N1 IAV proteins to inhibit gene expression and affecting virus pathogenicity. These results highlight the importance to monitor the evolution of these two virulence factors of IAV, which could result in enhanced viral replication and virulence.","output":"Natural Selection of H5N1 Avian Influenza A Viruses with Increased PA-X and NS1 Shutoff Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical activity (PA) is an important part of lifestyle management for adolescents with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Opportunities for PA were reduced by COVID-19 restrictions. Therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare PA among adolescents with and without T1D during the first New Zealand (NZ) COVID-19 lockdown. PA levels of adolescents aged 11-18 years with T1D (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 34) were assessed through self-reported and parent proxy-reported questionnaires. Overall, PA levels during lockdown were below recommended levels. PA levels did not differ between T1D and control participants (p = 0.212) nor between genders (p = 0.149). Younger adolescents tended to be more active than older adolescents (p = 0.079). PA level was negatively associated with BMI z-score (r = -0.29, p = 0.026) but was not associated with socioeconomic status (SES) or T1D-related parameters. In the T1D group, higher HbA1c was associated with lower school decile (r = -0.58, p < 0.001) and higher BMI z-score (r = 0.68, p < 0.001). Overall, young people were insufficiently active during lockdown, and some sub-groups were more affected than others by the restrictions.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features, test results, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients after discharge. METHODS 149 COVID-19 patients with follow-up data after discharge were included. Post-hospitalization data related to clinical features and outcomes were obtained by following the patients up to 6 weeks. RESULTS The COVID-19 patients were followed for a median of 28.0 days (range of 22 days to 42 days) after discharge from hospital. At the end of follow-up, four patients (2.7%) still had cough. The proportions of leukopenia and lymphopenia were 7.4% and 4.7%, respectively. The proportions of ALT, AST, and Cr abnormalities were 26.2%, 6.0%, and 0%, respectively. Abnormal chest CT was detected in 94 (63.1%) patients, including 14 (9.4%) unilateral pneumonia and 80 (53.7%) bilateral pneumonia. However, the proportion of chest CT abnormality significantly decreased compared to that at the time of admission. CONCLUSIONS One month after discharge, few patients with COVID-19 had clinical symptoms; however, a substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients harbored abnormal laboratory and radiological examinations. Moderately long-term medical follow-up would justifiably benefit COVID-19 patients after discharge.","output":"Clinical Features and Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 After Discharge: A Retrospective, Multi-center Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, TTUHSC opened a new 20,000sf Institute of Anatomical Sciences for human gross anatomy. When the COVID\\\\19 pandemic struck and many schools shifted from in person to online teaching, we hypothesized that if safety measures were used, in person cadaveric anatomy could be safely taught without a decrease in student performance. To test this, we reduced onsite attendance to less than 25% of room capacity. Masks were required at all times and students were instructed to social distance. Six students were assigned per cadaver, but only two students dissected at a time. The other four students reviewed and completed dissections and/or reviewed in groups of two at other allotted times. Thus, students dissected only every third lab. Dissection and lab review attendance was mandatory and students were nearly 100% compliant. Teaching assistants recorded dissected prosections reviews, and these videos were uploaded to password protected course files for independent learning. Students were provided iPads in the laboratory and access to three software packages for use on and off site. All students had access to multiple formative quizzes and exams, and three new online practice practical exams were created. To help reduce testing anxiety, a pass/fail system replaced categorical grading. However, all written and practical exams were conducted on site and in person. At TTUHSC, we have developed an exam question database to track historical student performance including a 25\\\\question optional pre\\\\block practice exam used to assess incoming student anatomical aptitude. In 2020, 90% of incoming students (93% in 2019) took the pre\\\\block exam and scored an average of 28% (24% in 2019). In 2020, despite vastly different content delivery approaches (>80% of lectures were on Zoom) and reduced in\\\\person dissection requirements, students modestly outperformed their 2019 counterparts. Overall exam averages were 89% in 2020 compared to 87% in 2019. If a categorical system was in place, 66% of students would have earned Honors or High Pass in 2020 compared to 61% in 2019. Our formative assessments were highly predictive of summative exam performance, and students reported that they reduced exam stress. Furthermore, summative exam averages correlated strongly with NBME performance (p<0.0001, r(2)=0.63). TTUHSC medical students estimated that a majority of their peers at other medical schools did not have any in person dissection in 2020. Our students ranked in person laboratory dissection as the most useful learning activity, 88% reported that our COVID\\\\19 preparations were very good to outstanding, and 97% were satisfied with the quality of their anatomy education. We conclude that 1) When using appropriate precautions, in person cadaveric anatomy can be taught safely during a pandemic; 2) cadaveric dissection is essential for mastery of anatomical concepts; and 3) coupling online learning modalities with rigorous formative assessments prevented a modest reduction in cadaveric dissection opportunities from negatively impacting student performance.","output":"Lessons Learned from Teaching in Person Cadaveric Anatomy During the COVID\\\\19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinsons disease (PD) and related mobility issues places a serious burden on healthcare systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the urgent need for better tools to manage chronic conditions remotely, as regular access to clinics may be problematic. Digital health technology in the form of remote monitoring with body-worn sensors offers significant opportunities for transforming research and revolutionizing the clinical management of PD. Significant efforts are being invested in the development and validation of digital outcomes to support diagnosis and track motor and mobility impairments off-line. Imagine being able to remotely assess your patient, understand how well they are functioning, evaluate the impact of any recent medication/intervention, and identify the need for urgent follow-up before overt, irreparable change takes place? This could offer new pragmatic solutions for personalized care and clinical research. So the question remains: how close are we to achieving this? Here, we describe the state-of-the-art based on representative papers published between 2017 and 2020. We focus on remote (i.e., real-world, daily-living) monitoring of PD using body-worn sensors (e.g., accelerometers, inertial measurement units) for assessing motor symptoms and their complications. Despite the tremendous potential, existing challenges exist (e.g., validity, regulatory) that are preventing the widespread clinical adoption of body-worn sensors as a digital outcome. We propose a roadmap with clear recommendations for addressing these challenges and future directions to bring us closer to the implementation and widespread adoption of this important way of improving the clinical care, evaluation, and monitoring of PD.","output":"Body-Worn Sensors for Remote Monitoring of Parkinsons Disease Motor Symptoms: Vision, State of the Art, and Challenges Ahead"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and concerns about several other pandemics in the 21st century have attracted extensive global attention. These emerging infectious diseases threaten global public health and raise urgent studies on unraveling the underlying mechanisms of their transmission from animals to humans. Although numerous works have intensively discussed the cross-species and endemic barriers to the occurrence and spread of emerging infectious diseases, both types of barriers play synergistic roles in wildlife habitats. Thus far, there is still a lack of a complete understanding of viral diffusion, migration, and transmission in ecosystems from a macro perspective. In this review, we conceptualize the ecological barrier that represents the combined effects of cross-species and endemic barriers for either the natural or intermediate hosts of viruses. We comprehensively discuss the key influential factors affecting the ecological barrier against viral transmission from virus hosts in their natural habitats into human society, including transmission routes, contact probability, contact frequency, and viral characteristics. Considering the significant impacts of human activities and global industrialization on the strength of the ecological barrier, ecological barrier deterioration driven by human activities is critically analyzed for potential mechanisms. Global climate change can trigger and expand the range of emerging infectious diseases, and human disturbances promote higher contact frequency and greater transmission possibility. In addition, globalization drives more transmission routes and produces new high-risk regions in city areas. This review aims to provide a new concept for and comprehensive evidence of the ecological barrier blocking the transmission and spread of emerging infectious diseases. It also offers new insights into potential strategies to protect the ecological barrier and reduce the wide-ranging risks of emerging infectious diseases to public health.","output":"Ecological Barrier Deterioration Driven by Human Activities Poses Fatal Threats to Public Health due to Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facing the lack in specific antiviral treatment, it is necessary to develop new means of prevention.

Chest CT findings have been described as an aid for COVID-19 diagnosis and management. We aimed to describe the CT imaging characteristics in a group of COVID-19 patients while we also intended to assess if any of these radiological features were associated with short-term prognosis. Materials and methods: CT examinations from 164 consecutive patients with at least one positive RT-PCR nucleic acid assay for SARS-CoV-2 were retrospectively analyzed. Numerous CT imaging features were recorded independently by two radiologists. Patients were grouped according to their status 14 days after the initial CT scan in either discharged/hospitalized in a non-ICU ward (favorable prognosis group) versus deceased/admitted to an intensive care unit (unfavorable prognosis group). Results: Ground-glass opacities (89.0 %) and consolidations (73.2 %) with multilobar involvement were the predominant imaging findings, while a nodular pattern (3.7 %) and cavitation (1.2 %) were uncommon. Mean age was higher in the mortality/ICU group. Ground-glass opacities and consolidations were dominant in both groups, but distribution pattern of abnormalities was different, being more often diffuse in the mortality/ICU group. Linear opacities and opacities that were rounded in shape were more frequently observed in the favorable prognosis group. CT severity index was significantly higher in the mortality/ICU group. For assessing unfavorable prognosis, the best cut-off for CT severity index was 24 (sensitivity 78 %; specificity 59 %). Interobserver agreement for all CT findings was excellent. Conclusion: COVID-19 pneumonia in Porto, Portugal, manifests as multilobar ground-glass opacities and consolidations. Older age, diffuse distribution and increasing CT severity index are associated with worse short-term prognosis while linear opacities resembling organizing pneumonia and rounded opacities herald a more favorable prognosis.","output":"Chest CT imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia: First radiological insights from Porto, Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are important causes of infection in both humans and animals.

Despite the implementation of automated detection systems, and previous efficiencies including barcoding, electronic data transfer and extensive robotics, capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in clinical settings is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly detection failures with weak positive samples. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with a focus on pools containing weak positive specimens. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of weak positive samples during the pandemic were reviewed. Weak positive specimens, with Ct values of 33 or greater, were detected in 95% of 60 five-sample pools but only 87% of 39 nine-sample pools. The proportion of positive samples with very low viral loads rose markedly during the first few months of the pandemic, peaking in June, decreasing thereafter and remaining level since August. At all times, weak positive specimens comprised a significant component of the sample population, ranging from 29% to greater than 80% for Ct values above 31. In assessing the benefits of pooling strategies however, other aspects of the testing process must be considered. Accessioning, result data management, electronic data transfer, reporting and billing are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures.

The exclusion criteria were: 1. abstracts from conferences;2. commentaries;and 3. inclusion of subjects younger than 18 years. The databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched. Using the search term anosmia OR smell loss OR smell disorders OR dysosmia OR parosmia AND COVID-19, 157 papers were selected for analysis, with 109 being ruled out based on the exclusion criteria. The full texts and their references were obtained and studied, and the references meeting the inclusion criteria were also included in this review, leading to a total of 68 papers selected for the review. Results: Approximately 60% of patients with COVID-19 disease present with smell disorders. Most studies agree anosmia appears more frequently in the mild course of the disease. The inflammation and demyelination of the olfactory nerve fibres probably play a key role in the pathogenesis. Damage to the supporting cells of the olfactory epithelium may also play an important role. Olfactory disorder may persist over a varying period of time after the resolution of the acute phase of COVID-19. Olfactory training seems to be beneficial in the treatment. The data regarding the efficacy of topical corticosteroids are inconsistent. No other drugs have yet demonstrated a clinical effect.

Consequently, the present study aimed to determine the KAP levels of university students and associated anxiety during the earlier stage of the pandemic in Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional, online study with 544 university students was conducted during April 17CMay 1, 2020. The questionnaire incorporated several KAP-related test items aligned with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Anxiety was measured with the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between KAP levels and anxiety adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Subgroup analyses included rerunning models stratified by gender and quarantine status. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of students showed high levels of knowledge about COVID-19 guidelines, 59% reported behavioral practices that aligned with COVID-19 guidelines, and 39% had negative attitudes toward COVID-19 guidelines. Attitudes differed by anxiety ((2) = 23.55, p < 0.001); specifically, negative attitudes were associated with higher anxiety (OR: 2.40, 95% CI = 1.66C3.46, p < 0.001).

METHODS Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RNA distributions (Cq and copies/mL) from more than 6000 patients from three clinical laboratories in UK, Belgium and the Republic of Korea were analyzed. Impact of Cq cut-offs on clinical sensitivity was assessed. The June/July 2020 INSTAND EQA scheme SARS-CoV-2 materials were used to estimate laboratory reported copies/mL and to estimate the variation in copies/mL for a given Cq. RESULTS When the WHO suggested Cq cut-off of 25 was applied, the clinical sensitivity dropped to as little as about 16%. Clinical sensitivity also dropped to as little as about 27% when a simulated LOD of 106 copies/mL was applied. The inter-laboratory variation for a given Cq value was >1000 fold in copies/mL (99% CI). CONCLUSION While RT-qPCR has been instrumental in the response to COVID-19, we recommend Cq (Ct or Cp) values not be used to set clinical cut-offs, or diagnostic performance targets, due to poor inter-laboratory reproducibility; calibrated copy-based units (used elsewhere in virology) offer more reproducible alternatives.

To combat the spread of the virus and prevent an uncontrolled outbreak with limited resources, national lockdown protocols have taken effect in the Netherlands since March 13th, 2020. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence, type and characteristics of HEMS and HEMS-ambulance 'Lifeliner 1' dispatches during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period one year prior. METHODS: A retrospective review of all HEMS and HEMS-ambulance 'Lifeliner 1' dispatches was performed from the start of Dutch nationwide lockdown orders from March 13th until May 13th, 2020 and the corresponding period one year prior. Dispatch-, operational-, patient-, injury-, and on-site treatment characteristics were extracted for analysis. In addition, the rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel and the time physicians were unable to take call was described. RESULTS: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HEMS and HEMS-ambulance was requested in 528 cases. One year prior, a total of 620 requests were received. The HEMS (helicopter and ambulance) was cancelled after deployment in 56.4% of the COVID-19 cohort and 50.7% of the historical cohort (P = 0.05). Incident location type did not differ between the two cohorts, specifically, there was no significant difference in the number of injuries that occurred at home in pandemic versus non-pandemic circumstances. Besides a decrease in the number of falls, the distribution of mechanisms of injury remained similar during the COVID-19 study period. There was no difference in self-inflicted injuries observed. Prehospital interventions remained similar during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to one year prior. Specifically, prehospital intubation did not differ between the two cohorts. The rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel was 23.1%. Physicians who tested positive were unable to take call for a mean of 25 days (range 8-53). CONCLUSION: A decrease in the number of deployments and increase in the number of cancelled missions was observed during the COVID-19 study period. No major differences in operational- and injury characteristics were found for HEMS and HEMS-ambulance dispatches between the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands and the same period one year prior. These findings highlight the importance of continued operability of the HEMS, even during pandemic circumstances.

With the continuous exploration of the types of programmed cell death, an increasing number of studies have confirmed that caspase-8 plays an important role in cancer. Recently, scholars have proposed the term \\"PANoptosis\\", which mainly includes three programmed cell death modes, namely pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. In addition to mediating endogenous apoptotic pathways, caspase-8 can also participate in the cleavage of gasdermin (GSDM) family proteins to induce pyroptosis. Furthermore, the expression of enzymatically inactive caspase-8 (C362S) can cause embryonic lethality and inflammatory tissue destruction in mice by inducing necroptosis and pyroptosis. Therefore, the activation and deletion of caspase-8 enzyme activity, as well as the knockout of the coding gene, are closely related to \\"PANoptosis\\". In addition, caspase-8 can also improve the tumor microenvironment and enhance tumor anti-immunity. Studies have shown that caspase-8 is also associated with tumor growth and invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis, therapeutic resistance, and poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is very important to measure the cancer-promoting and anti-cancer effects of caspase-8 and find a balance, and to study its role in the effect of \\"PANoptosis\\" in depth.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the feature of the haptics simulator in comparison with a conventional mannequin simulator by analyzing the assessment of products prepared by dental students using these two kinds of simulator. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects were 30 students in the sixth-year classes of the faculty of dentistry. Abutments for a full cast crown were prepared by each subject using two kinds of simulator; one is the haptics simulator and the other is a mannequin simulator. For the resulted products, occlusal surface form, margin design, surface smoothness, taper angle, total cut volume and overall impression were rated by 3 evaluators. Score differences between two simulators were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The kinds of simulator affected subject performance for margin design and total cut volume. The differences in cutting feeling between the simulators as well as variation of stereoscopic ability in subjects were considerable reasons. Evaluators rating was affected by difference in simulators for occlusal surface form, total cut volume, and overall impression. This may have been due to variation of stereoscopic ability in evaluators. CONCLUSION: The unique characteristics of virtual reality, such as the simulated cutting sensation and the simulated three-dimensional images created by stereo viewers, affect operators performance and evaluators rating. It was suggested that educational programs need to be constructed taking account of the characteristics of virtual reality to make the best use of the haptics simulator.","output":"Effect of the haptic 3D virtual reality dental training simulator on assessment of tooth preparation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2012, Vanuatu designed and implemented a syndromic surveillance system based on the guidelines developed by the Pacific Community and the World Health Organization to provide early warning of outbreaks and other important public health events. Four core syndromes were endorsed for surveillance: acute fever and rash, prolonged fever, influenza-like illness and acute watery diarrhoea. In March 2015, Vanuatu was struck by Cyclone Pam, after which several important changes and improvements to the countrys syndromic surveillance were made. To date, there has been no formal evaluation of whether regular reports are occurring or that core syndromes are being documented. We therefore carried out a descriptive study in the 11 sentinel sites in Vanuatu conducting syndromic surveillance between July and December 2015. There was a total of 53 822 consultations which were higher in the first 13 weeks (n = 29 622) compared with the last 13 weeks (n = 24 200). During the six months, there were no cases of acute fever and rash or prolonged fever. There were cases with influenza-like illness from week 27 to 35, but no case was reported after week 35. Acute watery diarrhoea occurred in one or two cases per week during the whole study period. For these two core syndromes, there were generally more females than males, and about one third were children aged under 5 years.

Seventeen clinical trials are currently registered to inform on the benefits of BCG vaccinations upon exposure to CoV-2. Numerous epidemiological analyses showed a correlation between incidence of COVID-19 and BCG vaccination policies. These studies were not systematically corrected for confounding variables. We observed that after correction for confounding variables, most notably testing rates, there was no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality. Moreover, we found variables describing co-morbidities, including cardiovascular death rate and smoking prevalence, were significantly associated COVID-19 spread rate and percent mortality, respectively.

COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system and causes the development of severe pneumonia and related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in some patients. We aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 pneumonia cases can be evaluated in different categories in clinical and radiological terms. PATIENTS AND METHODS COVID-19 associated ARDS cases being treated with the diagnosis of severe pneumonia between March 21, 2020 and June 15, 2020 in Anesthesia Intensive Care Unit were examined and divided into 2 groups (type-L and type-H, total 29 cases) according to their clinical findings (according to whether they benefited from high PEEP and their lung compliance) and lung computed tomography findings (according to the severity of the ground glass appearance). The groups were compared with each other in terms of inflammatory markers [CRP (C reactive protein), ferritin, D Dimer, PCT (procalcitonin), white blood cell, lymphocyte count, arterial blood gas analysis] and imaging findings. RESULTS It was observed that the prone position was beneficial in improving oxygenation in both H-type and L-type patients. 7 of 22 L-type patients were intubated and 5 of these patients died.

A 60-nucleotide (nt) sequence, common between wild-type RNA2 and mutant RNA3, supported efficient repair (90%) of a modified 3' noncoding region in the RNA3 segment by homologous recombination with wild-type RNA2 3' noncoding sequences. Deletions within this sequence in RNA3 demonstrated that a nucleotide identity as short as 15 nt can support efficient homologous recombination events, while shorter (5-nt) sequence identity resulted in reduced recombination frequency (5%) within this region. Three or more mismatches within a downstream portion of the common 60-nt RNA3 sequence affected both the incidence of recombination and the distribution of crossover sites, suggesting that besides the length, the extent of sequence identity between two recombining BMV RNAs is an important factor in homologous recombination. Site-directed mutagenesis of the common sequence in RNA3 did not reveal a clear correlation between the stability of predicted secondary structures and recombination activity. This indicates that homologous recombination does not require similar secondary structures between two recombining RNAs at the sites of crossovers. Nearly 20% of homologous recombinants were imprecise (aberrant), containing either nucleotide mismatches, small deletions, or small insertions within the region of crossovers. This implies that homologous RNA recombination is not as accurate as proposed previously. Our results provide experimental evidence that the requirements and thus the mechanism of homologous recombination in BMV differ from those of previously described heteroduplex-mediated nonhomologous recombination (P.

A meta-analysis by pooling studies was performed according to the multivariate-adjusted risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) preferentially. We further conducted additional subgroup and sensitivity analyses to explore possible explanations of the results. RESULTS: A total of seven observational studies were included, with a total of 2132 female patients diagnosed with meningiomas. Ever smoking was associated with a significantly reduced risk of meningioma in women, with pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.83 (95% CI 0.70-0.98).

METHODS: Eligible inclusion and exclusion criteria were established in advance. Then, a systematic literature search was performed in several databases from inception to February 2020. Further, the included randomized controlled trials data were adopted to calculation, prepare graphs and multidimensional cluster analysis by WinBUGS 1.4.3, Stata V.13.0 and R 3.6.1 software, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 53 eligible randomized controlled trial studies with 6401 patients were obtained that evaluated the clinical effectiveness rate, the level of hypersensitive C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, fibrinogen, and adverse reactions after the application of Danshen class injections plus western medicine.

Use limits, including rationing vehicle entry at gates by reservation, are one possible strategy to manage visitation levels. After an initial full closure, the park chose to operationalize a multiphased permit system for day-use and overnight entry over the course of the pandemic in accordance with local and national guidelines for operational safety. While park closures and other entry restrictions have been common in recent years due to wildland fires and other natural hazards, the pandemicrelated entry limits represent a nearly yearlong experiment. The prolonged entry ration along with restrictions to group activities has limited visitation and potentially reduced transmission of the novel coronavirus.

Oxidative stress is a feature of inflammation and promotes the progression of chronic lung diseases, including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Increased oxidative stress leads to exhaustion of antioxidant defenses, alterations in autophagy/mitophagy and cell survival regulatory mechanisms, thus promoting cell senescence. All these events are amplified by the increase of inflammation driven by oxidative stress. Several models of bronchial epithelial cells are used to study the molecular mechanisms and the cellular functions altered by cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure, and to test the efficacy of molecules with antioxidant properties. This review offers a comprehensive synthesis of human in-vitro and ex-vivo studies published from 2011 to 2021 describing the molecular and cellular mechanisms evoked by CSE exposure in bronchial epithelial cells, the most used experimental models and the mechanisms of action of cellular antioxidants systems as well as natural and synthetic antioxidant compounds.","output":"Cellular and Molecular Signatures of Oxidative Stress in Bronchial Epithelial Cell Models Injured by Cigarette Smoke Extract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: There have been substantial recent changes in youth tobacco product use in the United Statesincluding, notably, a rapid increase in use of e\\\\cigarettes. It is not known whether, and if so how far, these changes are reflected in levels of nicotine dependence. This study used data from a large, nationally representative sample of US adolescents to (i) estimate the annual prevalence of nicotine dependence in relation to current use of tobacco products, (ii) describe trends in dependence over time and (iii) evaluate whether the increase in youth use of tobacco products has been paralleled by a similar increase in the population burden of nicotine dependence. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of National Youth Tobacco Surveys conducted annually, 2012C19. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 86 902 high school students. MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence of (i) strong cravings to use tobacco in the past 30 days and (ii) wanting to use nicotine products within 30 minutes of waking, in relation to type of product used (cigarettes, other combustible tobacco, smokeless tobacco, e\\\\cigarettes). FINDINGS: Between 2012 and 2019 there was a marked decline in past 30\\\\day cigarette smoking and a surge in use of e\\\\cigarettes. Different products were associated with differing levels of nicotine dependence, with cigarettes characterized by highest dependence (strong craving 42.3%; wanting to use within 30 minutes 16.8% among exclusive users in 2019) and e\\\\cigarettes in otherwise tobacco\\\\naive students by low dependence (16.1 and 8.8% respectively in 2019). The overall 33.8% increase in population use of nicotine products between 2012 and 2019 (from 23.2 to 31.2%) was not accompanied by an equivalent increase in overall population burden of dependence {percentage reporting craving 10.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 9.8C12.2%] in 2012 and 9.5% (95% CI = 7.5C12.0%) in 2019; wanting to use within 30 minutes 4.7% (95% CI = 4.0C5.5%) in 2012, 5.4% (95% CI = 4.0C7.2%) in 2019}. CONCLUSIONS: Among US high school students, increases in the prevalence of nicotine product use from 2012 to 2019 do not appear to have been accompanied by a similar increase in the population burden of nicotine dependence. This may be at least partly attributable to a shift in the most common product of choice from cigarettes (on which users are most dependent) to e\\\\cigarettes (on which users are least dependent).","output":"Dependence on nicotine in US high school students in the context of changing patterns of tobacco product use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased population movements and increased mobility made it possible for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which is mainly spread by respiratory droplets, to spread faster and more easily. This study tracked and analysed the development of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the top 100 cities that were destinations for people who left Wuhan before the city entered lockdown. Data were collected from the top 100 destination cities for people who travelled from Wuhan before the lockdown, the proportion of people travelling into each city, the intensity of intracity travel and the daily reports of COVID-19. The proportion of the population that travelled from Wuhan to each city from 10 January 2020 to 24 January 2020, was positively correlated with and had a significant linear relationship with the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in each city after 24 January (all P < 0.01).

The aim is to examine the experiences of this target group and gain insight in the way measures were taken in order to be able to advise care organizations about adequate care with respect to possible restrictive measures in the future. METHODS: In\\\\depth interviews were conducted with two groups of people: (1) fourteen people with an intellectual and visual disability, living in sheltered care facilities and (2) twelve people being relatives of residents of these same sheltered care facilities. In the interviews, the participants were questioned about their experiences with respect to the adjusted visiting regulations and with respect to the relation with their family during this period.

These challenges have been enormous and debilitating, as the infrastructure of many countries, including developing ones, had little or no resources to deal with the crisis. Even in developed countries, such as Italy, health systems have been so inundated by cases that health care facilities became oversaturated and could not accommodate the unexpected influx of patients to be tested. Initially, resources were focused on testing to identify those who were infected. When it became clear that the virus mainly attacks the lungs by causing parenchymal changes in the form of multifocal pneumonia of different levels of severity, imaging became paramount in the assessment of disease severity, progression, and even response to treatment. As a result, there was a need to establish protocols for imaging of the lungs in these patients. In North America, the focus was on chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) as these are widely available and accessible at most health facilities. However, in Europe and China, this was not the case, and a cost-effective and relatively fast imaging modality was needed to scan a large number of sick patients promptly. Hence, ultrasound (US) found its way into the hands of Chinese and European physicians and has since become an important imaging modality in those locations. US is a highly versatile, portable, and inexpensive imaging modality that has application across a broad spectrum of conditions and, in this way, is ideally suited to assess the lungs of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This bedside test can be done with little to no movement of the patients from the unit that keeps them in their isolated rooms, thereby limiting further exposure to other health personnel. This article presents a basic introduction to COVID-19 and the use of the US for lung imaging. It further provides a high-level overview of the existing US technologies that are driving development in current and potential future US imaging systems for lung, with a specific emphasis on portable and 3-D systems.","output":"Current Ultrasound Technologies and Instrumentation in the Assessment and Monitoring of COVID-19 Positive Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the relationship of pneumococcal vaccination rates, influenza, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccinations (DTP), polio, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), and Bacillus CalmetteCGuerin (tuberculosis) vaccination rates to COVID-19 case and death rates for 51 nations that have high rates of COVID-19 testing and for which nearly complete childhood, at-risk adult and elderly pneumococcal vaccination data were available.

Significant positive correlations were found between IPD (but not lower respiratory infections) and COVID-19 rates, while significant negative correlations were found between pneumococcal vaccination and COVID-19 rates. Influenza and MMR vaccination rates were negatively correlated with lower respiratory infection (LRI) rates and may synergize with pneumococcal vaccination rates to protect against COVID-19.

To better understand how the U.S Veterans health outcomes compared to non-Veterans, this study utilized the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset to examine 10 different self-reported morbidities. Yearly age-adjusted, population estimates from 2003 to 2019 were used for Veteran vs. non-Veteran. Complex weights were used to evaluate the panel series for each morbidity overweight/obesity, heart disease, stroke, skin cancer, cancer, COPD, arthritis, mental health, kidney disease, and diabetes. General linear models (GLMs) were created using 2019 data only to investigate any possible explanatory variables associated with these morbidities. The time series analysis showed that Veterans have disproportionately higher self-reported rates of each morbidity with the exception of mental health issues and heart disease. The GLM showed that when taking into account all the variables, Veterans disproportionately self-reported a higher amount of every morbidity with the exception of mental health. These data present an overall poor state of the health of the average U.S. Veteran.

However, associations between specific programme indicators and key clinical endpoints, such as emergency hospital admissions, remain unclear. We aimed to examine whether attainment of Quality and Outcomes Framework and National Diabetes Audit primary care diabetes indicators is associated with diabetes-related, cardiovascular, and all-cause emergency hospital admissions. DESIGN Historical cohort study. SETTING A total of 330 English primary care practices, 2010-2017, using UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. PARTICIPANTS A total of 84,441 adults with type 2 diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was emergency hospital admission for any cause. Secondary outcomes were (1) diabetes-related and (2) cardiovascular-related emergency admission. RESULTS There were 130,709 all-cause emergency admissions, 115,425 diabetes-related admissions and 105,191 cardiovascular admissions, corresponding to unplanned admission rates of 402, 355 and 323 per 1000 patient-years, respectively. All-cause hospital admission rates were lower among those who met HbA1c and cholesterol indicators (incidence rate ratio = 0.91; 95% CI 0.89-0.92; p < 0.001 and 0.87; 95% CI 0.86-0.89; p < 0.001), respectively), with similar findings for diabetes and cardiovascular admissions. Patients who achieved the Quality and Outcomes Framework blood pressure target had lower cardiovascular admission rates (incidence rate ratio = 0.98; 95% CI 0.96-0.99; p = 0.001). Strong associations were found between completing 7-9 (vs. either 4-6 or 0-3) National Diabetes Audit processes and lower rates of all admission outcomes (p-values < 0.001), and meeting all nine National Diabetes Audit processes had significant associations with reductions in all types of emergency admissions by 22% to 26%. Meeting the HbA1c or cholesterol Quality and Outcomes Framework indicators, or completing 7-9 National Diabetes Audit processes, was also associated with longer time-to-unplanned all-cause, diabetes and cardiovascular admissions. CONCLUSIONS Attaining Quality and Outcomes Framework-defined diabetes intermediate outcome thresholds, and comprehensive completion of care processes, may translate into considerable reductions in emergency hospital admissions.

An online, self-administered questionnaire was delivered for residents within the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were examined by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Most of the participants (n = 2314) aged between 31 and 59 years (54.2%), were women (76.6%), White (90.6%) with a university degree (66.6%). Moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were reported in 3.9% and 4.5% of participants, respectively, before COVID-19. During the pandemic (June-July, 2020), these proportions increased to 29.1% (6.6-fold increase) and 37.8% (7.4-fold increase), respectively. Higher rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms were observed among women, those aged 18-30 years, diagnosed with chronic disease and participants who had their income negatively affected by social restrictions. Remaining active or becoming physically active during social distancing restrictions reduced the probability of aggravated mental health disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive and anxiety symptoms had a 6.6- and 7.4-fold increase since the COVID-19 pandemic. Public policies such as physical activity promotion and strategies to reduce the economic strain caused by this pandemic are urgently needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on mental health.","output":"Sharp increase in depression and anxiety among Brazilian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from the PAMPA cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great challenge for contemporary public transportation worldwide, resulting from an unprecedented decline in demand and revenue. In this paper, the authors synthesize the state-of-the-art, up to early June 2020, on key developments regarding public transportation and the COVID-19 pandemic, including the different responses adopted by governments and public transportation agencies around the world, and the research needs pertaining to critical issues that minimize contagion risk in public transportation in the so-called post-lockdown phase. While attempts at adherence to physical distancing (which challenges the very concept of mass public transportation) are looming in several countries, the latest research shows that for closed environments such as public transportation vehicles, the proper use of face masks has significantly reduced the probability of contagion. The economic and social effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in public transportation extend beyond service performance and health risks to financial viability, social equity, and sustainable mobility. There is a risk that if the public transportation sector is perceived as poorly transitioning to post-pandemic conditions, that viewing public transportation as unhealthy will gain ground and might be sustained. To this end, this paper identifies the research needs and outlines a research agenda for the public health implications of alternative strategies and scenarios, specifically measures to reduce crowding in public transportation. The paper provides an overview and an outlook for transit policy makers, planners, and researchers to map the state-of-affairs and research needs related to the impacts of the pandemic crisis on public transportation. Some research needs require urgent attention given what is ultimately at stake in several countries: restoring the ability of public transportation systems to fulfill their societal role.","output":"COVID-19 and Public Transportation: Current Assessment, Prospects, and Research Needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a respiratory illness due to novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), described in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and rapidly evolved into a pandemic. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract can also be involved. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old man was hospitalised for COVID-19-associated pneumonia. A rapid recovery of respiratory and general symptoms was observed after 1 week of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine and broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam plus teicoplanin). No GI symptoms were reported during hospitalisation, but a lung contrast-enhancement CT (CE-CT) excluding thromboembolism showed, as collateral finding, intraperitoneal free bubbles not present on a previous CT examination; the subsequent abdominal CE-CT described pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) involving the caecum and the right colon. Ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was started, and the 2-week follow-up CT showed the complete resolution of PI. DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of PI is poorly understood. PI involving the caecum and right colon has been described for HIV and Cytomegalovirus infections, but, to our best knowledge, never before in COVID-19. We hypothesise a multifactorial aetiopathogenesis for PI, with a possible role of the bowel wall damage and microbiota impairment due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we suggest a conservative management in the absence of symptoms.","output":"Pneumatosis intestinalis in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human milk oligosaccharides, proteins, such as lactoferrin, and bacteria represent just some of the bioactive components of mother's breast milk (BM). Bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) are an often-overlooked component of BM that can cause major changes in microbial composition and metabolism. BM bacteriophage composition has been explored in term and healthy infants, suggesting vertical transmission of bacteriophages occurs between mothers and their infants. Several important differences between term and very preterm infants (<30 weeks gestational age) may limit this phenomenon in the latter. To better understand the link between BM bacteriophages and gut microbiomes of very preterm infants in health and disease, standardised protocols are required for isolation and characterisation from BM. In this study, we use isolated nucleic acid content, bacteriophage richness and Shannon diversity to validate several parameters applicable during bacteriophage isolation from precious BM samples. Parameters validated include sample volume required; centrifugal sedimentation of microbes; hydrolysis of milk samples with digestive enzymes; induction of temperate bacteriophages and concentration/purification of isolated bacteriophage particles in donor milk (DM). Our optimised method enables characterisation of bacteriophages from as little as 0.1 mL BM. We identify viral families that were exclusively identified with the inclusion of induction of temperate bacteriophages (Inoviridae) and hydrolysis of milk lipid processes (Iridoviridae and Baculoviridae). Once applied to a small clinical cohort we demonstrate the vertical transmission of bacteriophages from mothers BM to the gut of very preterm infants at the species level. This optimised method will enable future research characterising the bacteriophage composition of BM in very preterm infants to determine their clinical relevance in the development of a healthy preterm infant gut microbiome.","output":"Optimisation and Application of a Novel Method to Identify Bacteriophages in Maternal Milk and Infant Stool Identifies Host-Phage Communities Within Preterm Infant Gut"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world searching for hope has already experienced a huge loss of lives due to COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 started in Wuhan, China.

Current study focused on whether climatic conditions(temperature and relative humidity)are having any influence in the occurrence of COVID-19 when the outbreak has been classified as pandemic. To determine the effect of daily average temperature and average relative humidity on log-transformed total daily cases of COVID-19, polynomial regression as a quadratic term and linear regression were done.

Present study observed no correlation between the climatic conditions (the daily average temperature and relative humidity) and the number of cases of COVID-19. Similar result was found in relation between daily average temperature and average number of cases per day in country-wise analysis. However, about 93.5% cases of COVID-19 occurred between 1{degrees}C to 16{degrees}C and the average number of cases per day was lower in high temperature country than low temperature country with exceptions.

RESULTS: Elevated neutrophil-to-LYM ratio (NLR), D-dimer(D-D), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-2, interferon-Y, and age were significantly associated with the severity of illness. However, significant and sustained decreases were observed in the LYM subset (p<0.05). D-D, T cell counts, and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of mild cases. Second, D-D increased from 0.5 to 8, and the risk ratio increased from 2.75 to 55, eventually leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Moreover, the acute renal function damage occurred earlier than abnormal heart and liver functions (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The degrees of lymphopenia and proinflammatory cytokine storm were higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases. The degree was associated with the disease severity. Advanced age, NLR, D-D, and cytokine levels may serve as useful prognostic factors for the early identification of severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 93 confirmed COVID-19 patients. The samples were examined for lymphocyte (LYM) subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. The receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to determine the best diagnostic thresholds for laboratory results, and principal component analysis was used to screen the major risk factors.

METHODS: 316 patients with UTUC who underwent radical surgery at a high-volume center in China between January 2008 and December 2019 were included in this study. We retrospectively collected the clinicopathologic data from the medical records, including age, sex, smoking history, ECOG performance status (ECOG PS), body mass index (BMI), tumor location and size, number of lesions, T stage, N stage, surgical approach and occurrence of hydronephrosis, lymph node invasion, lymph node dissection, surgical margin, tumor necrosis, infiltrative tumor architecture, lymphovascular invasion and concomitant bladder cancer. Surgical wait time was defined as the interval between initial imaging diagnosis and radical surgery of UTUC. Hydronephrosis was defined as abnormal dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces due to obstruction of the urinary system. Firstly, all patients were divided into short-wait (<31 days), intermediate-wait (31-90 days) and long-wait (>90 days) groups according to the surgical wait time. The clinicopathological characteristics of each group were evaluated and the survival was compared. For patients with hydronephrosis, we subsequently divided them into two groups: short-wait (60 days) and long-wait (>60 days) groups according to the surgical wait time. Univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis were performed to evaluate the prognostic risk factor for patients with hydronephrosis. RESULTS: A total of 316 patients with UTUC were included in this study with a median surgical wait time of 22 days (IQR 11-71 days). Of the 316 patients, 173 were classified into the short-wait group (54.7%), 69 into the intermediate-wait group (21.8%) and 74 into the long-wait group (23.5%). The median follow-up time for all patients was 43 months (IQR 28-67months). The median surgical wait times of the short-wait, intermediate-wait and long-wait group were12 days (IQR 8-17days), 42days (IQR 37-65days) and 191days (IQR 129-372days), respectively. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of all patients was 54.3%. The 5-year OS of short-wait, intermediate-wait and long-wait groups were 56.4%, 59.3% and 35.1%, respectively (P=0.045). The 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) of short-wait, intermediate-wait and long-wait groups were 65.8%, 70.9% and 39.6%, respectively (P=0.032). In the subgroup analysis, we divided 158 UTUC patients with hydronephrosis into short-wait group (60 days) and long-wait group (> 60 days), 120 patients were included in the short-wait group and 38 patients in the long-wait group. The median surgical wait times of the short-wait and long-wait group were 14days (IQR 8-28days) and 174days (IQR 100-369days), respectively. The 5-year OS of long-wait group was significantly lower than the OS of short-wait group (44.2% vs. 55.1%, P =0.023). The 5-year CSS of long-wait and short-wait group were 49.1% and 61.7%, respectively (P=0.041). In multivariate Cox regression analysis of UTUC patients with hydronephrosis, surgical wait time, tumor grade, pathological T stage, and tumor size were independent risk factors for OS and CSS. Lymph node involvement was also a prognostic factor for CSS. CONCLUSION: For patients with UTUC, the surgical wait time should be limited to less than 3 months. For UTUC patients with hydronephrosis, the OS and CSS of patients with surgical wait time of more than 60 days were relatively shorted than those of patients with surgical wait time of less than 60 days.","output":"Impact of Surgical Wait Time on Survival in Patients With Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma With Hydronephrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Ventilators used for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) must be able to synchronize in the presence of system leaks. We compared the ability of 7 ICU ventilators and 3 dedicated NIV ventilators to compensate for leaks during pediatric NIV. METHODS Using a lung simulator, we compared the Maquet Servo-i, Dr?ger V500, Dr?ger Carina, Covidien PB840, Respironics V60, Respironics Vision, GE Healthcare/Engstr?m Carestation, CareFusion Avea, Hamilton C3, and Hamilton G5 during increasing (n = 6) and decreasing leaks (n = 6). With a lung simulator we tested 4 leak levels (baseline [BL] 2-3 L/min, L1 5-6 L/min, L2 9-10 L/min, and L3 19-20 L/min); 3 patient weights (10, 20, and 30 kg); and 3 lung mechanics scenarios (normal, obstructive, and restrictive). The ventilator settings were NIV mode, pressure support of 10 cm H2O, and PEEP of 5 cm H2O. The synchronization rate (synchronized cycles/total simulated respirations) was recorded for each ventilator and each leak scenario. Synchronization was defined as triggering without auto-triggering, miss-triggering, delayed cycling, or premature cycling. RESULTS The mean synchronization rate across all ventilators was 68  27% (range 23-96%) and marked differences existed between the ventilators (P < .001). Significant differences in synchronization rate were observed between the 10-kg model (mean 57  30%, range 17-93%), the 20-kg model (69  30%, 25-98%), and the 30-kg models (77  22%, 28-97%) (P < .001). The synchronization rate for the obstructive model (60  30%, 9-94%) was significantly different from the normal model (71  29%, 18-98%) and the restrictive model (72  28%, 23-98%) (P < .001). The PB840 and the C3 had synchronization rates over 90% overall across all body weights, all lung mechanic profiles, and all leak levels.

In April 2020, the US FDA exercised enforcement discretion for the temporary use of inpatient CGM during the pandemic, thus hospitals were presented the opportunity to implement this technology. METHODS: We sought to investigate the accuracy of CGM in hospitalized patients on general care floors and the intensive care unit (ICU) in attempts to decrease healthcare professional exposure to COVID-19 and ultimately improve glycemic management of patients affected by COVID-19. Point of care (POC) and laboratory (Lab) glucose values were matched with simultaneous CGM glucose values and measures of accuracy were performed to evaluate the safety and usability of CGM in this population. Our data are presented drawing a distinction between POC and Lab as reference glucose sources. RESULTS: In 808 paired samples obtained from 28 patients (10 ICU, 18 general floor), overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) for all patients using either POC or Lab as reference was 13.2%. When using POC as the reference glucose MARD was 13.9% and using Lab glucose as reference 10.9%. Using both POC and Lab reference glucose pairs the overall MARD for critical care patients was 12.1% and for general floor patients 14%. CONCLUSION: We determined, with proper protocols and safeguards in place, use of CGM in the hospitalized patient is a reasonable alternative to standard of care to achieve the goal of reducing healthcare professional exposure. Further study is necessary to validate safety, accuracy, and efficacy of this technology.

These associations persisted even when using different prevalence estimates of substance use, though some associations lost statistical significance when applying the survey weights to account for non-response. Conclusion: College students overestimated the prevalence of substance use in their respective colleges, even during the early stages of the pandemic when social interactions were limited, and these beliefs were associated with substance use.

It is hypothesized that proteins in yak FF participate in the physio-biochemical pathways. The primary aims of this study were to find differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between mature and immature FF, and to elucidating functions of the mature and immature FF in yak. RESULTS: The mature and immature FF samples were obtained from three healthy yaks that were nonpregnant, aged from four to five years, and free from any anatomical reproductive disorders. The FF samples were subjected to mass spectrometry with the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). The FF samples went through correlation analysis, principle component analysis, and expression pattern analysis based on quantification of the identified proteins. Four hundred sixty-three DEPs between mature and immature FF were identified. The DEPs between the mature and immature FF samples underwent gene ontology (GO), Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. The DEPs highly expressed in the mature FF mainly took parts in the complement and coagulation cascades, defense response, acute-phase response, response to other organism pathways to avoid invasion of exogenous microorganisms. The complement activation pathway contains eight DEPs, namely C2, C5, C6, C7, C9, C4BPA, CFH, and MBL2. The three DEPs, CATHL4, CHGA, and PGLYRP1, take parts in defense response pathway to prevent invasion of exogenetic microorganism. The coagulation cascades pathway involves many coagulation factors, such as F7, F13A1, FGA, FGB, FGG, KLKB1, KNG1, MASP1, SERPINA1, and SERPIND1. While the DEPs highly expressed in the immature FF participated in protein translation, peptide biosynthetic process, DNA conformation change, and DNA geometric change pathways to facilitate follicle development. The translation pathway contains many ribosomal proteins, such as RPL3, RPL5, RPS3, RPS6, and other translation factors, such as EIF3J, EIF4G2, ETF1, MOV10, and NARS. The DNA conformation change and DNA geometric change involve nine DEPs, DDX1, G3BP1, HMGB1, HMGB2, HMGB3, MCM3, MCM5, MCM6, and RUVBL2. Furthermore, the expressed levels of the main DEPs, C2 and SERPIND1, were confirmed by western blot. CONCLUSIONS: The differential proteomics revealed the up-regulated DEPs in mature FF take parts in immunoreaction to prevent invasion of microorganisms and the up-regulated DEPs in immature FF participate in protein synthesis, which may improve our knowledge of the follicular microenvironment and its biological roles for reproductive processes in yak. The DEPs, C2 and SERPIND1, can be considered as protein markers for mature yak follicle.

The transmission of the disease varies depending on the environmental conditions. Saliva is a recognized SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in infected individuals. Therefore, exposure to fluids during dental procedures leads to a high risk of contagion. Objective: This study aimed to develop an infection risk prediction model for COVID-19 based on an analysis of the dynamic behavior of aerosol particles generated during dental procedures. Materials: and methods : The dispersion of aerosol particles during dental aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) performed on phantoms was evaluated using colored saliva. The gravity-deposited aerosol particles were registered using filter paper within the perimeter of the phantom head and the settled particles were recorded in standardized photographs. Digital images were processed to analyze the stained area and the drops dimensions. A logistic regression model was built with the variables ventilation, distance from the mouth, instrument used, area of the mouth treated, and location within the perimeter area. Results: The largest percentage of aerosol particles ranged from 1 to 5 m. The maximum settlement range from the mouth of the phantom head was 320 cm, with a high-risk cut-off distance of 78 cm. Ventilation, distance, instrument used, area of the mouth being treated, and location within the perimeter showed association with the amount of aerosol particles. These variables were used for constructing a scale to determine the risk of exposure to aerosol particles in dentistry within an infection risk prediction model. Conclusion: Contamination by disseminated aerosol particles represents a risk for the dental staff. Thus, it is advisable to improve ventilation and use biosafety measures. The need to implement new clinical and educational strategies was evident.

With DARt, the problem of time misalignment caused by lagging observations is tackled by incorporating observation delays into the joint inference of infections and R t ;the drawback of averaging is improved by instantaneous updating upon new observations and a model selection mechanism capturing abrupt changes caused by interventions;the uncertainty is quantified and reduced by employing Bayesian smoothing.

We report the effect of BCG exposure on COVID-19 severity in oncology patients from the CCC19 registry. Methods: The CCC19 registry (NCT04354701) was used to identify patients with prior BCG exposure. Cohort A received intravesical treatment for bladder carcinoma, and cohort B received prior BCG vaccination. Each cohort was matched 3:1 to non-BCG-exposed controls by age, sex, race, primary cancer type, cancer status, ECOG performance status (PS) and calendar time of COVID-19 infection. The primary endpoint was COVID-19 severity reported on an ordinal scale (uncomplicated, hospitalized, admitted to ICU +/- ventilated, died within 30 days) of patients exposed to prior BCG compared to matched non-exposed controls. 2-sided Wilcoxon ranksum tests were used. Results: As of 6-Feb-2021 we included 124 patients with BCG exposure, 68 patients with bladder carcinoma who had received intravesical BCG (Cohort A), and 64 cancer patients with prior BCG vaccination (Cohort B). Median age was 76 years, IQR 69-83 (Cohort A) and 67 years, IQR 62-74 (Cohort B). Bladder cancer pts were predominately male (78%) vs 55% for Cohort B.

In a bench study we investigated the effect of inspiratory rise time on inspiratory work load during pressure-support ventilation (PSV). METHODS We studied 6 ICU ventilators. We measured flow and pressure at the airway opening (P(ao)) at PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O, pressure-support of 5 cm H(2)O and 10 cm H(2)O, 4 triggering sensitivities, and inspiratory drives 300 mL, 500 mL, and 700 mL. The inspiratory-rise-time setting was not consistent between the ventilators, and we chose 3 inspiratory-rise-time levels with each ventilator. The inspiratory delay time (DT) was defined as the time between the onset of inspiration and the return of P(ao) to baseline, and was divided into 2 parts at the point of the lowest P(ao): before the lowest P(ao) (DT(1)), and after the lowest P(ao) (DT(2)). As an indicator of inspiratory work load we calculated the pressure-time-product (PTP) of the P(ao) over the DT. PTP was also divided into PTP(1) and PTP(2), at the point of the lowest P(ao). RESULTS Short inspiratory rise time reduced DT(2), PTP(1), and PTP(2), regardless of the pressure-support level, triggering sensitivity, or inspiratory drive. However, the inspiratory-rise-time setting did not affect DT(1). The PTP(1), PTP(2), and DT(2) values differed significantly among the ventilators. A combination of short inspiratory rise time, high PSV, and sharp triggering sensitivity resulted in the smallest PTP and DT values. CONCLUSIONS Short inspiratory rise time decreased inspiratory work load, regardless of the pressure-support level, triggering sensitivity, or inspiratory drive. Inspiratory work load can be maximally lowered by a combination of a short inspiratory rise time, a sharp triggering sensitivity, and a high inspiratory pressure-support level for a given patient's inspiratory effort.","output":"Effects of inspiratory rise time on triggering work load during pressure-support ventilation: a lung model study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with misfolding of proteins into highly-ordered amyloid fibrils.

Strategies to reduce false negative rate of NPS have limitations.

Laryngotracheal aspiration (LTA) is easy to perform and showed a similar accuracy to BAL for diagnosis of other pulmonary diseases, however it was not studied to diagnose SARS-COV-2 pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: An observational cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the negative predictive value of LTA in patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 pneumonia despite a negative NPS. METHODS: In the EDs of two university hospitals, consecutive patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 pneumonia despite a negative NPS underwent LTA performed with a nasotracheal tube connected to a vacuum system. Final diagnosis based on all respiratory specimen tests (NPS, LTA and BAL) and hospital data was established by two reviewers and in case of discordance by a third reviewer. RESULTS: 117 patients were enrolled. LTA was feasible in all patients and no patients experienced adverse events. Fifteen (12.7%) patients were diagnosed with community-acquired SARS-COV-2 pneumonia: 13 LTA positive and only 2 (1.7%) LTA negative.

Exercise motives, PA, and mental health were measured by use of the Behavioural Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire-3, Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity Questionnaire, and General Health Questionnaire-12, respectively. Participants were also asked to specify their average step count per day, if they used a mobile device for this purpose (n = 190).

There were no differences observed in explained variance between pre- and during lockdown for unplanned PA and steps per day. Planned and unplanned PA were significant explanatory variables for mental health both pre- and during lockdown, but sedentary behaviour was not. Partial correlations, with BMI and age partialled out, showed that steps per day were not correlated with mental health either pre- or during lockdown. The range of variables used to explain planned and unplanned PA and mental health suggest that people's motives to exercise were tempered by lockdown. For those who routinely measured their steps per day, the step count was unrelated to their mental health scores both pre- and during lockdown.

The proposed infrastructure in this study is a pan-India one and can broadly be divided into two parts, hotspot mapping and accessibility to services. In the first part, hospitals are proposed to act as nodes of data collection, sending data to a national GIS portal. This portal shall have the capabilities of plotting the data using map rendering services such as Google and Bing Maps. This way, hotspots can be visualized in no time, benefitting the government and common citizenry alike. The second part deals with the accessibility of citizenry to a wide range of services, i.e., healthcare services, grocery outlets, emergency services, baby food, and many other essential services of the day to day life. In order to implement this, we propose that the government need to enforce a mandatory submission of locational coordinates of all Goods and Services Tax (GST) enrolled service providers. Once the coordinates are submitted, the government can effectively control the opening and closing of services and inform the citizenry at the same time.

Furthermore, no clear recommendation was made for patients with previous COVID-19 infection and favorable outcome seeking for bariatric surgery. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current manuscript is to analyze the risk of specific complications for patients with previous COVID-19 infection who were admitted for bariatric surgery. SETTINGS: 8 high volume private centers from 5 countries METHODS: All patients with morbid obesity disease and previous COVID-19 infection admitted for bariatric surgery were included in the current study. Patients were enrolled from 8 centers and 5 countries and their electronic health data were reviewed retrospectively. The primary outcome was to identify early (<30 days) specific complications related to COVID-19 infection, following bariatric surgery and the secondary outcome was to analyze additional work up to prevent them. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with a mean age of 40 years (range 21 C 68) and mean BMI of 44.3 kg/m(2) ( 7.4 kg/m(2)) with previous COVID-19 infection underwent different bariatric procedures: 23 cases of sleeve (65.7 %), 7 cases of bypass, and 5 other cases. The symptomatology of the previous COVID-19 infection varied: no symptoms (15 patients), fever and respiratory signs (12 patients), only fever (5 patients), digestive symptoms (2 patients), and isolated respiratory signs (one patient). Only 5 patients (14.2 %) were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection for a mean period of 8.8 days (range 6-15 days). One patient was admitted in intensive care unit and needed invasive mechanical ventilation. The mean interval time from COVID infection to the bariatric surgery was of 11.3 weeks (3 - 34 weeks). Hospital stay was 1.7 days ( 1) and all patients were clinically evaluated one month following the bariatric procedure. There were 2 readmissions and one case of complication: one case of gastric leak treated with laparoscopic drainage and repeated pigtail drain with favorable outcome. No case of other specific complications or mortality were recorded. CONCLUSION: Minor and moderate COVID-19 infections, especially the forms not complicated with invasive mechanical ventilation should not preclude the indication for bariatric surgery.

Abstract The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis.

People of the whole world are susceptible to this deadly disease. To control the prevailing havoc of Coronavirus, researchers worldwide are adopting techniques like plasma therapy, proning, medicines, etc. To stop the rapid spreading of COVID-19, contact tracing is one of the important ways that can put a check on the infected people. This paper explains the various challenges people and health practitioners are facing due to COVID-19. In this paper, various ways with which the impact of COVID-19 can be controlled using IoT technology have been discussed. A six-layer architecture of IoT solutions for containing the deadly COVID-19 has been proposed. In addition to this, role of machine learning techniques for diagnosing COVID-19 have been discussed in this paper, and a quick explanation of the Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) applications for contact tracing has also been specified. From the study conducted, it is quite evident that IoT solutions can be used in various ways for restricting the impact of COVID-19.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a person-specific source that is used as a therapeutic adjunct for the treatment of cartilage damage because it offers a cocktail of growth factors that are necessary for wound healing and tissue regeneration. However, PRP treatments in the clinic are not satisfactory and require upgrading, especially the point of maintaining bioactivity. In this study, we presented PRP as a photo-activated and photo-crosslinkable bio-ink in terms of tissue-specific structures for the first time. We achieved long-term and constant rate growth factor release and bioactivity protection of PRP with satisfactory mechanical characteristics. Photo-crosslinked PRP hydrogel was enabled by the addition of microwave-induced methacrylated gelatin (Gel-MA), which is connected to platelets in PRP via integrin receptors in its structure and chemically cross-linked upon UV irradiation (300-500 nm). Photo-activation of PRP was realized by a polychromatic light source in the near-infrared region (PAC, 600-1200 nm). Our results showed that Gel-MA/PRP hydrogels with the desired mechanical properties (low degradation rate and high mechanical strength) released growth factors at a constant rate for the long-term by the periodic PAC application. In vitro cell culture studies (viability, proliferation, morphology, histology, immunochemistry, biochemistry, gene expression analyses) proved that proliferation and differentiation of the ATDC5 cells increased in the periodically light-applied Gel-MA/PRP hydrogel without any external chemical agents.","output":"Photo-activated platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-based patient-specific bio-ink for cartilage tissue engineering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In todays electronic society, security of information is an issue of major concern especially in the communication domain. Indeed, there is a very serious need for schemes that guarantee security of information exchanged between entities, over public networks. Several techniques such as cryptography and/or steganography have been proposed in existing literature. Audio steganography has certain advantages over conventional steganography. Existing audio steganography systems suffer from limitations that includes, their inability to embed information in multiple audio file formats, high distortion rate and low level of robustness of their resultant stego-files. To overcome these limitations, this current research focused on the development of an efficient and robust audio steganography system for the security of information whether in store or on transit across the Internet. This is achieved by first encrypting a given secret information, compressing the resultant cipher-text, then embedding the compressed file in a suitable cover (audio file) using frequency hopping spread spectrum technique, to yield as output, an audio stego file which is not distinguishable from the original audio cover file. To allow for the embedding of the secret compressed file, the selected audio cover file is first broken into frames using one dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Results of performance evaluation of this developed system shows that it has very low level of distortion as revealed by the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The compression ratio obtained is also equal to one (1), which shows that the cover audio file is identical to the resultant stego-file.","output":"Development of an Audio Steganography System Using Discrete Cosine Transform and Spread Spectrum Techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The radiologic evaluation of the transplanted bowel is largely unknown and rather complex because it involves several techniques that depend on indications and times that have not been fully defined. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2002 in the Section of Radiology I of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Modena, Italy), 11 patients with transplanted bowel were studied with different methods: traditional radiologic evaluation with contrast agent (all patients), evaluation of transit time with radiopaque markers (five patients), ultrasonographic (US) evaluation of the intestinal wall and Doppler US of the vascular axes (five patients), computed tomographic (CT) evaluation (all patients), and magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of the bowel and the vascular axes (five patients). Traditional contrast examination enabled evaluation of the gastroesophageal transit and cardia functionality; anatomy and integrity of the anastomoses (proximal and distal); time of gastric emptying; morphology, tone, and kinesis of the transplanted small bowel loops and time of global transit. The study of transit with radiopaque markers was carried out in five patients to define the time of transit through the entire transplanted bowel, confirm recovery of intestinal motility, and identify possible abnormalities. The US examination was carried out in five patients to evaluate the morphology, thickness, and echo structural features of the intestinal loops. Color Doppler was performed to visualize the superior mesenteric artery and a wall arteriole of the sampled loop. CT examination was performed 2 to 4 weeks after surgery to evaluate the anatomy of the transplanted organs, arterial and venous anastomoses in case of complications identified with other methods or suspected, and periodically in the follow-up of patients who underwent transplantation due to Gardner syndrome. The protocol for MR evaluation of the bowel included coronal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, axial and/or sagittal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, coronal fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo (FMP- SPGR) sequences, coronal FMPSPGR sequences with and without administration of intravenous paramagnetic contrast agent, and axial or sagittal FMPSPGR fat-saturated sequences performed after dynamic gadolinium administration. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study of transit with radiopaque markers was useful in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction because it identified recovery and normalization of motility. Traditional contrast examination of the gastrointestinal tract continues to play an important role in transplanted patients because it is a simple examination that allows evaluation of the graft anatomy and recovery of motility of the residual native bowel and the transplanted loops. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in early detection of major postoperative complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, fistulas, and anastomotic complications (stenosis and dehiscence). CT examination is crucial for the detection of fluid collections, abscesses, and fistulas because it can serve as a guide of drainage and during follow-up of patients with Gardner syndrome can be used to investigate all possible sites in which desmoids might arise in addition to their relation to the graft. Because patients with transplanted bowel are generally rather a young population of reproductive age and because of technologic advances, MR may represent an effective method that does not use ionizing radiation and can therefore substitute for traditional radiologic evaluation. US represents a quick examination technique that is easily available and well tolerated by patients, and it has a role to play in the follow-up of transplanted patients and in the identification of major postoperative complications. However, its role in monitoring possible rejection remains to be defined with studies on wider and more representative samples.","output":"Radiologic imaging of the transplanted bowel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged into the human population in late 2019 and caused the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Conventional trauma-focused therapies (TFTs) have shown limited success. Novel interventions including Multi-modal Motion-assisted Memory Desensitization and Reconsolidation therapy (3MDR) may prove successful in treating TR-PTSD. Objective: To qualitatively study the experiences of Canadian military members and Veterans with TR-PTSD who received the 3MDR intervention. Methods: This study explored qualitative data from a larger mixed-method waitlist control trial testing the efficacy of 3MDR in military members and veterans. Qualitative data were recorded and collected from 3MDR sessions, session debriefings and follow-up interviews up to 6 months post-intervention; the data were then thematically analyzed. Results: Three themes emerged from the data: (1) the participants' experiences with 3MDR; (2) perceived outcomes of 3MDR; and (3) keys to successful 3MDR treatment. Participants expressed that 3MDR provided an immersive environment, active engagement and empowerment. The role of the therapist as a coach and fireteam partner supports the participants' control over their therapy. The multi-modal nature of 3MDR, combining treadmill-walking toward self-selected trauma imagery with components of multiple conventional TFTs, was key to helping participants engage with and attribute new meaning to the memory of the traumatic experience. Discussion: Preliminary thematic analysis of participant experiences of 3MDR indicate that 3MDR has potential as an effective intervention for combat-related TR-PTSD, with significant functional, well-being and relational improvements reported post-intervention. Conclusion: Military members and Veterans are at risk of developing TR-PTSD, with worse outcomes than in civilians.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care for non-COVID-19 cases was affected due to the reallocation of resources towards urgent care for COVID-19 patients, resulting in inadequate ongoing care for chronic conditions. METHODS: A keyword search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Scopus for English language articles published between January 2020 and January 2021. FINDINGS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person care for individuals with chronic conditions have decreased due to government restriction of elective and non-urgent healthcare visits, greater instilled fear over potential COVID-19 exposure during in-person visits, and higher utilization rates of telemedicine compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Potential benefits of a virtual-care framework during the pandemic include more effective routine disease monitoring, improved patient satisfaction, and increased treatment compliance and follow-up rates. However, more needs to be done to ensure timely and effective access to telemedicine, particularly for individuals with lower digital literacy. Capitation primary care models have been proposed as a more financially-robust approach during the COVID-19 pandemic than fee-for-service primary care models; however, the interplay between different primary models and the health outcomes is still poorly understood and warrants further investigation. Shortages of medication used to manage chronic conditions were also observed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic due to global supply chain disruptions. Finally, patients with chronic conditions faced lifestyle disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in physical activity, sleep, stress, and mental health, which need to be better addressed.

Effects of sera on RBD-ACE2 interactions were measured as a proxy for neutralizing antibodies. The samples were obtained from healthy individuals or patients on immunosuppressive therapy who had received two to four doses of COVID-19 vaccines and from COVID-19 convalescents. The results show that anti-RBDwt titers correlate with the levels of binding- and neutralizing antibodies against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Omicron variants. The benefit of multiplexed analysis lies in the ability to measure a wide range of anti-RBD titers using a single dilution of serum for each assay. The reactivity patterns also yield an internal reference for neutralizing activity and binding antibody units per milliliter (BAU/ml). Results obtained with sera from vaccinated healthy individuals and patients confirmed and extended results from previous studies on time-dependent waning of antibody levels and effects of immunosuppressive agents.

Stable isotopically labeled compounds of each kinase inhibitor were used as internal standards. The acquisition time was 7.0 min per run. All analytes and internal standards eluted within 3.0 min. The calibration curves were linear over the range of 2C500 ng/mL for afatinib, axitinib, bosutinib, lenvatinib, ruxolitinib, and trametinib, and 6C1500 ng/mL for cabozantinib, dabrafenib, nilotinib, and osimertinib (coefficients of correlation  0.99). Validation assays for accuracy and precision, matrix effect, recovery, carryover, and stability were appropriate according to regulatory agencies. The rapid and sensitive assay ensures high throughput and was successfully applied to monitor concentrations of kinase inhibitors in patients.

METHODS: Vaccine efficacies were estimated from the titre distributions of 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50), assuming that PRNT50 titres of primary vaccination decreased by 2-10 folds due to antibody waning and emergence of VOCs, and an additional dose of vaccine would increase PRNT50 titres by 3- or 9-fold. We then used an existing SARS-CoV-2 transmission model to assess the outcomes of vaccine allocation strategies with and without the use of antivirals for symptomatic patients in Japan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam. FINDINGS: Increasing primary vaccination coverage was the most important contributing factor in reducing the total and peak number of COVID-19 hospitalisations, especially when population vaccine coverage or vaccine uptake among older adults was low. Providing antivirals to 50% of symptomatic infections only further reduced total and peak hospitalisations by 10-13%. The effectiveness of an additional dose of vaccine was highly dependent on the immune escape potential of VOCs and antibody waning, but less dependent on the boosting efficacy of the additional dose. INTERPRETATION: Increasing primary vaccination coverage should be prioritised in the design of allocation strategies of COVID-19 vaccines and antivirals against emerging VOCs, such as Omicron, in the EAP region. Heterologous vaccination with any available vaccine as the additional dose could be considered when planning pandemic exit strategies tailored to the circumstances of EAP jurisdictions.

One of the most prominent representatives of gammacoronavirus genus is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) which is a highly contagious viral pathogen of chickens causing considerable economic losses to the poultry industry. IBVs mostly affect the respiratory, urinary, and reproductive tracts leading to a substantial drop in production. Backyard poultry in the villages usually share their food and water with free flight birds which puts them at serious risk of disease transmission. Furthermore, the poor hygienic measurements which are often used in backyard flocks make them a potential reservoir for diseases that can be transferred to commercial poultry flocks. Live bird markets (LBMs) which receive live poultry to be resold or slaughtered and sold onsite play a significant role in spreading infectious diseases among the different bird species. In the present study, a number of 354 cloacal swab samples were collected from different bird species from LBMs of Gilan province. Subsequently, after RNA extraction, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was carried out using specific primers of S1 gene to detect coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. Two samples from backyard chickens were reported to be positive to coronavirus which were named Iran/Backyardchicken 96/2017 and Iran/Backyardchicken 94/2017. The results of the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these two isolates are placed in QX and IS-1494 strains, respectively.

The patient had suffered from recurrent catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) since 2009, despite several prevention approaches and attempts. In 2013, the patient's catheter was substituted for the BIP Foley Catheter, coated with a noble metal alloy (NMA) of gold, silver, and palladium. Method This is a retrospective-prospective clinical case study covering 4 years history for the control catheters and up to 2.5 years for the anti-infective BIP Foley Catheter. CAUTI incidences, symptoms, antibiotics, catheter performance, and comfort were evaluated. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines were measured pre- and post-substitution to BIP Foley Catheter in urine of the case and of four other permanently catheterized patients. In addition, the levels of noble metals were assessed in urine of the case subject during use of the BIP Foley Catheter. Results While using control catheters, the patient experienced symptomatic CAUTIs requiring antibiotics almost every month for 4 years. After 1 month with the BIP Foley Catheter, the symptoms disappeared, and the patient remained free of symptomatic CAUTIs and antibiotic treatment for the following 2.5 years, despite bacteriuria. The patient was satisfied with the comfort during insertion, use, and removal of the BIP Foley Catheter. Urinary levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) decreased towards normal levels post catheter type substitution. Traces of noble metals detected in a few urine samples were ?4% of the permitted daily exposure. The levels of the noble metals gold, silver, and palladium remaining on the BIP Foley Catheter after use were the same as for unused catheters. Conclusion Long-term use of a NMA-coated catheter was associated with cessation of frequent CAUTIs. The catheter was experienced as comfortable and inflammatory markers were reduced with time. The coating was stable, with no significant metal release into urine and is therefore safe for patient use.","output":"Long-term use of noble metal alloy coated urinary catheters reduces recurrent CAUTI and decreases proinflammatory markers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized (C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a region) can have alarming effects;thus, our study contributes to an understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak infection ratio substantially;this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to understand and control over an extended period of time.","output":"Centralized and decentralized isolation strategies and their impact on the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of COVID-19 it was hypothesized that COVID-19 is subject to multi-wave seasonality, similar to Influenza-Like Illnesses since time immemorial. One year into the pandemic, we aimed to test the seasonality hypothesis for COVID-19. METHODS: We calculated the average annual time-series for Influenza-Like Illnesses based on incidence data from 2016 till 2019 in the Netherlands, and compared these with two COVID-19 time-series during 2020/2021 for the Netherlands. We plotted the time-series on a standardized logarithmic infection scale. Finally, we calculated correlation coefficients and used univariate regression analysis to estimate the strength of the association between the time-series of COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses. RESULTS: The time-series for COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses were strongly and highly significantly correlated. The COVID-19 peaks were all during flu season, and lows were all in the opposing period. Finally, COVID-19 meets the multi-wave characteristics of earlier flu-like pandemics, namely a short first wave at the tail-end of a flu season, and a longer and more intense second wave during the subsequent flu season. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that seasonal patterns of COVID-19 incidence and Influenza-Like Illnesses incidence are highly similar, in a country in the temperate climate zone, such as the Netherlands. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic satisfies the criteria of earlier respiratory pandemics, namely a first wave that is short-lived at the tail-end of flu season, and a second wave that is longer and more severe. This seems to imply that the same factors that are driving the seasonality of Influenza-Like Illnesses are causing COVID-19 seasonality as well, such as solar radiation (UV), temperature, relative humidity, and subsequently seasonal allergens and allergies.","output":"Comparable seasonal pattern for COVID-19 and flu-like illnesses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is estimated that up to 10% of SARS-CoV-2 patients progress from early and pulmonary stages to the most severe stage of illness, which manifests as an extra-pulmonary systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome.

Clinical monitoring of IP-10 has been restricted in the absence of a rapid diagnostic test. MeMed Key(TM) is a novel platform recently cleared to provide IP-10 measurements in 15 minutes. We hypothesized that providing physicians with real time IP-10 measurements would support detection and continuous monitoring of patients with a dysregulated immune response and potentially allow personalized immunomodulation to improve patient outcome.

A clinical decision support protocol was in place focused on managing viral response, oxygenation and inflammatory state (NCT04389645). RESULTS: The median age of the 52 patients was 69, 69% were male, 21% were ventilated, 4 died, 2 due to non-COVID-19 related complications. The most common comorbidities were Diabetes 40% and Hypertension 46%. IP-10 >1000 pg/ml correlated with ICU admission (p< 0.05) and increased COVID-19 severity score (p< 0.01). 19 of the 52 patients had IP-10 >1000 pg/ml, of these 12 were treated with corticosteroids. Monitoring IP-10 within the clinical decision support protocol assisted with personalized corticosteroid regimens with the aim of reducing IP-10 < 1000 pg/ml. The 10 patients that survived exhibited IP-10 levels >1000 pg/ml for 2.6 days on average. In contrast, the 2 patients that died of COVID-19 related complications displayed an average of 7.5 days with IP-10 >1000 pg/ml (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: Providing physicians with real time measurements of IP-10 in COVID-19 patients proved a useful tool as part of the clinical decision support protocol.

We investigated whether biomarker-based monitoring would allow for early detection of po-AKI in patients undergoing abdominal aortic interventions. METHODS In an investigator-initiated prospective single-center observational study in a tertiary care academic center, adult patients with emergency/ elective abdominal aortic repair were included. Patients were tested for concentrations of urinary (TIMP-2) x (IGFBP7) at baseline, after surgical interventions (PO), and in the mornings of the first postoperative day (POD1). The primary endpoint was a difference in urinary (TIMP-2) x (IGFBP7) levels at POD1 in patients with/ without po-AKI (all KDIGO stages, po-AKI until seven days after surgery). Secondary endpoints included sensitivity/ specificity analyses of previously proposed cut-off levels and clinical outcome measures (e.g. need for renal replacement therapy). RESULTS 93 patients (n = 71 open surgery) were included. Po-AKI was observed in 33% (31/93) of patients.

The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of NAbs and anti-S-RBD IgGs after vaccination of health workers with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine over a period of up to three months after the second shot. The possible influence of comorbidities, characteristics of the subjects, co-medication, and adverse events was also investigated. Methods: All participants have been enrolled in a large prospective study (NCT04743388) evaluating the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination. Main inclusion criteria for participation in this study were eligibility for vaccination according to the national program for COVID-19, age above 18 years, and ability to sign the informed consent form. Major exclusion criteria included the presence of active malignant disease, immunosuppressive therapy, and end-stage renal disease. According to National Immunization Program, access to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was available to anyone 18 years of age or older. Nbs and anti-S-RBD IgG titers were measured on days 1 (before the first vaccine shot), 8, 22 (before the second shot), 36, 50, and three months after the second vaccination (D111), using FDA approved methods, namely, cPass?

On D1, immediately before vaccination, the median neutralizing inhibition was 14.2%, while 29 individuals (10.2%) had inhibition levels above the positive threshold of the method (30%). NAbs showed a rapid increase from D8 to D36 on a constant rate of about 3% per day and reached a median (SD) of 97.2% (4.7) at D36. From D36 to D50 a slight decrease in NAbs values was detected and it became more prominent between D50 and D111, when the rate of decline was determined at -0.11 per day.

Paired grouped comparisons using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed statistically significant differences in inhibition levels between pairs: D36 vs. D50, D36 vs. D111, and D50 vs. D111 (for all three comparisons p<0.001) (Figure A). A similar pattern was also observed for anti-S-RBD antibodies. It is worth mentioning that compared to NAbs, the maximum anti-S-RBD levels were reached two weeks later, i.e., at D36. Interestingly, anti-S-RBDs showed a steeper increase during D22-D36 and a lower decline rate during D36-D111. All consecutive pairs comparison, using Wilcoxon's test, led to p-values<0.001 (Figure B). There was an almost linear relationship between NAbs and anti-S-RBD at D22 (Spearman's rho correlation coefficient equal to 0.718). However, their relationship became non-linear from D36; this is due to the steep increase in anti-S-RBD levels that was observed during the D22-D36 period, while the corresponding increase rate for NAbs was much lower. Also, the decline of anti-S-RBD titers was lower compared to that of NAbs. The composite effect of these functions led to a non-linear pattern. Furthermore, prior COVID-19 and younger age were associated with superior antibody responses over time. Regarding those with previous positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, significantly higher levels were observed at the initial phase (D1, D8) (Mann-Whitney p-values<0.001) and at D111 (p=0.046). From D50 there was a trend for a slower decline rate for those with previous positive PCR. Younger individuals had higher antibody titers at D36, D50, and D111, which is due to a slower decline in NAbs compared to the older group of participants (for all three comparisons, Wilcoxon's p-values were<0.05). Conclusions: We found a persistent but declining anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity at 3 months following full vaccination with BNT162b2 in healthy individuals. Our longitudinal study is ongoing to determine the time point of NAbs reduction below the positivity threshold; then a booster vaccine dose might be necessary to maintain humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

We suggest that collective threats require a tremendous amount of coordination, and that strict adherence to social norms is a key mechanism that enables groups to do so. Here we examine how the strength of social normsor cultural tightnessCloosenesswas associated with countries' success in limiting cases and deaths by October, 2020. We expected that tight cultures, which have strict norms and punishments for deviance, would have fewer cases and deaths per million as compared with loose cultures, which have weaker norms and are more permissive. METHODS: We estimated the relationship between cultural tightnessClooseness and COVID-19 case and mortality rates as of Oct 16, 2020, using ordinary least squares regression. We fit a series of stepwise models to capture whether cultural tightnessClooseness explained variation in case and death rates controlling for under-reporting, demographics, geopolitical factors, other cultural dimensions, and climate. FINDINGS: The results indicated that, compared with nations with high levels of cultural tightness, nations with high levels of cultural looseness are estimated to have had 499 times the number of cases (7132 per million vs 1428 per million, respectively) and 871 times the number of deaths (183 per million vs 21 per million, respectively), taking into account a number of controls. A formal evolutionary game theoretic model suggested that tight groups cooperate much faster under threat and have higher survival rates than loose groups. The results suggest that tightening social norms might confer an evolutionary advantage in times of collective threat. INTERPRETATION: Nations that are tight and abide by strict norms have had more success than those that are looser as of the October, 2020. New interventions are needed to help countries tighten social norms as they continue to battle COVID-19 and other collective threats.

Controlling and lowering blood pressure are of significant benefit to people with hypertension because hypertension is a risk factor for stroke, heart disease, and cardiovascular disease. Roselle, the tropical plant Hibiscus sabdariffa, also commonly called sour tea or red tea, has been used as both a thirst-quenching drink and for medicinal purposes. OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of Roselle on blood pressure in people with primary hypertension. SEARCH METHODS For this update, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases and trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCTs): the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (to 6 August 2021), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2021, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 5 August 2021), Embase Ovid (1974 to 5 August 2021), ProQuest Dissertations & Theses (to 6 August 2021), Web of Science Clarivate (to 7 August 2021), Food Science and Technology Abstracts Clarivate (to 7 August 2021), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 6 August 2021), and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (to 6 August 2021). We searched Google Scholar and OpenSIGLE. We also handsearched local and regional Chinese databases: CBM, CMCC, TCMLARS, CNKI, CMAC, and the Index to Chinese Periodical Literature (to 14 September 2020), as well as Thai databases (ThaiJO, CUIR, TDC, CMU e-Theses, TCTR) (to 3 October 2020). There were no language or publication date restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA We sought RCTs evaluating the use of any forms of Roselle with placebo or no treatment in adults with hypertension. Our primary outcome was change in trough and/or peak systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP). Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to adverse effects, change in pulse pressure, and change in heart rate. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS All search results were managed using Covidence and re-checked for the number of records, inclusion and exclusion of studies with Mendeley reference management software. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors worked independently in parallel for screening (titles and abstracts, and full reports), data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and assessment of the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consultation with the third review author if necessary. We presented mean difference (MD) of change in SBP and DBP with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). MAIN RESULTS For this update, only one RCT with a parallel-group design involving 60 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This study investigated the effect of Roselle extract capsules (total dose of 5600 mg) compared with placebo (lactose) at eight weeks. The study was at low risk of selection bias, performance bias, and detection bias. Conversely, it was at high risk of attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias (baseline imbalance). We have very little confidence in the effect estimate of Roselle on change-from-baseline in both SBP and DBP between the two groups. The MD of change in SBP was 1.65, 95% CI -7.89 to 11.19 mmHg, 52 participants, very low-certainty evidence. The MD of change in DBP was 4.60, 95% CI -1.38 to 10.58 mmHg, 52 participants, very low-certainty evidence. Our secondary outcomes of withdrawals due to adverse effects, change in pulse pressure, and change in heart rate were not reported. Due to the limited available data, no secondary analyses were performed (subgroup and sensitivity analysis). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The evidence is currently insufficient to determine the effectiveness of Roselle compared to placebo for controlling or lowering blood pressure in people with hypertension. The certainty of evidence was very low due to methodological limitations, imprecision, and indirectness. There is a need for rigorous RCTs that address the review question.","output":"Roselle for hypertension in adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital patients can have catheters and lines inserted during the course of their admission and serious complications can arise if they are positioned incorrectly.

RECENT FINDINGS Both morbidity and mortality are associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Thus, clinicians are attempting eradication strategies for MRSA using combinations of oral, aerosolized, intravenous, and topical antibiotics, with some success. However, household contacts may be colonized with MRSA, which can impact the durability of eradication. Epidemic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also associated with increased morbidity and mortality and some clones are detected in CF patients throughout the world presumably due to social networks among patients. Recent experimental and clinical data have suggested that CF patients can generate droplet nuclei in the respirable range and that infectious particles can be cultured from room air minutes to hours after patients have left. SUMMARY Although these observations regarding droplet nuclei have not been linked to transmission, they do challenge the safety of the '3-foot rule' and suggest the potential role of masks.

Blast and drought are the most prevalent biotic and abiotic stress factors hampering rice production. Molecular techniques demonstrate higher efficacy in the pyramiding of disease resistance genes, providing green performance under the background of water-saving and drought-resistance rice. RESULTS This study employed molecular marker-assisted selection, conventional hybridization, and high-intensity stress screening to integrate three broad-spectrum blast resistance genes Pi9, Pi5, and Pi54 into Huhan 1S. Subsequently, a novel water-saving and drought-resistance rice (WDR) PTGMS line Huhan 74S was developed. The drought resistance of the new PTGMS line Huhan 74S was comparable to that of Huhan 1S. Pathogenicity assays involving the inoculation of 14 blast prevalent isolates in the glasshouse showed that the blast resistance frequency of Huhan 74S was 85.7%. Further evaluation under natural blast epidemic field conditions showed that Huhan 74S and its hybrids were resistant to leaf and neck blast. The critical temperature point of fertility-sterility alteration of Huhan 74S was 23 C daily mean temperature. The complete male sterility under natural growth conditions in 2017 at Shanghai lasted for 67 days. Also, both the agronomic and grain quality traits met the requirement for two-line hybrid rice production. CONCLUSION These results indicate that the newly bred PTGMS line Huhan 74S can be used to breed high-yielding, good-quality, disease-resistant two-line hybrid water-saving and drought-resistance rice (WDR), hence promoting sustainable rice production in China.","output":"Molecular Breeding of a Novel PTGMS Line of WDR for Broad-Spectrum Resistance to Blast Using Pi9, Pi5, and Pi54 Genes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ImportanceMonoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment decreases hospitalization and death in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19; however, only intravenous administration has been evaluated in randomized clinical trials of treatment.

There is no approved effective therapy for COVID-19, but MSC therapies have shown first promise in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) pneumonia, inflammation, and sepsis, which are among the leading causes of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Many of the critically ill COVID-19 patients are in a hypercoagulable procoagulant state and at high risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation, thromboembolism, and thrombotic multi-organ failure, another cause of high fatality. It is not yet clear whether IV infusion is a safe and effective route of MSC delivery in COVID-19, since MSC-based products express variable levels of highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF/CD142), compromising the cells' hemocompatibility and safety profile. Of concern, IV infusions of poorly characterized MSC products with unchecked (high) TF/CD142 expression could trigger blood clotting in COVID-19 and other vulnerable patient populations and further promote the risk for thromboembolism. In contrast, well-characterized products with robust manufacturing procedures and optimized modes of clinical delivery hold great promise for ameliorating COVID-19 by exerting their beneficial immunomodulatory effects, inducing tissue repair and organ protection. While the need for MSC therapy in COVID-19 is apparent, integrating both innate and adaptive immune compatibility testing into the current guidelines for cell, tissue, and organ transplantation is critical for safe and effective therapies. It is paramount to only use well-characterized, safe MSCs even in the most urgent and experimental treatments.

In this manuscript we describe the unexpected and urgent organizational change of the Cardio-Pulmonary Rehabilitation (CPR) service during the COVID-19 emergency in a Northern Italian rehabilitation hospital, focusing on the Respiratory Physiotherapists' (RPTs) role. A quick three-days complete reorganization of the entire hospital was needed. A COVID-19 care team including a multidisciplinary panel of physicians, nurses, and RPTs was quickly performed to manage 90 beds for post acute patients with COVID-19. Within the team, the RPTs changed their shifts, so as to be available 16h per day, 7 days out of 7. Remodelled tasks in charge of RPTs were: oxygen therapy daily monitoring, non invasive ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) delivery, pronation and postural changes to improve oxygenation, reconditioning with leg/arm cranking and exercises, initial and final patients' functional assessment by short-physical performance battery (SPPB) and 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1-STS) to evaluate motor conditions and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation. Three \\"what-to-do\\" algorithms were developed to guide: i) oxygen de-escalation by reducing inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2); ii) oxygenation improvement through the use of Venturi mask; iii) reconditioning and physical activity. One-hundred seventy patients were treated in one month. As main topics, RPTs have been involved in oxygen therapy management in almost a third of the admitted patients, reconditioning exercises in 60% of the cases, and initial and final functional motor capacity assessment in all patients. Details of activities performed by the RPT in one typical working day are also shown. Our reorganization has exploited the professional skills and clinical expertise of the RPTs. This re-organization can provide practical insights to other facilities that are facing this crisis, and may be a starting point for implementing post-COVID-19 rehabilitation. Future studies will have to improve and review this organization.","output":"How the COVID-19 infection tsunami revolutionized the work of respiratory physiotherapists: an experience from Northern Italy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis study aims to examine the association between predictive accounting downside risk measures and changes in credit spreads.

Higher BMI is also associated with higher incidences of treatment-related adverse events. This study assesses whether body mass index is associated with survival outcomes and adverse events in metastatic melanoma patients with systemic therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS This multicentric retrospective study, conducted from March 1, 2013 to April 29, 2019, enrolled adults with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma from the French multicentric prospective cohort-MelBase (NCT02828202). Patients with first-line chemotherapy and targeted and immune therapy were included. Underweight people and those with metastatic mucosal or ocular melanoma were excluded. Body mass index was categorized using the World Health Organization criteria. Co-primary outcomes included the association between body mass index and progression-free survival and overall survival, stratified by treatment type, sex and age. Secondary endpoints were the association of body mass index with overall response and treatment-related adverse events. Multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Totally, 1,214 patients were analyzed. Their median age was 66.0 years (range, 53-75). Male predominance was observed (n = 738 [61%]). Most patients received immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (63%), followed by targeted therapy (32%), and had stage M1c disease (60.5%). Obese patients represented 22% of the cohort. The median follow-up duration was 13.5 months (range, 6.0-27.5). In the pooled analysis, no positive or negative association between body mass index and progression-free survival (p = 0.88)/overall survival (p = 0.25) was observed, regardless of treatment type, sex, and age. These results were nonsignificant in the univariate and multivariate analyses. The objective response rate, according to body mass index category, did not differ significantly regardless of age. Treatment-related adverse events were not associated with body mass index. CONCLUSION The observed lack of an association between body mass index and survival demonstrates that body mass index is not a valuable marker of systemic treatment-related outcomes in metastatic melanoma. Future approaches might focus on the whole-body distribution.","output":"Relevance of body mass index as a predictor of systemic therapy outcomes in metastatic melanoma: analysis of the MelBase French cohort data."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, more infants weighing less than or equal to 300 g are born, and they survive because of the improvements in neonatal care and treatment.

Methods: The incidence data and epidemic information of COVID-19 reported in Ningbo as of 9 March, 2020 were collected, and based on the implementation of prevention and control strategies, we developed a SEIR epidemic dynamics model. The basic and real-time reproduction numbers were calculated to evaluate effectiveness of prevention and control. Results: A total of 157 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, without death, in Ningbo. The proportion of severe cases was 12.1%. The mean incubation period was estimated to be (5.72.9) days. The mean interval from illness onset to diagnosis was (5.43.7) days. The mean duration from diagnosis to hospital discharge was (16.66.5) days. A total of 105 339 contacts had been under medical observation. The infection rates in contacts with home quarantine and centralized quarantine were 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. In the confirmed cases, those who had been under medical observation before diagnoses accounted for 63.1%. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 4.8. With the strengthening of prevention and control measures, real-time reproduction number showed a gradual downward trend, dropping to below 1.0 on 4 February, and then continued to drop to 0.2 in mid-February.

Music-Supported Therapy (MST) is an effective intervention to enhance motor and cognitive function, emotional well-being and quality of life in chronic stroke patients. We have adapted the original MST training protocol to a home-based intervention, which incorporates increased training intensity and variability, group sessions, and optimisation of learning to promote autonomy and motivation. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to test the effectiveness of this enriched MST (eMST) protocol in improving motor functions, cognition, emotional well-being and quality of life of chronic stroke patients when compared to a program of home-based exercises utilizing the Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (GRASP). Sixty stroke patients will be recruited and randomly allocated to an eMST group (n = 30) or a control GRASP intervention group (n = 30). Patients will be evaluated before and after a 10-week intervention, as well as at 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome of the study is the functionality of the paretic upper limb measured with the Action Research Arm Test.

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these stressors, as pandemic-related restrictions created barriers to resources and newborn bonding. Modern technology offers tools that can help NICU parents maintain their mental and social health remotely. Study Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess self-reported mental health and technology use among parents of infants hospitalized in the NICU at a single institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also studied the prevalence of specific COVID-19-related stressors among participants. Participants were asked to rank a series of statements on a Likert scale to describe their mental health, technology use, and COVID-19-related stress. Spearman rank coefficients were calculated to measure strength and direction of associations. Results: A sample of 47 participants completed the voluntary assessment. Mental health was negatively associated with higher COVID-19-related stress (rs-0.40, p=.015). The most prevalent COVID-19-related stressor was hospital visitation restriction, which 31.9% of participants assigned the highest severity stress score. Higher COVID-19-related stress was associated with the use of text and video chat for social support [(rs 0.35, p.016)and ( rs 0.33 p=.025) respectively].

This manuscript reviews the global situation, contextualizes India's disease control efforts, and outlines the possible way forward by identifying specific actions under the following headings: enhancing district preparedness, enabling care for patients, and broadening community and stakeholder engagement for India.","output":"Our Fight Against the Rapidly Evolving COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review of India's Actions and Proposed Way Forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 has brought about a significant challenge to the whole of humanity, but with a special burden upon the medical community. Clinicians must keep updated continuously about symptoms, diagnoses, and effectiveness of emergent treatments under a never-ending flood of scientific literature. In this context, the role of evidence-based medicine (EBM) for curating the most substantial evidence to support public health and clinical practice turns essential but is being challenged as never before due to the high volume of research articles published and pre-prints posted daily. Artificial Intelligence can have a crucial role in this situation. In this article, we report the results of an applied research project to classify scientific articles to support Epistemonikos, one of the most active foundations worldwide conducting EBM. We test several methods, and the best one, based on the XLNet neural language model, improves the current approach by 93\\\\% on average F1-score, saving valuable time from physicians who volunteer to curate COVID-19 research articles manually.","output":"Neural language models for text classification in evidence-based medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three cardinal manifestations of neoplasia, namely inflammation, immune dysfunction, and coagulopathy are also seen in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing a biological rationale for testing selected anticancer drugs for their ability to control the symptoms and/or modify the course of COVID-19.","output":"Repurposing anticancer drugs for COVID-19-induced inflammation, immune dysfunction, and coagulopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ubiquitin (Ub) and the Ub-like (Ubl) modifier interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) participate in the host defence of viral infections. Viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronavirus (SARS hCoV), have co-opted Ub-ISG15 conjugation pathways for their own advantage or have evolved effector proteins to counter pro-inflammatory properties of Ub-ISG15-conjugated host proteins. In the present study, we compare substrate specificities of the papain-like protease (PLpro) from the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) hCoV to the related protease from SARS, SARS PLpro. Through biochemical assays, we show that, similar to SARS PLpro, MERS PLpro is both a deubiquitinating (DUB) and a deISGylating enzyme. Further analysis of the intrinsic DUB activity of these viral proteases revealed unique differences between the recognition and cleavage specificities of polyUb chains. First, MERS PLpro shows broad linkage specificity for the cleavage of polyUb chains, whereas SARS PLpro prefers to cleave Lys48-linked polyUb chains. Secondly, MERS PLpro cleaves polyUb chains in a 'mono-distributive' manner (one Ub at a time) and SARS PLpro prefers to cleave Lys48-linked polyUb chains by sensing a di-Ub moiety as a minimal recognition element using a 'di-distributive' cleavage mechanism. The di-distributive cleavage mechanism for SARS PLpro appears to be uncommon among USP (Ub-specific protease)-family DUBs, as related USP family members from humans do not display such a mechanism. We propose that these intrinsic enzymatic differences between SARS and MERS PLpro will help to identify pro-inflammatory substrates of these viral DUBs and can guide in the design of therapeutics to combat infection by coronaviruses.","output":"SARS hCoV papain-like protease is a unique Lys48 linkage-specific di-distributive deubiquitinating enzyme."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Lage et les comorbidits sont les facteurs de risque de dcs les plus clairement tablis au cours du COVID-19.

As a growing body of literature demonstrates the ingestion of MP by zooplankton in controlled laboratory studies, few data are available demonstrating in situ observations of MP in zooplankton. A field survey was performed to collect zooplankton in the highly urbanized Hudson-Raritan estuary. Following washing, sorting by species, and enumeration, three dominant species of copepods (Acartia tonsa, Paracalanus crassirostris and Centropages typicus) were digested. MP were filter concentrated and characterized by size, morphology, and color via microscopy and polymer type by micro-FTIR imaging and/or Raman spectroscopy. MP were observed in all extracts performed on the three copepod species with averages ranging from 0.30 to 0.82 MP individual-1. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the dominant polymer types observed and fragments and beads the most commonly observed morphologies for MP. These data were used to estimate the flux of MP through zooplankton based on gut turnover times, which we compare to estimates of MP entering this environment though the local waterways. The estimated fluxes were sufficiently large, indicating that ingestion by zooplankton is a major sink of MP in the size range subject to zooplankton feeding in surface estuarine waters.","output":"Pervasive occurrence of microplastics in Hudson-Raritan estuary zooplankton"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"D614G genotype of SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly infectious and responsible for almost all infection for 2nd wave.

In the UK, the Nursing and Midwifery Council introduced emergency standards for undergraduate programmes in 2020, making significant short-term changes to programme delivery. However, the mandate for all students to undertake interprofessional education remained. Interprofessional education is key to preparing students on health and social care programmes, as it enables students to work as effective members of multi-agency/multi-professional teams on qualification. It is an important element of training, as it has a direct impact on quality of care and service user experience. This series of articles will explore the experiences of 'lockdown learning' from the perspective of academics, students and service users from a global perspective in relation to the delivery of interprofessional education during the pandemic, which necessitated a wholesale move from face-to-face, blended and online learning to include emergency remote teaching. The series was written by members of the Centre for the Advancement of Interprofessional Education Research Subgroup (Interprofessional Education Experiences) and aims to identify barriers and facilitators to successful shared learning and provide suggestions for how lessons learned can be taken forward to further enhance this important element of pre-registration education. The perceptions and attitudes of academics and students on such comprehensive changes are a unique and rich data source to explore and inform future provision.

Previous research has indicated potential associations between the clearance system in the brain and the pathological conditions of the central nervous system (CNS), due to its importance, which has attracted considerable attention recently. In the last decade, studies of the clearance system have been restricted to the glymphatic system. However, removal of toxic and catabolic waste by-products cannot be completed independently by the glymphatic system, while no known research or article has focused on a comprehensive overview of the structure and function of the clearance system. This thesis addresses a neglected aspect of linkage between the structural composition and main components as well as the role of neural cells throughout the clearance system, which found evidence that the components of CNS including the glymphatic system and the meningeal lymphatic system interact with a neural cell, such as astrocytes and microglia, to carry out vital clearance functions. As a result of this evidence that can contribute to a better understanding of the clearance system, suggestions were identified for further clinical intervention development of severe conditions caused by the accumulation of metabolic waste products and neurotoxins in the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).","output":"Clearance Systems in the Brain, From Structure to Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is the present-day pandemic around the globe.

The mechanisms underlying this benefit remain uncertain. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of stroke volume guided intra-venous fluid and low dose dopexamine on tissue microvascular flow and oxygenation and inflammatory markers in patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS Randomised, controlled, single blind study of patients admitted to a university hospital critical care unit following major gastrointestinal surgery. For eight hours after surgery, intra-venous fluid therapy was guided by measurements of central venous pressure (CVP group), or stroke volume (SV group). In a third group stroke volume guided fluid therapy was combined with dopexamine (0.5 mcg/kg/min) (SV & DPX group). RESULTS 135 patients were recruited (n = 45 per group). In the SV & DPX group, increased global oxygen delivery was associated with improved sublingual (P < 0.05) and cutaneous microvascular flow (P < 0.005) (sublingual microscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry). Microvascular flow remained constant in the SV group but deteriorated in the CVP group (P < 0.05). Cutaneous tissue oxygen partial pressure (PtO2) (Clark electrode) improved only in the SV & DPX group (P < 0.001). There were no differences in serum inflammatory markers. There were no differences in overall complication rates between the groups although acute kidney injury was more frequent in the CVP group (CVP group ten patients (22%); pooled SV and SV & DPX groups seven patients (8%); P = 0.03) (post hoc analysis). CONCLUSIONS Stroke volume guided fluid and low dose inotropic therapy was associated with improved global oxygen delivery, microvascular flow and tissue oxygenation but no differences in the inflammatory response to surgery.

Within the neocortex, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in the rapid cortical learning of new information that is congruent with an existing framework of knowledge, or schema. How the brain integrates associations to form inferences, specifically how inferences are represented, is not well understood. In this study, we investigate how the brain uses schemas to facilitate memory integration in an associative inference paradigm (A-B-C-D). We conducted two event-related fMRI experiments in which participants retrieved previously learned direct (AB, BC, CD) and inferred (AC, AD) associations between word pairs for items that are schema congruent or incongruent. Additionally, we investigated how two factors known to affect memory, a delay with sleep, and reward, modulate the neural integration of associations within, and between, schema. Schema congruency was found to benefit the integration of associates, but only when retrieval immediately follows learning. RSA revealed that neural patterns of inferred pairs (AC) in the PHc, mPFC, and posHPC were more similar to their constituents (AB and BC) when the items were schema congruent, suggesting that schema facilitates the assimilation of paired items into a single inferred unit containing all associated elements. Furthermore, a delay with sleep, but not reward, impacted the assimilation of inferred pairs. Our findings reveal that the neural representations of overlapping associations are integrated into novel representations through the support of memory schema. Significance Statement Our ability to draw novel links between pieces of existing knowledge allows us to understand how information in memory is related. Existing knowledge (memory schema) can facilitate learning, and then integration, of new related information. We ask how the human brain uses schema to form links between related pieces of information, and how sleep and reward affect this process. Our results suggest that memory schema helps pieces of knowledge become a single inferred unit in the brains memory systems. A delay with sleep between learning and retrieval, though not reward, is important for how schema achieve this.","output":"Schema support for forming inferences in the human brain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic revolutionised the practice of oral & maxillofacial surgery in addition to almost all specialties in health care across the globe.

It is worth to highlight the use of the developed model as a tool to analyze the influence of the temperature on the performance of microalgae cultures at large scale.

Although it is well established that some fraction of the expiratory airflow leaks around the edges of the mask, it is unclear how these leakage airflows affect the overall efficiency with which masks block emission of expiratory aerosol particles. Here, we show experimentally that the aerosol particle concentrations in the leakage airflows around a surgical mask are reduced compared to no mask wearing, with the magnitude of reduction dependent on the direction of escape (out the top, the sides, or the bottom). Because the actual leakage flowrate in each direction is difficult to measure, we use a Monte Carlo approach to estimate flow-corrected particle emission rates for particles having diameters in the range 0.5C20 m. in all orientations. From these, we derive a flow-weighted overall number-based particle removal efficiency for the mask. The overall mask efficiency, accounting both for air that passes through the mask and for leakage flows, is reduced compared to the through-mask filtration efficiency, from 93 to 70% for talking, but from only 94C90% for coughing. These results demonstrate that leakage flows due to imperfect sealing do decrease mask efficiencies for reducing emission of expiratory particles, but even with such leakage surgical masks provide substantial control.","output":"Expiratory aerosol particle escape from surgical masks due to imperfect sealing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":" medida que a pandemia SARS-CoV-2 alcan?a a escala planetria multiplicam-se as respostas polticas de combate  doen?a Covid-19.

Proper management of an increasing number of home-quarantined individuals created a significant challenge for health care authorities and professionals. This was especially true when considering the importance of remote surveillance to detect signs of disease progression and consequently regulate access to hospitals and intensive care units on a priority basis. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we report on an initiative promoted to cope with the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Spring/Summer of 2020, in the Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy. A purposefully built app named TreCovid19 was designed to provide dedicated health care staff with a ready-to-use tool for remotely monitoring patients with progressive symptoms of COVID-19, who were home-quarantined during the first wave of the epidemic, and to focus on those patients who, based on their self-reported clinical data, required a quick response from health care professionals. METHODS: TreCovid19 was rapidly developed to facilitate the monitoring of a selected number of home-quarantined patients with COVID-19 during the very first epidemic wave. The app was built on top of an existing eHealth platform, already in use by the local health authority to provide home care, with the following functionalities: (1) to securely collect and link demographic and clinical information related to the patients and (2) to provide a two-way communication between a multidisciplinary health care team and home-quarantined patients. The system supported patients to self-assess their condition and update the multidisciplinary team on their health status. The system was used between March and June 2020 in the province of Trento. RESULTS: A dedicated multidisciplinary group of health care professionals adopted the platform over a period of approximately 3 months (from March-end to June 2020) to monitor a total of 170 patients with confirmed COVID-19 during home quarantine. All patients used the system until the end of the initiative. The TreCovid19 system has provided useful insights of possible viability and impact of a technological-organizational asset to manage a potentially critical workload for the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of a relevant number of quarantined patients, notwithstanding its limitations given the rapid implementation of the whole initiative. CONCLUSIONS: The technological and organizational model adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was developed and finalized in a relatively short period during the initial few weeks of the epidemic. The system successfully supported the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of an increasing number of home-quarantined patients and provided valuable data in terms of disease surveillance.","output":"Use of eHealth Platforms and Apps to Support Monitoring and Management of Home-Quarantined Patients With COVID-19 in the Province of Trento, Italy: App Development and Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The objectives of this study are to assess the relationship between media exposure and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and to highlight the underlying mechanisms mediated by risk perception. Methods: This survey was conducted online in China from February 1st to February 10th, 2020. A total of 2,858 Chinese citizens aged 18 years from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional study. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess media exposure, PTSS, and risk perception. Results: The prevalence of respondents with heightened PTSS scores was 22.2%. After controlling for covariates, media exposure (more than five times a day) was significantly and positively associated with a high level of PTSS (B = 4.11, p < 0.001), and risk perception (worry and severity) significantly mediated the relationship between media exposure and PTSS (all 95% CIs did not include 0). Conclusions: Based on these findings, the frequency of media exposure was associated with PTSS. Risk perception (worry and severity) mediated the relationship between media exposure and PTSS.

The PTEC is 25% transparent, which can be varied according to the necessity of the utilizer. The X-ray diffraction of material and electric characterization of module i.e., open-circuited voltage (VOC) and Seebeck coefficient were performed. The experimental observations disclose that in the proposed PTEC module with an increment in the average temperature (TAvg) from 34 to 60 C, results in the rise of VOC a 2.4 times. However, by modifying the size of heat-absorbing top electrode and by increasing the temperature gradient through the addition of water coolant under the bottom electrode, an uplift in the champion device results in as increment of VOC a5.5 times and Seebeck coefficient obtained was -250 V/0C, respectively. Results show that not only the selection of material but also the external modifications in the device highly effective the power efficiency of the devices. The proposed modules can generate electric power from light and utilize the penetrating sunlight inside the room and for the heating of the water which also acts as a coolant. These semitransparent thermoelectric cells can be built-in within windows and roofs of buildings and can potentially contribute to green energy harvesting, in situations where movement is restricted locally or globally.","output":"A novel and stable way for energy harvesting from Bi2Te3Se alloy based semitransparent photo-thermoelectric module"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus 2019 [COVID-19] pandemic has posed challenges in the routine care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD].

We considered a material with high hydrogen bonding capacity (cellulose) and a material capable of strong hydrophobic interactions (graphite). Initially, the spike adsorbs to both surfaces through essentially the same residues belonging to the receptor binding subunit of its three monomers. Adsorption onto cellulose stabilizes in this configuration, with the help of a large number of hydrogen bonds developed between cellulose and the three receptor-binding domains of the glycoprotein spike. In the case of adsorption onto graphite, the initial adsorption configuration is not stable and the surface induces a substantial deformation of the glycoprotein spike with a large number of adsorbed residues not pertaining to the binding subunits of the spike monomers.","output":"Computer simulations of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and different surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Open distance learning has become a new norm in medical education since the COVID-19 pandemic. The abrupt shift from conventional medical education to fully virtual learning deserves a reflection on how it affected the learning motivation among medical students.

Uncertainties surrounding CFS/ME etiology may impact the interpretation of CFS/ME in schools. Thus, school personnel need information from health care providers to make adequate adaptations to education and social life at school for these students. Objectives: To explore teachers, counselors, and school nurses' experiences with adapting education for students with CFS/ME aged 13C19 in secondary and high schools. Design: A qualitative study with focus group interviews and individual interviews performed face-to-face or digitally between November 2020 and March 2021. Data were analyzed using Systematic text condensation. Participants: Six teachers, two counselors, and four school nurses in secondary and high school participated. Results: Adapting education for students with CFS/ME was challenging, especially before the students received a diagnosis. The challenges were related to identifying the students' adaptational needs, maintaining a teacher-student relationship due to school absence, difficulties in maintaining continuity of education, and uncertainty regarding the diagnosis. Successful adaptations were related to quickly reacting to school absence, early referral to educational, psychological services, a close collaboration with the school management, and the development of digital teaching for students with CFS/ME. Interdisciplinary collaboration and a clear, constructive plan with adaptive measures, including maintained teacher-student communication and educational and social adaptations, may be useful in preventing the losses, young people, with CFS/ME experience.

With an increase in online learning and evaluation platforms especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the off-topic detection system can be very useful to check essays that are mainly submitted online. In this paper, we answer the question: given a prompt and an essay written in Pakistani English, can the process of detecting whether the essay is off-topic or not be reliably and completely autonomized with zero human intervention using currently available tools and techniques? For this purpose, we explore and implement various embedding techniques proposed in recent years to extract similarity or dissimilarity features between question and response, and compare the performance of these techniques using 10 benchmark data sets and 6 classifiers. With different classifiers and different datasets along with different embeddings, we conclude that combining word mover distance, average word embeddings and idf weighted word embeddings together and then using random forest as the classifier is the best combination for off-topic essay detection.

It is not evident whether the benefits of this procedure overcome the potential increased risk. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare SILC with conventional multi-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (MILC). METHODS Data from randomized, controlled trials published up to December 2011 and comparing SILC versus MILC were extracted. The primary end point was overall morbidity. A fixed-effect model was applied to summarize the study outcomes in the meta-analysis, and a random-effect model was used in the sensitivity analysis. The outcome measures were relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD); a RR of <1.0 or a negative MD indicated a more favorable outcome after SILC. Publication bias was assessed by a funnel plot, and heterogeneity was tested by the I (2) measure and subgroup analyses. RESULTS A total of 12 trials (996 patients) were included. Mortality was nil in both treatment groups; the overall RR for morbidity was 1.36 (p = 0.098). The mean operating time was 47.2 min for MILC and 58.1 min for SILC (MD 9.47 min; p < 0.001). The visual analog scale pain score at 24 h after surgery was 2.96 in MILC and 2.34 in SILC (MD -0.64; p = 0.058), but sensitivity analysis of the four studies deemed at low risk of bias for pain assessment, according to blinding and postoperative analgesic protocols, showed significance at -0.43 points (95 % confidence interval -0.87 to 0.00; p = 0.049). Cosmetic outcome scored better in the SILC group, with its standardized MD being equal to 1.16 (95 % confidence interval 0.57 to 1.75; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In selected patients, SILC has similar overall morbidity compared with MILC; further, it results in better cosmetic satisfaction and reduced postoperative pain despite longer operative time.","output":"Is single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy safe?

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a HIPAA-compliant application that allows physicians to call patients from their personal cell phones is associated with an increase in physician productivity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used a 100% sample of Medicare claims and longitudinal physician-level data to examine whether physician use of a smartphone application that enables physician-patient phone calls is associated with changes in Medicare patient volume and services. We compared early adopters of the application, 31,577 physicians providing Part B services who initiated use of the application between January 2014 and December 2017, with later adopters, 22,988 physicians who initiated use between January 2018 and July 2019. MAIN MEASURES: Physician productivity was measured as total Medicare Part B beneficiaries, total Part B services provided, the number of Part B beneficiaries with any evaluation and management (E&M) service, the total number of E&M services provided, and the average number of E&M services provided per beneficiary. KEY RESULTS: Following application use, there was a 0.52 increase (95% CI: 0.19 to 0.85) in the monthly number of Part B beneficiaries seen. This difference translates to a 0.8% increase in Part B beneficiaries. Similar increases were observed for the number of unique beneficiaries for which the physician provided E&M servicesa 0.50 increase (95% CI: 0.27 to 0.73) or 1.2%.

Some nutritional factors (zinc and selenium) may remodel these changes leading to a possible escaping of diseases with subsequent healthy ageing, because they are especially involved in improving immune functions as well as antioxidant defense. Experiments performed in vitro (human lymphocytes exposed to endotoxins) and in vivo (old mice or young mice fed with low zinc dietary intake) show that zinc is important for immune response both innate and adoptive. Selenium provokes zinc release by Metallothioneins (MT), via reduction of glutathione peroxidase. This fact is crucial in ageing because high MT may be unable to release zinc with subsequent low intracellular free zinc ion availability for immune response. Taking into account the existence of zinc transporters (ZnT and ZIP family) for cellular zinc efflux and influx, respectively, the association between ZnT and MT is important in maintaining satisfactory intracellular zinc homeostasis in ageing. Improved immune performance occur in elderly after physiological zinc supplementation, which also induces prolonged survival in old, nude and neonatal thymectomized mice. The association zinc plus selenium improves humoral immunity in old subjects after influenza vaccination. Therefore, zinc and selenium are relevant for immunosenescence in order to achieve healthy ageing and longevity.","output":"Role of Zinc and Selenium in Oxidative Stress and Immunosenescence: Implications for Healthy Ageing and Longevity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep neural networks have increasingly been used as an auxiliary tool in healthcare applications, due to their ability to improve performance of several diagnosis tasks. However, these methods are not widely adopted in clinical settings due to the practical limitations in the reliability, generalizability, and interpretability of deep learning based systems. As a result, methods have been developed that impose additional constraints during network training to gain more control as well as improve interpretabilty, facilitating their acceptance in healthcare community. In this work, we investigate the benefit of using Orthogonal Spheres (OS) constraint for classification of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. The OS constraint can be written as a simple orthonormality term which is used in conjunction with the standard cross-entropy loss during classification network training. Previous studies have demonstrated significant benefits in applying such constraints to deep learning models. Our findings corroborate these observations, indicating that the orthonormality loss function effectively produces improved semantic localization via GradCAM visualizations, enhanced classification performance, and reduced model calibration error. Our approach achieves an improvement in accuracy of 1.6% and 4.8% for two- and three-class classification, respectively;similar results are found for models with data augmentation applied. In addition to these findings, our work also presents a new application of the OS regularizer in healthcare, increasing the post-hoc interpretability and performance of deep learning models for COVID-19 classification to facilitate adoption of these methods in clinical settings.

Israels vaccination campaign was launched on December 20, and within 2.5 weeks, 20% of Israelis had received their first dose. Afterwards, the pace slowed. It took an additional 4 weeks to increase from 20 to 40% and yet another 6 weeks to increase from 40 to 60%. Initially, uptake was low among young adults, and two religious/cultural minority groups - ultra-Orthodox Jews and Israeli Arabs, but their uptake increased markedly over time. In the first quarter of 2021, Israel had to enhance access to the vaccine, address a moderate amount of vaccine hesitancy in its general population, and also address more intense pockets of vaccine hesitancy among young adults and religious/cultural minority groups. A continued high rate of infection during the months of February and March, despite broad vaccination coverage at the time, created confusion about vaccine effectiveness, which in turn contributed to vaccine hesitancy. Among Israeli Arabs, some residents of smaller villages encountered difficulties in reaching vaccination sites, and that also slowed the rate of vaccination. The challenges were addressed via a mix of messaging, incentives, extensions to the initial vaccine delivery system, and other measures. Many of the measures addressed the general population, while others were targeted at subgroups with below-average vaccination rates. Once the early adopters had been vaccinated, it took hard, creative work to increase population coverage from 40 to 60% and beyond. Significantly, some of the capacities and strategies that helped Israel address vaccine hesitancy and geographic access barriers are different from those that enabled it to procure, distribute and administer the vaccines. Some of these strategies are likely to be relevant to other countries as they progress from the challenges of securing an adequate vaccine supply and streamlining distribution to the challenge of encouraging vaccine uptake.

The results indicated that among all treatments conventional Western medical therapy (WM) plus Dengzhanxixin injection (DZXX) led to the best improvement in the clinical efficacy and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) to forced vital capacity (FVC) (FEV(1)/FVC), with surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA)=80.47% and 98.55%, respectively. Moreover, Shenmai injection (SM) plus WM and Reduning injection (RDN) plus WM led to the best improvement in the FEV(1) (SUCRA=80.18%) and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to the predicted value (FEV(1)%, SUCRA=87.28%). Shengmai injection (SGM) plus WM led to the most considerable shortening in the length of hospital stay (SUCRA=94.70%). Cluster analysis revealed that WM+DZXX had the most favorable response for clinical efficacy and FEV(1), as well as clinical efficacy and FEV(1)/FVC, WM+RDN had the most favorable response for clinical efficacy and FEV(1)%, WM+SGM had the most favorable response for clinical efficacy and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: WM+DZXX, WM+RDN, and WM+SGM were noted to be the optimum treatment regimens for improving in clinical efficacy, FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC, FEV(1)% and reducing the hospital stay length of AECOPD patients. Considering the limitations this NMA may have, the current results warrant further verification via additional high-quality studies.","output":"Chinese Medical Injections for Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Network Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Naveen Madhavan PhD MBCS, Senior Product Specialist (Pathology) at the NHS Wales Informatics Service, assesses how COVID-19 has changed our perceptions of the workplace and explores the likely lasting influence for the virus on digital transformation.","output":"How Covid-19 Changed The Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular pathology of multi-organ injuries in COVID-19 patients remains unclear, preventing effective therapeutics development.

Decreases in mass concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and its components were observed during the lockdown with reductions of 32C51%. The dominant contributor of PM was organic aerosol (OA), and results of a hybrid environmental receptor model indicated OA was composed of four primary OA (POA) factors (hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), cooking OA (COA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), and coal combustion OA (CCOA)) and two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors (less-oxidized OOA (LO-OOA) and more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA)). The mass concentrations of OA factors decreased from before to during the lockdown over a range of 17% to 58%, and they were affected by control measures and secondary processes. Correlations of secondary aerosols/CO with O(x) (NO(2) + O(3)) and aerosol liquid water content indicated that photochemical oxidation had a greater effect on the formation of nitrate and two OOAs than sulfate; however, aqueous-phase reaction presented a more complex effect on secondary aerosols formation at different relative humidity condition.

Thus, identifying the host pathways essential for the virus replication may lead to potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The mechanisms and pathways explored by SARS-CoV-2 to support its replication within host cells are not fully known. Lipid droplets (LD) are organelles with major functions in lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis and intracellular transport, and have multiple roles in infections and inflammation. Here we described that monocytes from COVID-19 patients have an increased LD accumulation compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative donors. In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection were seen to modulate pathways of lipid synthesis and uptake as monitored by testing for CD36, SREBP-1, PPAR, and DGAT-1 expression in monocytes and triggered LD formation in different human cell lines. LDs were found in close apposition with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and double-stranded (ds)-RNA in infected Vero cells. Electron microscopy (EM) analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells show viral particles colocalizing with LDs, suggestive that LDs might serve as an assembly platform. Pharmacological modulation of LD formation by inhibition of DGAT-1 with A922500 significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as reduced production of mediators pro-inflammatory response.

Addition of anti-CD4 or anti-Iad monoclonal antibodies to the culture suppressed IL-2 production. These results suggest that the response involved typical receptor-mediated activation of T cells. Surprisingly, reciprocal mixing experiments with a coculture of T cells from infected mice and APC from either infected or naive mice resulted in the production of IL-2. The absence of viral antigens in spleen cells 1 month after infection, as indicated by their inability to induce the proliferation of T-cell clones specific for the viral antigens, suggest that the T cells from mice 1 month after infection were not responding to the viral antigens. The inoculum components other than the virus did not induce this immune response. We also found that the frequency of self-reactive but not alloreactive IL-2-producing T cells in the spleens of infected mice was 3- to 10-fold higher than that in naive mice.

The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of antibodies to BPAG1e in the experimental BP models. We generated Bpag1 conditional knockout (Bpag1-cKO) mice, where the KO of Bpag1 is restricted to keratin 5-expressing epithelial cells. Bpag1-cKO mice were immunized with the C-terminal portion of BPAG1e, and the splenocytes were injected into Rag2-/- mice intravenously. The recipient mice presented with erosion on the feet and tails. Microscopic examination showed subepidermal blisters and a linear deposition of IgG at the dermal-epidermal junction. To assess the potential role of trauma on BP development, we inflicted surface wounds on the dorsum of the Rag2-/- recipient mice after adoptive transfer. The wounded Rag2-/- mice had increased morbidity and severity of BP-like symptoms. Moreover, the depletion of B cells from splenocytes abolished a subepidermal blistering phenotype in vivo.

TREAT-CAD tests the hypothesis, that aspirin is as safe and effective as vitamin K antagonists. Patients and methods TREAD-CAD is a Prospective, Randomised controlled, Open-labelled, multicentre, non-inferiority trial with Blinded assessment of outcome Events (PROBE-design). Key eligibility criteria are (i) clinical symptoms attributable to cervical artery dissection and (ii) verification of the cervical artery dissection diagnosis by established magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Patients are randomised to receive either Aspirin 300 mg daily or vitamin K antagonists for 90 days. Results Primary outcomes are assessed at 14  10 days (magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examination) and at 90  30 days (clinical examinations). The primary endpoint is a composite outcome measure - labelled Cerebrovascular Ischemia, major Hemorrhagic events or Death (CIHD) - and includes (i) occurrence of any stroke (including retinal infarction), (ii) new ischaemic lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, (iii) any major extracranial haemorrhage, (iv) any symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, (v) any new haemorrhagic lesion visible on paramagnetic-susceptible sequences and (vi) death. Discussion After database closure, (i) central verification of cervical artery dissection diagnosis will be done by two experienced raters, (ii) adjudication of outcome events will be performed by independent adjudication committees, separately for clinical and imaging outcomes.

The 1000-fold improvement in resolution provided by electron microscopy (EM) has allowed visualization of viruses, the existence of which had previously only been suspected as the causative agents of transmissible infectious disease. Viruses are grouped into families based on their morphology. Viruses from different families look different and these morphological variances are the basis for identification of viruses by EM. Electron microscopy initially came to prominence in diagnostic microbiology in the late 1960s when it was used in the rapid diagnosis of smallpox, by differentiating, on a morphological basis, poxviruses from the less problematic herpesviruses in skin lesions. Subsequently, the technique was employed in the diagnosis of other viral infections, such as hepatitis B and parvovirus B19. Electron microscopy has led to the discovery of many new viruses, most notably the various viruses associated with gastroenteritis, for which it remained the principal diagnostic method until fairly recent times. Development of molecular techniques, which offer greater sensitivity and often the capacity to easily process large numbers of samples, has replaced EM in many areas of diagnostic virology. Hence the role of EM in clinical virology is evolving with less emphasis on diagnosis and more on research, although this is likely only to be undertaken in specialist centres. However, EM still offers tremendous advantages to the microbiologist, both in the speed of diagnosis and the potential for detecting, by a single test, any viral pathogen or even multiple pathogens present within a sample. There is continuing use of EM for the investigation of new and emerging agents, such as SARS and human monkeypox virus. Furthermore, EM forms a vital part of the national emergency response programme of many countries and will provide a frontline diagnostic service in the event of a bioterrorism incident, particularly in the scenario of a deliberate release of smallpox virus. In the field of bacteriology, EM is of little use diagnostically, although some bacterial pathogens can be identified in biopsy material processed for EM examination. Electron microscopy has been used, however, to elucidate the structure and function of many bacterial features, such as flagellae, fimbriae and spores and in the study of bacteriophages. The combined use of EM and gold-labelled antibodies provides a powerful tool for the ultrastructural localisation of bacterial and viral antigens.","output":"Application of transmission electron microscopy to the clinical study of viral and bacterial infections: Present and future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2020 will be remembered as the year of the Covid-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2: a virus that suddenly spread worldwide affecting the health and the life of millions of people of all ages and putting a strain on welfare, economic, scientific and politic structures of all the Nations that have tried to respond to the multiple needs of their populations facing many obstacles and difficulties.

To detect respiratory RNA virus infections, a reverse transcription (RT) step is implemented to create cDNA molecules that can serve as template in the qPCR step. However, positive RT-qPCR results can be found long after patient recovery, in part because the RT-qPCR can detect residual viral RNA genome fragments. To minimize the detection of such fragments, we here modified the RT-qPCR assay by replacing the routinely used random hexamers with an oligonucleotide that binds to the 3' end of the viral genome. We demonstrate that this method allows us to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious samples. Moreover, in clinical samples obtained over 15 days after the onset of symptoms, we observe that the modified RT-qPCR protocol yields significantly fewer positive results compared to a commercial RT-qPCR test. No significantly different results were found compared to the commercial test when SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples were tested within 5 days of the onset of symptoms, suggesting that the modification has a similar sensitivity for detecting infectious viral RNA.

This is because such an approach will take into consideration relevant factors including the likelihood that a patient will respond to given therapeutics based on their disease phenotype. Unfortunately, the application of this precision medicine paradigm in the daily treatment of patients has been greatly hampered by the lack of robust biomarkers, in particular biomarkers for determining early treatment responsiveness. Lipid mediators are central in the regulation of host immune responses during both the initiation and resolution of inflammation. Amongst lipid mediators, the specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) govern immune cells to promote the resolution of inflammation. These autacoids are produced via the stereoselective conversion of essential fatty acids to yield molecules that are dynamically regulated during inflammation and exert potent immunoregulatory activities. Furthermore, there is an increasing appreciation for the role that these mediators play in conveying the biological actions of several anti-inflammatory therapeutics, including statins and aspirin. Identification and quantitation of these mediators has traditionally been achieved using hyphenated mass spectrometric techniques, primarily liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Recent advances in the field of chromatography and mass spectrometry have increased both the robustness and the sensitivity of this approach and its potential deployment for routine clinical diagnostics.

This paper compares three survey instruments for the assessment of life in pregnancy/postpartum and investigates the effects of the timing of early-life stress for emotional/behavioral difficulties (EBD) of offspring during mid/late childhood and adolescence. METHODS: Observational data were obtained from the European Longitudinal Cohort Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC-CZ), which included 4811 pregnancies in two Czech metropolitan areas. We used data collected between 1991 and 2010 at 20 weeks of pregnancy (T1), after delivery (T2), at 6 months postpartum (T3), and at child's age of 7 years (T4), 11 years (T5), 15 years (T6), and 18 years (T7). Life stress was assessed with (1) the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), (2) a stressful life events (SLE) count based on 42-item inventory, and (3) the SLE measure weighted by perceived stressfulness (PS). Each stress measure was administered at T1, T2, and T3. Child's EBD were assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at T4, T5, T6, and T7. RESULTS: Each stress measure independently predicted long-term EBD. The best data fit was obtained in a model combining EPDS and SLE. Effect sizes for SLEs decreased between the first half of pregnancy and postpartum, while the effect of EPDS increased. DISCUSSION: SLE-based methods capture an aspect of perinatal stress not adequately assessed by EPDS. Combination of psychological distress measures and SLE-based measures is optimal in predicting EBD of the child.

The Transactional Model of eHealth Literacy and subsequent Transactional eHealth Literacy Instrument may provide a feasible option for measuring eHealth literacy. However, this instrument has yet to be validated, which is the aim of this study. We conducted an online cross-sectional study among 236 Vietnamese young people. Using exploratory factor analysis, we ensured that a model consisting of four factors had the best fit (RMSEA = 0.116; CFI = 0.907) and the highest internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.96). A confirmatory factor analysis tested measurement invariance at four levels: configural, metric, scalar, and strict invariance. Only metric invariance was partially invariant, while the rest tested fully invariant. Even with partial metric invariance, there is reason to assume that functional, communicative, critical, and translational eHealth literacy (the four levels according to the transactional model) are consistently measured when deploying the Transactional eHealth Literacy Instrument across groups. In other words, this study suggests the instrument can be used for comparisons across groups and has the potential to generate high-quality data usable for informing change agents as to whether a particular population is proficient enough to adopt novel eHealth innovations.","output":"Factorial Structure of the Transactional eHealth Literacy Among Vietnamese Youth: An Instrument Validation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parents are a determinant factor in a childs development of motor skills.

Although the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have high homology, the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 differ significantly from those of SARS. How and whether SARS-CoV-2 evades (cellular) immune surveillance requires further elucidation. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to major histocompability complex class &#921; (MHC-&#921;) down-regulation both in vitro and in vivo. The viral protein encoded by open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all viral proteins, directly interacts with MHC-&#921; molecules and mediates their down-regulation. In ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-&#921; molecules are selectively targeted for lysosomal degradation via autophagy. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are much less sensitive to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Because ORF8 protein impairs the antigen presentation system, inhibition of ORF8 could be a strategy to improve immune surveillance.","output":"The ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates immune evasion through down-regulating MHC-"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 'Homecoming Tradition Restriction' was one of the government's policies to terminate and limit the spread of the Covid-19 Virus Apart from being a media for socializing government policies, Twitter can be utilized by the public to convey responses, opinions, and criticisms towards government policies This study aims were to determine public sentiment towards the 'Homecoming Tradition Restriction' policy This study uses a data mining approach to classify public sentiments delivered via Twitter Sentiment classification models are built using two algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Na?ve Bayes Na?ve Bayes produces the highest performance measurement with a recall of 80% and an F-measure of 71 32% This study shows that the majority of people support this government policy as indicated by the majority of sentiments that have been collected is positive, and also backed by the fact that the total number of homecoming vehicles during Eid Holiday was decreased by 62% from the previous year This shows that social media data is relevant enough to be used in the assessment of public responses to government policies ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Sentiment Analysis on 'Homecoming Tradition Restriction' Policy on Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The problem and the aim of the study: COVID-19 pandemic had affected all sectors including the educational sector The educational system shifted from the traditional face to face teaching method to use online means in order to ensure the safety of the students and the social distancing These changes also affected the roles of the educational members including the school counselors Therefore, the study aims to investigate the school counseling skills needed in light of COVID-19 Research Method: The study relied on the descriptive approach and administrated by a questionnaire to collect the data from the school counselors The study sample consisted of (400) Jordanian schools counselors from both genders whom chosen randomly to respond to the study tool Results: The study found that the main required skills are the cognitive, emotional and humanitarian skills, professional and ethical skills, technical and electronic skills The study found that the most needed counseling skills are similar to the traditional education, but due to the shift from the from face to face education to the distance education the most concentration will be on the counselors IT skills ? 2021 Karadeniz Technical University All rights reserved","output":"School counseling skills needed to activate distance learning in light of Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An elderly patient presented with acute-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia.

The hand hygiene is now being very essential in the public. Compliance with hand hygiene recommendations is critical to reducing colonization and infection of the hands of all people. Hand hygiene is of utmost importance because it may be contaminated easily from direct contact with airborne microorganism droplets from coughs and sneezes. Particularly in situations like pandemic outbreak, it is crucial to interrupt and cut the transmission chain of the virus by the practice of proper hand sanitization. The use of hand sanitizers drastically reduce the transmission of microorganisms to patients, ultimately reducing morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with healthcare-associated infections (HCAI). It can be achieved with contact isolation and strict infection control tool like maintaining good hand hygiene in hospital settings and in public. The success of the hand sanitization solely depends on the use of effective hand disinfecting agents formulated in various types and forms such as bathl soaps, water-based or alcohol-based hand sanitizer, with the latter being widely used in hospital settings. To date, most of the effective hand sanitizer products are alcohol-based formulations containing 70%C95% of alcohol as it can denature the proteins of microbes and the ability to inactivate viruses.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1994 and December 2018, 491 patients with RCC who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy at 2 institutions were enrolled in this study. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) analyses were performed to distinguish the differences in postoperative recurrence and survival between patients stratified by an optimal cut-off value of AAPR. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were established to determine the independent prognostic factors after propensity score weighting. RESULTS: Of the total 491 patients, 51 patients (10.4%) developed local recurrence or distant metastasis and 26 patients (5.3%) died of disease during the follow-up period. Patients with AAPR<0.41 had significantly lower rates of RFS and CSS than those of patients with AAPR0.41 in multivariate analysis (P < .001 and P = .027, respectively). After propensity scroe matching analyses, this difference was still remained for RFS (P < .001). However, AAPR was not an independent prognostic factor for CSS but the value was almost pregnant (HR = 2.674; 95%CI = 0.872-8.203; P = .086). CONCLUSION: AAPR can serve as a novel and useful tool to refine prognosis in patients with non-metastatic RCC treated with partial or radical nephrectomy. These findings suggest that AAPR could be a promising prognostic factor for prediction of recurrence and survival in patients with non-metastatic RCC who undergo nephrectomy.","output":"Albumin-to-Alkaline Phosphatase Ratio as a Novel Prognostic Factor in Patients Undergoing Nephrectomy for Non-Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: Propensity Score Matching Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives : Due to the spread of the Omicron variant, many countries have experienced COVID-19 case numbers unseen since the start of the pandemic. We aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics of Omicron with prior variants and different strains of influenza, to provide context for public health responses. Methods : We developed transmission models for SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as influenza, in which transmission, death, and vaccination rates were taken to be time-varying. We fit our model based on publicly available data in South Africa, the United States and Canada. We used this model to evaluate the relative transmissibility and mortality of Omicron compared to previous variants and influenza. Results : We find that Omicron is more transmissible and less fatal than both seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza, as well as the Delta variant; these characteristics make Omicron epidemiologically more similar to influenza than it is to Delta. We estimate that as of February 7, 2022, booster doses have prevented 4.29  10 7 and 1.14  10 6 Omicron infections in the United States and Canada, respectively.

It is predicted that this concept will bring positive change to the citizens dietary habits; however, the residents in rural areas may experience less exposure to this campaign, or lack of understanding to the concept of Malaysian Healthy Plate. Hence, this study aims to assess factors affecting the campaigns awareness among the rural population in Malaysia. The National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2019 focused on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). Data collection was carried out from July to September 2019. Questionnaires that pertained to awareness, knowledge, and practice were included in this nationwide survey. Data collected from adults in rural areas aged 18 years old and above were used as respondents for the statistical analysis. Complex sample multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between the independent variables and awareness of the Malaysian Healthy Plate concept. About four fifths (83.2%) of rural adults in Malaysia were unaware of the Malaysian Healthy Plate concept after three years of implementation. The unawareness was significantly higher in males (91.3%), adults aged above 60 years old (91.8%), adults of others ethnicity (88.5%), those without formal education (95.2%), widows/widowers/divorcees (88.1%), retirees/adults who were not working (88.4%), and household income at the bottom 40% (B40) (85.0%).

Evidence showing extensive pathophysiology and pharmacology CBL learning value in preclinical students was derived in the setting of in-person CBL, but little is known about best practices for virtual zoom CBL. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools shifted CBL rapidly to virtual modalities, providing an opportunity to study outcomes related to conducting second year medical school (M2) systems pathophysiology and pharmacology CBL by zoom or other virtual learning platforms. At the UCF College of Medicine, we compared M2 cohorts who experienced CBL virtually vs in-person to evaluate their perceptions of various learning themes. Our objective is to share the outcomes of a survey sent to learners who had experienced both types of CBL as well as to report end-of-module evaluation data for cohorts with CBL conducted in-person versus virtually. METHODS Students (N=42) who had completed their preclinical education using both zoom and in-person CBL, volunteered to answer Likert survey items related to the following themes: Learning-Critical thinking (L-T), Collaborative-team learning (Coll-T), Engagement-Motivation (E-M), and Empathy (Emp) for zoom vs in-person cases. Responses to general end-of-module general survey items on CBL (N=116) from an in-person cohort were compared to responses from a zoom only CBL cohort (N=123) to obtain perceptions from an entire class. Survey items were presented using a Likert scale and the percent affirmative to survey questions was reported for end-of-module items. The Likert anchor was as follows: 5:Strongly agree, 4:Mostly agree, 3:Neutral, 2:Mostly disagree, 1:Strongly disagree. Module data percent affirmative combined responses 4 & 5. RESULTS Data are represented as mean Likert + SD for zoom (Z) vs in-person (IP), respectively, for the themes: L-T (Z:3.1+0.6 vs IP:4.3+0.6), Coll-T (Z:3.0+0.7 vs IP:4.3+0.6), E-M (Z: 3.2+0.7 vs IP:4.2+0.7), Emp (Z:2.0+0.9 vs IP:3.3+1.2). Results showed zoom CBL was ranked lower than in-person CBL for all categories; significance was determined by paired t-tests (p<0.01). Module data comparing a Z cohort with a previous IP cohort showed, reported as % affirmative for Z vs IP, the following by theme: Coll-L (Z:69% vs IP:75%), L-T(Z:80% vs IP:84%), preparation for CBL (Z:96% vs IP:88%). When given the option to work as a small group or individual on CBL, 16% of the Z cohort elected group work whereas 69% of the IP cohort elected collaborative work over individual completion. CONCLUSION The data show students, when specifically asked to compare 2 methods of CBL on a survey, perceive the in-person CBL promoted more collaborative team learning, thinking, engagement, and empathy than zoom CBL. At the end of modules, a majority in both cohorts generally agreed that either zoom or in-person CBL promoted learning, but the in-person cohort tended to rate their CBL learning experience more highly. After working in-person, but not by zoom, students were more likely to elect collaborative learning when it was optional, suggesting that the in-person interactions changed attitudes and behavior about collaborative learning. Given an additional goal of small group CBL is to develop team skills, this finding suggests in-person CBL has some specific benefits.","output":"Second Year Medical Students Perceive In-person Pathophysiology and Pharmacology Case-Based Sessions Promote Learning More Effectively than Zoom."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a lineage B coronavirus, causing the worldwide outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Despite genetically closed to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 seems to possess enhanced infectivity and subtle different clinical features, which may hamper the early screening of suspected patients as well as the control of virus transmission Unfortunately, there are few tools to predict the potential target organ damage and possible clinical manifestations caused by such novel coronavirus Methods: To solve this problem, we use the online single-cell sequence datasets to analyze the expression of the major receptor in host cells that mediates the virus entry, including angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and its co-expressed membrane endopeptidases Results: The results indicated the differential expression of ADAM10 and ADAM17 might contribute to the ACE2 shedding and affect the membrane ACE2 abundance We further confirm a putative furin-cleavage site reported recently in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which may facilitate the virus-cell fusion Based on these findings, we develop an approach that comprehensively analyzed the virus receptor expression, ACE2 shedding, membrane fusion activity, virus uptake and virus replication to evaluate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 to different human organs Conclusion: Our results indicate that, in addition to airway epithelia, cardiac tissue and enteric canals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as well ? 2021 Ma et al","output":"Ace2 shedding and furin abundance in target organs may influence the efficiency of sars-cov-2 entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a complex disease with many clinicopathological issues, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, renal, cutaneous, and coagulative ones; in addition, reactive arthritis has been reported by different authors.

METHODS: We reviewed and analyzed data on pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including basic information, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment, outcome, and follow-up results. RESULTS: A total of 74 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Of the 68 case patients whose epidemiological data were complete, 65 (65 of 68; 95.59%) were household contacts of adults. Cough (32.43%) and fever (27.03%) were the predominant symptoms of 44 (59.46%) symptomatic patients at onset of the illness.

Several research branches have been developed to tackle the problem from different perspectives, including Natural Language Processing and Big Data analysis, with the goal of providing valuable resources to support decision-making in a wide variety of fields. In this paper, we propose a real-time domain-specific clustering-based event-detection approach that integrates textual information coming, on one hand, from traditional newswires and, on the other hand, from microblogging platforms. The goal of the implemented pipeline is twofold: (i) providing insights to the user about the relevant events that are reported in the press on a daily basis;(ii) alerting the user about potentially important and impactful events, referred to as hot events, for some specific tasks or domains of interest. The algorithm identifies clusters of related news stories published by globally renowned press sources, which guarantee authoritative, noise-free information about current affairs;subsequently, the content extracted from microblogs is associated to the clusters in order to gain an assessment of the relevance of the event in the public opinion.

However, it can also place other stresses on workers outside of their work. This study determines the effect of COVID-19 on symptoms of negative and positive mental health and the workforce's experience with various sources of support. Effect modification by demographic variables was also studied. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study, conducted between April 2nd and May 4th 2020 (2 waves), led to a convenience sample of 4509 healthcare workers in Flanders (Belgium), including paramedics (40.6%), nurses (33.4%), doctors (13.4%) and management staff (12.2%). About three in four were employed in university and acute hospitals (29.6%), primary care practices (25.7%), residential care centers (21.3%) or care sites for disabled and mental healthcare. In each of the two waves, participants were asked how frequently (on a scale of 0 to 10) they experienced positive and negative mental health symptoms during normal circumstances and during last week, referred to as before and during COVID-19, respectively. These symptoms were stress, hypervigilance, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, unable to relax, fear, irregular lifestyle, flashback, difficulty concentrating, feeling unhappy and dejected, failing to recognize their own emotional response, doubting knowledge and skills, and feeling uncomfortable within the team. Associations between COVID-19 and mental health symptoms were estimated by cumulative logit models and reported as odds ratios. The needed support was our secondary outcome and was reported as the degree to which healthcare workers relied on sources of support and how they experienced them. RESULTS: All symptoms were significantly more pronounced during versus before COVID-19. For hypervigilance there was a twelvefold odds (OR 12.24, 95% CI 11.11-13.49) during versus before COVID-19. Positive professional symptoms such as the feeling that one can make a difference were less frequently experienced. The association between COVID-19 and mental health was generally strongest for the age group 30-49 years, females, nurses, and residential care centers. Healthcare workers reported to rely on support from relatives and peers. A considerable proportion, respectively 18% and 27%, reported the need for professional guidance from psychologists and more support from their leadership.

Bernard Vallat, director general of the OIE, made the statement, As a result of globalisation and climate change we are currently facing an unprecedented worldwide impact of emerging and re-emerging animal diseases and zoonoses. He is not alone in this thinking, but are we facing an unprecedented impact of diseases and are globalisation and climate change the main driving forces? This paper examines some historical disease outbreaks and the factors that played a role in their emergence and compares these with recent emerging diseases. In doing so it highlights certain challenges that face livestock producers and decision makers today as they grapple with emerging diseases. One of the driving forces for the emergence of diseases is translocation of people and their livestock and this has often been coupled with invading armies or peoples, political unrest and a concurrent environment of socio-economic upheaval. Contact between wild animals, domestic animals and people is another driving force involving the interaction between na?ve population groups that induces the emergence of new diseases. Pandemics are not new to human society and nor are many of the driving forces that caused them to occur in the past; what has changed is our increased knowledge and awareness of disease dynamics, allowing identification of challenges for the future and ways of addressing these. Modern farming practices often serve to amplify emerging infectious diseases and modern trade and transport mechanisms and routes have served to sometimes accelerate the spread of disease. How can we reduce the risks and should we only be worried about emerging infectious diseases or are emerging non-communicable diseases just as important in our modern society?

In Molinette Hospital, a new communication model between healthcare providers and families of COVID-19 affected patients was developed by a team of physicians and psychologists. The study's aims were to investigate caregivers' distress and to analyse their satisfaction with the communications provided. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among caregivers of patients of Molinette Hospital COVID wards. Between April and June 2020, all caregivers were contacted 2 weeks after the patient's discharge/death to assess their satisfaction with the communications received through an online survey. Results: A total of 155 caregivers completed the survey. Caregivers' distress level was found to be higher in women than men (p = 0.048) and in caregivers whose relative died compared to the caregivers whose relative was discharged (p < 0.001). More than 85% of caregivers defined communication excellent/very good; being male was associated with higher satisfaction levels than women ( = ?0.165, p = 0.046). Besides daily communication, 63 caregivers (40.6%) received additional support from a psychologist of the team. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study presenting, in an emergency, a new model of communication provided by a team of physicians and psychologists, and analyzing satisfaction with it. This model was highly appreciated by caregivers and it limited the discomfort caused by the restrictions on relatives' visits. It would be interesting to further evaluate the possibility of extending a communication model that includes doctors and psychologists in routine clinical practice.","output":"Interprofessional Communication Team for Caregivers of Patients Hospitalized in the COVID-19 Wards: Results From an Italian Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of anemia treatment with erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is controversial, particularly regarding optimal hemoglobin (Hb) target ranges METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT) with ESA to estimate the effect of different achieved Hb values on physical HRQOL and functionality We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PEDro, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases, until May 2020 Two authors independently extracted data from studies We included observational and RCTs that enrolled CKD patients undergoing anemia treatment with ESA with different achieved Hb levels among groups We excluded studies with achieved Hb &lt;9 g/dL For the meta-analysis, we included RCTs with control groups achieving Hb 10-11 5 g/dL and active groups with Hb &gt;11 5 g/dL We analyzed the standardized mean difference (SMD) between groups for physical HRQOL RESULTS: Among 8496 studies, fifteen RCTs and five observational studies were included for the systematic review We performed the meta-analysis in a subset of eleven eligible RCTs For physical role and physical function, SMDs were 0 0875 [95% CI: - 0 0025 - 0 178] and 0 08 [95% CI: - 0 03 - 0 19], respectively For fatigue, SMD was 0 16 [95% CI: 0 09-0 24] Subgroup analysis showed that trials with greater achieved Hb had greater pooled effects sizes - 0 21 [95% CI: 0 07-0 36] for Hb &gt; 13 g/dL vs 0 09 [95% CI: 0 02-0 16] for Hb 11 5-13 g/dL Proportion of older and long-term diabetic patients across studies were associated with lower effect sizes CONCLUSION: Achieved hemoglobin higher than currently recommended targets may be associated with small but potentially clinically significant improvement in fatigue, but not in physical role or physical function Younger and non-diabetic patients may experience more pronounced benefits of higher Hb levels after treatment with ESAs","output":"Physical health-related quality of life at higher achieved hemoglobin levels among chronic kidney disease patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Data on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are still scarce.

Antigen display on lactic acid bacteria is a reliable approach for efficient oral vaccination and preventing bowel diseases. To develop an oral vaccine against ETEC, the gene of the binding domain from heat-labile toxin (LTB), a key ETEC virulence factor, was codon-optimized and cloned into a construct containing a signal peptide and an anchor for display on L. lactis. Bioinformatics analysis showed a codon adaptation index of 0.95 for the codon-optimized gene. Cell surface expression of LTB was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and blotting. White New Zealand rabbits were immunized per os (PO) with the recombinant L. lactis, and the antibody titers were assayed with ELISA. In vitro neutralization assay was performed using mouse adrenal tumor cells and rabbit ileal loop test was performed as the in vivo assay. ELISA results indicated that oral administration of the engineered L. lactis elicited a significant production of IgA in the intestine. In vitro neutralization assay showed that the effect of the toxin could be neutralized with 500 g/ml of IgG isolated from the oral vaccine group. Furthermore, the dose of ETEC causing fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test showed a tenfold increase in rabbits immunized with either recombinant L. lactis or LTB protein compared to other groups. Our results imply that recombinant L. lactis could potentially be an effective live oral vaccine against ETEC toxicity.

Despite the ongoing controversies, HCQ was recommended for managing mild to moderate cases in Saudi Arabia . However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have been conducted in Saudi Arabia to assess its effectiveness. Methods A hospital-based retrospective cohort study involving 161 patients with COVID-19 was conducted from March 1 to May 20, 2020. The study was conducted at Prince Mohammed bin Abdul Aziz Hospital (PMAH). The population included hospitalized adults (age 18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Each eligible patient was followed from the time of admission until the time of discharge. Patients were classified into two groups according to treatment type: in the HCQ group, patients were treated with HCQ; in the SC group, patients were treated with other antiviral or antibacterial treatments according to Ministry of Health (MOH) protocols The outcomes were hospitalization days, ICU admission, and the need for mechanical ventilation. We estimated the differences in hospital length of stay and time in the ICU between the HCQ group and the standard care (SC) group using a multivariate generalized linear regression. The differences in ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were compared via logistic regression. All models were adjusted for age and gender variables. Results A total of 161 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Approximately 59% (n=95) received HCQ-based treatment, and 41% (n=66) received SC. Length of hospital stay and time in ICU in for patients who received HCQ based treatment was shorter than those who received SC. Similarly, there was less need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation among patients who received HCQ based treatment compared with SC, (8.6% vs. 10.7 and 3.1% vs. 9.1%). However, the regression analysis showed no significant difference between the two groups in terms of patient outcomes. Conclusion HCQ had a modest effect on hospital length stay and days in ICU compared with SC. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution. Larger observational studies and RCTs that evaluate the efficacy of HCQ in COVID-19 patients in the Saudi population are urgently needed.","output":"Comparing the impact of Hydroxychloroquine based regimens and standard treatment on COVID-19 patient outcomes: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has mandated rapid adoption of telehealth for surgical care. However, many surgical providers may be unfamiliar with telehealth. This study evaluates the perspectives of surgical providers practicing telehealth care during COVID-19 to help identify targets for surgical telehealth optimization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a single tertiary care center with telehealth capabilities, all department of surgery providers (attending surgeons, residents, fellows, and advanced practice providers) were emailed a voluntary survey focused on telehealth during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U analyses were performed as appropriate on responses. Text responses were thematically coded to identify key concepts. RESULTS: The completion rate was 41.3% (145/351). Providers reported increased telehealth usage relative to the pandemic (P < 0.001). Of respondents, 80% (116/145) had no formal telehealth training. Providers estimated that new patient video visits required less time than traditional visits (P = 0.001). Satisfaction was high for several aspects of video visits. Comparatively lower satisfaction scores were reported for the ability to perform physical exams (sensitive and nonsensitive) and to break bad news. The largest barriers to effective video visits were limited physical exams (55.6%; 45/81) and lack of provider or patient internet access/equipment/connection (34.6%; 28/81). Other barriers included ineffective communication and difficulty with fostering rapport. Concerns regarding video-to-telephone visit conversion were loss of physical exam/visual cues (34.3%; 24/70), less personal interactions (18.6%; 13/70), and reduced efficiency (18.6%; 13/70). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth remains a new experience for surgical providers despite its expansion.

Yet little is known about how perianaesthesia nurses who have been working in a COVID-ICU perceived their stress of conscience. The aim of this study was to: (1) describe and compare stress related to troubled conscience among perianaesthesia nurses in three countries who have been working in a COVID-ICU during the pandemic, (2) compare their levels of troubled conscience between working in a COVID-ICU and their usual workplace, and (3) compare nurses that usually work in an ICU department with nurses who usually work outside of the ICU. METHODS: A descriptive, international cross\\\\sectional online survey including the Stress of Conscience Questionnaire (SCQ) was distributed between organizational member countries of the International Collaboration of PeriAnaesthesia Nurses. RESULTS: A total of 246 nurses from three countries participated. Significant differences were found in stress of conscience when working in the Covid-ICU between Sweden 31.8 (8.6), Denmark 23.1 (8.6), and Netherlands 16.4 (6.5) p < 0.001. Significant differences were also found between nurses working in a COVID-ICU in contrast with their usual workplace: 23.1(5.6) versus 17.7(5.3), p < 0.001. The most stressful aspect of conscience reported was that work in the COVID-ICU was so demanding, nurses did not have sufficient energy to be involved with their family as much as they desired. No statistical differences were found between nurses that usually work in an ICU department with nurses who usually work outside of the ICU. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted stress of conscience among nurses working in the COVID-ICU. Swedish nurses were found to be more significantly impacted. This could be related to low numbers of existing ICU beds and ICU nurses prior to the pandemic necessitating a longer time required for working in a COVID-ICU. Stress of conscience also increased when working in the Covid-ICU compared to working in the usual workplace, and the most stressing aspect reported was that COVID-ICU work was so demanding that nurses did not have the energy to devote themselves to their family as they would have liked.","output":"Stress of conscience of COVID-19 among perianaesthesia nurses having worked in a COVID-ICU during the coronavirus pandemic: an international perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Local communities generally play a crucial role during a disaster, so their involvement in pre-disaster capacity development may prove beneficial in the face of a disaster threat.

However, since the sub-variables did not show any significance for being predictors, this implies that, even though there is a significant reliance between the pre-event DRR context and the individual attributes, the individual attribute could be regarded more as a modifier than a predictor.","output":"The Resilient Community: Strengthening People-Centered Disaster Risk Reduction in the Merapi Volcano Community, Java, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host cellular receptor that locks onto the surface spike protein of the 2002 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and of the novel, highly transmissible and deadly 2019 SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. One strategy to avoid the virus infection is to design peptides by extracting the human ACE2 peptidase domain &#945;1-helix, which would bind to the coronavirus surface protein, preventing the virus entry into the host cells. The natural &#945;1-helix peptide has a stronger affinity to SARS-CoV-2 than to SARS-CoV-1. Another peptide was designed by joining &#945;1 with the second portion of ACE2 that is far in the peptidase sequence yet grafted in the spike protein interface with ACE2. Previous studies have shown that, among several &#945;1-based peptides, the hybrid peptidic scaffold is the one with the highest/strongest affinity for SARS-CoV-1, which is comparable to the full-length ACE2 affinity. In this work, binding and folding dynamics of the natural and designed ACE2-based peptides were simulated by the well-known coarse-grained structure-based model, with the computed thermodynamic quantities correlating with the experimental binding affinity data. Furthermore, theoretical kinetic analysis of native contact formation revealed the distinction between these processes in the presence of the different binding partners SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike domains. Additionally, our results indicate the existence of a two-state folding mechanism for the designed peptide en route to bind to the spike proteins, in contrast to a downhill mechanism for the natural &#945;1-helix peptides. The presented low-cost simulation protocol demonstrated its efficiency in evaluating binding affinities and identifying the mechanisms involved in the neutralization of spike-ACE2 interaction by designed peptides. Finally, the protocol can be used as a computer-based screening of more potent designed peptides by experimentalists searching for new therapeutics against COVID-19.","output":"Shedding Light on the Inhibitory Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-1/CoV-2 Spike Proteins by ACE2-Designed Peptides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quadruplex structures have been identified in a plethora of organisms where they play important functions in the regulation of molecular processes, and hence have been proposed as therapeutic targets for many diseases.

Although T helper 1 (Th1) immunity was elicited in all vaccinated animals, as evidenced by the genesis of PRRSV-specific interferon-gamma secreting cells (IFNG SC), the overall extent of the memory response was variable and generally weak. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from these pigs responded to PRRSV exposure with a limited increase in their expression of the Th1 immune markers, IFNG, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-15 (IL15), and a reduction in the quantity of mRNAs encoding the innate and inflammatory proteins, IL1B, IL8 and IFNA.

In contrast to that, recent evidence unfolds a different view. Using \\"PubMed\\" and \\"Scopus\\" searches, we examined if the novel understanding regarding the cardia goes in line with the concept of unfolding, as described by Heidegger based on the ancient didactic poetry of Parmenides. What has been taken as gastric cardia in fact represents reflux-damaged, dilated, columnar lined oesophagus (CLO): dilated distal oesophagus (DDO). Due to its macroscopic gastric appearance it cannot be discriminated from the stomach by endoscopy. Differentiation between DDE and proximal stomach requires the histopathology of measured multi-level biopsies obtained from the DDO and the proximal stomach. Cardaic, onxytocardiac mucosa and intestinal metaplasia (IM; Barrett's oesophagus) define CLO and thus the oesophageal location, while oxyntic mucosa (OM) of the proximal stomach verifies a gastric biopsy location. Endoscopically visible CLO and DDO define the morphological manifestation of reflux: the squamo-oxyntic gap (SOG). Biopsies obtained from the level of the diaphragmatic impressions allow differentiation between an enlarged hiatus with normal anatomic content (CLO; oesophagus) vs. hernia with abnormal content (OM; stomach). Non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus exists in 10 %-17 % of asymptomatic and in 20 %-100 % (with increasing CLO length) of reflux symptom-positive individuals (annual cancer risk: 0.2 %-0.7 %). These data justify biopsy of an endoscopically normal appearing squamocolumnar junction for the exclusion of Barrett's oesophagus and cancer risk. In the absence of contraindications, cancer risk-based therapy of dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus includes radiofrequency ablation (RFA)  endoscopic resection. The perception of the cardia as reflux damaged DDO mirrors the concept of unfolding, as described by the interpretation of the didactic poem of Parmenides by Heidegger. Our data recommend to omit the term \\"cardia\\" and allocate morphology either to the oesophagus (CLO, DDO) or to the proximal stomach or indicate that allocation is impossible (i. e.. tumour-induced).

To meet this need, several large new data consortia have been developed that require frequent updating and sharing of electronic health record (EHR) data in different common data models (CDMs) to create multi-institutional databases for research. Traditionally, each CDM has had a custom pipeline for extract, transform, and load operations for production and incremental updates of data feeds to the networks from raw EHR data. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely data are far higher, and the requirements for updating faster than previous collaborative research using national data networks have increased. New approaches need to be developed to address these demands. METHODS: In this article, we describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical data model and the automated transformation of clinical data to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs for data sharing and research collaboration on COVID-19. RESULTS: FHIR data resources could be transformed to operational PCORnet and OMOP CDMs with minimal production delays through a combination of real-time and postprocessing steps, leveraging the FHIR data subscription feature. CONCLUSIONS: The approach leverages evolving standards for the availability of EHR data developed to facilitate data exchange under the 21st Century Cures Act and could greatly enhance the availability of standardized datasets for research.","output":"Automated production of research data marts from a canonical fast healthcare interoperability resource data repository: applications to COVID-19 research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hyperactive and damaging inflammation is a hallmark of severe rather than mild COVID-19 syndrome. To uncover key inflammatory differentiators between severe and mild COVID-19 disease, we applied an unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis. We integrated a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) dataset with a peripheral blood mononuclear cell dataset (PBMC) and analyzed the combined cell population, focusing on genes associated with disease severity. Distinct cell populations were detected in both BAL and PBMC where the immunomodulatory long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) NEAT1 and MALAT1 were highly differentially expressed between mild and severe patients. The detection of other severity associated genes involved in cellular stress response and apoptosis regulation suggests that the pro-inflammatory functions of these lncRNAs may foster cell stress and damage. The lncRNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 are potential components of immune dysregulation in COVID-19 that may provide targets for severity related diagnostic measures or therapy.","output":"LncRNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 Differentiate Inflammation in Severe COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The whole world is facing one of the biggest health related disasters of the century.

However, this person had no apparent history of travel abroad or contact with people tested positive for the virus. For this reason, the aim of this literature review was to reconstruct the epidemiological dynamics of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Lombardy Region. METHODS: To this end, a systematic review was carried out on PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE, and on grey literature. All article assessing incidence, mortality and hospitalizations by Lombardy province and municipality, and the impact of the main containment and organizational measures were considered eligible. In addition, data on general mortality and mortality due to COVID-19, hospital admission, and serological and environmental were also retrieved. RESULTS: From the included studies, it emerged that Lombardy was the first European region in which the virus began to circulate as early as January 2020 (and probably even earlier). Despite the high number of cases and deaths recorded, the reproduction number observed in Lombardy Region was, at the beginning of March 2020, the same (or lower) than in other regions. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, data of the first epidemic wave in Lombardy, compared to other Italian and foreign regions, highlight the extreme criticality of having had the first autochthonous case (and the first substantial outbreaks) when knowledge was still scarce and individual prevention measures were not widespread.

MethodsWe undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22445 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. The primary outcome was death or organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) by record review at 30 days. We split the cohort into derivation and validation sets, developed a clinical score based on the coefficients from multivariable analysis using the derivation set, and the estimated discriminant performance using the validation set. ResultsWe analysed 11773 derivation and 9118 validation cases. Multivariable analysis identified that age, sex, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen ratio, performance status, consciousness, history of renal impairment, and respiratory distress were retained in analyses restricted to the ten or fewer predictors. We used findings from multivariable analysis and clinical judgement to develop a score based on the NEWS2 score, age, sex, and performance status. This had a c-statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.81) in the validation cohort and predicted adverse outcome with sensitivity 0.98 (0.97-0.98) and specificity 0.34 (0.34-0.35) for scores above four points.

Two scenarios are considered in vaccine production: centralized and distributed. In the former case, the manufacturing units are closely located and transport the raw materials with no delay. In the latter case, the units are located geographically apart and transport of raw materials takes a finite time causing delays in vaccine production. The main contribution of the paper lies in the elucidation of optimal algorithms for both scenarios that take the dependencies between the ingredients into consideration. The dependencies have a constraining effect on the order of manufacturing of both the raw materials and the end products referred to as targets and hence careful consideration is necessary to maximize production.

This evaluation has been carried out in both the short and long term after the first lockdown period and can be considered as a proxy of a situation of a possible delay in administration or management of infusions, due to other different causes.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children With SMA Receiving Nusinersen: What Is Missed and What Is Gained?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe pneumonia which shares several of the features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in Coronavirus disease 19 (Covid\\\\19) for which as of now there is no effective treatment. ARDS is caused and sustained by an uncontrolled inflammatory activation characterized by a massive release of cytokines (cytokine storm), diffuse lung edema, inflammatory cell infiltraton and disseminated coagulation. Macrophage and T lymphocyte dysfunction plays a central role in this syndrome. In several experimental in vitro and in vivo models, many of these pathophysiological changes are triggered by stimulation of the P2X7 receptor. We hypothesize that this receptor might be an ideal candidate to target in Covid\\\\19\\\\associated severe pneumonia.","output":"A rationale for targeting the P2X7 receptor in Coronavirus disease 19 (Covid\\\\19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019 a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), emerged from Wuhan, China and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanding globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, USA, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as the Severe Specific Contagious Pneumonia (SSCP) in 1/15/2019 and is a notifiable communicable disease of the 5 category by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health. SSCP is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and jeopardized first-line healthcare workers if lack of stringent infection control or no proper personal protective equipment available. Currently, there is no definite treatment for SSCP although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of travel or contact history for patients with compatible symptoms.","output":"Overview of The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): The Pathogen of Severe Specific Contagious Pneumonia (SSCP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case series describes three patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 who developed polyradiculoneuritis as a probable neurological complication of COVID-19. A diagnosis of Guillain Barr syndrome was made on the basis of clinical symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electroneurography (ENG). In all of them therapeutic approach included the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 gr/kg for 5 days), which resulted in the improvement of neurological symptoms. Clinical neurophysiology revealed the presence of conduction block, absence of F waves, and in two cases significant decrease in amplitude of compound motor action potential cMAP. Due to the potential role of inflammation on symptoms development and prognosis, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and -8 (IL-8) levels were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during the acute phase, while only serum was tested after recovery. Both IL-6 and IL-8 were found increased during the acute phase, both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, whereas four months after admission (at complete recovery), only IL-8 remained elevated in serum. These results confirm the inflammatory response that might be linked to peripheral nervous system complications, and encourage the use of IL-6 and IL-8 as prognostic biomarkers in COVID-19.

We conducted in-depth interviews with 51 people experiencing sheltered and unsheltered homelessness in Atlanta, Georgia during May 2020 to August 2020 to (1) describe challenges and opportunities related to hand hygiene and (2) assess hand hygiene communication preferences. The primary hand hygiene barrier reported was limited access to facilities and supplies, which has disproportionately impacted people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. This lack of access has reportedly been exacerbated during COVID-19 by the closure of public facilities and businesses. Increased access to housing and employment were identified as long-term solutions to improving hand hygiene. Overall, participants expressed a preference for access to facilities and supplies over hand hygiene communication materials.","output":"Hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic among people experiencing homelessness-Atlanta, Georgia, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccination against COVID-19 remains as a main root of COVID-19 prevention. Few vaccines have been launched for this purpose recently with different side effects. Thrombotic events have been reported as a rare side effect after ChAdox1nCOV-19 vaccination that may cause death of recipient. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of hepatic artery occlusion after the first dose vaccination by ChAdOx1nCov-19.The patient was a health care worker, aged 34-year old. Past medical history was unremarkable and had not used heparin. Over the next couple of days after the vaccination, he reported headache, nausea, and dizziness as well as abdominal pain. His general status and the laboratories studies deteriorate quickly by increasing liver enzymes and severe coagulopathy. Clinically he had presented acute hepatic failure. He had been received blood products, prednisolone pulse along with broad antibiotics without benefit. He died on the sixth day. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombotic events after vaccination is very rare but can develop in main arteries with lethal outcome. This event may mimic autoimmune thrombosis clinically.","output":"Acute liver failure after vaccination against of COVID-19; a case report and review literature"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(O,[["render",V]]),M=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/22.md","filePath":"doctor/22.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/22.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{M as __pageData,z as default};
