Thus, assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in blood, validated on commercially available PCR systems, are required to allow a good comparability of data. MATERIAL AND METHODS The cobas SARS-CoV-2 dual-target RT-PCR assay, licensed for respiratory swab SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing, was validated for detection of viral RNA in blood. For the validation panel, SARS-CoV-2 positive plasma samples were prepared by spiking SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory specimens in negative human plasma. The 95% limit of detection (LOD95) was determined by probit analysis. For clinical validation, COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors and COVID-19 patients with a severe disease course treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) were included. RESULTS The validation of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for blood demonstrated high sensitivity, specificity, intra- and inter-assay precision and efficiency. The LOD95 for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 5.0 genome copies/mL (95% CI, 3.3-12 copies/ml) for target 1 and 4.3 genome copies/mL (95% CI, 2.9-10 copies/ml) for target 2. In a cohort of 39 CCP donors with 66 CCP donations no SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma was detected. Screening of 25 blood samples of 19 ICU COVID-19 patients showed six positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in at least one target of the assay. CONCLUSION The SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay, only licensed for respiratory swabs, performed on a PCR system for high-throughput testing, showed a good assay performance for blood testing.","output":"Validation of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR assay for high-throughput testing in blood of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors and patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of scaffolds namely aurones, 3-indolinones, 4-quinolones and cinnamic acid-piperazine hybrids, was designed, synthesized and investigated in vitro against influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus.

RESULTS: The search identified 5,432 articles, from which a total of 21 were included in the final review. Anxiety, burnout, depression, inadequate sleep, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, distress/stress and secondary trauma, were all reportedly experienced by emergency HCWs. Anxiety, burnout, depression and stress levels were higher among physicians and nurses compared to others. Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were higher among reserve medics, while Red Cross volunteers developed similar reactions of psychological stress and secondary trauma to other healthcare workers. Male HCWs reported more post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms than females, while stress was higher among females than male HCWs.

This is an emerging medical need, and it has been hypothesized that antifibrotic treatments could have a role in ameliorating the fibrotic process in the lungs of these patients.Areas covered: The safety and efficacy of available antifibrotic drugs (nintedanib and pirfenidone) and novel promising agents are being assessed in several ongoing clinical trials that were performed either in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care, or in discharged patients presenting fibrotic sequalae from COVID-19. Literature search was performed using Medline and Clinicaltrials.org databases (2001-2021).Expert opinion: Despite the strong rationale support the use of antifibrotic therapies in COVID-related fibrosis, there are several uncertainties regarding the timing for their introduction and the real risks/benefits ratio of antifibrotic treatment in the acute and the chronic phases of the disease.

Students were deprived of the hands-on activities and shared experiences of in-person learning that increase engagement, learning, and the overall educational experience that students rely on to grow as people and engineers. The lab-based nature of Geo-Education has rendered it particularly susceptible to this issue. New tools capable of bringing hands-on learning to remote students and an instructional focus on promoting shared experiences in this new era of learning are essential for the continued development of students in higher education through the COVID-19 pandemic and other future disruptions. The GeoExplorer CPT Operator module is a mixed reality environment that was adopted for remote implementations in the Spring 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021 semesters. Originally developed to advance and equalize how undergraduate civil engineering students obtain geotechnical field experience, GeoExplorer gave in-person and remote students the opportunity to simulate hands-on learning when most other opportunities for this style of learning were impossible. This mixed reality platform was presented to students in the same modality as laboratory experiments for which students would typically go into the physical laboratory space in the Spring 2021 semester, which is the focus of this paper. The difference between students interacting with this platform and other shared experience interventions when in-person versus remote was leveraged to assess the ability of these strategies to augment or fully replace hands-on experiences. Mixed methods data acquired through surveys, intermediate quizzes, laboratory reports, and interviews show the benefit of using mixed reality platforms in remote learning with respect to both engagement and learning gains. This research found that there was a difference in grades between remote and in-person students, and that there are new approaches to instruction and shared experience strategies that can help equalize the experience for in-person and remote learning. This attempt at equalization may be what carries students through times of future disruption to higher education.","output":"Assessing In-Person versus Remote Learning Gains: An Endeavor to Extend the Engineering Education Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text]","output":"Selective Inhibition of Enzymatic Activities of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Helicase with a Thioxopyrimidine Derivative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Women with BRCA1/2 mutations are at high risk to develop breast and ovarian cancer. To support these women to participate in shared decision-making, structured nurse-led decision coaching combined with an evidence-based decision aid may be employed. In preparation of the interprofessional randomized controlled trial to evaluate a decision coaching program to support preventive decisions of healthy female BRCA 1/2 gene mutation carriers (EDCP-BRCA), we adapted and piloted an existing training program for specialized nurses and included elements from an existing physician communication training. METHODS: The training was adapted according to the six-step-approach for medical curriculum development. The educational design is based on experience- and problem-based learning. Subsequently, we conducted a qualitative pilot study. Nurses were recruited from six German centers for familial breast and ovarian cancer. The acceptability and feasibility were assessed by structured class observations, field notes and participants feedback. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The training was revised according to the results. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the patient intervention was adapted as a virtual coaching and a brief additional training for nurses was added. RESULTS: The training consists of two modules (2 + 1 day) that teach competences in evidence-based medicine and patient information, (risk) communication and decision coaching. One pilot test was conducted with six nurses of which three were specialized and experienced in patient counselling. A final set of eight main categories was derived from the data: framework conditions; interaction; schedule, transparency of goals, content, methods, materials and practical relevance and feasibility. Overall, the training was feasible and comprehensible. Decision coaching materials were awkward to handle and decision coaching role plays were set too short. Therefore, materials will be sent out in advance and the training was extended. CONCLUSIONS: Specialized nurses are rarely available and nurse-led counselling is not routinely implemented in the centers of familial breast and ovarian cancer. However, training of less qualified nurses seems feasible. Decision coaching in a virtual format seems to be a promising approach. Further research is needed to evaluate its feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The main trial is registered under DRKS-ID: DRKS00015527.

These approaches, however, have not consistently included an economic efficiency analysis dimension. This systematic review aims to examine how, and in what ways, system dynamics modelling approaches incorporate economic efficiency analyses to inform decision-making on innovations (improvements in products, services, or processes) in the public sector, with a particular interest in health. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Relevant studies (n = 29) were identified through a systematic search and screening of four electronic databases and backward citation search, and analysed for key characteristics and themes related to the analytical methods applied. Economic efficiency analysis approaches within SD broadly fell into two categories: as embedded sub-models or as cost calculations based on the outputs of the SD model. Embdedded sub-models within a dynamic SD framework can reveal a clear allocation of costs and benefits to periods of time, whereas cost calculations based on the SD model outputs can be useful for high-level resource allocation decisions. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review reveals that SD modelling is not currently used to its full potential to evaluate the technical or allocative efficiency of public sector innovations, particularly in health. The limited reporting on the experience or methodological challenges of applying allocated efficiency analyses with SD, particularly with dynamic embedded models, hampers common learning lessons to draw from and build on.

However, its long-lasting effects on both mental health and decision-making difficulties remain unexplored. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and severity of psychological disorders in Italy's populace one-year after the outbreak; further, we investigated potential risks impacting mental health and decision-making. METHODS: In March 2021, 586 individuals (18C73 years) completed an online-survey plus a computerized delay discounting task for hypothetical money rewards. RESULTS: Psychological symptoms prevalence exceeded the Italy's lockdown rates, with about one-third reporting moderate-to-extremely severe depression, another third anxiety, and the rest stress; mirrored by an increase of symptoms at clinically significant severity levels. One year into the pandemic, half of our sample presented at least one psychological problem, and one-third was at risk of developing a more clinically severe psychological outcome. Fear of job loss, loneliness and intolerance of uncertainty were among the major risk factors to mental health. Plus, social-relationships and financial uncertainty were key determinants of depression, while fear of COVID-19 infection predicted anxiety symptoms. For decision-making tendencies, elevated delay discounting rates, implying less future-oriented behaviors, were mostly predicted by increased job loss fear and older age (>35 years). LIMITATIONS: This study provides cross-sectional evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Depression, anxiety and stress levels were still alarming one-year into COVID-19. Individuals experiencing financial insecurity, loneliness and intolerance of uncertainty perhaps benefit most from early interventions.

METHODS A cross sectional study, adopting a mixed method approach was used and conducted among the older population in Kerala. To study the health profile of study participants 405 older people were surveyed and 102 people were interviewed in-depth at their households between June to November 2020. The results of the study were triangulated with elderly COVID-19 fatality data available from the citizen-science dashboards of the research team and Department of Health, Kerala. Vaccination data was retrieved from the Co-WIN government website (cowin.gov.in) to study its impact. The data was analyzed using the IBM SPSS version 22.0. RESULTS Age is a predictor of COVID-19 fatality. Diabetes, hypertension, CAD, CKD and COPD are the significant predictors of elderly COVID-19 fatality in Kerala. The current comorbidity profile of the total older population matches with the comorbidities of the COVID-19 elderly death cases. CFR and IFR have declined even when the CMR is high in the second wave of COVID-19 with more deaths. This is attributable to vaccination even though there exists a lesser chance for breakthrough infection. CONCLUSIONS Age and comorbidities can predict potential fatality among older COVID-19 patients. Timely and accurate health data and better knowledge of high-risk factors such as comorbidity can easily guide the healthcare system and authorities to efficient prevention and treatment methodologies. Knowledge on prevailing NCDs can drive early preparedness before it converges with an epidemic like the present zoonotic disease.

Topics addressed included gender identity, sexual orientation, racial and ethnic background, rationale for pursuing anesthesiology, and medical training experiences. The study was administered from February to April 2021; 135 anesthesiology residents responded to the survey. RESULTS: The sample was 44.4% white (n = 60), 54.1% male (n = 73), and 83.7% (n = 113) of respondents self-reported as straight or heterosexual. Respondents indicated that role models/mentors were somewhat or very important in their desire to pursue anesthesiology (n = 85; 67.2%), 42% reported that having women/diverse faculty was somewhat or very important in their decision to pursue anesthesiology. Discrimination during the anesthesiology residency application process or as a resident ranged from 4.4% due to sexual orientation to 18.7% due to gender/gender identity and race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences of discrimination based on race/ethnicity, gender, and gender identity continues to be a concern among anesthesiology trainees. Creating an environment that is inclusive and supportive of all trainees regardless of race/ethnicity, gender/gender identity, and sexual orientation is needed. Interventions and strategies to create an inclusive environment may improve diversity within anesthesiology.","output":"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Among Anesthesiology Trainees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This position paper presents a prototype research agenda for design for sustainability transformations (DfST) in the (post-)pandemic context. COVID-19 has made visible vulnerabilities, structural dysfunctions, inequalities and injustices across health, environmental, social, economic, provisional and political systems. In response to the crisis, rapid, adaptive, technological and social innovations have started to emerge across all levels of society, opening up a multiplicity of alternative futures. This is an opportune time to address long-standing and urgent sustainability challenges in ways that move beyond the ineffective and business-as-usual approaches of ecological modernism. The authors used a co-creative process to identify weak signals relevant to sustainability transformations. In alignment with the deep leverage points framework, the identified weak signals are presented under two main headings: First, social structures and institutions;and second, values, goals and worldviews. The deep leverage points form the basis of a research agenda on how DfST could contribute to sustainability transformations right now and in the longer-term. ? 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

Up-to-date and comprehensive quality of service measurement techniques provide important information to the companies about the way customers perceive the quality and their service quality expectations. It is critical to measure the service quality for airline transportation, which is becoming more popular compared to other types of transportation and therefore increasing competition. In order to compete in the market and improve their service quality, companies should know their customers well and make improvements by analysing their expectations correctly. In this context, the SERVQUAL method is one of the frequently preferred and effective tools in service quality measurement. However, it is not possible to deal with the effects of radical changes such as the development and transformations of technology, events and trends under the influence of the world with the conventional SERVQUAL method. For this purpose, the traditional method consisting of five dimensions has been extended to nine dimensions by adding four more dimensions, namely Environment, Pandemic, Digital Technology and Information Systems. While it is possible to perform a more detailed service quality measurement with the proposed method, companies are provided with an effective and up-to-date tool to determine which dimensions are more important. In this study after structuring main dimensions and its inner levels hierarchically, Modified Delphi method is applied to a group of experts and the main criteria are evaluated with Best Worst Method and sub-criteria are evaluated with Interval-Valued Neutrosophic AHP method. After subjecting the criteria, whose importance are determined, to sensitivity analysis, the results obtained are evaluated in terms of airline transportation and recommendations are presented. In addition to the extended approach it proposes, this study is the most detailed research on airline service quality as far as we know.","output":"A three-level framework to evaluate airline service quality based on interval valued neutrosophic AHP considering the new dimensions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metformin is a widely prescribed medication for the treatment and management of type 2 diabetes. It belongs to a class of biguanides, which are characterized by a wide range of diverse biological properties, including anticancer, antimicrobial, antimalarial, cardioprotective and other activities. It is known that biguanides serve as excellent N-donor bidentate ligands and readily form complexes with virtually all transition metals. Recent evidence suggests that the mechanism of action of metformin and its analogues is linked to their metal-binding properties. These findings prompted us to summarize the existing data on the synthetic strategies and biological properties of various metal complexes with metformin and its analogues. We demonstrated that coordination of biologically active biguanides to various metal centers often resulted in an improved pharmacological profile, including reduced drug resistance as well as a wider spectrum of activity. In addition, coordination to the redox-active metal centers, such as Au(III), allowed for various activatable strategies, leading to the selective activation of the prodrugs and reduced off-target toxicity.","output":"Biological Properties of Transition Metal Complexes with Metformin and Its Analogues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is a qualitative analysis of perspectives on leadership development among working peer support specialists and highlights the challenges, needs and efficacy these individuals experience in their work settings.

In hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical droplet precaution to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. However, for asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks in public could easily cause the spread of COVID-19. The prevention of environmental droplet contamination (EnvDC) from coughing/sneezing/speech is fundamental to reducing transmission. As an immediate solution to promote public droplet safety, we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal community droplet reduction solution is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces within 1.8 m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 social distancing. All textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to &lt;30 cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as medical mask/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to &lt;10 cm, and the area of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a community droplet reduction solution (i.e., face covers/scarfs/masks and surface covers) will reduce COVID-19 EnvDC and thus the risk of transmitting/acquiring COVID-19.","output":"Textile Masks and Surface CoversA Spray Simulation Method and a Universal Droplet Reduction Model Against Respiratory Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Long-term results of arcuate incisions are rarely reported. This is unfortunate as long-term stability of astigmatic correction is of great interest to surgeons performing astigmatic correction. This study investigates the seven year stability of results after application of femtosecond-laser assisted arcuate incisions with the Castrop nomogram. METHODS Prospective interventional case series at the Augen- und Laserklinik, Castrop-Rauxel, Germany. Single site, single surgeon study. Seven year results of cataract patients with low to moderate corneal astigmatism receiving femtosecond laser-assisted arcuate incisions using a TechnolasVictus SW 2.7 (Bausch & Lomb Inc, Dornach, Germany) were assessed and compared to one year results. Outcome evaluation was based on astigmatic vector analysis, manifest refraction, and visual acuity. RESULTS The study analyzed 19 eyes of 19 patients 7 years after surgery. Ocular residual astigmatism changed from -0.26 to -0.39 D. Preoperative corneal astigmatism was -1.51 D. Correction Index changed from 1.0 to 1.16. The magnitude of difference vector changed from 0.26 to 0.39 D. The index of success changed from 0.20 to 0.29. Spherical equivalent remained stable. A slight tendency to change towards astigmatic overcorrection was mainly observed for patients with preoperative with the rule astigmatism, but not with patients with against the rule astigmatism. CONCLUSIONS The Castrop nomogram showed stable results seven years after surgery. Similar to toric IOL surgery, it is advisable to be less aggressive when correcting with the rule astigmatism, to avoid overcorrection over a long period.","output":"Lasting effects: Seven year results of the Castrop Nomogram for Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Paired Corneal Arcuate Incisions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trust is a form of love, explained a study participant. As a form of love, trust nourishes connections and accelerates progress. As a result, the purpose of this session is to reflect upon the notion of trust and examine how trust moves science and social justice forward. Trust must be seen as sustained or broken over multiple generations. Moreover, trust between older adults and medical and social support institutions has profound implications for this historical moment. In the COVID-19 pandemic, trust can be viewed as a facilitator of emergency responses in the State of Washington as noted in Dr. Berridges paper. On the other hand, distrust and a related sense of abandonment contributes to Black Americans' limited uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations, as noted in Dr. Johnsons work. On a related note, Dr. Perrys work shows that lack of trust over time has led those aging with hemophilia to withdraw from care at different points in their own trajectories. Finally, on a positive note, Dr. Kotwals work illustrates the role of a peer outreach intervention in facilitating trusting relationships among diverse, low-income older adults which led to sustained reductions, over a 2-year period, in loneliness, barriers to socializing, and depression. This symposium on trust highlights how researchers work, either consciously or unconsciously, within a continuum of trust in their participants' communities. At a broader level, systemic attention to building trust from academia, government, and national advocacy organizations holds the potential to foster meaningful scientific engagement and empowerment of historically marginalized communities.","output":"An Exploration on Trust"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivos: identificar as evidncias cientficas existentes at o presente momento sobre a efetividade do uso da cloroquina, da hidroxicloroquina associada (ou n?o)  azitromicina para tratamento da afec??o pelo coronavrus e seus possveis efeitos adversos e txicos aos seres humanos.

Only one experiment found that messaging about individual victims increased compliance compared to messaging about statistical victims-i.e., \\"flatten the curve\\" graphs-an effect that was undetected after controlling for other factors. However, messaging about flu (vs. COVID19) indirectly reduced compliance by reducing perceived threat of the pandemic. Nevertheless, moral beliefs predicted compliance better than messaging and reflection in both experiments.

This study aims to identify the factors contributing to readmission in patients with HF. Methods: A prospective-observational single-centre study was conducted in Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. A total of 146 patients with HF are included in the study. Patients demographics, patient medical characteristics, lab values, medications were collected for each patient, and the factors associated with readmission are identified. The primary outcome is to identify the factors contributing to readmission and reduce readmission rate. SPSS software for windows version 26 is used for data analysis. Results: The number of patients with heart failure admitted to hospital is higher with males (73.3%) than females. 42.1% were readmitted and were not compliant, whereas patients who are not readmitted and were compliant shows a lower percentage. Noncompliance was the most significant factor associated with readmission (p = 0.02, OR = 3.6, 95%CI: 1.57 - 8.28). Other factors that are associated with readmission were low haemoglobin (p = 0.001, OR = 0.96, 95%CI: 0.94 - 0.98), and NYHA class of HF (p = 0.023, OR = 2.22, 95%CI: 1.12 - 4.43).

[Image: see text] OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to identify and measure QACs in breast milk and evaluate early-life exposure to this group of compounds for nursing infants. METHODS: Eighteen QACs, including 6 benzylalkyldimethyl ammonium compounds (BACs, with alkyl chain lengths of C8-C18), 6 dialkyldimethyl ammonium compounds (DDACs, C8-C18), and 6 alkyltrimethyl ammonium compounds (ATMACs, C8-C18), were measured in breast milk samples collected from U.S. mothers. Daily lactational intake was estimated based on the determined concentrations for 0C12 month old nursing infants. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 18 QACs were detected in breast milk and 7 of them were found in more than half of the samples. The total QAC concentrations (QAC) ranged from 0.33 to 7.4 ng/mL (median 1.5 ng/mL). The most abundant QAC was C14-BAC with a median concentration of 0.45 ng/mL.

The objectives were to identify critical care drugs required, obtain patient usage data and consider current regional practice to establish the requirement. METHOD: Health and Social Care (HSC) Trusts across Northern Ireland (NI) identified critical care drugs required and an estimation of average daily usage data. The Microsoft Excel database was constructed to compile Trust data and establish regional requirement. The database was refined further according to real-world data from NI HSC Trusts, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre report on COVID-19 in critical care, daily regional COVID-19 figures and other available National data. Components of a tool originally developed for H1N1 and updated for COVID-19 were adapted to reflect the NI context and used in the regional database. The database was clinically reviewed to ensure that it accurately reflected current regional practice given the evolving nature of the pandemic. RESULTS: The critical care drugs required in the pandemic, usage data and current regional practice were identified to establish requirement. A regional database was constructed and used to produce a model for calculating approximate critical drug requirements. The model was used to map critical drug requirements to available stock in Trusts and wholesalers/suppliers, enabling the identification of treatment capacity for these medicines regionally, both currently and for projected surges. Data have also been used in the preparation of weekly regional situation reports provided to both the HSC Board and the Department of Health.

In the urban counties, the median prevalence of COVID\\\\19 increased from 10.1 per 100,000 population to 107.6 per 100,000 within the same period. The COVID\\\\19 adjusted prevalence rates in rural counties were substantially elevated in counties with higher black populations, smoking rates, and obesity rates. Counties with high rates of people aged 25\\\\49 years had increased COVID\\\\19 prevalence rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a rapid spread of COVID\\\\19 across urban and rural areas in 21 days.

Previous studies had reported cases of COVID-19 reinfection both in hospital-based and community-based data. However, limited studies reported COVID-19 reinfection in large community-based data. The present study aimed to provide the incidence of COVID-19 reinfection based on secondary data in the U.S. Study designCross-sectional study MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted using secondary data provided by COVID-19 Research Database, i.e., Healthjump. Reinfection were defined as diagnosed COVID-19 (U07.1= confirmed virus identified) twice with []90 days interval between diagnosis. Age, gender, and region data were also explored. A Chi-square test continued by a binary logistic regression was conducted to determine the association between parameters. Data collecting and processing were done in the Amazon workspace. ResultsThe study revealed 3,778 reinfection cases of 116,932 COVID-19 infected cases (3.23%). Reinfection cases were more common in females (3.35%) than males (3.23%). Elderly subjects were the highest incidence (5.13%), followed by adult (4.14%), young adults (2.35%), and children (1.09%). Proportion in the region of living northeast was the highest (3.68%), compared to the south (3.49%), west (2.59%), and midwest (2.48%). ConclusionThe incidence of COVID-19 reinfection was 3.23%, suggesting our concern with COVID-19 management and future research to understand COVID-19 reinfection better.

But in recent decades, compelling evidence has led the scientific community to place a greater emphasis on the role of gut microbes on the brain. Pathological observations and early gastrointestinal symptoms highlighted that gut dysbiosis likely precedes the onset of cognitive deficits in Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) patients. The delicate balance in the number and functions of pathogenic microbes and alternative probiotic populations is critical in the modulation of systemic inflammation and neuronal health. However, there is limited success in restoring healthy microbial biodiversity in AD and PD patients with general probiotics interventions and fecal microbial therapies. Fortunately, the gut microflora is susceptible to long-term extrinsic influences such as lifestyle and dietary choices, providing opportunities for treatment through comparatively individual-specific control of human behavior. In this review, we examine the impact of restrictive diets on the gut microbiome populations associated with AD and PD. The overall evidence presented supports that gut dysbiosis is a plausible prelude to disease onset, and early dietary interventions are likely beneficial for the prevention and treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases.","output":"Association of Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis with Neurodegeneration: Can Gut Microbe-Modifying Diet Prevent or Alleviate the Symptoms of Neurodegenerative Diseases?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Inflammation is an immune response characterized by swelling, redness, pain and heat. Inflammation is mainly managed using conventional medicines that are associated with many side effects. Plant-based remedies are considerably better alternative therapies for they have fewer side effects. Objective: This study aimed at determining the anti-inflammatory potential of dichloromethane (DCM) leaf extracts of Eucalyptus globulus and Senna didymobotrya in mice. Methods: Fresh leaves of these plants were harvested from Embu County, Kenya. Quantitative phytochemical analysis was done using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Anti-inflammatory test comprised nine groups of five animals each: normal, negative, positive controls and 6 experimental groups. Inflammation was induced with Carrageenan. One hour post-treatment, the different groups were intraperitoneally administered with the reference drug, diclofenac, 3% DMSO and six DCM leaf extracts at doses of 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250mg/kgbw. Results: GC-MS results revealed &#945;-phellandrene, camphene, terpinolene, and limonene among others. Anti-inflammatory effects showed that extract doses of 100,150,200 and 250mg/kg bw significantly reduced the inflamed paw. Doses of 200 and 250mg/kgbw in both plants were more potent and compared with diclofenac. E. globulus extract dose of 250mg kg bw reduced inflamed paw in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th hours, by 2.27,6.52,9.09 and 10.90% respectively while S.didymobotrya at similar dose ranges, inflamed paw reduced by 2.41, 5.43, 8.31 and 9.05% respectively.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the thoracic MSCT data of 600 children who received thoracic MSCT from January to June 2020 with their age ranging from 1 month to 19 years. The distribution of sternal ossification centers and adjacent tissues and organs was observed. Subcutaneous soft tissue thickness and the distance between the skin and the posterior margin of the sternum were measured in the central areas of sternal manubrium and mesosternum (segments I and II), and the correlation between the two was calculated using linear correlation. RESULTS: A total of 600 patients were enrolled, the mean age was 9.87 years and the standard deviation was 8.28 years. The sternal manubrium and ossification centers at the I and II segments of the mesosternum were visible in all cases (100%). There was no ossification in segment III of the mesosternum in 15 cases (2.5%), including 12 cases (80%) adjacent to the posterior pericardium and 7 cases (46.7%) of lung tissue. There were 274 cases (45.7%) of segment IV without ossification, including 204 cases (74.5%) of adjacent pericardium and 95 cases (32.8%) of lung tissue. The xiphoid process was not ossified in 258 cases (43%), including 190 cases (73.6%) adjacent to the pericardium and 97 cases (37.6%) adjacent to the lung tissue. Correspondingly, the thickness of subcutaneous soft tissue of the sternal manubrium and the central region of the I and II segments of the mesosternum had a low positive correlation with age (P < 0.001), the distance between the skin and the posterior margin of the sternum showed a moderate positive correlation with age (P < 0.001), and the distance between the skin and the posterior margin of the sternum showed a high positive correlation with the thickness of subcutaneous soft tissue (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Nonossification of the sternal ossification center usually occurs below segment III of the mesosternum and is usually adjacent to heart and lung tissue. Pediatric sternal puncture should be performed at the sternal manubrium and the mesosternum of segments I and II. However, attention should be paid to the space between multiple ossification centers. The thickness of subcutaneous soft tissue is a critical factor that determines the depth of the puncture.","output":"A safe area for sternal puncture in children: an MSCT study based on sternal development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Ireland, as around the world, the Covid-19 pandemic necessitated that Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) adopt innovative approaches to ensure the continuity of placement-related components of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes.

Drawing upon the Community of Inquiry framework as a lens, this paper considers how pre-service student-teachers facilitated and experienced teaching presence while peer-teaching in a synchronous online environment as part of their TOP. The paper finds that design and organisation, facilitating discourse, and direct instruction, were viewed as relevant and helpful for teaching in online settings, and that overall there was agreement about the importance of establishing a strong sense of teacher presence when teaching in synchronous videoconferencing environments such as Zoom. It concludes by considering how these findings may be of relevance for future development of ITE programmes.","output":"Presence accounted for? student-teachers establishing and experiencing presence in synchronous online teaching environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis still remains the leading cause of in-hospital death in the world [...].","output":"Sepsis: New Challenges and Future Perspectives for an Evolving DiseasePrecision Medicine Is the Way!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has affected >188 countries, involved >24 million people, and caused >840,000 deaths.

The study has shown that Ukraine's involvement in European integration processes has questioned the economic performance of the domestic economy sector, the wealth of Ukrainian citizens, infrastructure upgrade and industrial re-equipment. The Agreement on Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the EU countries, signed and implemented by Ukraine, has not had a critical impact on the improvement of Ukraine's leading macroeconomic indicators. Thus, the GDP recovery, investment and infrastructure renewal rate was very low, with depressed and unstable social and economic projects in 2014 - 2019;in general, this prevented from moving toward the EU standards. It is also noted that with the growth of EU's GDP by USD 1, the foreign trade turnover of all goods will increase by USD 0.887, and bilateral turnover of agricultural and industrial goods - by USD 1.693 dollars;Ukraine's GDP growth has a much smaller impact, which can be explained by the difference in the EU and Ukrainian economic scales. Based on modelling study, forecasting and analysis of time series within the last five-six years, it is proved that without regular investments, supporting measures to trigger the development of high-tech sectors of Ukraine's economy and without its production and logistics partnership and involvement in the global most powerful economic centres, the domestic social and economic segments will continue to worsen and be exposed to the globalized economic risks. Therefore, it is proposed to develop new approaches to the European integration process based on pragmatism and successful experience of Central and Eastern European countries, namely to implement the relevant measures and a strategic level program in Ukraine to propel and develop high-tech and high-margin industrial sector. This requires triggering of state policy on strong involvement of co-financing of structural funds, as well as EU's framework and targeted programs;attracting investment, reducing the influence of oligarchic clans and corruption on the social and economic system of Ukraine. In addition, it is urgent to launch a strategic level program in Ukraine to develop a policy with priority initial stage focusing the key resources on the development of IT sector, which can a priori be integrated and rapidly developed in course of implementation of EU's current industrial innovation strategy.","output":"Economic European Integration: Assessment and Modelling of Superficial and Hidden Factors of Divergence Between Ukraine and the EU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Mass casualty events (MCE) are situations that overwhelm local capacity and lead to morbidity and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) can be considered a nationwide sustained MCE that affected multiple aspects of healthcare. We hypothesized that the surge of patients and lack of preparation for MCEs resulted in increased patient length of stay (LOS), complications, mortality, and costs associated with care for critically ill patients. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study compared patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in 2019 to 2020. The timeframe was March to August. In 2020, this was the first six months of the nationwide response to COVID-19. 2019 was the historical control. Data were collected from the Vizient Clinical Data Base/Resource Manager? (CDB/RM) (Irving, TX), a national database of patient outcomes and cost-data from over 700 tertiary/quaternary and community hospitals. Data is reported with an associated severity of illness score. The total number of ICU admissions, complication percentage, ICU LOS, observed and expected LOS, LOS index (ratio of observed-to-expected LOS), observed and expected mortality rate, mortality index (ratio of observed-to-expected mortality), total cost of admission, observed and expected direct cost of admission, and direct cost index (ratio of observed-to-expected direct cost) were collected. Inclusion criteria were all medical centers with complete datasets for the timeframe. All major geographic regions of the United States were included. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 27.0 (Armonk, NY) was used to summarize data with mean and standard deviation. Independent sample two-sided t-tests were used to compare subgroup means. All cost data were adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index. RESULTS: Twenty health systems and 42,397 patients were included in the study. There was a significant increase from 2019 to 2020 in patient outcomes and cost-of-care (table 1). In 2020, ICU LOS was longer compared to 2019;this was highest at tertiary centers [1.5 days longer] and metropolitan hospitals [1.2 days longer]. There was 1.4% increase in complication rates;this was highest in community hospitals [1.8%] and hospitals in urban regions [1.8%]. On average, the total cost of admission per ICU patient was $5,522 more in 2020. This was highest for tertiary academic centers [$6,870] followed by metropolitan hospitals [$6,469], community hospitals [$4,945] and rural hospitals [$4,102].

While distancing measures can safeguard public health, they also can profoundly impact the economy and may have important indirect effects on the environment.

We develop an epidemiological-economic model to examine the optimal duration and intensity of physical distancing measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19. In an application to the United States, our model considers the trade-off between the lives saved by physical distancing-both directly from stemming the spread of the virus and indirectly from reductions in air pollution during the period of physical distancing-and the short- and long-run economic costs that ensue from such measures. We examine the effect of air pollution co-benefits on the optimal physical distancing policy and conduct sensitivity analyses to gauge the influence of several key parameters and uncertain model assumptions. Using recent estimates of the association between airborne particulate matter and the virulence of COVID-19, we find that accounting for air pollution co-benefits can significantly increase the intensity and duration of the optimal physical distancing policy.

In the context of this pandemic, all professions- combined healthcare workers (HCWs), and not only direct caregivers, are a frontline workforce in contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases and seem to be a high-risk group for exposure. The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs in our hospital after the first and the second pandemic wave and also to characterize the distribution of this seroprevalence in relation to various criteria. Methods: At the end of the two recruitment periods, a total of 4008 serological tests were performed in this single-center cross-sectional study. After completing a questionnaire including demographic and personal data, possible previous COVID-19 diagnostic test results and/or the presence of symptoms potentially related to COVID-19, the study participants underwent blood sampling and serological testing using DiaSorin's LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test for the first phase and LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG test for the second phase of this study. Results: 302 study participants (10,72%) in the first round of the study and 404 (33,92%) in the second round were positive for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. The prevalence of seropositivity observed after the second wave was 3,16 times higher than after the first wave. We confirmed that direct, prolonged and repeated contact with patients or their environment was a predominant seroconversion factor, but more unexpectedly, that this was the case for all HCWs and not only caregivers. Finally, the notion of high-risk contact seemed more readily identifiable in ones workplace than in ones private life. Conclusion: Our study confirmed that HCWs are at a significantly higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than the general population, and suggest that repeated contacts with at-risk patients, regardless of the HCWs profession, represent the most important risk factor for seroconversion.

They would be benefited not only by an increase in income but also in offering visitors a taste of Tokyo's great hospitality if the Olympics had been held in 2020. However, postponement of the sporting event is likely to have a significant impact on their happiness level. We independently collected individual-level panel data from March to April 2020. In the survey, the respondents were asked about their happiness levels by choosing from 11 categories: 1 (very unhappy) and 11 (very happy). They were also asked about expected income changes from 2020 to 2021. Based on this, we examined the effect of postponement on happiness level and expected income change. The sample was divided into sub-samples of areas including and excluding Tokyo. We found that the happiness level of workers in the tourism and restaurant sectors declined drastically after the announcement of the postponement. Only two weeks later, their happiness level did not alter from the pre-announcement level. This tendency was strongly observed in Tokyo and the surrounding prefectures, but not in other prefectures. However, workers engaged in the tourism and restaurant sectors did not predict a decrease in their income even after the postponement. Combined, these findings indicate that loss of extending hospitality, rather than reduction in income, temporarily reduces the happiness level of workers.","output":"The impact of postponing 2020 Tokyo Olympics on the happiness of O-MO-TE-NA-SHI workers in tourism: a consequence of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).

STUDY DESIGN To formally assess the cardiovascular safety of liraglutide, the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of cardiovascular outcome Results (LEADER) trial was commenced in 2010. LEADER is a phase 3B, multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with long-term follow-up. Patients with T2DM at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) who were either drug naive or treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents or selected insulin regimens (human NPH, long-acting analog, or premixed) alone or in combination with oral antihyperglycemics were eligible for inclusion. Randomized patients are being followed for up to 5 years. The primary end point is the time from randomization to a composite outcome consisting of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

Challenges to improving integration include the risk of curtailing the basic sciences in the process and the push to decrease contact hours in medical curricula. Self-paced learning tools can be developed that deliberately relate basic and clinical sciences to aid students in making interdisciplinary connections. The purpose of this project was to develop, implement, and evaluate a self-paced learning module that would be applicable to integration of different disciplines in medical education. The module was intended to improve integration between histology and anatomic pathology before a respiratory pathology laboratory session. Qualtrics XM, a survey software commonly available at educational institutions, was used in a novel manner to create the module. Module activities included pre- and post-module quizzes; four short videos emphasizing normal histological features and recalling associated pathologies; three categorization activities designed for students to recognize normal versus abnormal characteristics of lung specimens; and post-activity feedback. Preliminary data from first-year medical students showed that post-module quiz scores were significantly higher than pre-module quiz scores (p < 0.001) and that module users pre-laboratory pathology self-efficacy was significantly higher than non-users (p < 0.05). These data suggest that module use facilitated short-term knowledge gain and improved pathology self-efficacy before the laboratory session. Online modules can be developed affordably using Qualtrics XM to integrate anatomical sciences with other disciplines, while providing students interactive learning resources without increasing contact hours. The module presented in this report focused on normal versus abnormal morphology, guiding students through recognizing the continuum from healthy to disease states before learning about the pathologies more in depth.

METHODS: An observational ICU cohort study including adult patients admitted to the ICU at Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, from March 13th to June 8th 2020. We compared the clinical, electrophysiological and plasma biomarker data between COVID-19 patients who developed CIN/CIM and those who did not. Electrophysiological characteristics were also compared between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ICU patients. RESULTS: 111 COVID-19 patients were included, 11 of whom developed CIN/CIM. Patients with CIN/CIM had more severe illness; longer ICU stay, more thromboembolic events and were more frequently treated with invasive ventilation for longer than 2 weeks. In particular CIN was more frequent among COVID-19 patients with ICUAW (50%) compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort (0%, p = 0.008). Neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) levels were higher in the CIN/CIM group compared with those that did not develop CIN/CIM (both p = 0.001) and correlated with nerve amplitudes. CONCLUSIONS: CIN/CIM was more prevalent among COVID-19 ICU patients with severe illness. SIGNIFICANCE: COVID-19 patients who later developed CIN/CIM had significantly higher NfL and GFAp in the early phase of ICU care, suggesting their potential as predictive biomarkers for CIN/CIM.","output":"Critical illness polyneuropathy, myopathy and neuronal biomarkers in COVID-19 patients: A prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis and treatment of small bowel diseases (SBDs) has always been a challenge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) in the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel diseases. METHOD: The clinical data of 466 patients who underwent double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) in the Endoscope Center of Gastroenterology Department of the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province from Jan. 2015 to Dec. 2020 were analysed retrospectively. The factors included age, sex, indications, endoscopic treatment results, pathological results, discharge diagnosis and so on. RESULTS: A total of 370 patients underwent 466 double-balloon enteroscopies, among whom 274 underwent one examination and 96 received two-way examinations (oral and transanal approaches). Abnormalities were detected in 299 cases, with a detection rate of 80.81% (299/370). The common indications were occult gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) (30.8%, 114/370) and abdominal pain (28.3%, 105/370). The diagnosis rates were 64.9% and 77.1%, respectively. The common positive findings included nonspecific inflammation/erosion (60 cases), ulcers (34 cases), diverticulum (32 cases), polyps (26 cases) and Crohn's disease (CD) (24 cases). The common tumours were lymphoma(12 cases), adenocarcinoma(11 cases) and stromal tumour(8 cases). Lymphoma was mostly located in the ileum, while stromal tumours and adenocarcinoma were mostly located in the duodenum and jejunum. The main endoscopic intervention measures were haemostasis and polypectomy, including haemostatic clip, argon plasma coagulation (APC), endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), endoscopic trap resection, endoscopic foreign body extraction and other operations, without serious complications.

Machine learning models can support decision making in healthcare by assessing fatality risk in patients that do not yet show severe signs of COVID-19. Most predictive models rely on static demographic features and clinical values obtained upon hospitalization. However, time-dependent biomarkers associated with COVID-19 severity, such as antibody titers, can substantially contribute to the development of more accurate outcome models. Here we show that models trained on immune biomarkers, longitudinally monitored throughout hospitalization, predicted mortality and were more accurate than models based on demographic and clinical data upon hospital admission. Our best-performing predictive models were based on the temporal analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike IgG titers, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. These biomarkers, together with C-reactive protein and blood urea nitrogen levels, were found to correlate with severity of disease and mortality in a time-dependent manner. Shapley additive explanations of our model revealed the higher predictive value of day post-symptom onset (PSO) as hospitalization progresses and showed how immune biomarkers contribute to predict mortality. In sum, we demonstrate that the kinetics of immune biomarkers can inform clinical models to serve as a powerful monitoring tool for predicting fatality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, underscoring the importance of contextualizing clinical parameters according to their time post-symptom onset.","output":"Longitudinally monitored immune biomarkers predict the timing of COVID-19 outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020 summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo were postponed to July-September 2021 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Actions aimed at women's economic empowerment through income transfer programs are one of those. Still, the literature on their impact is scarce and controversial. This study attempts to shed some light on this matter assessing whether the Brazilian Conditional Cash Transfer Program (Programa Bolsa Famlia [PBF]) is a protective factor for psychological and physical IPV against women in families of different levels of income. This is a cross-sectional, household-based study conducted in the city of Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The sample comprised 807 women reporting some intimate relationship in the 12 months before the interview. Information on IPV and participation on PBF were collected through face-to-face interviews using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2) and a direct question, respectively. A multigroup path analysis was applied to study the relations between PBF and psychological and physical IPV, considering confounding factors, some mediators, and moderation by income. The prevalence of both psychological and physical IPV are high, be it in the poverty and the extreme poverty income strata (psychological IPV: 66.2% and 72.7%, respectively; physical IPV: 26.2% and 40.6%, respectively). Results also showed a positive and direct association between PBF and psychological violence, yet only among families above the poverty line ( = .287, p = .001). The same could be found regarding physical violence, but the effect of PBF was indirect, mediated by psychological violence ( = .220, p = .003).

To minimise infection risk, many people have been switched from intravenous to subcutaneous biologics including biosimilars. DESIGN: The survey was designed to understand comparative economic issues related to the intravenous infusion vs subcutaneous biologic administration routes for infliximab. The survey focused on direct cost drivers/indirect cost drivers. Acquisition costs of medicines were not included due to data not being available publicly. Wider policy implications linked to the pandemic were also explored. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Semistructured single telephone interviews were carried out with twenty key stakeholders across the National Health Service(NHS) from 35 clinical/42 pharmacy/28 commissioning roles. The interviews were undertaken virtually during April 2020. From interview (n = 20) results, a simple cost analysis was developed plus a qualitative analysis of reports on wider policy/patient impacts. RESULTS: Key findings included evidence of significant variation in local infusion tariffs UK wide, with interviewees reporting that not all actual costs incurred are captured in published tariff costs. A cost analysis showed administration costs 50% lower in the subcutaneous compared to infusion routes, with most patients administering subcutaneous medicines themselves. Other indirect benefits to this route included less pressure on infusion unit waiting times/reduced risk of COVID-19 infection plus reduced patient 'out of pocket' costs. However, this was to some extent offset by increased pressure on home-care and community/primary care services. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from infusion to subcutaneous routes is currently driven by the COVID-19 pandemic in many services. A case for biologics (infusion vs subcutaneous) must be made on accurate real-world economic analysis. In an analysis of direct/indirect costs, excluding medicine acquisition costs, subcutaneous administration appears to be the more cost saving option for many patients even without the benefit of industry funded home-care. What's known One important group of people at high risk in COVID-19 pandemic are those with autoimmune conditions, including those with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Depending on the complexity of their condition, some of the patients in this group may be receiving intravenous biologic infusion therapy which under normal circumstances is administered within a hospital or day hospital setting. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has published new guidance to ensure that patients having intravenous treatment are assessed for possible switching to the same treatment in subcutaneous form. What's new A cost analysis showed that administration costs for subcutananous routes are 50% lower than for infusion routes, with most patients administering subcutaneous medicines themselves. Other indirect benefits to this route included less pressure on infusion unit waiting times and reduced risk of COVID-19 infection, along with reduced patient costs.

These include a heavy impact on mental health due to fast changing lockdown and quarantine measures, uncertainty about health and safety and the prospect of new waves of infections. To provide crisis mental health support during the pandemic, E?tv?s Lornd University in Hungary launched a specialist online counselling programme, consisting of one to three sessions. The programme was available to all university members between 4th March and 25th May 2020. Overall, 47 clients received support. In this paper we discuss challenges reported by clients, key features of providing a brief mental health intervention online, reflect on counsellor experiences and give recommendations on how mental health services could be developed in the time of crisis. Most clients had challenges with developing a daily routine under quarantine;and many had hardship related to finances, housing, and distance learning. Common mental health consequences included fear from the virus and stress, anxiety, and fatigue due to the interruption to everyday life. In some cases, more complex conditions were triggered by the pandemic. Examples include addictive behaviours and symptoms of depression or psychosis. However, referring cases beyond the competency of counselling proved to be a challenge due to the closure of specialist services. Counsellors observed three key features to the online delivery of a brief crisis mental health intervention: [1] an explicit problem-oriented approach to counselling;[2] challenges of building rapport online;and [3] frames of online counselling. Counsellor experiences often overlapped with those of clients and included challenges of working from home and adjusting to online counselling methods. The possibility of online counselling allowed that mental health care could take place at all during the pandemic. Client experiences reflect findings from previous literature. Like other mental health initiatives launched to tackle COVID-19, the intervention's effectiveness was not measured given the unexpected context and short time frame for programme development. We recommend the use of impact measurement tools to develop mental health services in crises. Meanwhile, the pandemic brought to attention the need to better understand online delivery models. Counsellors should have access to training opportunities on online counselling and managing work-life balance in a remote setting. The COVID-19 counselling programme in E?tv?s Lornd University, Hungary is an example of providing online mental health counselling in the time of crisis.

Our results showed that the emotional changes of members ranged from shock to depression to positive. The public's emotions swiftly changed from stress, anxiety, and isolation, to the hope of returning to work or finding a job during the pandemic with the help of OESAG. OESAG has effectively regulated the negative emotions of members by conducting psychological crisis intervention to provide members a space to communicate with each other, especially the female and frontline staff.

A best-fit multiple linear regression model was constructed to model the relationship between P and R, from 1 January to 20 March 2020, after accounting for meteorology, net move-in mobility (NM), time trend (T), co-morbidity (CM), and the time-lag effects. Regression analysis shows that P ( = 0.4309, p < 0.001) is the most significant determinant of R. In addition, T ( = ?0.3870, p < 0.001), absolute humidity (AH) ( = 0.2476, p = 0.002), P  AH ( = ?0.2237, p < 0.001), and NM ( = 0.1383, p = 0.003) are more significant determinants of R, as compared to GDP per capita ( = 0.1115, p = 0.015) and CM (Asthma) ( = 0.1273, p = 0.005). A matching technique was adopted to demonstrate a possible causal relationship between P and R across 18 provincial capital cities. A 10 g/m(3) increase in P gives a 1.5% increase in R (p < 0.001). Interaction analysis also reveals that P  AH and R are negatively correlated ( = ?0.2237, p < 0.001). Given that P exacerbates R, we recommend the installation of air purifiers and improved air ventilation to reduce the effect of P on R. Given the increasing observation that COVID-19 is airborne, measures that reduce P, plus mandatory masking that reduces the risks of COVID-19 associated with viral-particulate transmission, are strongly recommended. Our study is distinguished by the focus on the rate of change instead of the individual cases of COVID-19 when modelling the statistical relationship between R and P in China; causal instead of correlation analysis via the matching analysis, while taking into account the key confounders, and the individual plus the interaction effects of P and AH on R.","output":"Outdoor PM(2.5) concentration and rate of change in COVID-19 infection in provincial capital cities in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular disease is a frequent complication and the most common cause of death in patients with CKD. Despite landmark medical advancements, mortality due to cardiovascular disease is still 20 times higher in CKD patients than in the general population, which is mainly due to the high prevalence of risk factors in this group. Indeed, in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, CKD patients are exposed to nontraditional ones, which include metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory alterations. The global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has brought novel challenges for both cardiologists and nephrologists alike. Emerging evidence indicates that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases the risk of cardiovascular events and that several aspects of the disease may synergize with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients. A better understanding of these mechanisms is pivotal for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular events in this context, and we believe that additional clinical and experimental studies are needed to improve cardiovascular outcomes in CKD patients with COVID-19. In this review, we provide a summary of traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients, discussing their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infection and focusing on CO-VID-19-related cardiovascular complications that may severely affect short- and long-term outcomes in this high-risk population.","output":"The Impact of Old and Novel Cardiovascular Risk Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People's knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) are a part of the public's emergency response capability and play an important role in controlling public health emergencies.

We aimed to analyse characteristics of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in Brazil, and to examine the impact of COVID-19 on health-care resources and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of all patients aged 20 years or older with quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe, a nationwide surveillance database in Brazil, between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020 (epidemiological weeks 8C33). We also examined the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic across three 4-week periods within this timeframe (epidemiological weeks 8C12, 19C22, and 27C30). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We compared the regional burden of hospital admissions stratified by age, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and respiratory support. We analysed data from the whole country and its five regions: North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South. FINDINGS: Between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020, 254 288 patients with RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe. The mean age of patients was 60 (SD 17) years, 119 657 (47%) of 254 288 were aged younger than 60 years, 143 521 (56%) of 254 243 were male, and 14 979 (16%) of 90 829 had no comorbidities. Case numbers increased across the three 4-week periods studied: by epidemiological weeks 19C22, cases were concentrated in the North, Northeast, and Southeast; by weeks 27C30, cases had spread to the Central-West and South regions. 232 036 (91%) of 254 288 patients had a defined hospital outcome when the data were exported; in-hospital mortality was 38% (87 515 of 232 036 patients) overall, 59% (47 002 of 79 687) among patients admitted to the ICU, and 80% (36 046 of 45 205) among those who were mechanically ventilated. The overall burden of ICU admissions per ICU beds was more pronounced in the North, Southeast, and Northeast, than in the Central-West and South. In the Northeast, 1545 (16%) of 9960 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation outside the ICU compared with 431 (8%) of 5388 in the South. In-hospital mortality among patients younger than 60 years was 31% (4204 of 13 468) in the Northeast versus 15% (1694 of 11 196) in the South. INTERPRETATION: We observed a widespread distribution of COVID-19 across all regions in Brazil, resulting in a high overall disease burden. In-hospital mortality was high, even in patients younger than 60 years, and worsened by existing regional disparities within the health system. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to improve access to high-quality care for critically ill patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, particularly in LMICs.

These generalisations have not been able until today to represent the potential of the epidemic to overwhelm hospital capacity until today. This work builds on previous generalisations, including a new compartment for hospital occupancy that allows accounting for the infected patients that need specialised medical attention. Consequently, a deeper understanding of the hospitalisations rate and probability as well as of the recovery rates for hospitalised and non-hospitalised individuals is achieved, offering new information and predictions of crucial importance for the planning of the health systems and global epidemic response. Additionally, a new methodology to calibrate epidemic flows between compartments is proposed. We conclude that the two-step calibration procedure is able to recalibrate non-error-free data and showed crucial to reconstruct the series in a specific situation characterised by significant errors over the official recovery cases. The performed modelling also allowed us to understand how effective the several interventions (lockdown or other mobility restriction measures) were, offering insight for helping public authorities to set the timing and intensity of the measures in order to avoid the implosion of the health systems.","output":"Addressing hospitalisations with non-error-free data by generalised SEIR modelling of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Low-income couples are at an increased risk for relationship instability and divorce, which can have residual impacts on coparenting between the two partners. Growing evidence suggests that brief online relationship education programs can be an effective tool for alleviating relationship distress among low-income couples. However, findings remain mixed when it comes to whether benefits from relationship-focused programs not explicitly addressing coparenting spillover to coparenting among those with children. This preregistered study sought to investigate whether couples participating in an evidence-based online relationship-focused intervention, the OurRelationship program, experienced improvements in coparenting during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To expand on the existing literature, coparenting outcomes assessed included partners' gatekeeping behaviors in addition to coparenting satisfaction, given their important implications for partner involvement in parenting. We also examined the extent to which changes in coparenting were moderated by pre-post gains in relationship satisfaction, child gender, division of childcare, and pandemic disruptions. In a sample of 136 low-income couples (N = 272 individuals) and a one-group/pre-post design, we found medium-sized gains in relationship satisfaction (Cohen's d = .76) and small-sized improvements in all coparenting aspects assessed (|d|s = .29-.39). Couples with greater gains in relationship satisfaction experienced greater improvements in coparenting; further, coparenting changes were robust to other moderators. Taken together, findings suggested that brief online relationship education programs, such as the OurRelationship program, may be a promising option to improve coparenting among relationally distressed low-income couples with children during a global health crisis.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the receptor responsible for coronavirus binding, while subsequent cell entry relies on priming by the serine protease TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2). Although renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) blockers have been suggested to upregulate ACE2, their use in COVID-19 patients is now considered safe. The aim of our study was to investigate parameters that determine COVID-19 severity, focusing on RAAS-components and variation in the genes encoding for ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Methods: Adult patients hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection between May 2020 and October 2020 in the Haga Teaching Hospital were included, and soluble ACE2 (sACE2), renin, aldosterone (in heparin plasma), and polymorphisms in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes (in DNA obtained from EDTA blood) were determined. Measurements and main results Of the 188 patients that were included, 60 were defined as severe COVID-19 (ICU and/or death). These patients more often used antidiabetic drugs, were older, had higher renin and sACE2 levels, lower aldosterone levels, and a lower aldosterone/renin ratio. In addition, they displayed the TMPRSS2-rs2070788 AA genotype less frequently. No ACE2 polymorphism-related differences were observed. Multivariate regression analysis revealed independent significance for age, sACE2, the aldosterone/renin ratio, and the TMPRSS2 rs2070788 non-AA genotype as predictors of COVID-19 severity, together yielding a C-index of 0.79. Findings were independent of the use of RAAS blockers.

DEVELOPMENT We reviewed the publications in scientific journals in the last decade that had as their main topic the use of digital health tools or telemedicine focused on the care of patients with epilepsy, including 4 months after the national quarantines due to the appearance of the virus SARS-CoV-2. Seventeen publications were found on the use of telemedicine focused on epilepsy. The most widely used tools internationally are online platforms, followed by mobile applications, videoconferences, epileptic seizure capture systems, checklists, algorithms for understanding medical data, phone calls, tele-encephalography and text messages.

Such publicly accessible prediction models are lacking, however. Methods: Based on a comprehensive evaluation of existing machine learning (ML) methods, we created two models based solely on the age, gender, and medical histories of 23,749 hospital-confirmed COVID-19 patients from February to September 2020: a symptom prediction model (SPM) and a mortality prediction model (MPM). The SPM predicts 12 symptom groups for each patient: respiratory distress, consciousness disorders, chest pain, paresis or paralysis, cough, fever or chill, gastrointestinal symptoms, sore throat, headache, vertigo, loss of smell or taste, and muscular pain or fatigue. The MPM predicts the death of COVID-19-positive individuals. Results: The SPM yielded ROC-AUCs of 0.53C0.78 for symptoms. The most accurate prediction was for consciousness disorders at a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 70%. 2,440 deaths were observed in the study population. MPM had a ROC-AUC of 0.79 and could predict mortality with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 70%. About 90% of deaths occurred in the top 21 percentile of risk groups. To allow patients and clinicians to use these models easily, we created a freely accessible online interface at www.aicovid.net. Conclusion: The ML models predict COVID-19-related symptoms and mortality using information that is readily available to patients as well as clinicians.

OBJECTIVES To measure systemic cytokine levels in blood plasma from young South African children with and without ALRI and with and without HIV to determine associations between cytokine responses and disease status and respiratory viral identification. METHODS Blood plasma samples were collected from 106 hospitalized ALRI cases and 54 non-ALRI controls less than two years of age. HIV status was determined. Blood plasma concentrations of 19 cytokines, 7 chemokines and 4 growth factors (EGF, FGF-basic, HGF and VEGF) were measured using The Human Cytokine 30-Plex Panel. Common respiratory viruses were identified by PCR. RESULTS Mean cytokine concentrations for G-CSF, IFN-, IL-5 and MCP-1 were significantly higher in ALRI cases than in non-respiratory controls.Within the ALRI cases, several cytokines were higher in children with a virus compared with children without a virus. Mean cytokine concentrations for IFN-, IFN-, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF- and MIP-1 were significantly lower in HIV-infected cases than in HIV-uninfected cases, while IP-10 and MIG were significantly higher in HIV-infected cases than in HIV-uninfected cases. CONCLUSIONS Certain cytokines are likely to play an important role in the host immune response to ALRI.

They include cells including adaptive immunity (T and B cells) innate effectors and innate like effectors as well as soluble factors like cytokines and antibodies. This system acts differently in the different organs and tissues and upon environmental stress. Cancer induces also a modification of the homeostasis of the tissues. Immunology is a rapidly evolving science with important recent and not fully completed actors and functions. Various novel therapies rely on the immune system and have demonstrated their high effciency during the very last years. The first most recent waves of immunotherapies rely on the mechanisms of cosignaling but also genitically engeneered T cells prone to kill tumor targets as well as technological development using bispecific antibodies recognizing both tumor and an activating receptor on immune cells. The next steps will embrace various important mechanisms involved in the immune responses including cytokines, blockade of the inhibitory pathways in the tumor micro environment, innate and innate-like cells and vaccines. ? 2020 SPLF.

Our broad contention is that, notwithstanding its biomedical reality, TB is socially constructed by, and through, human experience. Further, public health practitioners depend, to a large extent, on the media to alert the public to threats of disease and opportunities for protection. However, the messages conveyed are sometimes neither helpful nor accurate. In our analysis of TB coverage in three major daily newspapers in New Zealand, we enumerate and classify references to the disease, as well as undertake a discursive analysis of the revealed themes. Of the 366 texts we retrieved in the database search, we selected 120 for in-depth analysis. Our examination indicated the importance of bovine TB within the national consciousness, the stigmatised character of TB and the association between TB and immigrants. We observe that newspaper stories in general, and commentaries by public health officials in particular, are invariably offered on a case by case basis. We conclude that this specificity in time and place avoids more challenging discourses linking TB with deeply embedded determinants of health such as the strong link between TB and poverty.","output":"Discourses of disease: Representations of tuberculosis within New Zealand newspapers 2002C2004()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tradition of making fermented foods and beverages in Iraq dates back to 7500 BC.

Methods: The SEMI-COVID registry is an ongoing retrospective cohort comprising consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Spain since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, radiology, treatment, and progress are collected. Patients with COPD were selected and compared to patients without COPD. Factors associated with a poor prognosis were analyzed. Results: Of the 10,420 patients included in the SEMI-COVID registry as of May 21, 2020, 746 (7.16%) had a diagnosis of COPD. Patients with COPD are older than those without COPD (77 years vs 68 years) and more frequently male. They have more comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, kidney failure) and a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (2 vs 1, p<0.001). The mortality rate in COPD patients was 38.3% compared to 19.2% in patients without COPD (p<0.001). Male sex, a history of hypertension, heart failure, moderate-severe chronic kidney disease, presence of cerebrovascular disease with sequelae, degenerative neurological disease, dementia, functional dependence, and a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index have been associated with increased mortality due to COVID-19 in COPD patients. Survival was higher among patients with COPD who were treated with hydroxychloroquine (87.1% vs 74.9%, p<0.001) and with macrolides (57.9% vs 50%, p<0.037).

However, the ramp down in cardiac surgery volumes may result in unintended harm to patients who are at high risk of mortality if their conditions are left untreated. To help optimize triage decisions, we derived and ambispectively validated a clinical score to predict intensive care unit length of stay after cardiac surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following ethics approval, we derived and performed multicenter valida tion of clinical models to predict the likelihood of short (2 days) and prolonged intensive care unit length of stay (7 days) in patients aged 18 years, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and/or aortic, mitral, and tricuspid value surgery in Ontario, Canada. Multivariable logistic regression with backward variable selection was used, along with clinical judgment, in the modeling process. For the model that predicted short intensive care unit stay, the c\\\\statistic was 0.78 in the derivation cohort and 0.71 in the validation cohort. For the model that predicted prolonged stay, c\\\\statistic was 0.85 in the derivation and 0.78 in the validation cohort. The models, together termed the CardiOttawa LOS Score, demonstrated a high degree of accuracy during prospective testing. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical judgment alone has been shown to be inaccurate in predicting postoperative intensive care unit length of stay. The CardiOttawa LOS Score performed well in prospective validation and will complement the clinician's gestalt in making more efficient resource allocation during the COVID\\\\19 period and beyond.","output":"Derivation and Validation of a Clinical Model to Predict Intensive Care Unit Length of Stay After Cardiac Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The adoption of minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques has revolutionised urological practice.

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines were adhered to. Ten studies, that included both randomised controlled trials and retrospective case series reviews, were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The effect of PNP pressure on outcomes following prostatectomy, live donor nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy and a variety of benign upper tract procedures were discussed. Low pressure PNP appears safe when compared to high pressure PNP, potentially reducing post-operative pain and rates of ileus. When compared to general surgery, there is a lack of quality evidence investigating the impact of PNP pressures on outcomes within urology. Low pressure PNP appears non-inferior to high pressure PNP.

However, uncontrolled conditions in online experiments can be problematic, particularly when inferences hinge on response-times (RTs) in the millisecond range. To address this challenge, we developed a mobile-friendly open-source application using R-Shiny, a popular R package. In particular, we aimed to replicate the numerical distance effect, a well-established cognitive phenomenon. In the task, 169 participants (109 with a mobile device, 60 on a desktop computer) completed 116 trials displaying two-digit target numbers and decided whether they were larger or smaller than a fixed standard number. Sessions lasted ~7-minutes. Using generalized linear mixed models estimated with Bayesian inference methods, we observed a numerical distance effect: RTs decreased with the logarithm of the absolute difference between the target and the standard. Our results support the use of R-Shiny for RT-data collection. Furthermore, our method allowed us to measure systematic shifts in recorded RTs related to different OSs, web browsers, and devices, with mobile devices inducing longer shifts than desktop devices. Our work shows that precise RT measures can be reliably obtained online across mobile and desktop devices.

Under the oxidative stress, Nrf2 is separated from Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which is a key sensor of oxidative stress, translocated to the nucleus, interacts with the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the target gene, and then activates the transcriptional pathway to ameliorate the cellular redox condition. Curcumin is a yellow polyphenolic curcuminoid from Curcuma longa (turmeric) that has revealed a broad spectrum of bioactivities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-viral activities. Curcumin significantly increases the nuclear expression levels and promotes the biological effects of Nrf2 via the interaction with Cys151 in Keap1, which makes it a marvelous therapeutic candidate against a broad range of oxidative stress-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, viral infections, and more recently SARS-CoV-2. Currently, the multifactorial property of the diseases and lack of adequate medical treatment, especially in viral diseases, result in developing new strategies to finding potential drugs. Curcumin potentially opens up new views as possible Nrf2 activator. However, its low bioavailability that is due to low solubility and low stability in the physiological conditions is a significant challenge in the field of its efficient and effective utilization in medicinal purposes.

Hosts with high infections are more likely to transmit infection to others, and are may be more likely to experience progression from infection to disease symptoms, to being physiologically compromised by disease. Understanding how and why hosts exhibit variation in infection intensity therefore plays a major part in developing and implementing measures aimed at controlling infection spread, its effects, and its chance of persisting and circulating within a population of hosts. To track the relative importance of a number of variables in determining the level of infection intensity, we ran field-surveys at two breeding sites over a 12 month period using marked larvae of the common midwife toad (Alyes obstetricans) and their levels of infection with the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). At each sampling occasion we measured the density of larvae, the temperature of the water in the 48 h prior to sampling, the period of time the sampled individual had been in the water body, the developmental (Gosner) stage and the intensity of Bd infection of the individual. Overall our data suggest that the temperature and the duration of time spent in the water play a major role in determining the intensity of Bd infection within an individual host. However, although the duration of time spent in the water was clearly associated with infection intensity, the relationship was negative: larvae that had spent less than 3C6 months in the water had significantly higher infection intensities than those that had spent over 12 months, although this infection intensity peaked between 9 and 12 months. This could be due to animals with heavier infections developing more quickly, suffering increased mortality or, more likely, losing their mouthparts (the only part of anuran larvae that can be infected with Bd). Overall, our results identify drivers of infection intensity, and potentially transmissibility and spread, and we attribute these differences to both host and pathogen biology.","output":"Temperature and duration of exposure drive infection intensity with the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The covid-19 virus isn't the first coronavirus to jump from animals to humans.

METHODS: Retrospective study of 2434 patients (age <21 years) admitted to a PICU from 1 January 2006 through 31 March 2016 and captured in the Virtual Pediatric Systems database with ICD9 diagnosis 277.87, disorders of mitochondrial metabolism. Factors influencing mortality and prolonged length of stay (14 days) were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Predictors independently affecting mortality (adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, p < 0.05): age 1C23 months 3.4 (1.7C6.6) and mechanical ventilation 4.7 (2.6C8.6) were risk factors; post-operative 0.2 (0.1C0.6), readmission 0.5 (0.3C0.9), and neurologic reason for admittance 0.3 (0.1C0.9) were factors reducing risk. Predictors affecting prolonged length of stay: mechanical ventilation 7.4 (5.2C10.3) and infectious reason for admittance 2.0 (1.3C3.2) were risk factors, post-operative patients 0.3 (0.2C0.5) had lower risk. The utility of PRISM and PIM2 scores in this patient group was evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The single most predictive factor for both mortality and prolonged length of stay is the presence of mechanical ventilation.

Recently, chemokines, the group of chemotactic cytokines, have become a focus for basic and clinical scientists in the context of the development and treatment of brain diseases. Among them, chemokine CCL2 and its main receptor CCR2 have become candidate mediators of abnormal brain-immune system dialogue in depression. Besides the chemotactic activity, the CCL2-CCR2 axis is involved in various neurobiological processes, neurogenesis, neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, as well as neuroregeneration. Given the range of immunomodulatory possibilities that the CCL2-CCR2 pair can exert on the nervous system, its proinflammatory properties were initially thought to be a major contributor to the development of depressive disorders. However, further research suggests that the malfunctions of the nervous system are rather associated with impaired homeostatic properties manifested by the CCL2-CCR2 dyad dysfunctions. This review aims to present literature data on the action of the CCL2-CCR2 axis in the central nervous system under physiological and pathological conditions, as well as the contribution of this ligand-receptor system to the processes underlying affective disorders. Additionally, this article draws attention to the importance of the CCL2-CRR2 pathway as a potential pharmacological target with antidepressant potential.","output":"Targeting the CCL2-CCR2 axis in depressive disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social isolation is considered one of the main risk factors leading to intimate partner violence episodes; this evidence also emerged during the application of stay-at-home policies to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

The need for this type of training has been reinforced by the massive limitations of presence education and social contacts due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention. However, students are still quite reluctant to take part in such training, although their positive effects have been repeatedly proven. OBJECTIVES: Thus, the goal of our research was to examine perceptions and barriers among university students, and to deduce strategies for target-group oriented communication for mindfulness training. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with male and female students with low and high experience in mindfulness training. RESULTS: It was shown that students prefer an ideologically neutral and evidence-based framing of the trainings. Emphasis of the spiritual background seems to limit the access for inexperienced users (although they are a relevant part for experienced users). In addition, it is important for the interviewed students that the advertisement for the mindfulness training depicts the relevance for academic and professional challenges without selling them as tools for performance enhancement. CONCLUSIONS: Although the roots of mindfulness training is spiritual, inexperienced users are skeptical about these aspects. This corresponds with more general discussions about the introduction of mindfulness training at universities. Furthermore, evidence for the selection of gatekeepers (authentic intermediaries) and the selection of message strategies (diverse exemplars) can be deduced.","output":"Lieber professionell als spirituell.

Most recently, GCs have been shown to be an effective remedy to manage septic shock in patients infected with COVID-19. In this study, a self-made dielectric barrier discharge reactor integrating microbubbles and peroxymonosulfate (DBD/MB/PMS) was used to degrade the GCs in water. At neutral pH and ambient temperature, hydrocortisone (HC), betamethasone (BT) and fluocinolone acetonide (FA) were degraded effectively by the DBD/MB/PMS system with the 90-min degradation efficiencies of 77%, 80% and 82%, respectively (discharge power: 83.5 W;PMS:GC ratio: 20:1). In comparison, the 90-min degradation efficiencies for HC, BT and FA by DBD/MB system (discharge power: 83.5 W, pH unadjusted, flow rate 40 mg/L) were only 49%, 54% and 60% respectively;and the efficiencies by heat activated PMS (90 C) were only 24%, 12%, and 16%, respectively. Hence, DBD/MB is an efficient approach for PMS activation, which resulted in increased removal efficiencies and energy yields for GCs degradation. The rate constants for GCs degradation also increased with the increase of PMS dosage and initial solution pH. Both SO4? and OH were prominent species for GCs degradation. Based on the results of scavenging experiment, the contributions of SO4? for HC, BT and FA degradation were roughly estimated to be 51%, 59% and 60%, respectively, and the contributions of OH were 30%, 29% and 27%, respectively.

Interestingly, ~200 ms is also the typical duration of eye fixations during reading. Prompted by this observation, we demonstrate that German readers sample written text at ~5 Hz. A subsequent meta-analysis of 142 studies from 14 languages replicates this result and shows that sampling frequencies vary across languages between 3.9 Hz and 5.2 Hz. This variation systematically depends on the complexity of the writing systems (character-based versus alphabetic systems and orthographic transparency). Finally, we empirically demonstrate a positive correlation between speech spectrum and eye movement sampling in low-skilled non-native readers, with tentative evidence from post hoc analysis suggesting the same relationship in low-skilled native readers. On the basis of this convergent evidence, we propose that during reading, our brain's linguistic processing systems imprint a preferred processing rate-that is, the rate of spoken language production and perception-onto the oculomotor system.","output":"Eye movements during text reading align with the rate of speech production."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high demand of diagnostic tools. Rapid antigen detection tests have been developed and many have received regulatory acceptance such as CE IVD or FDA markings. Their performance needs to be carefully assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 158 positive and 40 negative retrospective samples collected in saline and analyzed by a laboratory-developed RT-PCR test were used to evaluate Sofia (Quidel), Standard Q (SD Biosensor), and Panbio? (Abbott) rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs). A subset of the specimens was subjected to virus culture. RESULTS: The specificity of all RADTs was 100% and the sensitivity and percent agreement was 80% and 85% for Sofia, 81% and 85% for Standard Q, and 83% and 86% for Panbio?, respectively. All three RADTs evaluated in this study reached a more than 90% sensitivity for samples with a high viral load as estimated from the low Ct (Cycle threshold) values in the reference RT-PCR. Virus culture was successful in 80% of specimens with a Ct value <25. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, the RADTs were less sensitive than RT-PCR. However, they benefit from the speed and ease of testing, and lower price as compared to RT-PCR.

Among the possible causes of this pathology, both the activation of vascular endothelial cells, leading to the exposure of tissue factor by these cells, and direct activation of the plasma hemostasis were named. Besides, there is a significant change in platelet responses to activation, which is not accompanied by significant thrombocytopenia. The mechanism of platelet dysfunction is rather controversial. On the one hand, there are suggestions that platelets can act as a direct container for the virus, thus spreading it throughout the body. On the other hand, the presence of viral RNA in platelets has been demonstrated in only one study, while other authors have obtained the opposite result. Another mechanism of the virus's direct effect on platelets is the penetration of the virus into megakaryocytes and the subsequent violation of thrombocytopoiesis. However, three of the four published works show that platelets from patients with SARS-CoV-2 are in an activated state (the so-called platelet pre-activation). This phenomenon can be caused by the direct influence of the virus and the effect of thromboinflammation in the lungs on platelet functions.

The use of antimicrobials for treating neonatal calf diarrhoea cases is still a common practice among veterinary surgeons, although its use is only justified in bacterial infections evolving towards a systemic disease. Since the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials for treating diarrhoeic calves increases the risk for the appearance of antimicrobial resistances, restrictions on the use of antimicrobials in veterinary practice were implemented. The aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial susceptibility of ETEC strains obtained from diarrhoeic calves. Our results are alarming since all ETEC strains were resistant to three or more families of antimicrobials; in addition, a high number of strains were resistant to most first-line antimicrobials used in veterinary practice. Only ceftiofur, cefoperazone, cefquinome and gentamicin presented efficacy against most ETEC strains. Thus, empirical treatment of calf scours caused by ETEC is usually ineffective. Our results reveal that performing antimicrobial susceptibility tests in each NCD outbreak is needed for establishing an effective treatment and avoiding the emergence of new resistance mechanisms. ABSTRACT: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the major pathogens involved in neonatal calf diarrhoea (NCD) causing high economic losses in dairy farms. Antibiotic treatment is common in cases of systemic illness caused by NCD, but antimicrobial susceptibility tests (AST) are usually not performed. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial susceptibility of ETEC strains obtained from calves with diarrhoea between 2018C2020. Faecal samples (n = 420) were analyzed to detect the typical ETEC virulence factors F5 and STa. Positive samples were cultured to identify and isolate ETEC strains (n = 41) and ASTs were performed. Our results are alarming since ETEC strains resistant to three or more families of antimicrobials were detected in all isolates. Only four antibiotics (ceftiofur, cefoperazone, cefquinome and gentamicin) presented efficacy against more than 90% of the ETEC strains, while the other ten antibiotics were effective against less than 40% of the strains. In addition, a high number of strains were resistant to most first-line antimicrobials used in veterinary practice. For this reason, when ETEC infection is suspected, an AST must always be performed to select the most appropriate antimicrobial in each case and to avoid the emergence of new resistance mechanisms.","output":"Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli from Diarrhoeic Neonatal Calves in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Differences between total deaths registered during the Covid-19 pandemic and those registered in a previous reference period is a valid measure of the pandemic effect. However, this does not consider demographic changes and temporal trends in mortality. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the excess mortality in 2020 in Italy considering demographic changes and temporal trends in mortality. METHODS: We used daily mortality and population data for the 2011-2019 period to estimate the expected deaths in 2020. Expected deaths were estimated, separately by sex, through an over-dispersed Poisson regression model including calendar year and age group as covariates, a smooth function of the year's week, and the logarithm of the population as offset. The difference between observed and expected deaths was considered a measure of excess mortality. RESULTS: In 2020, 746,146 deaths occurred in Italy. We estimated an excess mortality of 90,725 deaths (95% CI: 86,503-94,914), which became 99,289 deaths after excluding January and February, when mortality was lower than expected. The excess was higher among men (49,422 deaths) than women (41,303 deaths) and it was mostly detected at ages &#8805;80 (60,224 deaths) and ages 65-79 (25,791 deaths), while among the population aged 25-49 and 50-64 we estimated an excess of 281 and 4764 deaths, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After considering demographic changes and temporal improvement in mortality the excess deaths in 2020 still remains above 90,000 deaths.

A 57-item, cross-sectional, online questionnaire including open-ended questions was distributed to RDNs residing in the United States. Over two months (January 2021 to February 2021), 477 RDNs completed the questionnaire. Among RDNs, 68.5% reported no weight change, 21.4% reported weight gain greater than 5 pounds, and 10.3% reported weight loss greater than 5 pounds. Approximately 75% (n = 360) reported their RDN professional training equipped them with the skills needed to maintain healthy eating behaviors. Reduced physical activity and mental health were the top qualitative themes that emerged regarding reasons for weight change.

The willingness to be vaccinated against Covid-19 was investigated by the Italian ongoing ;surveillance systems PASSI (18-69yy) and PASSI d'Argento (65+) with a Covid module added in August 2020. Methods To measure the prevalence of hesitancy and refusal to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, we used a sample collected between August and December 2020, before starting the Covid-19 vaccination campaign. Sample was appropriately weighted to take into account the regional number and the composition by gender and age. Using a multinomial regression model, a specfic analysis on elderly data were provided to examine the association between demographic and medical characteristics and Covid-19 attitudes. Results Among adults, 67% answered to be likely accepting the vaccine (one half not hesitating at all and the other half very likely in any way);younger individuals, aged 18-34, are highly incline (76%). On older sample, 55% would accept vaccination and 16% would likely refuse;the remaining 29% were categorized as hesitant. Compared with the acceptance group, the hesitancy group identified several risk factors in common with the refusal group, including not having gotten a flu vaccine during the previous flu season (hesitancy: RRR=2.0;95% CI 1.4-2.9, refusal: RRR=12.1;95%CI 7.6-19.37) and lower risk of having had a death from Covid-19 among family or friends (hesitancy: RRR=4.8;95%CI 2.0-11.4, refusal: RRR=15.4;95%CI 3.7-64.5). Hesitancy group has also lesser awareness and experience with the disease, a lower perception of being personally at risk and lower trust in the ability of health units to manage the pandemic situation. Conclusions Results show the importance of establishing and maintaining ongoing contact among the preventive services, primary care providers and the population since trust is difficult to establish during an emergency.

Having an agile system that can monitor changing attitudes will be important to altering the messaging and identifying changes in the characteristics of those hesitant or unwilling to be vaccinated.","output":"The willingness to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 in the Italian population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The early COVID-19 pandemic resulted in great psychosocial disruption and stress, raising speculation that psychiatric disorders may worsen. This study aimed to identify patients vulnerable to worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study used electronic health records from March 9 to May 31 in 2019 (n = 94,720) and 2020 (n = 94,589) in a large, community-based health care system. Percent change analysis compared variables standardized to the average patient population for the respective time periods. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, psychiatric visits increased significantly (P < .0001) in 2020, with the majority being telephone/video-based (+264%). Psychiatric care volume increased overall (7%), with the greatest increases in addiction (+42%), behavioral health in primary care (+17%), and adult psychiatry (+5%) clinics. While patients seeking care with preexisting psychiatric diagnoses were mainly stable (&#8722;2%), new patients declined (&#8722;42%). Visits for substance use (+51%), adjustment (+15%), anxiety (+12%), bipolar (+9%), and psychotic (+6%) disorder diagnoses, and for patients aged 18-25 years (+4%) and 26-39 years (+4%), increased. Child/adolescent and older adult patient visits decreased (&#8722;22.7% and &#8722;5.5%, respectively), and fewer patients identifying as White (&#8722;3.8%) or male (&#8722;5.0) or with depression (&#8722;3%) or disorders of childhood (&#8722;2%) sought care. CONCLUSIONS: The early COVID-19 pandemic was associated with dramatic changes in psychiatric care facilitated by a rapid telehealth care transition. Patient volume, demographic, and diagnostic changes may reflect comfort with telehealth or navigating the psychiatric care system. These data can inform health system resource management and guide future work examining how care delivery changes impact psychiatric care quality and access.","output":"Changes in Diagnostic and Demographic Characteristics of Patients Seeking Mental Health Care During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic in a Large, Community-Based Health Care System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exposure-lag response of air temperature on COVID-19 incidence is unclear and there have been concerns regarding the robustness of previous studies.

Usually, they are mild or moderate but occasionally severe. One of these severe side effects is Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS). This review summarizes and discusses GBS as a side effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations (SCoVaG) based on recent research reports. Altogether, nine articles reporting 18 patients with SCoVaG were identified and one more report on another patient is under review. The age for the studies ranged between 20-86y. Nine patients were male, and ten were female. In all 19 patients, SCoVaG developed after the first dose of the vaccine. The Astra Zeneca vaccine was used in fourteen patients, the Pfizer vaccine in four patients, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was applied in one patient. The latency between vaccination and onset of GBS ranged from 3h to 39d. The treatment of SCoVaG included IVIGs (n=13), steroids (n=3), or no therapy (n=3). Six patients required mechanical ventilation. Only a single patient recovered completely and partial recovery was achieved in nine patients. In conclusion, GBS may develop time-linked to the first dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Though a causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations and SCoVaG remains speculative, more evidence is in favour than against it.","output":"Post SARS-CoV-2 vaccination Guillain-Barre syndrome in 19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking center stage in facing the COVID-19 pandemic AI based algorithms are contributing to the development of vaccines and potential forms of treatment In addition, various AI applications, such as robots, are being employed in interaction with the patients, replacing human contact and applying social distancing This paper examines the case of AI and its contribution to the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the issues of protection of the patients personal data, according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Implementation of AI technology in the health sector must be approached from the perspective of ethics in relation to science and technology","output":"Artificial intelligence and the COVID-19 pandemic: Ethical implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In aerobic organisms, oxygen is essential for efficient energy production, and it acts as the last acceptor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and as regulator of gene expression. However, excessive oxygen can lead to production of deleterious reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the directed migration of single cells or cell clumps from hypoxic areas toward a region of optimal oxygen concentration, named aerotaxis, can be considered an adaptive mechanism that plays a major role in biological and pathological processes. One relevant example is the development of O(2) gradients when tumors grow beyond their vascular supply, leading frequently to metastasis. In higher eukaryotic organisms, aerotaxis has only recently begun to be explored, but genetically amenable model organisms suitable to dissect this process remain an unmet need. In this regard, we sought to assess whether Dictyostelium cells, which are an established model for chemotaxis and other motility processes, could sense oxygen gradients and move directionally in their response. By assessing different physical parameters, our findings indicate that both growing and starving Dictyostelium cells under hypoxic conditions migrate directionally toward regions of higher O(2) concentration. This migration is characterized by a specific pattern of cell arrangement. A thickened circular front of high cell density (corona) forms in the cell cluster and persistently moves following the oxygen gradient. Cells in the colony center, where hypoxia is more severe, are less motile and display a rounded shape. Aggregation-competent cells forming streams by chemotaxis, when confined under hypoxic conditions, undergo stream or aggregate fragmentation, giving rise to multiple small loose aggregates that coordinately move toward regions of higher O(2) concentration. By testing a panel of mutants defective in chemotactic signaling, and a catalase-deficient strain, we found that the latter and the pkbR1(null) exhibited altered migration patterns. Our results suggest that in Dictyostelium, like in mammalian cells, an intracellular accumulation of hydrogen peroxide favors the migration toward optimal oxygen concentration. Furthermore, differently from chemotaxis, this oxygen-driven migration is a G protein-independent process.","output":"The Dynamics of Aerotaxis in a Simple Eukaryotic Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Confinement to the home and psychological distress due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may lead to harmful health behaviors, such as overeating, sedentary behavior with reduced physical activity, elevated alcohol and tobacco use and increased screen time causing impaired sleep All of these behaviors are associated with non-communicable diseases and can interfere with immunity While no foods, single nutrients or dietary supplements are capable of preventing infection with COVID-19, a balanced diet containing sufficient amounts of macronutrients and diverse micronutrients is a prerequisite of an optimally functioning immune system High-energy \\"Western\\" diets and obesity are major risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19 Alcohol use and tobacco also have detrimental effects on the immune system Therefore, population-wide body weight control, reduction of smoking rates and limitation of alcohol consumption are important preventive measures Furthermore, sufficient restorative sleep is needed for adequate immune functioning Appropriate lifestyle changes in regard to nutrition, exercise, sleep, smoking and alcohol intake may help shift the population distribution of infection risk and aid in preventing severe COVID-19 disease Large-scale surveys should explore the effects of lifestyle changes, and the provision of reliable lifestyle information and effective interventions to individuals and communities during the pandemic is a pressing need","output":"Lifestyle factors in the prevention of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The development of COVID-19 pandemic has affected all segments of the population;however, it had a significant impact on vulnerable subjects, such as in people experiencing homelessness The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 spread in homeless persons in the city of Rome, Italy Design and Methods: Patients included in the study underwent a clinical evaluation and rapid antibody analysis on capillary blood for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus Symptomatic patients were not included in the screening and immediately referred to local hospitals for further evaluation Results: One-hundred seventy-three patients of both sexes were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection through rapid serological test Age range was 10-80 years;people came from 35 different countries of origin and 4 continents Test results were negative for most patients (170-98 2%);two patients had positive IgM (1 2%) and one patient had positive IgG (0 6%) Conclusions: Our study is the first to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people experiencing homelessness in the city of Rome, Italy Most patients were negative for COVID- 19, although several factors may have had an impact on this result, such as the exclusion of symptomatic patients, the limited sensitivity of rapid serological tests in the initial stage of infection and the prevention measures adopted in these populations Larger studies on fragile populations are needed to prevent and intercept new clusters of infection in the upcoming months","output":"Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection through rapid serology testing in the homeless population in the City of Rome, Italy.

The lymphopenia seen in COVID-19 increases the incidence of susceptibility to other microorganisms and may cause co-infections. As the signs and symptoms of the diseases overlap with other infectious diseases and due to the intensity in health services, the diagnosis of co-infections becomes difficult and the treatment may be delayed. Therefore, infections accompanying COVID-19 cause an increase in morbidity and mortality.The isolation and quarantine measures taken during the COVID-19 process have reduced the number of infections transmitted from person to person. However, there was no significant decrease in diseases transmitted by food, such as salmonellosis. During the pandemic, salmonellosis continued to be a problem, especially in endemic areas such as Pakistan, and an increase in Salmonella infections associated with backyard poultry has been reported in countries such as the United States. A co-infection of COVID-19 and enteric fever associated with travel to Pakistan was reported for the first time in the literature in February 2021. In this case report, the first co-infection of COVID-19 and Salmonella in our country was presented. A 56-yearold male patient with no known systemic disease was admitted to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, weakness and myalgia lasting for three days. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test was positive. The patient has been hospitalized and favipiravir, moxifloxacin, and methylprednisolone were started. Blood cultures were taken from the patient whose clinical picture worsened and fever continued despite of the medical treatment. Salmonella enterica spp. enterica was isolated and ceftriaxone treatment was started. The patient's anamnesis was deepened, but no diarrhea, abdominal pain, suspicious food consumption, travel history were determined. From the second day of the ceftriaxone treatment, the patient's fever decreased and no growth was detected in the control blood cultures. Ceftriaxone treatment was completed in 14 days and the patient was discharged on the 28th day. Approximately 87-95% of Salmonella strains isolated in our country are S.enterica spp. enterica, and S.enterica spp. enterica was also isolated in our case. Salmonella infections most commonly present as gastroenteritis, but the risk of bacteremia increases in case of immunosuppression. Although there was no additional disease in our case, it was considered that the infection in the form of bacteremia occurred due to an immunosuppression caused by COVID-19. In this context; drawing blood cultures of patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 is very important in terms of detecting co-infections and superinfections, and administering appropriate antibiotic therapy at appropriate treatment times. Presentation of first case of Salmonella bacteremia and simultaneous COVID-19 infection in our country was the strong side of our report. In addition, our case is also important as being the first SARS-CoV-2 and Salmonella co-infection unrelated to Pakistan in the literature. The limitation of our case was that S.enterica spp. enterica detected in the blood culture could not be subtyped and the stool culture could not be examined. However, this does not constitute a diagnostic requirement. In addition, the patient's pre-COVID-19 Salmonella carrier status was also unknown. As a result, patients become vulnerable to other infections due to the lymphopenia seen in COVID-19. Therefore, Salmonella bacteremia can be seen with SARS-CoV-2 infection without a comorbid condition. Drawing blood cultures in hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 is very important in terms of detecting concomitant infections in a short time. In patients whose clinical condition does not improve and fever continues despite of treatment, blood cultures should be taken, especially in the case of an advanced immunosuppresive treatment plan, and it should always be kept in mind that secondary infections and co-infections may occur.","output":"[Salmonella Bacteremia Accompanying COVID-19: The First Salmonella Co-Infection in the World Unrelated to Pakistan]./ COVID-19'a Eslik Eden Salmonella Bakteremisi: Pakistan ile Iliskisiz Dnyadaki Ilk Salmonella Ko-Enfeksiyonu"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to study the COVID-19 data for New York City.

Viral infection is associated with both direct (invasive disease) and indirect (immune modulation) effects affecting susceptibility to other infections and promoting allograft rejection. The transplantation recipient is susceptible to a broad array of viral pathogens. Some may be transmitted with the allograft as donor-derived infections, while others result from exposure, either soon after the transplant or from more distant exposures when infection is latent and reactivates in the setting of immune suppression. Simultaneous infections with multiple viral or viral and nonviral pathogens are common. The risk for viral infection is a function of the intensity of exposure and virulence of the specific virus, the intensity of immune suppression used to prevent graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease, underlying immune deficits, and factors affecting host susceptibility. Studies of viral latency, reactivation, and of the cellular effects of viral infection will provide clues for future strategies in prevention and treatment of viral infections.

Control of viral replication during acute disease is mediated by infiltrating virus-specific T cells via cytokine secretion and cytolytic activity, however sterile immunity is not achieved and virus persists resulting in chronic neuroinflammation associated with demyelination. CXCR2 is a chemokine receptor that upon binding to specific ligands promotes host defense through recruitment of myeloid cells to the CNS as well as protecting oligodendroglia from cytokine-mediated death in response to MHV infection.

Objective: To investigate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the environmental surfaces of an ophthalmology examination room after visits by patients who were asymptomatic and had passed COVID-19 triage. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a quality improvement study conducted 1 week after the first officially confirmed COVID-19 case in Izmir Tepecik Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey, on March 20, 2020. A triage system was used to determine the risk of COVID-19 from patients who were asymptomatic and presented for examination in an ophthalmology clinic. Real-time polymerase chain reaction testing was used to detect the presence of viral RNA material in samples from the biomicroscope stage, slitlamp breath shield, phoropter, tonometer, and door handles. The first group of samples was taken before the beginning of the examinations, and the second group of the samples was taken after the last patient had left the room. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was the presence of viral material on surfaces in 5 circular zones with a diameter of 1 m each around where the patients sat. Results: Thirty-one persons visited the room, of whom 22 underwent ophthalmic examination and 9 were companions. The mean (SD) examination time was 9 (4) minutes (range, 5-13 minutes). Seven samples were taken before examinations and 7 after examinations. Two samples that were taken after examinations were found to be positive for COVID-19, 1 from the slitlamp breath shield and 1 from the phoropter. Conclusions and Relevance: This study showed the presence of COVID-19 viral material in a circle 1 m in diameter around where the patients sat. However, real-time polymerase chain reaction could only detect viral material, not the infectivity of these virus samples.","output":"Detection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Viral Material on Environmental Surfaces of an Ophthalmology Examination Room"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urinary tract infection remains the most common infection widespread worldwide in both community and hospital settings. Rapidly increasing antibiotic resistance of uropathogens is resulting in limited treatment options. Thus, understanding the current uropathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities is essential for effective urinary tract infection treatment. The purpose of this study was to isolate, characterize, and determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacterial pathogens associated with urinary tract infection at Pawe General Hospital in Northwest Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from January to April, 2020, at Pawe General Hospital. Midstream urine specimens were collected from 141 individuals with suspected urinary tract infection for bacteriological identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Among the 141 study participants, twenty-nine (20.6%) showed significant bacteriuria. Escherichia coli (42.6%) had the highest proportion of isolated uropathogen followed by Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. each (10.7%); Proteus spp. (9.3%); coagulase negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter spp. each (6.7%); Citrobacter spp. (4%); and Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus spp. each (1.3%). Outpatient isolates showed a resistance of 64% and 78.6% to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and tetracycline, respectively. Inpatients showed 63.9% and 87.2% of resistance to cephalexin and tetracycline. It was also observed that all the isolates have a multiple antimicrobial resistance index greater than 0.20 except Citrobacter spp. (0.142) in inpatients. Even though in this locality, most isolates were sensitive to ceftriaxone, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and norfloxacin, they are considered appropriate antimicrobials for empirical treatment of urinary tract bacterial infections.

METHODS The authors searched 5 databases (from the beginning coverage date to May 27, 2017) using keywords related to IPE and social media. Teams of 2 authors independently reviewed the search results to identify peer-reviewed, English language papers reporting on IPE activities using social media. They assessed the study quality of identified papers using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. RESULTS A total of 8 studies met the review's inclusion criteria. Of these 8 papers, 3 had single-group, posttest-only study design; 4 had single-group, pre- and posttest design; and 1 had nonrandomized 3-group design.

The results of both studies suggest that women in Spain have a 'more responsible' attitude toward the COVID-19 than men. Young adults (18-25 years) scored lower on compliance with safety measures and perceived need to stay home than older adults. In Study 1, level of compliance, knowing someone at risk, and knowing someone infected predicted 31.2% of the variance in the perceived need to stay home. In Study 2, personal concern, level of compliance, keeping distance from others, and perceived social alarm predicted 28.5% of the variance in perceived need to stay home. Regardless of age and/or gender, Spanish people's personal concern about COVID-19 was less than their perceived social alarm about it.

To address the research gap, this study examined whether two types of rumination and perceived social support predict psychological distress during the pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited from communities of the greater Daegu area (n=316) where the first massive outbreak in South Korea occurred and most residents underwent substantial disruption of daily life. They completed self-report questionnaires that included measures of psychological distress, event-related rumination, and social support. RESULTS: The hierarchical regression analysis showed that maladaptive intrusive rumination and perceived social support predicted increases and decreases in psychological distress, respectively, even when subjective severity of COVID-19-related experiences was controlled. Putatively adaptive type of rumination (i.e., deliberate rumination) was not a significant predictor concurrently. CONCLUSION: This is among the early endeavors to comprehensively understand risk and protective factors associated with an effective coping strategy against the COVID-19 crisis. Our results indicate that intrusive rumination aggravates but social support mitigates psychological distress during the pandemic, indicating that we can better adapt by differently attending to recent experiences and maintaining perceived social support.","output":"The Role of Event-Related Rumination and Perceived Social Support on Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from Greater Daegu Region in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Baricitinib is an oral synthetic Janus Kinase inhibitor that inhibits JAK1 and JAK2, and the new kid on the block in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To date, there are no studies comparing the clinical benefit of baricitinib in RA between different ethnicities. Ethnicity plays a role in the effectiveness of therapeutic agents. Given the large multi-ethnic population of Leicestershire in the United Kingdom and the range of new therapeutics in RA, we reviewed our cohort of patients with RA to see whether there is any difference in baricitinib Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) response between the Asian and White cohorts. Methods This was a retrospective study. The patients included were those under the care of rheumatology at University Hospitals of Leicester (UHL) with a diagnosis of RA and either receiving baricitinib or had received it in the past. Data was collected using the UHL information technology systems, clinic letters and pharmacy records. In addition to ethnicity, we reviewed patient age, gender, concurrent disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) used, previous biologics used, baseline and post-treatment DAS28, dropout from therapy, baseline biochemical assays (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF) status) and radiographic findings. An independent t-test was used to compare continuous data, and Pearsons chi-squared test was used to compare categorical data. Results A total of 120 patients were included in the analysis, and data were analysed with Portable Format for Analytics (PFA). There was no statistically significant difference in the mean DAS28 at baseline (Asian: 5.17 versus White: 4.65; p-value = 0.107) and post-treatment (Asian: 2.8 versus White: 3.3; p-value = 0.404). Comparing both ethnicities, there was no statistically significant difference in previous biologics used, anti-CCP and RF titres, and radiographic findings of erosions. Conclusion This is the first study of its kind, and it found no significant difference in baricitinib response between the Asian and White cohorts. Our study had certain limitations, and future studies will be needed to evaluate this subject further.

In addition, this evidence is aligned with published ACE2 entry-receptor (single cell) expression data across the human body to construct a viral distribution and ACE2 receptor body map. We highlight the broad organotropism of SARS-CoV-2, as many studies identified viral components (RNA, proteins) in multiple organs, including the pharynx, trachea, lungs, blood, heart, vessels, intestines, brain, male genitals and kidneys. This also implicates the presence of viral components in various body fluids such as mucus, saliva, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, semen and breast milk. The main SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, ACE2, is expressed at different levels in multiple tissues throughout the human body, but its expression levels do not always correspond with SARS-CoV-2 detection, indicating that there is a complex interplay between virus and host.

Analyses revealed that most academics were satisfied with the support they received from the university and colleagues, and they had adequate equipment and space at home to work. However, half incurred additional financial costs to maintain access to technology and many felt an altered relationship with the university. There were discrepancies in digital abilities and confidence according to employment status, age, faculty, and social identity as an academic. Teaching workload did not increase across the board, rather seniority predicted increases. Levels of wellbeing were low but were not significantly predicted by workload increase or abilities and confidence in working digitally as might have been expected.

Theoretically, it is believed that patients with malignancies having a significant chance of succumbing to COVID-19 due to the immunosuppression from the disease and myelosuppression from the cancer therapy compared to their counterparts without malignancies. However, there is scant evidence to support this claim. Here we analyze the outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19. Methods This is a retrospective review of all patients with hematologic malignancies with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to any one of the Beaumont hospitals in Michigan between March 1st,2020 and July 1st ,2020. Data regarding the demographics, cancer diagnosis and management, covid-19 management and outcomes were abstracted. Results A total of 32 patients with hematologic malignancies were identified. Of these 32 patients, five patients also had solid malignancies. Median age was 70.5 years (22-91 years) with patients being predominantly female 18 (56 %) and Caucasians 16 (50%). Median BMI was 26.5 kg/m2 (15-79 kg/m2). The most prevalent hematologic malignancies were Chronic/Small Lymphocytic lymphoma 7(25%) and Multiple Myeloma 6(19%). The median length of stay in the hospital was 9 days (2-61days). Twelve patients were on active therapy prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Therapies administered include radiation, surgery, anti-CD30 antibody drug conjugate, immunomodulatory agents, proteasome inhibitors, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, steroids and chemotherapy. These agents were held at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19 Twenty two patients (69%) patients received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin which were standard of care at that time. A total of 31 (97%) patients were on anticoagulation of which 14 (45%) were on therapeutic doses while 17 (55%) were on prophylactic dose. Four (13%) of the patients were admitted in the ICU. A total of 6 deaths were reported and the median age was 83 years (66-91 years). Four deaths were attributed to COVID-19. Two non-COVID-19 deaths were as a result of aspiration pneumonia and hospital acquired pneumonia. Only one patient with COVID-19 received treatment for malignancy (surgical cytoreduction) but succumbed to COVID-19 four days later. All patients who died received a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Conclusion Our study, though limited by sample size, shows that about a third of patients received treatment for their hematologic malignancies around the time of COVID-19 diagnosis and only one death was reported.

Thus, therapeutic options are urgently needed, and will be discussed in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Iron-containing enzymes are required for viruses most likely including coronaviruses (CoVs) to complete their replication process. Moreover, poor prognosis occurred in the conditions of iron overload for patients upon infections of viruses. Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators. For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed. SUMMARY: For even though we know little about iron regulation in COVID-19 patients thus far, it could be deduced from other viral infections that iron chelation might be an alternative beneficial adjuvant in treating COVID-19.","output":"Depriving Iron Supply to the Virus Represents a Promising Adjuvant Therapeutic Against Viral Survival"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging epidemics and local infection clusters are initially prone to stochastic effects that can substantially impact the early epidemic trajectory.

Here, we review existing mathematical results on the size of the epidemic over time, and derive new results to elucidate the early dynamics of an infection cluster started by a single infected individual. We show that the initial growth of epidemics that eventually take off is accelerated by stochasticity. As an application, we compute the distribution of the first detection time of an infected individual in an infection cluster depending on testing effort, and estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern Alpha detected in September 2020 first appeared in the UK early August 2020. We also compute a minimal testing frequency to detect clusters before they exceed a given threshold size.

The timing of oxygen therapy was considered to have a great influence on the symptomatic relief of hypoxemia and seeking medical intervention, especially in situations with insufficient medical resources, but the evidence on the timing of oxygen therapy is limited. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medical charts review was carried out to collect the data of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed in Tongji hospital, Wuhan from 30(th) December 2019 to 8(th) March 2020. In this study, the appropriate timing of oxygen therapy and risk factors associated with severe and fatal illness were identified and the effectiveness of antivirus on disease progression was assessed. Among 1362 patients, the prevalence of hypoxia symptoms was significantly higher in those patients with severe and fatal illness than in those with less severe disease. The onset of hypoxia symptoms was most common in the second to third week after symptom onset, and patients with critical and fatal illness experienced these symptoms earlier than those with mild and severe illness. In multivariable analyses, the risk of death increased significantly when oxygen therapy was started more than 2 days after hypoxia symptoms onset among critical patients (OR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.20 to 3.10). Compared to the critically ill patients without IFN-a, the patients who were treated with IFN-a had a lower mortality (OR, 0.60; 95%CI, 0.39 to 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of oxygen therapy was associated with lower mortality among critical patients. This study highlighted the importance of early oxygen therapy after the onset of hypoxia symptoms.

Most participants were female (68%), and White (45%) or African-American (43%). One in four (27%) completed less than high school education, and 41% reported annual pre-tax household income of less than $10,000. Housing quality problems were common.

Lack of heat and air conditioning were correlated, as were water leaks and mold. Using logistic regression analyses controlling for participant demographic characteristics, we found that reporting more housing quality problems was associated with greater odds of worse mental and physical health outcomes.

In Sainte-Anne Hospital (GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neuroscience, Paris, France) we have observed a lower incidence of symptomatic forms of COVID-19 among patients than among our clinical staff. This observation led us to hypothesize that psychotropic drugs could have a prophylactic action against SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients from the symptomatic and virulent forms of this infection, since several of these psychotropic drugs have documented antiviral properties. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a phenothiazine derivative, is also known for its antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recentin vitro studies have reported that CPZ exhibits anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV-1 activity. METHODS: In this context, the ReCoVery study aims to repurpose CPZ, a molecule with an excellent tolerance profile and a very high biodistribution in the saliva, lungs and brain. We hypothesize that CPZ could reduce the unfavorable course of COVID-19 infection among patients requiring respiratory support without the need for ICU care, and that it could also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we plan a pilot, multicenter, randomized, single blind, controlled, phase III therapeutic trial (standard treatment vs. CPZ+standard treatment). CONCLUSION: This repurposing of CPZ for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity could offer an alternative, rapid strategy to alleviate infection severity. This repurposing strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, and could save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easily managed side effects.","output":"Repurposing chlorpromazine to treat COVID-19: The reCoVery study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading coronavirus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, which is characterized by severe respiratory infection. Many factors have been identified as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, with much early attention being paid to body mass index (BMI), which is a well-known cardiometabolic risk factor. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to examine the impact of additional baseline cardiometabolic risk factors including high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes on the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in UK Biobank (UKB) study participants. METHODS: We examined the effect of BMI, lipid profiles, diabetes and alcohol intake on the odds of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 among 9,005 UKB participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16 through July 14, 2020. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and ancestry. RESULTS: Higher BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 odds (p < 0.05) while HDL-C and ApoA-I were associated with decreased odds (p < 0.001). Though the effect of BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were eliminated when HDL-C was controlled, the effect of HDL-C remained significant when BMI was controlled for. LDL-C, ApoB and triglyceride levels were not found to be significantly associated with increased odds. CONCLUSION: Elevated HDL-C and ApoA-I levels were associated with reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, while higher BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased odds. The effects of BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c levels were no longer significant after controlling for HDL-C, suggesting that these effects may be mediated in part through regulation of HDL-C levels. In summary, our study suggests that baseline HDL-C level may be useful for stratifying SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and corroborates the emerging picture that HDL-C may confer protection against sepsis in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular.","output":"Baseline cardiometabolic profiles and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Complications increase the costs of care of surgical patients. We studied the Premier database to determine the incidence and direct medical costs related to pulmonary complications and compared it to cardiac complications in the same cohort. METHODS We identified 45,969 discharges in patients undergoing major bowel procedures. Postoperative pulmonary and cardiac complications were identified through the use of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes and through the use of daily resource use data. Pulmonary complications included pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, pleural effusion, pulmonary failure, and mechanical ventilation more than 48 h after surgery. Cardiac complications included ventricular fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, cardiopulmonary arrest, transient ischemia, premature ventricular contraction, and acute congestive heart failure. RESULTS Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) or postoperative cardiac complications (PCC) were present in 22% of cases; PPC alone was most common (19.0%), followed by PPC and PCC (1.8%) and PCC alone (1.2%). The incremental cost of PPC is large ($25,498). In comparison, PCC alone only added $7,307 to the total cost. CONCLUSIONS The current study demonstrates that postoperative pulmonary complications represent a significant source of morbidity and incremental cost after major small intestinal and colon surgery and have greater incidence and costs than cardiac complications alone. Therefore, strategies to reduce the incidence of these complications should be targeted as means of improving health and bending the cost curve in health care.","output":"Incidence, outcome, and attributable resource use associated with pulmonary and cardiac complications after major small and large bowel procedures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paediatric otolaryngology practice involves examining and operating in anatomical locations with high levels of aerosol generation and transmission of COVID-19 to treating clinicians, especially from the asymptomatic patient populations including children.

Moreover, the reviewed evidence suggests distinctive interactive effects of minority-specific stressors with pandemic-specific challenges (e.g., being forced to stay close to rejecting others during lockdown periods). A significant share of the included literature was US-based, while research from other countries remained scarce. The specific mechanisms still deserve to be better understood to protect SGM in future crises, especially during pandemics.","output":"Sexual and Gender Minorities Facing the Coronavirus Pandemic: A Systematic Review of the Distinctive Psychosocial and Health-related Impact."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluate the implications of relaxing the Supplementary Leverage Ratio during the COVID-19 market disruption for bank balance sheet composition and credit provision. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to causally identify the effect of the SLR regulation change on bank level outcomes. We find that the relaxation may have eased Treasury market liquidity by allowing banks to hold modestly greater inventories of Treasuries, and further allowed for a significant expansion of traditional bank credit. Our findings suggest that this risk-invariant leverage ratio was binding for banks during COVID-19, weakly affected bank liquidity provision in Treasury markets, and strongly affected banks' portfolio composition across asset classes, amounting to a shift of banks' loan supply schedules. Thus, we highlight that countercyclical relaxation of uniform leverage constraints can increase bank credit provision during economic downturns. Given the binding nature of the SLR, the relaxation of this constraint may be more effective than other countercyclical measures in allowing banks to extend credit.","output":"The Value of Countercyclical Capital Requirements: Evidence from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutrophil counts (innate immunity) and lymphocyte counts (adaptive immunity) are common markers of inflammation in the context of acute stroke, and Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is likely to be expected to predict the post-stroke outcome.

In establishing infection these icosahedral viruses undergo endosomal membrane fusion catalysed by envelope glycoprotein rearrangement of the putative receptor-binding domain III (DIII) and exposure of the hydrophobic fusion loop(2,3,4). Humoral immunity has an essential protective function early in the course of West Nile virus infection(5,6). Here, we investigate the mechanism of neutralization by the E16 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds DIII. Structurally, the E16 antibody Fab fragment engages 16 residues positioned on four loops of DIII, a consensus neutralizing epitope sequence conserved in West Nile virus and distinct in other flaviviruses. The E16 epitope protrudes from the surface of mature virions in three distinct environments(7), and docking studies predict Fab binding will leave five-fold clustered epitopes exposed. We also show that E16 inhibits infection primarily at a step after viral attachment, potentially by blocking envelope glycoprotein conformational changes. Collectively, our results suggest that a vaccine strategy targeting the dominant DIII epitope may elicit safe and effective immune responses against flaviviral diseases.

METHODS: We used a microsimulation to estimate the 10-year impact of COVID-19 disruptions in healthcare delivery on HCV outcomes including identified infections, linkage to care, treatment initiation and completion, cirrhosis, and liver-related death. We modeled hypothetical scenarios consisting of an 18-month pandemic-related disruption in HCV care starting in March 2020 followed by varying returns to pre-pandemic rates of screening, linkage, and treatment through March 2030 and compared them to a counterfactual scenario in which there was no COVID-19 pandemic or disruptions in care. We also performed alternate scenario analyses in which the pandemic disruption lasted for 12- and 24-months. RESULTS: Compared to the no pandemic scenario, in the scenario in which there is no return to pre-pandemic levels of HCV care delivery, we estimate 1,060 fewer identified cases, 21 additional cases of cirrhosis, and 16 additional liver-related deaths per 100,000 people. Only 3% of identified cases initiate treatment and <1% achieve sustained virologic response (SVR). Compared to no pandemic, the best-case scenario in which an 18-month care disruption is followed by a return to pre-pandemic levels, we estimated a smaller proportion of infections identified and achieving SVR.

Using a phantom model, we aimed to delineate an imaging technique to better visualize the aluminum shaft of the nasopharyngeal swab on radiographs to help in identification. A technique using lower tube voltage (kVp) with tight collimation centered at the nasal bones area produced the best visualization of the aluminum shaft of the swab. Recognition that aluminum foreign bodies may be difficult to visualize radiographically and optimization of radiograph acquisition technique may help guide clinical management in unusual cases.

When the donning process has moisture introduced, however, complications can arise, which consumes vital time. Most commonly, gloves undergo a chlorination treatment to reduce glove tack, allowing easier donning. To assess the effects of different chlorination strengths and glove thicknesses on donning, acrylonitrile butadiene gloves were manufactured at two different thicknesses (0.05 and 0.10 mm) with 4 different chlorination treatments: 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm. Six participants were used to assess the time taken to don each of the glove sets with dry and wet hands (16 tests in total). Overall, the thicker gloves took longer to don, due to differences in the material stiffness hindering the donning process. The quickest performance from the chlorinated gloves was noted in the 1000 and 2000 ppm concentrations. Wet conditions also showed significant increases in the donning time.Practitioners Summary: The study was conducted based on the gaps identified in previous literature reviews which revealed the requirement for a greater understanding of glove donning process. It was found a stronger chlorination was detrimental when the hands were wet, but better when dry. Thicker gloves were also found to be detrimental.

However, the development of AI also raises two sets of problems when considering climate change: the possible exacerbation of social and ethical challenges already associated with AI, and the contribution to climate change of the greenhouse gases emitted by training data and computation-intensive AI systems.

METHODS: Collected data included symptoms, nutritional status, self-evaluation of food intake, Performance Status (PS) Scale, Asthenia Scale, self-evaluation of strength (SES) for arms and legs at discharge and at D30. An SES <7 was used to determine subjective functional loss. A composite criteria for severe disability was elaborated combining malnutrition, subjective functional loss and PS >2. Patients were classified into three groups according to change in nutritional status between discharge and D30 (persistent malnutrition, correction of malnutrition and the absence of malnutrition). RESULTS: Of 549 consecutive patients hospitalised for COVID-19 between 1 March and 29 April 2020, 130 died including 17 after discharge (23.7%). At D30, 312 patients were at home, 288 (92.3%) of whom were interviewed. Of the latter, 33.3% were malnourished at discharge and still malnourished at D30, while 23.2% were malnourished at discharge but no longer malnourished at D30. The highest predictive factors of persistent malnutrition were intensive care unit (ICU) stay (OR=3.42, 95% CI: 2.04 to 5.75), subjective functional loss at discharge (OR=3.26, 95% CI: 1.75 to 6.08) and male sex (OR=2.39, 95% CI: 1.44 to 3.97). Subjective functional loss at discharge (76.8%) was the main predictive factor of subjective functional loss at D30 (26.3%) (OR=32.6, 95% CI: 4.36 to 244.0).

In the past couple of months, we have witnessed mayhem in an unprecedented scale: social, economic, food security, education, business, travel, and freedom of movements are all casualties of this pandemic. Our experience about this virus and its epidemiology is limited, and mostly the treatment for symptomatic patients is supportive. However, it has been observed that COVID-19 not only attacks the respiratory system; rather it may involve other systems also from the beginning of infection or subsequent to respiratory infection. In this article, we attempt to describe the systemic involvement of COVID-19 based on the currently available experiences. This description is up to date as of now, but as more experiences are pouring from different corners of the world, almost every day, newer knowledge and information will crop up by the time this article is published.

AIM: The goal of this perspective is to highlight the existing and future role of wearable and RPM optical technologies in an increasingly at-home healthcare and research environment. APPROACH: First, the specific changes occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare delivery, regulations, and technological innovations related to RPM technologies are reviewed. Then, a review of the current state and potential future impact of optical physiological monitoring in portable and wearable formats is outlined. RESULTS: New efforts from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies are advancing and encouraging at-home, portable, and wearable physiological monitors as a growing part of healthcare delivery. It is hoped that these shifts will assist with disease diagnosis, treatment, management, recovery, and rehabilitation with minimal in-person contact. Some of these trends are likely to persist for years to come. Optical technologies already account for a large portion of RPM platforms, with a good potential for future growth. CONCLUSIONS: The biomedical optics community has a potentially large role to play in developing, testing, and commercializing new wearable and RPM technologies to meet the changing healthcare and research landscape in the COVID-19 era and beyond.","output":"Perspective on the increasing role of optical wearables and remote patient monitoring in the COVID-19 era and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A person's appearance, identity, and other nonverbal cues can substantially influence how one is perceived by a negotiation counterpart, potentially impacting the outcome of the negotiation.

One of the comorbidities associated with severe outcome and mortality of COVID-19 is dyslipidemia. Statin is one of the drugs which is most commonly used for the treatment of dyslipidemic patients. This study aims to analyze the association between statin use and in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We systematically searched the Google Scholar database using specific keywords related to our aims until August 1st, 2020. All articles published on COVID-19 and statin were retrieved. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies with a total of 3449 patients were included in our analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that statin use did not improve severity outcome [OR 1.64 (95% CI 0.51-5.23), p = 0.41, I2 = 93%, random-effect modelling] nor mortality rate from COVID-19 infection [OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.50-1.21), p = 0.26, I2 = 0%, fixed-effect modelling]. CONCLUSION: Statin use did not improve in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 infections.

J. Haematol. 2017; 176:498) reported that CD56 positive is associated with poor prognosis of patients with intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (IR-AML). However, our data were inconsistent with the finding. Thus, in this study, we provided the different results to discuss. METHODS A total of 262 bone marrow transcriptomic data of IR-AML in the GSE12417-GPL96 and GSE71014-GPL-10558 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) database, and 92 IR-AML patients from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database were obtained for prognostic analysis and validation. RESULTS Compared with low CD56 expression, IR-AML patients with high CD56 expression had a longer overall survival (OS) time and restricted mean survival time (RMST) and favorable OS rate in the GSE12417-GPL96 dataset. These results were confirmed in both GSE71014-GPL-10558 and TCGA datasets. Importantly, the inconsistency between our findings and the previous finding may be due to the following reasons: different detection methods, age stratification, countries, treatment options etc. CONCLUSIONS The prognostic value of CD56 expression in IR-AML may need to be comprehensively evaluated based on different detection methods, age stratification, countries, treatment options, and other factors. If confirmed, CD56 may be a biomarker for further risk stratification for IR-AML patients.","output":"High expression of CD56 may be associated with favorable overall survival in intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To understand the potential role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), highlighting evolving practices and outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: The role for ECMO in COVID-19-related ARDS has evolved throughout the pandemic. Early reports of high mortality led to some to advocate for withholding ECMO in this setting. Subsequent data suggested mortality rates were on par with those from studies conducted prior to the pandemic. However, outcomes are evolving and mortality in these patients may be worsening with time. SUMMARY: ECMO has an established role in the treatment of severe forms of ARDS. Current data suggest adherence to the currently accepted algorithm for management of ARDS, including the use of ECMO. However, planning related to resource utilization and strain on healthcare systems are necessary to determine the feasibility of ECMO in specific regions at any given time. Utilization of national and local networks, pooling of resources and ECMO mobilization units are important to optimize access to ECMO as appropriate. Reported complications of ECMO in the setting of COVID-19-related ARDS have been predominantly similar to those reported in studies of non-COVID-19-related ARDS. Further high-quality research is needed.","output":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019-related acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and its neurological manifestations have now been confirmed. We aimed at describing delirium and neurological symptoms of COVID-19 in ICU patients. METHODS: We conducted a bicentric cohort study in two French ICUs of Strasbourg University Hospital. All the 150 patients referred for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 between March 3 and May 5, 2020, were included at their admission. Ten patients (6.7%) were excluded because they remained under neuromuscular blockers during their entire ICU stay. Neurological examination, including CAM-ICU, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in some of the patients with delirium and/or abnormal neurological examination. The primary endpoint was to describe the incidence of delirium and/or abnormal neurological examination. The secondary endpoints were to describe the characteristics of delirium, to compare the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay in patients with and without delirium and/or abnormal neurological symptoms. RESULTS: The 140 patients were aged in median of 62 [IQR 52; 70] years old, with a median SAPSII of 49 [IQR 37; 64] points. Neurological examination was normal in 22 patients (15.7%). One hundred eighteen patients (84.3%) developed a delirium with a combination of acute attention, awareness, and cognition disturbances. Eighty-eight patients (69.3%) presented an unexpected state of agitation despite high infusion rates of sedative treatments and neuroleptics, and 89 (63.6%) patients had corticospinal tract signs. Brain MRI performed in 28 patients demonstrated enhancement of subarachnoid spaces in 17/28 patients (60.7%), intraparenchymal, predominantly white matter abnormalities in 8 patients, and perfusion abnormalities in 17/26 patients (65.4%). The 42 electroencephalograms mostly revealed unspecific abnormalities or diffuse, especially bifrontal, slow activity. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed inflammatory disturbances in 18/28 patients, including oligoclonal bands with mirror pattern and elevated IL-6. The CSF RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 was positive in one patient. The delirium/neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients were responsible for longer mechanical ventilation compared to the patients without delirium/neurological symptoms. Delirium/neurological symptoms could be secondary to systemic inflammatory reaction to SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Delirium/neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients are a major issue in ICUs, especially in the context of insufficient human and material resources.

Despite these advantages, misinformation on vaccine safety and efficacy can lead to increased hesitation towards vaccination. This study reports the incidence of adverse events following Covishield vaccination, their associated factors, medication used for their management, and attitudes about vaccine safety. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from the sample of Covishield-vaccinated individuals from a secondary hospital, two primary health centres, and 36 health posts in eastern Nepal. Individuals (n = 602) were randomly sampled from a population (n = 1013) who had received the first dose of Covishield, namely frontline workers and other high-risk populations. The second-round follow-up had 516 participants. Association of incidence and severity of post-vaccination events with socio-demographic variables, comorbidity status, and medication use were estimated. RESULTS: Among the 79.9% of participants who reported adverse events after receiving the first dose, two-thirds of complaints were mild (67.4%, 95% CI 63.2C71.6) with the most common complaint being pain at the injection site (86.5%). Paracetamol or its combination with NSAIDs were used in the majority of cases (95.2%). After the second dose, only 31.2% (95% CI 27.2C35.2) reported adverse events, the overwhelming majority of which were mild (95.7%) and required a lower frequency of medication (7.5% vs. 26.0%). Adverse event following immunization were significantly associated with being 18C30 years old ((2) = 16.9, df = 3, p < 0.001) and female gender ((2) = 5.2, df = 1, p < 0.05). Prior to the first dose, 86.0% of participants (95% CI 83.3C88.8%) perceived the vaccine to be safe, and 96.0% recommended the vaccine post-vaccination, while 96.8% were interested in receiving the second dose. AEFI severity was negatively associated with vaccine recommendation to the peers (odds-ratio 0.062, p < 0.05) following the first dose, whereas, the optimistic pre-vaccination perception was associated with positive vaccine recommendation post-vaccination (odds-ratio 28.658, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, vaccination-associated events were mild and majority were managed with paracetamol or its combination. Effective counselling about adverse events before vaccination should be prioritized to reduce hesitation and fear.

Cooperation with the institution was done to administer the survey questionnaires. Binary logistic regression analysis and descriptive methods were used.Findings reveal that majority of the students used Facebook to communicate with their friends and relatives followed by Instagram. The students were using social media daily for 1-5 hours. The only variable that affected the extent of utilization of social media was the respondents gender. With 0.87, females were two times more exposed to social media rather than males. The study concludes that females are more exposed to social media rather than males. The use of social media by females has to do with their desire to communicate or share more personal information, revealing more about their personal lives. They use social networking sites to make connections and stay in touch with family or friends. Men, by contrast, use social media to gather the information they need to build influence. Facebook is the most preferred social networking site for students to connect with family and friends. They are entertained by Facebook. They use a long time chatting with friends rather than doing school works. Facebook becomes their daily routine. The study recommends for other researchers who wish to do a similar study, employ other variables which are not tested in the study to find other factors that affect the extent of social media usage of the students.","output":"Effects of Social Media on Academic Performance of High School Students under Pandemic (COVID-19) Situations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ImportanceMulti-organ impairment associated with Long COVID is a significant burden to individuals, populations and health systems, presenting challenges for diagnosis and care provision.

DesignThis was a prospective, longitudinal study in individuals following recovery from acute COVID-19. We assessed symptoms, health status, and multi-organ tissue characterisation and function, using consensus definitions for single and multi-organ impairment. Physiological and biochemical investigations were performed at baseline on all individuals and those with organ impairment were reassessed, including multi-organ MRI, 6 months later. SettingTwo non-acute settings (Oxford and London). Participants536 individuals (mean 45 years, 73% female, 89% white, 32% healthcare workers, 13% acute COVID-19 hospitalisation) completed baseline assessment (median: 6 months post-COVID-19). 331 (62%) with organ impairment or incidental findings had follow up, with reduced symptom burden from baseline (median number of symptoms: 10 and 3, at 6 and 12 months).

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey administered via Qualtrics among 18-75-year-old participants in the UK. The sample was stratified by age and gender with quotas defined according to the 2011 UK census distribution. SETTING: Qualtrics' Online panel of respondents in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 676 participants comprising nearly an equal number of females (n 341) and males (n 335) and a majority (586 %) from households whose income was <30 000. RESULTS: Our findings showed that nearly 40 % of respondents were exposed to some or a lot of CNI. We found that while exposure to CNI from TV and online news increased nutrition confusion, CNI from health professionals increased backlash. Exposure to CNI from social media and health websites was associated with reduced backlash. We also found that nutrition confusion and backlash were negatively associated with exercise behaviour and fruit and vegetable consumption, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the theoretical pathways that explain the influence of CNI exposure on nutrition-related cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Additionally, different types of online information sources are associated with these outcomes to varying degrees. In the context of obesity and diabetes rates in the UK, our findings call for (a) further experimental research into the effects of CNI on consumers' diet-related cognitions and behaviours and (b) multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary approaches to address this problem.","output":"Associations between conflicting nutrition information, nutrition confusion and backlash among consumers in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: 'Repurposing' existing drugs to treat COVID-19 is vital to reducing mortality and controlling the pandemic. Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies. METHODS: Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available. RESULTS: Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days). Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US. CONCLUSIONS: Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices. Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.","output":"Minimum costs to manufacture new treatments for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Telehealth may remain an integral part of cancer survivorship care after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While telehealth may reduce travel/waiting times and costs for many patients, it may also create new barriers that could exacerbate care disparities in historically underserved populations, manifesting as differences in overall care participation, and in differential video versus phone use for telehealth. METHODS: We reviewed visits by cancer survivors between January and December 2020 at a designated cancer center in Minnesota. We used descriptive statistics, data visualization, and generalized estimating equation logistic regression models to compare visit modalities and trends over time by age, urban/rural status, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Among 159,301 visits, including 33,242 telehealth visits, older and rural-dwelling individuals were underrepresented in telehealth compared with in-person care. Non-Hispanic White individuals, those aged 18C69 years, and urban residents used video for > 50% of their telehealth visits. In contrast, those aged  70 years, rural residents, and most patient groups of color used video for only 33C43% of their telehealth visits. Video use increased with time for everyone, but relative differences in telehealth modalities persisted. Visits of Black/African American patients temporarily fell in spring/summer 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore reduced uptake of telehealth, especially video, among potentially vulnerable patient populations. Future research should evaluate reasons for differential telehealth utilization and whether visit modality (in-person versus video versus phone) affects cancer outcomes.

Current liver models often rely on cancer cell lines or primary cells, which both have major limitations. However, the development of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has created a new opportunity for liver disease modeling, drug discovery and liver toxicity research. hiPSCs can be differentiated to any cell of interest, which makes them good candidates for disease modeling and drug discovery. Moreover, hiPSCs, unlike primary cells, can be easily genome-edited, allowing the creation of reporter lines or isogenic controls for patient-derived hiPSCs. Unfortunately, even though liver progeny from hiPSCs has characteristics similar to their in vivo counterparts, the differentiation of iPSCs to fully mature progeny remains highly challenging and is a major obstacle for the full exploitation of these models by pharmaceutical industries.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A structured questionnaire consisting of 15 multiple-choice questions and demographic information about the knowledge and attitudes of parents regarding dental treatment during the COVID-19 outbreak was used for the study. The participants were parents of pediatric patients (aged 8-14 years) who visited for a routine orthodontic examination at the department of orthodontics. RESULTS: A total of 250 participants responded to the questionnaire. The findings indicate that more than 95% of parents had information about the transmission paths of the virus, took COVID-19 seriously, and told their children about this disease. 34% of the parents thought that dental clinics were more dangerous than other social areas, and 39.2% thought their children could be infected by medical instruments during dental treatment. A statistically significant difference was observed between educational levels in the answers given about the transmission paths of the virus, the danger of dental clinics in terms of the virus, the permitted dental treatment procedures, and the personal protective equipment of the dentist (p < 0.05).

Finally, to guarantee that the measures taken are relevant and acceptable to the population, a multidisciplinary approach must be systematically relied upon and re-evaluated on a prospective basis.","output":"Quels lments prsident  lmergence dune pidmie virale ?

Previous work shows that people who trust in science are more likely to comply with official guidelines, which suggests that higher levels of compliance could be achieved by improving trust in science. However, analysis of a global dataset (n=4341) suggests otherwise. Trust in science had a small, indirect effect on adherence to the rules. It affected adherence only insofar as it predicted people's approval of prevention measures such as social distancing. Trust in science also mediated the relationship between political ideology and approval of the measures (more conservative people trusted science less and in turn approved of the measures less). These effects varied across countries, and were especially different in the USA. Overall, these results mean that any increase in trust in science is unlikely to yield strong immediate improvements in following COVID-19 rules. Nonetheless, given its relationships with both ideology and individuals' attitudes to the measures, trust in science may be leveraged to yield longer-term and more sustained social benefits.","output":"Facing the pandemic with trust in science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was conducted to verify the perceived restorativeness of citizens visiting forests on social-psychological stress and psychological resilience according to forest space type. The study involved a questionnaire survey conducted on citizens who visited forests between 1 May and 15 July 2020, when social distancing in daily life was being implemented. Three types of forest spaces (urban forest, national park, and natural recreation forest) were selected for the survey. They used the survey results of 1196 people as analysis data for this study. In this study, the PRS (Perceived Restorativeness Scale) and the PWI-SF (Psychosocial Well-being Index Short Form) were used to evaluate perceived restorativeness and social-psychological stress of citizens visiting forests. In the study, the average score of visitors' perceived restorativeness was 5.31  0.77. Social-psychological stress was found in the healthy group, potential stress group, and high-risk group. These groups made up 8.0%, 82.5%, and 9.5% of the respondents, respectively.

Here, we introduce its implementation with reflective mirror-based afocal telescopes, optimized for imaging light-induced retinal activity (optoretinography) and weak retinal reflections at the cellular scale. A non-planar optical design was followed based on previous recommendations with key differences specific to a line-scan geometry. The three beam paths fundamental to an OCT system -illumination/sample, detection, and reference- were modeled in Zemax optical design software to yield theoretically diffraction-limited performance over a 2.2 deg. field-of-view and 1.5 D vergence range at the eye's pupil. The performance for imaging retinal structure was exemplified by cellular-scale visualization of retinal ganglion cells, macrophages, foveal cones, and rods in human observers. The performance for functional imaging was exemplified by resolving the light-evoked optical changes in foveal cone photoreceptors where the spatial resolution was sufficient for cone spectral classification at an eccentricity 0.3 deg. from the foveal center. This enabled the first in vivo demonstration of reduced S-cone (short-wavelength cone) density in the human foveola, thus far observed only in ex vivo histological preparations. Together, the feasibility for high resolution imaging of retinal structure and function demonstrated here holds significant potential for basic science and translational applications.","output":"Reflective mirror-based line-scan adaptive optics OCT for imaging retinal structure and function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Soon after the first COVID-19 positive case was detected in Wuhan, China, the virus spread around the globe, and in no time, it was declared as a global pandemic by the WHO. Testing, which is the first step in identifying and diagnosing COVID-19, became the first need of the masses. Therefore, testing kits for COVID-19 were manufactured for efficiently detecting COVID-19. However, due to limited resources in the densely populated countries, testing capacity even after a year is still a limiting factor for COVID-19 diagnosis on a larger scale and contributes to a lag in disease tracking and containment. Due to this reason, we started this study to provide a better cost-effective solution for enhancing the testing capacity so that the maximum number of people could get tested for COVID-19. For this purpose, we utilized the approach of artificial neural networks (ANN) to acquire the relevant data on COVID-19 and its testing. The data were analyzed by using Machine Learning, and probabilistic algorithms were applied to obtain a statistically proven solution for COVID-19 testing. The results obtained through ANN indicated that sample pooling is not only an effective way but also regarded as a Gold standard for testing samples when the prevalence of the disease is low in the population and the chances of getting a positive result are less. We further demonstrated through algorithms that pooling samples from 16 individuals is better than pooling samples of 8 individuals when there is a high likelihood of getting negative test results. These findings provide ground to the fact that if sample pooling will be employed on a larger scale, testing capacity will be considerably increased within limited available resources without compromising the test specificity. It will provide healthcare units and enterprises with solutions through scientifically proven algorithms, thus, saving a considerable amount of time and finances. This will eventually help in containing the spread of the pandemic in densely populated areas including vulnerably confined groups, such as nursing homes, hospitals, cruise ships, and military ships.","output":"Identification of efficient COVID-19 diagnostic test through artificial neural networks approach ? substantiated by modeling and simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study is aimed at investigating the types of cohesive devices and their relationship which are found in an article of Time magazine entitled how COVID-19 will shape the class of 2020 for the rest of their live.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data on 94 consecutive donor-recipient pairs (188 patients) were reviewed. All donor nephrectomies were performed by pure laparoscopy. There were 74 left laparoscopic donor nephrectomies and 20 right laparoscopic donor nephrectomies. Intraoperative parameters and graft outcome were recorded and the data were analyzed to compare right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy versus left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy using a computer software system. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years (mean, 3.4 y). RESULTS There were no significant differences in any intraoperative or postoperative parameters, except in a slightly higher warm ischemia time in right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy versus left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, but this did not translate into an adverse effect on renal recovery. Acute graft rejection was observed in 2 of 74 patients who had a left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (2.7%) and none of the patients who had a right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy.

The modeling results have revealed that the prevalence of DFNB1A in an isolated population can be dramatically increased under frequent assortative marriages in a relatively short time period under the pressure of relaxed selection. However, under current conditions, the proportion of recessive homozygotes quickly reaches a short plateau and then continuously decreases. Moreover, in the long term, the studied effect can be leveled by growing social equality for deaf people, as evidenced by the results of neutral selection modeling. ABSTRACT: An increase in the prevalence of autosomal recessive deafness 1A (DFNB1A) in populations of European descent was shown to be promoted by assortative marriages among deaf people. Assortative marriages became possible with the widespread introduction of sign language, resulting in increased genetic fitness of deaf individuals and, thereby, relaxing selection against deafness. However, the effect of this phenomenon was not previously studied in populations with different genetic structures. We developed an agent-based computer model for the analysis of the spread of DFNB1A. Using this model, we tested the impact of different intensities of selection pressure against deafness in an isolated human population over 400 years. Modeling of the purifying selection pressure on deafness (No deaf mating scenario) resulted in a decrease in the proportion of deaf individuals and the pathogenic allele frequency. Modeling of the relaxed selection (Assortative mating scenario) resulted in an increase in the proportion of deaf individuals in the first four generations, which then quickly plateaued with a subsequent decline and a decrease in the pathogenic allele frequency. The results of neutral selection pressure modeling (Random mating scenario) showed no significant changes in the proportion of deaf individuals or the pathogenic allele frequency after 400 years.","output":"Agent-Based Modeling of Autosomal Recessive Deafness 1A (DFNB1A) Prevalence with Regard to Intensity of Selection Pressure in Isolated Human Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The time at which we write these lines is a dramatic time of war [...].","output":"Bio-Cultural Diversities: Why They Matter Now"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to identify the reasons that led to the judicialization of health care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic; describe the outcomes of lawsuits concerning health care involving the COVID-19; and analyze the cases of health care judicialization intended to ensure the populations right to health.

The dashboard accessed the prescribing workload from our clinical information system and filled prescriptions from robotic prescription dispensing systems. The aggregated data was visualized using modern tools. The dashboard presents performance data in near real time and is updated every 15 minutes. After validation during the early weeks of the COVID-19 crisis, the dashboard provided reliable data and served as a great decision support aid in calculating the backlog of prescribed but unfilled prescriptions. It also aided in adjusting manpower, identifying prescribing and dispensing patterns, identifying trends, and diverting staff resources to appropriate locations. The dashboard has been useful in clearing the backlog in a timely manner, staff planning, and predicting the next coming surge so that we can proactively minimize accumulation of backlogged prescriptions.

Homeostasis of these micronutrients is tightly regulated by multiple compensatory mechanisms that balance their concentrations including transporters, importers, and metallothioneins. An altered intake of only one of these trace elements may cause an imbalance in their levels and result in their competition for absorption. Relatively low levels of zinc and increased levels of copper may result in an increased level of oxidative stress and impair the antioxidant properties of multiple enzymes. Altered levels of trace elements were discovered in various pathologies including immunological, degenerative, and inflammatory diseases. Moreover, due to the role of Zn and Cu in oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, they were found to influence cancerogenesis. We review the roles of zinc and copper and their mechanisms in tumor growth, metastasis potential, microenvironment remodeling, and drug resistance. We highlight their role as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, concentrating on their impact on gynecological malignancies.","output":"The Role of Zinc and Copper in Gynecological Malignancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recombination in the family Coronaviridae has been well documented and is thought to be a contributing factor in the emergence and evolution of different coronaviral genotypes as well as different species of coronavirus. However, there are limited data available on the frequency and extent of recombination in coronaviruses in nature and particularly for the avian gamma-coronaviruses where only recently the emergence of a turkey coronavirus has been attributed solely to recombination. In this study, the full-length genomes of eight avian gamma-coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates were sequenced and along with other full-length IBV genomes available from GenBank were analyzed for recombination. Evidence of recombination was found in every sequence analyzed and was distributed throughout the entire genome. Areas that have the highest occurrence of recombination are located in regions of the genome that code for nonstructural proteins 2, 3 and 16, and the structural spike glycoprotein. The extent of the recombination observed, suggests that this may be one of the principal mechanisms for generating genetic and antigenic diversity within IBV. These data indicate that reticulate evolutionary change due to recombination in IBV, likely plays a major role in the origin and adaptation of the virus leading to new genetic types and strains of the virus.","output":"Recombination in Avian Gamma-Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 pandemic has raised public awareness around disease protection.

Cohort was evaluated with regard to subgroups as influenza and other respiratory viruses (ORV), as well as survivors and nonsurvivors. Result Out of 938 admitted patients, 319 were followed as ARF and only 149 patients had viral respiratory panel results. In 49 patients with ARF, 52 positive viral results were detected and 47 patients with single positive viral isolates of either influenza or ORV were included. Among them, 62% had ORV with quite similar characteristics with influenza group apart from diabetes mellitus which was encountered more in influenza group (p= 0.02). Overall ICU mortality was 32% and there was no difference between the two groups (p= 0.42).

This function is driven by neural interactions in the entorhinal cortical-hippocampal network, especially the neural input from the pyramidal cells in layer III of medial entorhinal cortex (MECIII) to hippocampal CA1 is crucial for TAL. Successful TAL depends on the strength of event stimuli and the duration of the temporal gap between events. Whereas it has been demonstrated that the neural input from pyramidal cells in layer II of MEC, referred to as Island cells, to inhibitory neurons in dorsal hippocampal CA1 controls TAL when the strength of event stimuli is weak, it remains unknown whether Island cells regulate TAL with long trace periods as well. To understand the role of Island cells in regulating the duration of the learnable trace period in TAL, we used Pavlovian trace fear conditioning (TFC) with a 60-sec long trace period (long trace fear conditioning [L-TFC]) coupled with optogenetic and chemogenetic neural activity manipulations as well as cell type-specific neural ablation. We found that ablation of Island cells in MECII partially increases L-TFC performance. Chemogenetic manipulation of Island cells causes differential effectiveness in Island cell activity and leads to a circuit imbalance that disrupts L-TFC. However, optogenetic terminal inhibition of Island cell input to dorsal hippocampal CA1 during the temporal association period allows for long trace intervals to be learned in TFC.

Mean ejaculate characteristics were analyzed in 3 independent groups formed from patients examined at the Laboratory of Genetics of Impaired Reproduction of the Research Center for Medical Genetics in 2021: the comparison group consisted of 759 unvaccinated men;the group of 73 men who were vaccinated with Sputnik V and for whom the time between the full vaccination (2 components of the vaccine) and semen analysis was less than 75 days;and the group of 58 men who underwent vaccination more than 75 days prior to semen analysis. The results of semen analysis of 53 patients before and after full vaccination procedure were compared. In 32 patients, less than 75 days passed since vaccination;in 21 patients, more than 75 days;for 5 patients data prior to 75 days since vaccination and after are available. The study group included patients without history of COVID-19. Standard semen analysis was performed in accordance with the World Health Organization Guidelines. For statistical analysis of the differences between the groups Student's t-test was used with significance level of p <0.05. Results. Comparison of semen analysis of the same patients before and after vaccination procedure showed no statis- tically significant differences. Small decrease in progressive motility was observed (from 19.0  0.4 to 13.8  1.1 %), as well as decline in sperm morphology (from 4.53  0.12 to 3.55  0.31 %) in the group who underwent vaccination less than 75 days prior to the analysis.

There were no statistically significant differences in the ejaculate indices of the same patients before and after vaccination with Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac). In the group of patients examined in a short time after vaccination, there is a decrease in the quality of sperm compared to the comparison group (unvaccinated).

Cub domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1), a cell-surface protein that confers poor prognosis of patients with certain solid tumors, was recently identified as one of the most significantly upregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected children who developed systemic vasculitis, a hallmark of KD. However, a potential role of CDCP1 in KD has not previously been explored. In this study, we found that CDCP1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited attenuated coronary and aortic vasculitis and decreased serum Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS)-specific IgM/IgG2a and IL-6 concentrations compared with wild-type mice in an established model of KD induced by CAWS administration. CDCP1 expression was not detectable in cardiomyocytes, cardio fibroblasts, or coronary endothelium, but constitutive expression of CDCP1 was observed on dendritic cells (DCs) and was upregulated by CAWS stimulation. CAWS-induced IL-6 production was significantly reduced in CDCP1 KO DCs, in association with impaired Syk-MAPK signaling pathway activation.

It is associated with elevations in inflammatory markers including the one produced during fibrinolysis, namely D-Dimer. Reports have shown marked elevations in this protein fragment particularly in severe disease. We report our observations regarding change in D-Dimer and effect on mortality over time. Methods: We analyzed all adults between March and September 2020 who were admitted or managed in the emergency department for COVID19 infection within the University Hospitals Health System in Northeast Ohio. Delta d-dimer was defined as the change in d-dimer (d-dimer) from day of presentation to the maximum value between day 1 to 6 post admissions. Kaplan-Meier and cox regression analyses were performed to explore the association with mortality. Receiver operating characteristics were used to estimate discrimination power for mortality. Results: A total of 442 patients were included. Mean age was 6416 years. A total of 93 patients were managed in the intensive care unit, 324 were managed as inpatient, and 25 patients were managed in the emergency department. The median admission d-dimer was 1169 [645-2208] ng/ml, and d-dimer was 75 [-334 to 717]. At a median follow-up of 108 days, 100 patients died (30-day mortality of 21%). The 30-day mortality was 12.3% for tertile 1, 12.2% for tertile 2, and 39.1% for tertile 3 of d-dimer, (Figure). Compared with tertile 1, patients in tertile 3 of d-dimer had 4-fold higher mortality (age-adjusted HR 3.77 [2.30-6.18], P&lt;0.001). In multivariable analysis, d-dimer but not admission d-dimer (P=0.36) was associated with mortality after adjusting for age (per 1000 ng/mL increase: HR 1.017 [1.008-1.027], P&lt;0.001). d-dimer had a good discriminative power for mortality (AUC=0.70). An increase in d-dimer of 540 ng/ml was determined to be the best threshold for mortality (sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 80%).

However, accurate information on the delivery of global health education (GHE) at a university level is lacking. This study aims to assess current GHE practices in U.K. universities, by identifying the availability of dedicated global health qualifications, as well as the breadth of inclusion of GHE topics across university course content. METHODS: Universities selected were the top 25 recipients of MRC funding in 2015C2016, as well as universities who were included in previous iterations of the Global Health League Table. We used the Consortium of Universities for Global Health GHE Competencies Toolkit to identify the presence of global health content across university global health and other course offerings. Universities were additionally judged on opportunities available in global health and on the presence of sustainable partnerships. RESULTS: Our results showed that 20 universities (74%) offer a post-graduate global health related course, with 9 (33%) offering an undergraduate global health related course. 13 (48%) were identified as centers of global health excellence. Just 12 (44%) universities had registered sustainable partnerships with Tropical Health and Education Trust. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was identified as the top deliverer of GHE, with the Universities of Leicester and the Universities of Exeter joint bottom. We were unable to standardize quality assessments in this iteration of the project, but the release of student feedback to future assessors would help to improve the reliability of this study methodology. Additionally, much of our data was based on information available online, and thus some aspects of degree courses not published publicly may not have been accounted for in our scoring. CONCLUSION: Those institutions wishing to improve their delivery of GHE should consider the establishment of a postgraduate or undergraduate degree course.

The project includes setup optimization, data collection, data analysis, and applications. The final materials chosen were quinine-containing tonic water, 397-402 nm wavelength UV tube lights, an iPhone and tripod, string, and a spray bottle. The experiment took place in a dark closet with a dark background. During data collection, the test subject first wets their mouth with an ingestible fluorescent liquid (tonic water) and speaks, sneezes, or coughs under UV darklight. The fluorescence from the tonic water droplets generated can be visualized, recorded by an iPhone 8+ camera in slo-mo (240 fps), and analyzed. The software VLC is used for frame separation and Fiji/ImageJ is used for image processing and analysis. The dependencies of oral fluid droplet generation and propagation on different phonics, the loudness of speech, and the type of expiratory event were studied in detail and established using the metrology developed. The efficacy of different types of masks was evaluated and correlated with fabric microstructures. All masks blocked droplets to varying extent.

The walls have two types of openings, large ones to allow passage of hands to examine the baby, small ones to enable passage of oxygen tubing when required. A simulation was created to examine the impact of aerosol spray on examining healthcare personnel. RESULTS: The cost of the acrylic box was negligible. It could be assembled locally with available acrylic sheets and craftsmen. It was not difficult to examine the baby inside the box, and the simulation demonstrated that it protected the health personnel from the aerosol contamination.

Reported data suggest that symptoms in pregnant women are similar to those in other populations, and that there is no evidence of vertical transmission from mother to child. In the meantime, considering the good prognosis of most of the infected mothers and infants and absence of serious obstetric complications in pregnant women with COVID-19, it is not recommended to give birth as soon as possible, and it is necessary to extend the gestational period reasonably.","output":"Clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Is central bank independence (CBI) associated with economic policy responses to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID 19 pandemic?

The work also highlights the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the dynamics of the co-infection of both diseases. The model is fitted to real COVID-19 data from Botswana. The impact of COVID-19 variants on HIV prevalence using simulations is also assessed. Simulation for the class of individuals co-infected with HIV and the wild or Delta COVID-19 variant reveals a significant decrease, as vaccination rate is increased. The impact of fractional order on different epidemiological classes is also studied . Drawing the plot of total infected population with the wild and Delta COVID-19 variants, at different vaccination rates, it is concluded that, as vaccination rate is increased, there is a significant reduction in population infected with the wild and delta COVID-19 variants. The plot of class of individuals co-infected with HIV and the wild or Delta COVID-19 variant is more interesting; as vaccination rate is increased, the co-infected populations experience a significant decrease. Thus, stepping up vaccination against the different variants of COVID-19 could reduce co-infection cases largely, among people already infected with HIV.","output":"A fractional order model for Dual Variants of COVID-19 and HIV co-infection via Atangana-Baleanu derivative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Leisure time physical activity (LTPA) provides both health benefits and risks, particularly during a pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, significant increases in close-to-home LTPA raised concerns for public health and land managers alike. This project illustrates a novel, integrated monitoring approach to estimating COVID-19 risk exposure during trail-related LTPA, with implications for other public spaces. METHODS: COVID-19 risk exposure was conservatively calculated from the integration of in-person observations of LTPA trail groups and automated monitoring of trail traffic volumes in spring 2020. Trained observers tracked 1,477 groups. Traffic volume estimates and observed distance data were integrated, considering occlusion and total trail traffic volume. RESULTS: 70% of groups had one or more encounters. Among individual users, 38.5% were 100% compliant across all events observed but 32.7% were not compliant. Considering trail traffic volumes and annual daily traffic volume, exposure to risk of COVID-19 was conservatively estimated at 61.5% among individual trail users. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring opportunities and challenges of health risk exposure exist. Adjusted exposure measures based on volume counts can approximate numbers of unique individuals exposed, inform management actions, efficacy and policy decisions.","output":"An integrated approach to monitoring and estimating COVID-19 risk exposure among leisure-time physical activity participants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High levels of secondary air pollutants during COVID-19 in China have aroused great concern.

The lockdown PAN levels also reached a high historical record based on our long-term measurements (2016-2019). Unlike ozone and PM2.5, PAN formation depends on less complex photochemistry between NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), providing a novel approach to investigate the wintertime photochemistry during COVID-19. The GEOS-Chem simulations suggest a markedly enhanced photochemistry by a factor of 2 during the lockdown. Change of meteorology featuring with anomalous wind convergence under higher temperatures is the main reason for enhanced photochemical formation of PAN, while chemically nonlinear feedbacks also play a role. Our results suggest implementing targeted VOC emission controls in the context of increasing photochemical pollution over this complex polluted region.","output":"Markedly enhanced levels of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) during COVID-19 in Beijing.

Currently, governments and transportation industries around the world are developing strategies to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with resuming activity. This study investigated the possible use of SARS-CoV-2 RNA wastewater surveillance from airline and cruise ship sanitation systems and its potential use as a COVID-19 public health management tool. METHODS: Aircraft and cruise ship wastewater samples (n = 21) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using two virus concentration methods, adsorptionCextraction by electronegative membrane (n = 13) and ultrafiltration by Amicon (n = 8), and five assays using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and RT-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR). Representative qPCR amplicons from positive samples were sequenced to confirm assay specificity. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in samples from both aircraft and cruise ship wastewater; however concentrations were near the assay limit of detection. The analysis of multiple replicate samples and use of multiple RT-qPCR and/or RT-ddPCR assays increased detection sensitivity and minimized false-negative results. Representative qPCR amplicons were confirmed for the correct PCR product by sequencing. However, differences in sensitivity were observed among molecular assays and concentration methods. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that surveillance of wastewater from large transport vessels with their own sanitation systems has potential as a complementary data source to prioritize clinical testing and contact tracing among disembarking passengers. Importantly, sampling methods and molecular assays must be further optimized to maximize detection sensitivity. The potential for false negatives by both wastewater testing and clinical swab testing suggests that the two strategies could be employed together to maximize the probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections amongst passengers.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in commercial passenger aircraft and cruise ship wastewater: a surveillance tool for assessing the presence of COVID-19 infected travellers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 crisis, managers and employees in many organizations suddenly are forced to work from home. Although working from home (WFH) is not a new phenomenon, it is new in its current scale and scope because of COVID-19. Against this background, we investigate the effect of WFH during the COVID-19 crisis on changes in leadership behaviors, and associated changes in perceived manager quality and productivity, at different hierarchical levels in organizations. Based on the literature, we develop two predictions in opposite directions. On the one hand, implementing WFH may force managers to show less direction and control and especially more delegation. On the other hand, research into the effects of exogenous shocks such as COVID-19, suggests that managers may become more controlling and delegate less. Consistent with the first prediction, we find that managers perceive they execute significantly less control and delegate more. Employees also perceive a significant decrease in control, however they perceive on average no change in delegation. Furthermore, and in line with the second prediction, employees of lower-level managers even report a significant decrease in delegation. Finally, our results show that increased delegation is associated with increased perceived productivity and higher manager quality. Together, these results suggest that in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the effectiveness of WFH might be hampered by the fact that required changes in leadership behaviors, in particular in delegation, are difficult to realize in times of crisis.","output":"Leading and Working From Home in Times of COVID-19: On the Perceived Changes in Leadership Behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Total internal reflection microscopy combined with microfluidics and supported bilayers is a powerful, single particle tracking (SPT) platform for host-pathogen membrane fusion studies. But one major inadequacy of this platform has been capturing the complexity of the cell membrane, including membrane proteins. Because of this, viruses requiring proteinaceous receptors, or other unknown cellular co-factors, have been precluded from study. Here we describe a general method to integrate proteinaceous receptors and cellular components into supported bilayers for SPT fusion studies. This method is general to any enveloped virus-host cell pair, but demonstrated here for feline coronavirus (FCoV). Supported bilayers are formed from mammalian cell membrane vesicles that express feline aminopeptidase N (the viral receptor) using a cell blebbing technique. SPT is then used to identify fusion intermediates and measure membrane fusion kinetics for FCoV. Overall, the fusion results recapitulate what is observed in vivo, that coronavirus entry requires binding to specific receptors, a low-pH environment, and that membrane fusion is receptor- and protease-dependent. But this method also provides quantitative kinetic rate parameters for intermediate steps in the coronavirus fusion pathway, which to our knowledge have not been obtained before. Moreover, the platform offers versatile, precise control over the sequence of triggers for fusion; these triggers may define the fusion pathway, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity of coronaviruses. Systematically varying these triggers in this platform provides a new route to study how viruses rapidly adapt to other hosts, and to identify factors that led to the emergence of zoonotic viruses, such as human SARS-CoV and the newly emerging human MERS-CoV.","output":"Single particle assay of coronavirus membrane fusion with proteinaceous receptor-embedded supported bilayers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The new media provides a convenient platform to access, use and exchange health information.

Human genomic databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were interrogated to identify DPP9 LoF variants and associated cancers.

DPP9 LoF variants were most often associated with uterine carcinoma. Two DPP9 intronic SNPs that have been associated with lung fibrosis and COVID-19 were not associated with liver fibrosis or cancer. All four DPP4-like genes were overexpressed in liver tumours and their joint high expression was associated with poor survival in HCC. Increased DPP9 expression was associated with obesity in HCC patients.. High expression of genes that positively correlated with overexpression of DPP4, DPP8, and DPP9 were associated with very poor survival in HCC. Enriched pathways analysis of these positively correlated genes featured Toll-like receptor and SUMOylation pathways.

One of the factors which triggered such losses was the lack of preparedness among governments and public transport providers. The losses can be minimized if the passenger count can be predicted with a higher accuracy and the public transport provision adapted to the demand in real time. The present paper explores the use of a novel machine learning algorithm, namely Regression Tsetlin Machine, in using historical passenger transport data from the current COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic period, combined with a calendar of pandemic-related events (e.g. daily number of new cases and deaths, restrictive measures for pandemic containment), to forecast public transport patronage variations in a pandemic scenario. Results show that the Regression Tsetlin Machine has the best accuracy of forecasts when compared to four other models usually employed in the public transport forecasting field. We also observed variations of the prediction accuracy in relation to the period of the pandemic in which the trained models are applied.

Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to be transmitted via breastmilk. Moreover, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are presumably contained in breastmilk of mothers with history of COVID-19 infection or vaccination. Direct breastfeeding is the preferred infant feeding option during the pandemic, but conflicting practices have been adopted, which could widen existing disparities in breastfeeding. This study aims to describe how was information about breastfeeding communicated in Mexican media during the pandemic and assess Mexican adults' beliefs regarding breastfeeding among mothers infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective content analysis of media coverage on breastfeeding in Mexico between March 1 and September 24, 2020, excluding advertisements, was done. For the content analysis, both a sentiment analysis and an analysis based on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for breastfeeding promotion were performed. Also, we incorporated a descriptive analysis from the July 2020 wave of the ENCOVID-19 survey, which included questions on beliefs about breastfeeding. This information was stratified by gender, age, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: 1014 publications on breastfeeding were identified in internet, newspapers, TV, and magazines. Most information was published during World Breastfeeding Week, celebrated in August. Based on the sentiment analysis, 57.2% of all information was classified as positive, and based on the SWOT analysis, most information was classified either as strengths or opportunities for breastfeeding promotion. However, the ENCOVID-19 data showed that 67.3% of people living in households with children under 3 years of age believe that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed, and 19.8% stated that they simply didn't know. These beliefs showed differences both by gender and by socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: While the Mexican government endorsed the recommendations on breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, communication of those messages was sporadic, inconstant and unequal across types of media. Moreover, there were also negative messages for breastfeeding circulating on the media. There continues to be a widespread notion that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed and, due to differences on beliefs by socioeconomic status, health inequities could be exacerbated.","output":"Breastfeeding Media Coverage and Beliefs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexico: Implications for Breastfeeding Equity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic showed that the virus is mostly conveyed by respiratory droplets that are produced at high intensity especially when an infected subject coughs or sneezes.

The virus gains access to host cells when the viral Spike protein (S-protein) binds to the host cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Studies have attempted to understand SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interaction with vertebrate orthologs of ACE2 by expressing ACE2 orthologs in mammalian cells and measuring viral infection or S- protein binding. Often these cells only transiently express ACE2 proteins and levels of ACE2 at the cell surface are not quantified. Here, we describe a cell-based assay that uses stably transfected cells expressing ACE2 proteins in a bi-cistronic vector with an easy to quantify reporter protein to normalize ACE2 expression. We found that both binding of the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and infection with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus is proportional to the amount of human ACE2 expressed at the cell surface, which can be inferred by quantifying the level of reporter protein, Thy1.1. We also compared different ACE2 orthologs which were expressed in stably transfected cells expressing equivalent levels of Thy1.1. When ranked for either viral infectivity or RBD binding, mouse ACE2 had a weak to undetectable affinity for S-protein while human ACE2 was the highest level detected and feline ACE2 had an intermediate phenotype. The generation of stably transfected cells whose ACE2 level can be normalized for cross-ortholog comparisons allows us to create a reusable cellular library useful for measuring emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants ability to potentially infect different animals.","output":"Variations in cell-surface ACE2 levels alter direct binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and viral infectivity: Implications for measuring Spike protein interactions with animal ACE2 orthologs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) that affects predominantly small- sized vessels.

METHODS Five hundred thirty-seven consecutive patients underwent hysterectomy for benign disease at Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in 2010. No cases were excluded. Minimally invasive approaches included total vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, total laparoscopic hysterectomy, and laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy. All surgeries were completed with the resident as the primary surgeon or first assistant. RESULTS The median age was 45 years, the median body mass index was 30 kg/m2, the median estimated uterine size was 11 cm, and 22% of patients had a prior cesarean section. Of the 537 hysterectomies, 526 (98%) were started with a minimally invasive approach and 517 (96%) were completed in that fashion; thus only 9 conversions (2%) were required. Of the cases in which a minimally invasive approach was used, 16% were vaginal and 84% were laparoscopic. The median operative time was 86 minutes, the median blood loss was 95 mL, the median hospital stay was 1 day, and the median uterine weight was 199 g.

Citizens also have expectations about the role that health care plays in enjoying a good quality of life, by providing response systems to handle emergencies and other illness situations adequately. Among the systems required to support desired performance levels is a robust and resilient pharmaceutical supply chain that is free of disruption. Shortages of drugs place undue pressure on healthcare providers to devise alternative approaches to administer patient care. With climate change expected to result in increasingly severe weather patterns in the future, it is critical that logistics engineers understand the impact that a catastrophic weather event could have on supply chain disruption to facilitate the design of supply systems that are robust and resilient. This study investigates the main causal and intermediate events that led to risk propagation in, and disruption of, the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain following Hurricane Maria.

The quantification is further examined through different advanced techniques such as predictive inference reasoning and sensitivity analysis. The general interpretation of these analyses suggests that port resilience is imperative to pharmaceutical supply chain performance in the case of Puerto Rico.","output":"Leveraging a Bayesian Network approach to model and analyze supplier vulnerability to severe weather risk: A case study of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain following Hurricane Maria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers play a critical role in the delivery of healthcare services. Because of the high risk of exposure to healthcare workers, the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact as they struggled to contain the pandemic. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the challenges they faced after contracting COVID-19. METHODS: An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) design was employed to gain insight into the lived experiences of healthcare workers who contracted COVID-19 in the course of their duties. This study involved participants who were healthcare workers based at a central hospital in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Data were collected through in-depth interviews that were audio recorded. A sample size of ten was reached based on data saturation. RESULTS: The study showed that healthcare workers lacked psychosocial support, experienced economic challenges as they incurred diagnostic and treatment costs. The study also found that the healthcare workers experienced stigma and discrimination both at work and in the community. Findings also indicate that healthcare workers did not receive institutional support. The study demonstrated lack of preparedness at the institution evidenced by inadequate testing for COVID-19 and shortage of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: This studys findings will be critical for health authorities, programmers and policymakers to facilitate planning and preparedness for pandemics. The researchers recommend setting up a differentiated service delivery support system for healthcare workers to cater for their mental health and well-being and that of their families.","output":"Challenges faced by healthcare workers at a central hospital in Zimbabwe after contracting COVID-19: An interpretive phenomenological analysis study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study will prove useful in expanding our understanding of the United Nations as the body with capacity, suitability, and competence to assume the role of governing and carrying out a global design of the Global Tax Governance architecture, as well as s well as to establish the bases, principles and areas of international tax cooperation.

This has resulted in an abundance of mHealth platforms available for research or commercial use. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to characterize the current state of mHealth platforms designed for anxiety or depression that are available for research, commercial use, or both. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using a two-pronged approach: searching relevant literature with prespecified search terms to identify platforms in published research and simultaneously searching 2 major app storesGoogle Play Store and Apple App Storeto identify commercially available platforms. Key characteristics of the mHealth platforms were synthesized, such as platform name, targeted condition, targeted group, purpose, technology type, intervention type, commercial availability, and regulatory information. RESULTS: The literature and app store searches yielded 169 and 179 mHealth platforms, respectively. Most platforms developed for research purposes were designed for depression (116/169, 68.6%), whereas the app store search reported a higher number of platforms developed for anxiety (Android: 58/179, 32.4%; iOS: 27/179, 15.1%). The most common purpose of platforms in both searches was treatment (literature search: 122/169, 72.2%; app store search: 129/179, 72.1%). With regard to the types of intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy and referral to care or counseling emerged as the most popular options offered by the platforms identified in the literature and app store searches, respectively. Most platforms from both searches did not have a specific target age group. In addition, most platforms found in app stores lacked clinical and real-world evidence, and a small number of platforms found in the published research were available commercially. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of mHealth platforms designed for anxiety or depression are available for research, commercial use, or both. The characteristics of these mHealth platforms greatly vary. Future efforts should focus on assessing the qualityutility, safety, and effectivenessof the existing platforms and providing developers, from both commercial and research sectors, a reporting guideline for their platform description and a regulatory framework to facilitate the development, validation, and deployment of effective mHealth platforms.","output":"Characteristics of Mobile Health Platforms for Depression and Anxiety: Content Analysis Through a Systematic Review of the Literature and Systematic Search of Two App Stores"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Severe influenza can lead to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. We explored whether ICU data reflect influenza like illness (ILI) activity in the general population, and whether ICU respiratory infections can predict influenza epidemics. METHODS: We calculated the time lag and correlation between ILI incidence (from ILI sentinel surveillance, based on general practitioners (GP) consultations) and percentages of ICU admissions with a respiratory infection (from the Dutch National Intensive Care Registry) over the years 2003C2011. In addition, ICU data of the first three years was used to build three regression models to predict the start and end of influenza epidemics in the years thereafter, one to three weeks ahead. The predicted start and end of influenza epidemics were compared with observed start and end of such epidemics according to the incidence of ILI. RESULTS: Peaks in respiratory ICU admissions lasted longer than peaks in ILI incidence rates. Increases in ICU admissions occurred on average two days earlier compared to ILI. Predicting influenza epidemics one, two, or three weeks ahead yielded positive predictive values ranging from 0.52 to 0.78, and sensitivities from 0.34 to 0.51. CONCLUSIONS: ICU data was associated with ILI activity, with increases in ICU data often occurring earlier and for a longer time period. However, in the Netherlands, predicting influenza epidemics in the general population using ICU data was imprecise, with low positive predictive values and sensitivities.","output":"Do Intensive Care Data on Respiratory Infections Reflect Influenza Epidemics?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"En este artculo se se?ala que el paulatino desplome del orden econmico neoliberal internacional, surgido en las dcadas de 1980 y 1990, podra estar dejando paso a un \\"nuevo\\" nuevo orden econmico internacional (NNOEI).

Exposure therapy is the gold-standard treatment for PTSD, and fear extinction learning is a key concept underlying successful exposure. METHODS: This study examined the role of genetic endocannabinoid polymorphisms in a fear extinction paradigm with PTSD compared to healthy participants (N = 220). Participants provided saliva for genotyping, completed a fear conditioning and extinction task, with blood samples taken before and after the task (n = 57). Skin conductance was the outcome and was analyzed using mixed models. RESULTS: Results for cannabinoid receptor type 1 polymorphisms suggested that minor alleles of rs2180619 and rs1049353 were associated with poorer extinction learning in PTSD participants. The minor allele of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) polymorphism rs324420 was associated with worse extinction in PTSD participants. Subanalysis of healthy participants (n = 57) showed the FAAH rs324420 genotype effect was dependent on plasma arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA) level, but not oleoylethanolamide or 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. Specifically, higher but not lower AEA levels in conjunction with the minor allele of FAAH rs324420 were associated with better extinction learning. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide translational evidence that cannabinoid receptor 1 and AEA are involved in extinction learning in humans. FAAH rs324420's effect on fear extinction is moderated by AEA plasma level in healthy controls. These findings imply that FAAH inhibitors may be effective for targeting anxiety in PTSD, but this effect needs to be explored further in clinical populations.","output":"Cannabinoid polymorphisms interact with plasma endocannabinoid levels to predict fear extinction learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed a huge strain on UK hospitals. Early studies suggest that patients can deteriorate quickly after admission to hospital. The aim of this study was to model changes in vital signs for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to one acute hospital trust in the UK (CV) and a cohort of patients admitted to the same hospital between 2013-2017 with viral pneumonia (VI). The primary outcome was the start of continuous positive airway pressure/non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, ICU admission or death in hospital. We used non-linear mixed-effects models to compare changes in vital sign observations prior to the primary outcome. Using observations and FiO2 measured at discharge in the VI cohort as the model of normality, we also combined individual vital signs into a single novelty score. RESULTS: There were 497 cases of COVID-19, of whom 373 had been discharged from hospital. 135 (36.2%) of patients experienced the primary outcome, of whom 99 died in hospital. In-hospital mortality was over 4-times higher in the CV than the VI cohort (26.5% vs 6%). For those patients who experienced the primary outcome, CV patients became increasingly hypoxaemic, with a median estimated FiO2 (0.75) higher than that of the VI cohort (estimated FiO2 of 0.35). Prior to the primary outcome, blood pressure remained within normal range, and there was only a small rise in heart rate. The novelty score showed that patients with COVID-19 deteriorated more rapidly that patients with viral pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 who deteriorate in hospital experience rapidly-worsening respiratory failure, with low SpO2 and high FiO2, but only minor abnormalities in other vital signs. This has potential implications for the ability of early warning scores to identify deteriorating patients.","output":"Trajectories of vital signs in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 2019 or COVID-19 is a pandemic that has resulted in mortality and mortality rates in various parts of the world.

Alternative methods to reach these people have become necessary. We assessed the feasibility, satisfaction, and effectiveness of video teleconsultation using mobile phones for managing persons with epilepsy (PWEs) on follow-up at a tertiary care center in the southern part of India. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included PWEs aged 18a?years and over who have been evaluated in person within the past six months, with details available in electronic health records (EHRs), and advised regular follow-up after getting telephonic consent. We excluded those requiring emergency care and those seeking teleconsultation for new symptoms. Participants were sent a message in English and in the local language about the possibility of a video teleconsultation. If willing, they were informed about the date, time, and technical requirements such as smartphones, browsing facilities, etc. Feasibility and effectiveness were assessed. Satisfaction/acceptability was assessed using Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS: From June 2020 to October 2020, we selected 336 PWEs after screening 1100 records, and we tried video teleconsultation in 141 (41.8%) PWEs. We achieved successful video connections in 95 (28.2%) and audio consultations in 46 (13.6%). The median duration for calling the participants, making successful connections, and consultation was 8 (5-14) min. The majority required two (47.4%) or three (32.6%) attempts. Sixty-five PWEs (68.4%) used caretaker's mobile phones. We gave prescriptions to all, and 18 received new drugs. Out of 95 PWEs, 90% either 'agreed' or 'strongly agreed' on 12 out of 14 telemedicine satisfaction questions. CONCLUSION: Although we need to make video teleconsultation more feasible, our synchronous mobile video teleconsultation model is an effective and acceptable method to follow up PWEs. This real-time model has the advantage that it does not require any mobile application to be downloaded and installed. Further studies are needed to evaluate methods to improve the reach of these services particularly to vulnerable groups of the population.","output":"Video teleconsultation services for persons with epilepsy during COVID-19 pandemic: An exploratory study from public tertiary care hospital in Southern India on feasibility, satisfaction, and effectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) assists the regulation of blood pressure and is the main target of the coronaviruses responsible for SARS and COVID19. The catalytic function of ACE2 relies on the opening and closing motion of its peptidase domain (PD). In this study, we investigated the possibility of allosterically controlling the ACE2 PD functional dynamics. After confirming that ACE2 PD binding site opening-closing motion is dominant in characterizing its conformational landscape, we observed that few mutations in the viral receptor binding domain fragments were able to impart different effects on the binding site opening of ACE2 PD. This showed that binding to the solvent exposed area of ACE2 PD can effectively alter the conformational profile of the protein, and thus likely its catalytic function. Using a targeted machine learning model and relative entropy-based statistical analysis, we proposed the mechanism for the allosteric perturbation that regulates the ACE2 PD binding site dynamics at atomistic level. The key residues and the source of the allosteric regulation of ACE PD dynamics are also presented.","output":"Allosteric control of ACE2 peptidase domain dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Various endovascular techniques have been applied to the treatment of vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms, including parent artery preservation with coiling, stent placement or flow diverter placement, and trapping and proximal occlusion. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to study clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search for studies on the endovascular treatment of vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms. From each study we abstracted the following data: immediate occlusion, long-term occlusion, long-term good neurologic outcome, perioperative morbidity, perioperative mortality, rebleed (ruptured only), recurrence, and retreatment. We performed subgroup analyses of patients undergoing deconstructive-versus-reconstructive techniques. Meta-analysis was performed by using a random effects model. RESULTS Seventeen studies with 478 patients were included in this analysis. Sixteen studies had at least 6 months of clinical/angiographic follow-up. Endovascular treatment was associated with high rates of long-term occlusion (87.0%; 95% CI, 74.0%-94.0%) and low recurrence (7.0%; 95% CI, 5.0%-10.0%) and retreatment rates (3.0%; 95% CI, 2.0%-6.0%). Long-term good neurologic outcome was 84.0% (95% CI, 65.0%-94.0%). Deconstructive techniques were associated with higher rates of long-term complete occlusion compared with reconstructive techniques (88.0%; 95% CI, 35.0%-99.0% versus 81.0%; 95% CI, 64.0%-91.0%; P < .0001).

This study aims to screen the potent genes associated with extended-spectrum -lactamases (ESBLs) in drug-resistant Escherichia coli and elucidate the specific drug-resistant mechanism. METHODS: Clinical ESBLs-EC samples were obtained based on the microbial identification, and the whole genome was sequenced. In combination with the significantly enriched pathways, several differently expressed genes were screened and verified by RT-PCR. Furthermore, through knocking out glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) gene and transfecting overexpressed plasmids, the potential relationship between GLO1 and ESBLs was then investigated. Lastly, the concentrations of -lactamases in bacteria and supernatant from different groups were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: After successful isolation and identification of ESBLs-EC, the whole genome and eighteen differential metabolic pathways were analyzed to select differently expressed genes, including add, deoD, guaD, speG, GLO1, VNN1, etc. RT-PCR results showed that there were no differences in these genes between the standard bacteria and susceptible Escherichia coli. Remarkably, the relative levels of four genes including speG, Hdac10, GLO1 and Ppcdc were significantly increased in ESBLs-EC in comparison with susceptible strains, whereas other gene expression was decreased. Further experiments utilizing gene knockout and overexpression strains confirmed the role of GLO1. At last, a total of 10 subtypes of -lactamases were studied using ELISA, including BES-, CTX-M1-, CTX-M2-, OXA1-, OXA2-, OXA10-, PER-, SHV-, TEM-, and VEB-ESBLs, and results demonstrated that GLO1 gene expression only affected PER--lactamases but had no effects on other -lactamases. CONCLUSION: SpeG, Hdac10, GLO1 and Ppcdc might be associated with the drug-resistant mechanism of Escherichia coli. Of note, this study firstly addressed the role of GLO1 in the drug resistance of ESBLs-EC, and this effect may be mediated by increasing PER--lactamases.","output":"GLO1 Contributes to the Drug Resistance of Escherichia coli Through Inducing PER Type of Extended-Spectrum -Lactamases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To promote equity in the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society (AOA) selection process, clear and timely communication of eligibility criteria is needed.

We, therefore, initiated systematic optimization of the direct binding assay to adapt it for routine use in regulatory-compliant assays of serum anti-drug antibodies. Accordingly, we first prepared a SULFO-TAG labeled conjugate of recombinant Protein-A/G to create a sensitive electrochemiluminescent secondary detection reagent with broad reactivity to antibodies across many species. Secondly, we evaluated candidate blocker-diluents to identify ones producing the highest signal-to-noise response ratios. Lastly, we introduced use of the ratio of signal responses in biotherapeutic-coated and uncoated wells as a data transformation strategy to identify biological outliers. This alternative data normalization approach improved normality, reduced skewness, and facilitated application of a parametric screening cut point.

Background: Due to governmental stay-at-home orders during the pandemic, families with dislocated (compelled to return home) college students would likely encounter unique stressors while also being limited in their normal ways of coping. Methods: Using an online survey, the current study sought to discover how diverse individual characteristics and family living situations of 323 dislocated students associated with varying homelife experiences (e.g., intrusive parenting, students making an extra effort to spend time with family), and how such experiences associated with relationship changes during the quarantine. Results: Analyses detected some differences in the students' homelife experiences based on background and living situations, especially related to being a first-year student, having been excited about returning home, and feeling accepted by parents about being home. Negative family relationship quality during the quarantine was most predicted by negative attitudes from students and parents about students being home, the student feeling less adultlike (based on treatment and own identity conception), and having low autonomy. Conclusion: Returning home for quarantine was challenging for most students, and circumstances and attitudes appeared to contribute to how such challenges associated with family relationship changes.

We evaluated in a mouse model an associated virus-bacterial vaccine based on seasonal live influenza vaccines (LAIV) and S. pneumoniae chimeric protein comprising flagellin (PSPF). Intranasal immunization of mice with a complex of trivalent LAIV and PSPF caused an increased release of early cytokines in the lungs of mice. The immunogenicity of LAIV and PSPF in the associated vaccine composition was sometimes decreased compared to each vaccine preparation alone. Nevertheless, only vaccination of mice with LAIV+PSPF significantly reduced lethality and the bacterial load in the lungs in a model of post-influenza bacterial pneumonia. The study of the interactions of influenza viruses with bacterial peptides is important during the development of associated virus-bacterial vaccines intended for the prevention of severe post-influenza bacterial complications.","output":"Associated virus-bacterial vaccine based on seasonal LAIV and S. pneumoniae chimeric peptide provide protection against post-influenza pneumococcal infection in mouse model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study intends to contribute to the state of the art of Fused-Filament Fabrication (FFF) of short-fiber-reinforced polyamides by optimizing process parameters to improve the performance of printed parts under uniaxial tensile loading.

Evaluated parameters included extrusion and printing bed temperatures, layer height and printing speed. It was concluded that when exposed to new observations, the ML-based model predicted the response with higher accuracy. However, the DoE fared slightly better at predicting observations where higher response values were expected, including the optimal solution, which reached an UTS of 117.1  5.7 MPa. Moreover, there was an important correlation between process parameters and the response. Layer height and printing bed temperatures were considered the most influential parameters, while extrusion temperature and printing speed had a lower influence on the outcome. The general influence of parameters on the response was correlated with the degree of interlayer cohesion, which in turn affected the mechanical performance of the 3D-printed specimens.","output":"Fused-Filament Fabrication of Short Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polyamide: Parameter Optimization for Improved Performance under Uniaxial Tensile Loading"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health practices including handwashing and vaccinations help reduce the spread and impact of infections. Nevertheless, the global burden of infection is high, and additional measures are necessary. Acute respiratory tract infections, for example, were responsible for approximately 2.38 million deaths worldwide in 2016. The role nutrition plays in supporting the immune system is well-established. A wealth of mechanistic and clinical data show that vitamins, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and folate; trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid play important and complementary roles in supporting the immune system. Inadequate intake and status of these nutrients are widespread, leading to a decrease in resistance to infections and as a consequence an increase in disease burden. Against this background the following conclusions are made: (1) supplementation with the above micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids is a safe, effective, and low-cost strategy to help support optimal immune function; (2) supplementation above the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), but within recommended upper safety limits, for specific nutrients such as vitamins C and D is warranted; and (3) public health officials are encouraged to include nutritional strategies in their recommendations to improve public health.","output":"Optimal Nutritional Status for a Well-Functioning Immune System Is an Important Factor to Protect against Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation patterns of the human genome can be modified by environmental stimuli and provide dense information on gene regulatory circuitries. We studied genome-wide DNA methylation in nasal samples from infants (<6 months) applying whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to characterize epigenome response to 10 different respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We identified virus-specific differentially methylated regions (vDMR) with human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and SARS-CoV-2 followed by Influenza B (Flu B) causing the weakest vs. strongest epigenome response with 496 vs. 78541 and 14361 vDMR, respectively. We found a strong replication rate of FluB (52%) and SARS-CoV-2 (42%) vDMR in independent samples indicating robust epigenome perturbation upon infection. Among the FluB and SARS-CoV-2 vDMRs, around 70% were hypomethylated and significantly enriched among epithelial cell-specific regulatory elements whereas the hypermethylated vDMRs for these viruses mapped more frequently to immune cell regulatory elements, especially those of the myeloid lineage. The hypermethylated vDMRs were also enriched among genes and genetic loci in monocyte activation pathways and monocyte count. Finally, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing characterization of nasal mucosa in response to these two viruses to functionally analyze the epigenome perturbations. Which supports the trends we identified in methylation data and highlights and important role for monocytes.

However, a confirmation of the food safety aspects of sake based on scientific evidence is important for establishing consumer confidence, in part because consumer concerns regarding food safety have increased. The presence of Bacillus cereus spores in refined rice wine has been reported, and in light of consumers' growing concern over food safety, the establishment of food and beverage safety is important for consumers' reassurance. Herein, to confirm the microbiological safety of sake, we investigated the content and growth of B. cereus. We conducted a spore addition test to determine whether B. cereus spores grow during sake production, and we observed no growth or germination of B. cereus spores during the manufacturing process. We also observed that processes such as solid-liquid separation and filtration help remove the risk posed by B. cereus. We then conducted a survey to assess the density of B. cereus in various commercial sake products. We analyzed 162 samples of commercial sake and observed that 11 of the products had &#8805;1 CFU of living cells in 1 mL of sake (detection rate: 6.8%). There was no product in which &#8805;100 CFU/mL-sake of living cells was detected. Our findings confirmed that the density of these bacteria in sake is lower than that in other foods, and the probability of infection is very low. The emetic toxin produced by B. cereus was not detected in any of the sake samples. This is the first study based on experimental data demonstrating that B. cereus is not able to grow in sake or during the sake manufacturing process. We thus conclude that the safety risk of B. cereus in sake is negligible.

Here, we describe an approach exploiting natural albumin transport across the airway epithelium to enhance mucosal TRM generation by vaccination. Pulmonary immunization with albumin-binding amphiphile conjugates of peptide antigens and CpG adjuvant (amph-vaccines) increased vaccine accumulation in the lung and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs). Amph-vaccines prolonged antigen presentation in MLNs over 2 weeks, leading to 25-fold increased lung-resident T cell responses over traditional immunization and enhanced protection from viral or tumor challenge. Mimicking such prolonged exposure through repeated administration of soluble vaccine revealed that persistence of both antigen and adjuvant was critical for optimal TRM induction, mediated through T cell priming in MLNs after prime, and directly in the lung tissue after boost. Thus, vaccine persistence strongly promotes TRM induction, and amph-conjugates may provide a practical approach to achieve such kinetics in mucosal vaccines.","output":"Exploiting albumin as a mucosal vaccine chaperone for robust generation of lung-resident memory T cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma has emerged as a promising therapy and has been granted Emergency Use Authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

To maximize the impact of these genomics studies, it is important that data from biological samples will become publicly available with standardized metadata. The availability of data at public archives provides the hope that greater insights could be obtained through integration with multi-omics data, reproducibility of published studies, or meta-analyses of large diverse datasets. These datasets should include a description of the host, organism, environmental source of the specimen, spatial-temporal information and other relevant metadata, but unfortunately these attributes are often missing and when present, they show inconsistencies in the use of metadata standards and ontologies. RESULTS: METAGENOTE (https://metagenote.niaid.nih.gov) is a web portal that greatly facilitates the annotation of samples from genomic studies and streamlines the submission process of sequencing files and metadata to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (Leinonen R, et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 39:D19-21, 2011) for public access. This platform offers a wide selection of packages for different types of biological and experimental studies with a special emphasis on the standardization of metadata reporting. These packages follow the guidelines from the MIxS standards developed by the Genomics Standard Consortium (GSC) and adopted by the three partners of the International Nucleotides Sequencing Database Collaboration (INSDC) (Cochrane G, et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 44:D48-50, 2016) - National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ).

CONCLUSIONS: METAGENOTE is a public resource that focuses on simplifying the annotation and submission process of data with its corresponding metadata. Users of METAGENOTE will benefit from the easy to use annotation interface but most importantly will be encouraged to publish metadata following standards and ontologies that make the public data available for reuse.","output":"METAGENOTE: a simplified web platform for metadata annotation of genomic samples and streamlined submission to NCBIs sequence read archive"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are nosocomial pathogens with increasing prevalence worldwide. Extensive hygiene measures have been established to prevent infection transmission in hospitals. Here, we developed a predictive score system (the predictive vancomycin-resistant enterococci [PREVENT] score) to identify the clearance or persistence in patients with a history of VRE carrier status at readmission. Over a cumulative 3-year period, patients with a positive VRE carrier status were included. The study population was recruited in two successive time periods and separated into training data for predictive score development and validation data for evaluation of the predictive power. The risk factors for persistent VRE colonization were analyzed in a univariable analysis before development of a logistic regression model based on the potential risk factors. The score points were determined proportionally to the beta coefficients of the logistic regression model. The data from 448 (79%) patients were used as the training data, and those from 119 (21%) as the validation data. Multivariable analysis revealed the following variables as independent risk factors: age of 60 years, hemato-oncological disease, cumulative antibiotic treatment for >4 weeks, and a VRE infection. The resulting logistic regression model exhibited an acceptable area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.91). The predictive score system had a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI, 65 to 93%) and a specificity of 77% (95% CI, 66 to 85%). The developed predictive score system is a useful tool to assess the VRE carrier status of patients with a history of VRE colonization. On the basis of this risk assessment, more focused and cost-effective infection control measures can be implemented. IMPORTANCE Given the increasing relevance of VRE as nosocomial pathogens worldwide, infection prevention and control measures, including patient isolation and contact precautions, are indispensable to avoid their spread in the hospital setting. In this study, we developed and validated the PREVENT score, a tool for rapid risk assessment of VRE persistence in patients with a history of previous VRE colonization. The score is designed to be easily performed, employing clinical information available in a regular admission setting and immediately providing information to inform the decision of whether to adopt patient isolation and contact precautions during the hospital stay. After validation, the score was shown to accurately identify patients with persistent VRE colonization upon admission, representing a suitable option as (i) a complementary method yielding preliminary results significantly more quickly than culture-based VRE detection techniques and (ii) an alternative strategy for VRE detection in settings in which microbiological VRE screening is not routinely performed due to limited resources.","output":"Development and Validation of a Tool for the Prediction of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci Colonization Persistencethe PREVENT Score"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past two years, the issue of the rapid spread of coronavirus infection has been actively discussed.

Thirty-two men with disk herniation participated in this clinical trial study which was randomly divided into three groups of suspension exercises (n: 12, age: 34.25  8.81, BMI: 24.01  2.7), core stability exercises (n: 10, age: 35  10.3, BMI: 25  2.27) and control (n: 10, age: 34.4  6.67, BMI: 23.76  1.45). Electrical activity of rectus abdominis, internal and external oblique and erector spinae muscles was masured by superficial EMG, back pain by McGill Pain Questionnaire and range of motion by Modified Schober test, one day before and immediately after of intervention period. The experimental groups performed an 8-week training period while the control group was only followed up. Data were analyzed using paired sample t test and analysis of covariance test and statistical significance was set at 0.05. Suspension group showed significant improvement in EMG of rectus abdominis, internal and external oblique muscles (respectively, p = 0.030, p = 0.017, p = 0.022) and pain (p = 0.001) compared to core stability group; but there was no significant difference between two groups in EMG of erector spinae muscle and range of motion.

Existing literature rather is normative, recommending SIRs to focus on customer orientation. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the types of competitive strategies really adopted by SIRs.Design/methodology/approachThis qualitative study is based on 13 semi-structured interviews of the booksellers, beer and wine merchants we met around Paris (France) in 2018. Data analysis was conducted in two stages: each interview was coded to bring out themes, which were then linked in cognitive maps.FindingsFive types of SIRs' competitive strategies emerged from the study, depending on their main focus of attention. Either SIRs have no weapon to fight against external factors and they suffer competition or they have limited means and focus on their relationship with customers or even they possess a specific resource they can rely on (innovative character, skills, values) to go beyond ordinary customer orientation.Practical implicationsThe typology should be a useful tool for SIRs interested in competitive strategies and for municipalities looking for new insights to succeed in the revitalisation of their city centres.Social implicationsRevitalisation of city centres is a big challenge for many Western cities, especially small- and middle-sized ones.Originality/valueTo the best of our knowledge, the typology that comes from this study is the very first one on SIRs.

It has been clinically tested and validated in intubated Covid-19 patients. Once the pandemic hit Chilean soil in March 2020, it was quite clear that the number of mechanical ventilators available would not be enough. As in other parts of the world many initiatives sprung, most of them naively simple. Chilean medical societies joined engineering specialists and agreed early on in an organized and regulated open process for validating emergency mechanical ventilators, thus allowing for rapid development but with the required functionality, reliability, and safety features. VEMERS UC was one of a few that completed successfully all stages of the validating process, the final test being on five critically ill intubated Covid-19 patients for eight hours each. VEMERS UC is based on an electropneumatic circuit architecture, and its components are all low cost, off-the-shelf pneumatic, and electronic products easily obtained in industrial markets. It works in continuous mandatory volume control mode. The novel technical features of VEMERS UC are discussed here as well as the results obtained in each stage of the validating process. The validating process carried out in Chile is noteworthy by itself, and it could be used as an example in other developing countries. Furthermore, VEMERS UC can be used as a guiding design reference in other countries as well, since this design has already been thoroughly tested in human patients and has proven to work successfully.","output":"VEMERS UC: A Clinically Validated Emergency Mechanical Ventilator for COVID-19 and Postpandemic Use in Low Resource Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives The study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health services with and without specific health care of COVID-19 patients through the eyes of leading physicians at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE). Methods From April 30 to May 12, 2020, four interviewers conducted 38 expert interviews via telephone, video or face-to-face by using a semi-standardized questionnaire. The standardized answers were analysed descriptively. The free text-answers were subject to a qualitative content analysis. The categories were analysed via quantitative frequency distributions. Results All chief physicians with responsibility for inpatient and outpatient health care at the UKE took part in this study (N=38). The leading physicians reported numerous changes regarding occupancy in the hospital, patient composition, work flows and diagnostic as well as therapeutic measures. Additionally, various arrangements were necessary to cover the needs of prevention, treatment and follow-up care as well as protection of staff. Measures showed, on the one hand, a strong reduction in occupancy and workload in most inpatient and outpatient clinics. On the other hand, the amount of work also increased by fundamental transitions of work flows, communication, staff structure and hygiene measures. Many respondents commented positively on the rapid and efficient setup of a digital communication structure. Partially, staff was strained by the pandemic itself and by the associated measures. Conclusion The results of the study help to understand and assess the effects of the pandemic on health care, work flows and staff. The findings may support the specification and adaptation of prospective measures and processes for pandemic crisis situations.

Working time is also known to be highly gendered, with men and women working to different schedules. This article merges these two strands of research and takes a gender-based approach to investigating the relationship between temporal job quality and self-reported health in Europe. First, the sixth European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) is used to establish the relationship between temporal dimensions of job quality and health and well-being outcomes for employed women and men. This is then corroborated using larger samples and more restricted measures of job quality drawn from micro-data from the 2019C2020 EU Labor Force Survey (LFS). The analyses show that good temporal job quality is positively associated with health and subjective well-being for both women and men, but this effect is significantly stronger for women, who are also at a greater risk of exposure to low control over working time and time under-employment. The findings highlight the importance of studying the impact of working and employment conditions on health from gender perspective, and the need for further exploration of job quality due to changes in the spatio-temporal organization of work during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Temporal Dimensions of Job Quality and Gender: Exploring Differences in the Associations of Working Time and Health between Women and Men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic has spread worldwide since December 2019.

We developed a new approach to obtain the spatial distribution for the probability of infection (PI) by combining the spatial flow impact factor (SFIF) method with the Wells-Riley model. Our method can be combined with the anti-problem approach, in order to determine the optimized arrangement of people and/or air purifiers in a confined space beyond the ability of previous methods. This method was validated by a CFD-integrated method, and an illustrative example is presented.

METHODS Our series includes thirteen patients, who underwent LLDN using 3-mm instruments and laparoscope and 5-mm transumbilical trocar. The patients were followed at 7 and 14 days from discharge and were specifically asked about their cosmetic satisfaction. At follow-up, the recipient graft function was controlled, as well as the donor's cosmetic results. Eight months after surgery, all thirteen patients were asked to fill out the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire and Scoring System (PSAQ). RESULTS All patients presented good recovery after surgery. Regarding cosmetic outcomes, the donors expressed their satisfaction toward the minimal incision size and optimal esthetic results at 7 and 14 days from discharge home. The low scores on each section of the PSAQ confirmed the favorable outcomes. Early graft function was satisfactory at 1 and 3 months after the kidney transplantation. Furthermore, there were no major complications in the recipients. CONCLUSIONS Our persistent positive results with the use of 3-mm instruments during LLDN support this technique as a good alternative to the standard laparoscopic approach for minimizing the incision site, while maintaining safety and excellent clinical outcomes. The fact that the general laparoscopic standards are maintained could make this approach a very attractive alternative to the other minimally invasive approaches for live donor nephrectomy. The hope is in that the higher degree of satisfaction in the donor population demonstrated in this study may likely enhance living kidney donation.","output":"Mini-laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy with the use of 3-mm instruments and laparoscope."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The elderly population in Hong Kong is rapidly growing, and the need for residential care homes (RCHs) is increasing. The risk of being infected with micro-organisms increases among the frail and the vulnerable elderly population as their immunity system begins to deteriorate. Furthermore, the residents in RCHs are at high risk of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) due to the confined living environments and individual co-morbidities. In relation to this, infection control practice (ICP) is considered a crucial and effective approach in preventing HAIs. This study aimed to observe the daily ICP of healthcare workers in RCH settings. METHODS: An observational study was conducted to observe daily ICP among healthcare workers in private and subsidized RCHs. Each RCH was separated into different units based on the location (common area and bedroom area) and nature of residents for successive days. The ICP episodes were observed until 200 opportunities in each unit. The ICP episodes were recorded by an electronic tool called eRub, which is an ICP checklist based on international guidelines. RESULTS: The most frequent observed ICP episodes were hand hygiene (n = 1053), the use of gloves (n = 1053) and respiratory protection (n = 1053). The overall compliance of hand hygiene was poor, with only 15% of participants performing this during the five moments for hand hygiene. Furthermore, the observations showed that 77.9% improperly performed the use of gloves, and 31.8% failed to wear a mask during the care provision for the elderly. However, the results showed that most healthcare workers can wear the mask in a proper way when they should. Generally, the personal care workers were the worst in terms of hand hygiene and use of gloves compared with the other types of healthcare workers. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that the practice of hand hygiene, the use of gloves, and respiratory protection were the important elements of ICP, overall compliance to these elements was still poor. Personal care workers had the most frequent contact with the residents, but they had the worst compliance rate. Hence, continued monitoring and training among healthcare workers is needed, particularly personal care workers, in this healthcare service setting.","output":"Observational study of compliance with infection control practices among healthcare workers in subsidized and private residential care homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in unprecedented disease burden, healthcare costs, and economic impacts worldwide. Despite several measures, SARS-CoV-2 has been extremely impactful due to its extraordinary infection potential mainly through coronavirus-borne saliva respiratory and droplet nuclei of an infected person and its considerable stability on surfaces. Although the disease has affected over 180 countries, its extent and control are significantly different across the globe, making it a strong case for exploration of its behavior and dependence across various environmental pathways and its interactions with the virus. This has spurred efforts to characterize the coronavirus and understand the factors impacting its transmission and survival such as aerosols, air quality, meteorology, chemical compositions and characteristics of particles and surfaces, which are directly or indirectly associated with coronaviruses infection spread. Nonetheless, many peer-reviewed articles have studied these aspects but mostly in isolation; a complete array of coronavirus survival and transmission from an infected individual through air- and water-borne channels and its subsequent intractions with environmental factors, surfaces, particulates and chemicals is not comprehensively explored. Particulate matter (PM) is omnipresent with variable concentrations, structures and composition, while most of the surfaces are also covered by PM of different characteristics. Learning from the earlier coronavirus studies, including SARS and MERS, an attempt has been made to understand the survival of SARS-CoV-2 outside of the host body and discuss the probable air and water-borne transmission routes and its interactions with the outside environment. The present work 1) Helps appreciate the role of PM, its chemical constituents and surface characteristics and 2) Further identifies gaps in this field and suggests possible domains to work upon for better understanding of transmission and survival of this novel coronavirus.","output":"Understanding air and water borne transmission and survival of coronavirus: Insights and way forward for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical course and impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) infection on pregnant women.

Eosinophils have been considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of virus\\\\induced asthma exacerbations. To determine how often asthma exacerbation is caused by virus infections and to examine the relationship between eosinophilia and asthma episode, we investigated 64 children who experienced asthma attacks between October 1999 and March 2000. We used rapid enzyme immunoassays to detect antigens of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus, and adenovirus in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) of these children, and enumerated eosinophils in the blood and NPS. We detected RSV in 27% and influenza A virus in 17% of the patients. No adenovirus infection or RSV/influenza A co\\\\infection was detected. RSV\\\\infected children were younger (3.85  0.83 years old) than influenza A virus\\\\infected patients (5.23  1.34 years old). Eighty\\\\two per cent of patients in the RSV group and 36% of patients in the influenza A virus group had moderate\\\\to\\\\severe asthma episodes (p < 0.05). In RSV\\\\infected children, the eosinophil counts in NPS were higher in the severe group, and younger patients had a greater number of eosinophils in their NPS than older patients (p < 0.05).

Current preparedness activities recognize the importance of oral antivirals and recommend therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is closely related to VARV, causing a highly similar clinical human disease, and can be used as a surrogate for smallpox antiviral testing. The prairie dog MPXV model has been characterized and used to study the efficacy of antipoxvirus therapeutics, including recently approved TPOXX (tecovirimat). Brincidofovir (BCV; CMX001) has shown antiviral activity against double-stranded DNA viruses, including poxviruses. To determine the exposure of BCV following oral administration to prairie dogs, a pharmacokinetics (PK) study was performed. Analysis of BCV plasma concentrations indicated variability, conceivably due to the outbred nature of the animals. To determine BCV efficacy in the MPXV prairie dog model, groups of animals were intranasally challenged with 9  10(5) plaque-forming units (PFU; 90% lethal dose [LD(90)]) of MPXV on inoculation day 0 (ID0). Animals were divided into groups based on the first day of BCV treatment relative to inoculation day (IDC1, ID0, or ID1). A trend in efficacy was noted dependent upon treatment initiation (57% on IDC1, 43% on ID0, and 29% on ID1) but was lower than demonstrated in other animal models. Analysis of the PK data indicated that BCV plasma exposure (maximum concentration [C(max)]) and the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC(last)) were lower than in other animal models administered the same doses, indicating that suboptimal BCV exposure may explain the lower protective effect on survival. IMPORTANCE Preparedness activities against highly transmissible viruses with high mortality rates have been highlighted during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Smallpox, caused by variola virus (VARV) infection, is highly transmissible, with an estimated 30% mortality. Through an intensive vaccination campaign, smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, and routine smallpox vaccination of individuals ceased. Today's current population has little/no immunity against VARV. If smallpox were to reemerge, the worldwide results would be devastating. Recent FDA approval of one smallpox antiviral (tecovirimat) was a successful step in biothreat preparedness; however, orthopoxviruses can become resistant to treatment, suggesting the need for multiple therapeutics. Our paper details the efficacy of the investigational smallpox drug brincidofovir in a monkeypox virus (MPXV) animal model. Since brincidofovir has not been tested in vivo against smallpox, studies with the related virus MPXV are critical in understanding whether it would be protective in the event of a smallpox outbreak.","output":"Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of a Potential Smallpox Therapeutic, Brincidofovir, in a Lethal Monkeypox Virus Animal Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 2.58 million deaths worldwide with over 500,000 of those in the US, at the time of this writing.

Based on functional enrichment analysis, miR-26a-5p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-34a-5p were identified as regulators of mRNA targets involved in endothelial and inflammatory signaling pathways, as well as viral diseases. A miRNA/mRNA network, constructed based on proteinCprotein interactions of the miRNA targets and the inflammatory biomarkers characterized in the patients, revealed a close interconnection of these miRNAs in association to the endothelial activation/dysfunction. Reduced expression levels of selected miRNAs were observed in the lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients (n = 9) compared to the Controls (n = 10) (P < 0.01-0.0001). MiR-26a-5p and miR-29b-3p presented the best power to discriminate these groups (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.8286, and AUC = 0.8125, respectively). The correlation analysis of the miRNAs with inflammatory biomarkers in the COVID-19 patients was significant for miR-26a-5p [IL-6 (r(2) = 0.5414), and ICAM-1 (r(2) = 0.5624)], and miR-29b-3p [IL-4 (r(2) = 0.8332) and IL-8 (r(2) = 0.2654)]. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the relevance and the non-random involvement of miR-26a-5p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-34a-5p in endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the occurrence of severe lung injury and immunothrombosis.","output":"Deregulated miRNA expression is associated with endothelial dysfunction in post-mortem lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary hypertension is frequently underdiagnosed, and referral is delayed with subsequent impact on outcomes.

Arrest histories are linked to comprehensive longitudinal measurement on over 1,000 individuals originally from Chicago. Using group-based trajectory modeling, we investigated the magnitude and type of cohort differences in trajectories of arrest over the period 1995 to 2020. Our results show that trajectory group membership varies strongly by birth cohort. Membership in the nonoffender group is nearly 15 percentage points higher for cohorts born in the mid-1990s as compared to those born in the 1980s; conversely, older cohorts are more likely to be members of adolescent-limited and chronic-offender groups. Large cohort differences in trajectory group membership persist after controlling for a wide-ranging set of demographic characteristics and early-life risk factors that vary by cohort and that prior research has identified as important influences on crime. Not only does the effect of social change on cohort differentiation persist, but its magnitude is comparable toindeed larger thandifferences in trajectory group membership associated with varying levels of self-control or by whether individuals grew up in high-poverty households. These results suggest that changes in the broader social environment shared by members of the same birth cohort are as powerful in shaping their trajectory group membership as classic predictors identified in prior research, a finding that carries implications for crime-control policies that rely on prediction.","output":"Social change and cohort differences in group-based arrest trajectories over the last quarter-century"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Das Thema COVID-19 und neurologische Erkrankungen l?sst uns so schnell nicht los.

This study aims to highlight the long-term neurological sequelae in patients with COVID-19 disease. Methods: This long-term study was carried out in the COVID-19 unit of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan from July 2020 to July 2021. After obtaining informed consent, we enrolled 1000 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and were discharged. The participants were followed up after 30 and 90 days. Results: At the time of enrollment, there were 602 (60.2%) males and 398 (39.8%) females. The most common neurological symptom on 30-day follow-up was headache (8.8%), followed by insomnia. The most common neurological symptom on day 90 follow-up was insomnia (5.07%), followed by an altered sense of smell (3.3%). Conclusion: COVID-19 tends to produce a wide range of neurological symptoms, ranging from headache to anosmia to increased risk of stroke, that complicates clinical management. Potential neurologic effects and drug interactions have been reported secondary to the medications used to treat COVID-19. In light of the aforementioned facts, COVID-19 could potentially have a long-term effect on the brain.

Elevated levels of blood IL-6 had been identified as a one of the risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 disease. Anti-IL6 inhibitors are among the therapeutic armamentarium for preventing the fatal consequences of acute respiratory and multi organ failure in around 20% of the COVID-19 infected patients. At present, their use is prioritized to patients with severe interstitial pneumonia (Brescia-COVID Scale-COVID 2-3) with hyperinflammation as determined by the presence of elevated IL6 and/or d-dimer, or progressive d-dimer increase, in patients who otherwise are subsidiary to ICU admission. However, many uncertainties remain on the actual role of anti-IL6 inhibitors in this setting, and whether current use and timing is the right one. There is the hypothesis that the use of anti-IL6 inhibitors at an earlier state during the hyperinflammatory syndrome would be beneficial and may avoid progressing to ARDS. On the other hand, the standard of care has changed and nowadays the use of corticosteroids has become part of the SOC in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our limited experience suggests that better treatment outcomes can be achieved when combining IL6-inhibitors (e.g. sarilumab) with corticosteroids. The aim of the present study is to evaluate if an earlier therapeutic intervention with sarilumab plus SOC (including corticosteroids) may be more effective than current standard of care alone, in preventing progression to respiratory failure in COVID-19 infected patients with interstitial pneumonia. This study will also provide supportive evidence to that provided by currently ongoing studies on the efficacy and safety of sarilumab in this clinical context. TRIAL DESIGN: A phase two multi-center randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms (1:1 ratio). PARTICIPANTS: They will be hospitalized patients, of at least 18 years of age, with severe COVID-19 who have positive RT-PCR test and have radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates by imaging or rales/crackles on exam and SpO2  94% on room air that requires supplemental oxygen. Patients must present elevation of inflammatory parameters (IL-6 > 40 pg/mL or d-dimer >1.0 mcg/ml) or, alternatively, progressive worsening in at least two of these inflammatory parameters in the prior 24-48h: CRP, LDH, serum ferritin, lymphopenia, or d-dimer. Exclusion criteria: high oxygen requirements (including face mask with reservoir, non-invasive mechanical ventilation or high flow nasal cannula, or mechanical ventilation), admission to ICU, pregnancy or lactation, allergy or hypersensitivity to sarilumab or corticoesteroids, immunosuppressive antibody therapy within the past 5 months, AST/ALT values > 10 x ULN, neutropenia (< 0.5 x 109/L), severe thrombocytopenia (< 50 x 109/L), sepsis caused by an alternative pathogen, diverticulitis with risk of perforation or ongoing infectious dermatitis. The study will be conducted in several hospitals in Spain. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised to the experimental arm will receive sarilumab + methylprednisolone plus SOC for COVID-19. Patients included in the control arm will receive methylprednisolone plus SOC for COVID-19. Corticosteroids will be given to all patients at a 1mg/kg/d of methylprednisolone for at least 3 days. Clinical follow-up visits will be performed at 3, 5, and 15 days after treatment randomization. Patients in the control group (SOC group without sarilumab) progressing to Brescia- COVID 2-3 plus inflammatory markers, will be given the option to be rescued with sarilumab at the same doses and, in that case, be included in an open-label phase and be followed up for additional weeks (with visits at 3, 7 and 15 days after sarilumab rescue administration). Patients randomly assigned to sarilumab therapy at baseline progressing to Brescia-COVID 2-3 will be rescued according to local clinical practice protocols. A final follow-up visit will be conducted for all patients at day 29 from randomization, regardless of initial treatment assignment. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary end point is the proportion of patients progressing to either severe respiratory failure (Brescia-COVID 2), ICU admission, or death. RANDOMIZATION: Randomization codes were produced by means of the PROC PLAN of the SAS system, with a 1:1 assignment ratio, stratifying by centre and using blocks multiple of 2 elements. The randomization schedule will be managed through the eCRF in a concealed manner. BLINDING (MASKING): All study drugs will be administered as open label.

Measurements and Main Results The survey consisted of 5 subsections: (1) demographic data, (2) impact of COVID-19 pandemic on MIGS practice, (3) changes of practice during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (4) changes in the conduct of surgery and post-operative care. A frequency distribution table was used to summarize responses. A total of 119 out of 144 PSGE Fellows participated in the survey. Average age was 53 years old, majority practicing in the National Capital Region, and practicing for more than fifteen years. Nearly all respondents cancelled surgeries due to the pandemic. As of the time of the survey, only 41% and 68.1% of Fellows had returned to perform laparoscopy and hysteroscopy respectively. Most respondents noted that their hospital of practice provided protocols for elective surgery. Majority (71.4%) reported reduced surgical staff with 30.6% due to resignation. Clinical practice saw the shift from face-to-face consults to the use of telemedicine (74.8%). Face masks and shields, and PPE were the top three precautions taken in the clinics, while symptom assessment, temperature screening, and RT-PCR testing were the most common screening procedures prior to surgery. Respondents also preferred laparotomy over laparoscopy (64.7%). Most of the respondents reported availability of disposable equipment, use of face mask, eye protection, and half or full respirator mask in the operating room. Conclusion The findings show that the COVID-19 pandemic markedly disrupted clinical and surgical practice among Fellows across the country. Adaptation of several precautionary measures and screening procedures to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV 2 transmission to patients and healthcare workers were done.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Practice of MIGS in the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of the COMPLETE (International Acute Ischemic Stroke Registry With the Penumbra System Aspiration Including the 3D Revascularization Device) registry was to evaluate the generalizability of the safety and efficacy of the Penumbra System (Penumbra, Inc, Alameda) in a real-world setting. METHODS: COMPLETE was a global, prospective, postmarket, multicenter registry. Patients with large vessel occlusionCacute ischemic stroke who underwent mechanical thrombectomy using the Penumbra System with or without the 3D Revascularization Device as frontline approach were enrolled at 42 centers (29 United States, 13 Europe) from July 2018 to October 2019. Primary efficacy end points were successful postprocedure angiographic revascularization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b) and 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0C2). The primary safety end point was 90-day all-cause mortality. An imaging core lab determined modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scores, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores, clot location, and occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage at 24 hours. Independent medical reviewers adjudicated safety end points. RESULTS: Six hundred fifty patients were enrolled (median age 70 years, 54.0% female, 49.2% given intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator before thrombectomy). Rate of modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b to 3 postprocedure was 87.8% (95% CI, 85.3%C90.4%). First pass and postprocedure rates of modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2c to 3 were 41.5% and 66.2%, respectively. At 90 days, 55.8% (95% CI, 51.9%C59.7%) had modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2, and all-cause mortality was 15.5% (95% CI, 12.8%C18.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Using Penumbra System for frontline mechanical thrombectomy treatment of patients with large vessel occlusionCacute ischemic stroke in a real-world setting was associated with angiographic, clinical, and safety outcomes that were comparable to prior randomized clinical trials with stringent site and operator selection criteria.

In the present study, the role of sialic acids in serotype I feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) infections was studied in feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures. Treatment of cells with neuraminidase (NA) enhanced infection efficiency, showing that terminal sialic acid residues on the cell surface were not receptor determinants and even hampered efficient virus-receptor engagement. Knowing that NA treatment of coronaviruses can unmask viral sialic acid binding activity, replication of untreated and NA-treated viruses was compared, showing that NA treatment of the virus enhanced infectivity in untreated cells, but was detrimental in NA-treated cells. By using sialylated compounds as competitive inhibitors, it was demonstrated that sialyllactose (2,6--linked over 2,3--linked) notably reduced infectivity of NA-treated viruses, whereas bovine submaxillary mucin inhibited both treated and untreated viruses. In desialylated cells, however, viruses were less prone to competitive inhibition with sialylated compounds. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that FECV had a sialic acid binding capacity, which was partially masked by virus-associated sialic acids, and that attachment to sialylated compounds could facilitate enterocyte infections. However, sialic acid binding was not a prerequisite for the initiation of infection and virus-receptor engagement was even more efficient after desialylation of cells, indicating that FECV requires sialidases for efficient enterocyte infections.","output":"Role of sialic acids in feline enteric coronavirus infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 emerged from animals and is now easily transmitted between people.

The time of nociception occurrence was defined as when the signs of inadequate anaesthesia occurred. The median values of NPI, SPI, and ANI for 1 minute from the time of the sign of inadequate anaesthesia were determined as the value of each analgesic index that represents inadequate anaesthesia. The time of no nociception was determined as 2 minutes before the onset of skin incision, and the median value for 1 minute from that time was defined as the baseline value. In total, 81 patients were included in the analysis. NPI showed good performance in distinguishing inadequate anaesthesia during propofol-remifentanil based general anaesthesia.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients less than 21 of age meeting MIS-C criteria who presented to a tertiary care children's hospital from May 2020 to March 2021. Results: Seventy-eight patients diagnosed with MIS-C (average age 9.7 +/- 4.6 years, 57% male) were included in this study (60 Hispanic, 9 non-Hispanic White, 7 Black, and 1 American Indian). The most common presenting symptoms were nausea and vomiting (76%), abdominal pain (71%), appetite changes (69%), fatigue (64%), and conjunctivitis (63%). The average length of intensive care unit stay was 2.5 days while average total hospitalization was 7.3 days. Forty-nine patients (62%) underwent echocardiography. Of those evaluated, there was systolic dysfunction in 45% with an average ejection fraction of 48%, diastolic dysfunction in 14%, valvular disease in 53%, coronary involvement in 16%, and pericardial effusion in 22%. Electrocardiogram was completed on 37 patients (47%) which revealed heart block in 23% and arrhythmia in 3%. Troponin T was elevated in 32% and pro-BNP was elevated in 89%. Ninety-five percent of patients received immunomodulators during their hospitalization, while 94% received methylprednisolone, 59% received intravenous immunoglobulin, and 19% received Anakinra.

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) counts as the standard tool to measure virus concentrations. Simple methods for data analysis such as analysis of variance (ANOVA), however, are impaired due to non-normality of the resulting optical density (OD) values as well as unequal variances in different groups. METHODS: To understand the relationship between the OD values from an ELISA test and the virus concentration per sample, we used a large serial dilution and modelled its non-linear form using a five parameter logistic regression model. Furthermore, we examined if the quality of the model can be increased if one or several of the model parameters are defined beforehand. Subsequently, we used the inverse of the best model to estimate the virus concentration for every measured OD value. RESULTS: We show that the transformed data are essentially normally distributed but provide unequal variances per group. Thus, we propose a generalised least squares model which allows for unequal variances of the groups to analyse the transformed data. CONCLUSIONS: ANOVA requires normally distributed data as well as equal variances. Both requirements are not met with raw OD values from an ELISA test. A transformation with an inverse logistic function, however, gives the possibility to use linear models for data analysis of virus concentrations. We conclude that this method can be applied in every trial where virus concentrations of samples from different groups are to be compared via OD values from an ELISA test. To encourage researchers to use this method in their studies, we provide an R script for data transformation as well as the data from our trial.

OBJECTIVE: In this implementation research, a newly developed implementation program based on previous experience and scientific literature, is tested. The primary aim of this research is to assess the effectiveness of the implementation program. The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the factors that impede or facilitate the implementation of Cognitive Adaptation Training. METHODS: To test the effectiveness of the implementation program, a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing the implementation program to a single training program in four mental health institutions in The Netherlands. Focus groups, semistructured interviews, and questionnaires were used at multiple levels of service delivery (service user, professional, team, organization) to identify factors that may hamper or facilitate implementation. The RE-AIM framework was applied to measure the implementation effectiveness. Following this framework, the primary outcomes were Reach, Intervention Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. These are assessed before, during, and after implementation.

To date, although many studies have reported on the computed tomography (CT) manifestations of COVID-19, the vascular enlargement sign (VES) of COVID-19 has not been deeply examined, with the few available studies reporting an inconsistent prevalence. We thus performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the best available studies to estimate the prevalence and identify the underlying differential diagnostic value of VES. Methods We searched nine English and Chinese language databases up to April 23, 2020. Studies that evaluated CT features of COVID-19 patients and reported VES, with or without comparison with other pneumonia were included. The methodologic quality was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Meta-analyses with random effects models were performed to calculate the aggregate prevalence and pooled odds ratios (ORs) of VES. We also conducted meta-regression and subgroup analyses to analyze heterogeneity. Results VES findings from a total of 1969 patients were summarized and pooled across 22 studies. Our analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of VES among COVID-19 patients was 69.37% [95% confidence interval (CI): 57.40-79.20%]. Compared with non-COVID-19 patients, VES manifestation was more frequently observed in confirmed COVID-19 patients (OR =6.43, 95% CI: 3.39-12.22). Studies that explicitly defined distribution of VES in the lesion area demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence (P=0.03). Subgroup analyses also revealed a relatively higher VES rate in studies with a sample size larger than 50, but the difference was not statistically significant. No significant difference in VES rates was found between different countries (China/Italy), regions (Hubei/outside Hubei), average age groups (over/less than 50-year-old), or slice thicknesses of CT scan. Extensive heterogeneity was identified across most estimates (I2>80%). Some of the variations (R2=19.73%) could be explained by VES distribution, and sample size. No significant publication bias was seen (P=0.29). Conclusions VES on thoracic CT was found in almost two-thirds of COVID-19 patients, and was more prevalent compared with that of the non-COVID-19 patients, supporting a promising role for VES in identifying pneumonia caused by coronavirus.","output":"Pulmonary vascular enlargement on thoracic CT for diagnosis and differential diagnosis of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative factor in the COVID-19 pandemic that infected more than 3 million people and the number of deaths continues to rise.

Comprising 44 supply and demand indicators of the NTE, the index was composed of an overall index and six major sub-indices that measured the vitality of six typical NTE subsectors, including catering, shopping, recreation, accommodation, touring, and fitness. The NTEVI was calculated using a unique multi-source dataset based on hourly online transaction data from a leading Chinese online-to-offline service platform, monthly night-time electricity consumption data, and official statistics from 2019 to 2020. Robustness and sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure high credibility of the index results. The findings of this study suggested that the NTEVI was highly and significantly correlated with night light indices, economic indicators, and tourism demand measures. By identifying regional and temporal differences across several service sectors over time at the county, city, and provincial levels, the NTEVI serves as a powerful numerical and visual tool: it offers key information to guide policy formulation, resource allocation, and policy evaluation.

Owing to their success in computer vision tasks, the state-of-the-art Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) or U-Net based models have often been employed in many recent studies for automatic tumor segmentation to learn numerous weight-shared convolutional kernels and extract various semantic features. However, the correlation between different tumor regions in feature maps cannot be easily captured due to the lack of contextual dependencies, which in turn limits the representative capability of the adopted models and thus affects the accuracy of tumor segmentation results. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework for segmentation of tumors in liver CT scans, which can explicitly extract multi-scale fine-grained contextual information by adaptively aggregating local features with their global dependencies. The proposed multi-scale framework features a light model with a very few additional parameters, and also its visualization capability significantly boosts networks interpretability.

Our project plan was upended by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-but we used the opportunity to conduct focus groups during the pandemic that, compared with focus groups conducted before the pandemic, provide an important portrait of public perceptions of serious illness care that can be used to design for greater public engagement. Our findings can be summarized in three observations. First, misunderstanding of ACP, PC, and hospice is wide ranging and deep. Second, COVID-19 evokes its own brand of confusion and ambivalence that is distinct from other serious illnesses. And third, distrust of the health care system has become the new normal. Despite these findings, our focus group participants strongly endorsed five messaging principles (1) talk up the benefits, (2) present choices for every step, (3) use stories that are positive and aspirational, (4) invite dialogue-more than once, and (5) invoke a new team-of people who matter, clinicians, medical institutions, and community organizations who are ready to help.

In this study, we utilized comprehensive satellite, ground-level observations, and source-oriented chemical transport modeling to investigate the O$_3$ variations during the COVID-19 in China. Here we found that the O$_3$ formation regime shifted from a VOC-limited regime to a NOx-limited regime due to the lower NOx during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, instead of these changes of the O$_3$ formation region, the significant elevated O$_3$ in the North China Plain (40%) and Yangtze River Delta (35%) were mainly attributed to the enhanced atmospheric oxidant capacity (AOC) in these regions, which was different from previous studies.

This difference persists even after balancing on a number of covariates including: demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and method of oxygenation, with an amplified mortality rate of 39% (215 of 555) for unfractionated heparin vs. 23% (119 of 522) for enoxaparin, presenting a risk ratio of 1.70 (95% C.I.: [1.40, 2.05]; p-value: 2.5e-7).

Chief among them is that the trees describing the ancestral lineages of each individual gene-the gene trees-often differ from the species tree. The multispecies coalescent is commonly used to model this gene tree discordance, at least when it is believed to arise from incomplete lineage sorting, a population-genetic effect. Another significant challenge in this area is that molecular sequences associated to each gene typically provide limited information about the gene trees themselves. While the modeling of sequence evolution by single-site substitutions is well-studied, few species tree reconstruction methods with theoretical guarantees actually address this latter issue. Instead, a standard-but unsatisfactory-assumption is that gene trees are perfectly reconstructed before being fed into a so-called summary method. Hence much remains to be done in the development of inference methodologies that rigorously account for gene tree estimation error-or completely avoid gene tree estimation in the first place. In previous work, a data requirement trade-off was derived between the number of loci m needed for an accurate reconstruction and the length of the locus sequences k. It was shown that to reconstruct an internal branch of length f, one needs m to be of the order of [Formula: see text]. That previous result was obtained under the restrictive assumption that mutation rates as well as population sizes are constant across the species phylogeny. Here we further generalize this result beyond this assumption. Our main contribution is a novel reduction to the molecular clock case under the multispecies coalescent, which we refer to as a stochastic Farris transform. As a corollary, we also obtain a new identifiability result of independent interest: for any species tree with [Formula: see text] species, the rooted topology of the species tree can be identified from the distribution of its unrooted weighted gene trees even in the absence of a molecular clock.","output":"A stochastic Farris transform for genetic data under the multispecies coalescent with applications to data requirements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the course of the year 2020, the global scientific community dedicated considerable effort to understanding COVID-19. In this review, we discuss some of the findings accumulated between the onset of the pandemic and the end of 2020, and argue that although COVID-19 is clearly a biological disease tied to a specific virus, the cultureCmind relation at the heart of cultural psychology is nonetheless essential to understanding the pandemic. Striking differences have been observed in terms of relative mortality, transmission rates, behavioral responses, official policies, compliance with authorities, and even the extent to which beliefs about COVID-19 have been politicized across different societies and groups. Moreover, many minority groups have very different experiences of the pandemic relative to dominant groups, notably through existing health inequities as well as discrimination and marginalization, which we believe calls for a better integration of political and socioeconomic factors into cultural psychology and into the narrative of health and illness in psychological science more broadly. Finally, individual differences in, for example, intolerance of uncertainty, optimism, conspiratorial thinking, or collectivist orientation are influenced by cultural context, with implications for behaviors that are relevant to the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as mask-wearing and social distancing. The interplay between cultural context and the experience and expression of mental disorders continues to be documented by cultural-clinical psychology; the current work extends this thinking to infectious disease, with special attention to diseases spread by social contact and fought at least in part through social interventions. We will discuss cultural influences on the transmission, course, and outcome of COVID-19 at three levels: (1) cross-society differences; (2) within-society communities and intergroup relations; and (3) individual differences shaped by cultural context.

METHODS: We used data from a cross-sectional study of 604 Asian American and 844 Black American adults aged &#8805;18 in the United States recruited from 5 US cities from May 21 through July 15, 2020. Multivariable linear regression models examined levels of depression and anxiety by self-reported vicarious racism and vigilance. RESULTS: Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, among both Asian and Black Americans, greater self-reported vicarious racism was associated with more symptoms of depression (Asian: ? = 1.92 [95% CI, 0.97-2.87]; Black: ? = 1.72 [95% CI, 0.95-2.49]) and anxiety (Asian: ? = 2.40 [95% CI, 1.48-3.32]; Black: ? = 1.98 [95% CI, 1.17-2.78]).

Endocytic pathways, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CavME), play an important role for CoVs to penetrate the cell membrane barrier. In this study, a novel CoV entry manner is unraveled in which clathrin and caveolae can cooperatively mediate endocytosis of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV). Using multicolor live-cell imaging, the dynamics of the fluorescently labeled clathrin structures, caveolae structures, and PEDV were dissected. During CavME of PEDV, we found that clathrin structures can fuse with caveolae near the cell plasma membrane, and the average time of PEDV penetrating the cell membrane was within a??3 min, exhibiting a rapid course of PEDV entry. Moreover, based on the dynamic recruitment of clathrin and caveolae structures and viral motility, the direct evidence also shows that about 20% of PEDVs can undergo an abortive entry via CME and CavME. Additionally, the dynamic trafficking of PEDV from clathrin and caveolae structures to early endosomes, and from early endosomes to late endosomes, and viral fusion were directly dissected, and PEDV fusion mainly occurred in late endosomes within a??6.8 min after the transport of PEDV to late endosomes. Collectively, this work systematically unravels the early steps of PEDV infection, which expands our understanding of the mechanism of CoV infection.IMPORTANCE Emerging and re-emerging coronaviruses cause serious human and animal epidemics worldwide.

The botanical plant extract Orthoquin(TM) is a powerful photosensitizer with antimicrobial properties. Here we report that Orthoquin also has antiviral properties. Photoactivated Orthoquin inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection of target cells in a dose-dependent manner across a broad range of sub-cytotoxic concentrations. HSV inactivation required direct contact between Orthoquin and the inoculum, whereas pre-treatment of target cells had no effect. Orthoquin did not cause appreciable damage to viral capsids or premature release of viral genomes, as measured by qPCR for the HSV-1 genome. By contrast, immunoblotting for HSV-1 antigens in purified virion preparations suggested that higher doses of Orthoquin had a physical impact on certain HSV-1 proteins that altered protein mobility or antigen detection. Orthoquin PDI also inhibited the non-enveloped adenovirus (AdV) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Orthoquin-mediated inhibition of the enveloped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was light-independent. Together, these findings suggest that the broad antiviral effects of Orthoquin-mediated PDI may stem from damage to viral attachment proteins.","output":"Photodynamic Inactivation of Herpes Simplex Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As countries begin to ease the lockdown measures instituted to control the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of a resurgence of the pandemic, and early reports of this are already emerging from some countries. Unlike many other countries, the UK started easing lockdown in England when levels of community transmission were still high, and this could have a major impact on case numbers and deaths. However thus far, the likely impacts of easing restrictions at this point in the pandemic have not been quantified. Using a Bayesian model, we assessed the potential impacts of successive lockdown easing measures in England, focussing on scenarios where the reproductive number (R) remains <1 in line with the UK governments stated aim. Methods: We developed a Bayesian model to infer incident cases and R in England, from incident death data from the Office of National Statistics. We then used this to forecast excess cases and deaths in multiple plausible scenarios in which R increases at one or more time points, compared to a baseline scenario where R remains unchanged by the easing of lockdown. Findings: The model inferred an R of 0.752 on the 13th May when England first started easing lockdown. In the most conservative scenario where R increases to 0.80 as lockdown was eased further on 1st June and then remained constant, the model predicts an excess 257 (95% 108-492) deaths and 26,447 (95% CI 11,105-50,549) cumulative cases over 90 days. In the scenario with maximal increases in R (but staying <1) with successive easing of lockdown, the model predicts 3,174 (95% 1,334-6,060) excess cumulative deaths and 421,310 (95% 177,012-804,811) excess cases. Results: When levels of transmission are high, even small changes in R with easing of lockdown can have significant impacts on expected cases and deaths, even if R remains <1. This will have a major impact on population health, tracing systems and health care services in England. Following an elimination strategy rather than one of maintenance of R below 1 would substantially mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic within England. This study provides urgently needed information for developing public health policy for the next stages of the pandemic.","output":"Modelling the impact of lockdown easing measures on cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic is the cause of several disasters on human health and livelihoods in many countries around the globe.

The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount. We find that online voter registration systems in some states have vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to alter or effectively prevent a voter's registration. We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence in U.S. elections infrastructure, thereby undermining the very purpose of these systems.","output":"Security Survey and Analysis of Vote-by-Mail Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) is a crucial target for treating coronavirus diseases including COVID-19.

Herein, a practical strategy via integrating bioactivity-guided fractionation and purification, mass spectrometry-based peptide profiling and time-dependent biochemical assay, was applied to identify the crucial constituents in AGE and to uncover their inhibitory mechanisms. The results demonstrated that the flavonoid-rich fractions (10-17.5 min) displayed strong SARS-CoV-2-3CL(pro) inhibitory activities, while the constituents in these fractions were isolated and their SARS-CoV-2-3CL(pro) inhibitory activities were investigated. Among all isolated flavonoids, dihydromyricetin, isodihydromyricetin and myricetin strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) in a time-dependent manner.

However, most studies to date have not examined mental health symptoms between individuals with insomnia, either pre-existing or developing post-pandemic, compared to good sleepers. This study examined differences in stress, anxiety, and depression between individuals with pre-existing insomnia symptoms, post-pandemic insomnia symptoms and no insomnia symptoms, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was completed by 2724 participants from 67 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perceived stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms were compared between individuals with post-pandemic insomnia symptoms (n=1007), pre-existing insomnia symptoms (n=804), and no insomnia symptoms (n=913). RESULTS Post-pandemic insomnia symptoms were associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression than pre-existing or no insomnia symptoms (p's<.001). Pre-existing insomnia symptoms were also associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression than no insomnia symptoms (p's<.001). Individuals who met likely criteria for Acute Insomnia also reported higher stress, anxiety and depression than those with Insomnia Disorder (p's<.001). Across all groups, individuals reporting a previous mental health diagnosis had worse stress, anxiety and depression than those without a previous mental health diagnosis (p's<.001). Lastly, individuals from South Africa reported higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression than other countries (p's<.01).

Also, the hyper-inflammatory response that is triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrom-Covid-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was believed to play an essential role in disease severity and adverse clinical course. For that reason, the classical inflammatory markers were proposed as a possible indicator for COVID-19 severity. However, an extensive analysis of the predictive value of inflammatory biomarkers in large patients cohorts is still limited and critically needed. In this study we investigated the predictive value of the classical inflammatory biomarkers in a patient cohort consists of 541 COVID-19 patients admitted to Al Kuwait Hospital, Dubai, UAE. A detailed analysis of the association between the essential inflammatory markers and clinical characteristics as well as clinical outcome of the patients were made. In addition, the correlation between those markers and a wide range of laboratory biomarkers and incidence of acute organs injury were investigated. Our results showed a significant elevation of many inflammatory markers including white cell count (WBC) count, neutrophils count, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-Dimer, ferritin, procalcitonin (PCT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in patients with more severe illness. Also, our results highlighted that higher levels of those markers can predict worse patient outcome including the need of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, multiple organs dysfunction as well as death. In addition, Our results showed that the presence of lymphopenia and lower absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) at the time of admission were associated with severe to critical COVID-19 illness (P<0.0001), presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (P<0.0001) and the need for ventilation and ICU admission., Moreover, our results showed a strong association between lower ALC count and multiple organs dysfunction and patients death (P<0.0001). In conclusion, our results highlighted the possible use of classical inflammatory biomarkers at time of admission as a potential predictive marker for more severe clinical course in COVID-19 patients that might need more aggressive therapeutic approach including the need of ventilators and ICU admission. The presence of such predictive markers might improve patients stratification and help in the direction of the available resources to patients in need, which in turn help in improving our response to the disease pandemic.","output":"The inflammatory biomarkers profile of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and its association with patients outcome: A single centered study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Papain-like protease (PLpro) from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus is one of the two proteases involved in the proteolytic processing of the virion polyproteins.

Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire along with a validated psychometric tool, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS21) scale. The metrics and scores of symptoms and their severity were created and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of potential covariates with outcome variables. Results: The prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress were 14%, 7% and 5% respectively. Participants from Bagmati province reported higher level of anxiety (OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.42 10.59), while stress (OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.09 21.29) and depressive symptoms (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.10 10.35) observed higher among the participants in Province 1.

Meanwhile, childhood obesity has dramatically increased, initially in high-income populations and subsequently in the more economically vulnerable. These trends are related to significant changes in diet and external factors, including new environmental threats. SUMMARY Obesity rates first increased in older children, then gradually in infants. And in the next couple of years, there will be more overweight and obese than moderately or severely underweight children in the world. The changes in childhood nutritional landscape are a result of poor diets. Today, almost 50% of the world's population consumes either too many or too few calories. Dietary disparities between countries result in disparities of under- and overnutrition and impact the global health landscape. Most children with obesity, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies live in lower income countries and in lower income families within any country. High energy-low nutrient diets are contributing to the increase in non-communicable diseases, which will manifest later in this generation of children. In 1990, child wasting was the #1 leading risk factor for mortality for all ages, and high BMI was #16; today, they are #11 and #5, respectively.

METHODS: Thirty-six young adult men performed two 30-min sessions of physical exercise in random order (EXG and TC). The same exercise protocol was used for each session; however, the TC session was guided by an exercise science professional. State anxiety was assessed before and immediately after each session. Heart rate was monitored during the sessions. Enjoyment and affective valence were assessed immediately after the sessions. In addition, the number of repetitions performed was recorded. RESULTS: There was no significant interaction between sessions (EXG vs. TC) and time (pre vs. post-session) (p = 0.102), no significant effect of session (p = 0.587), and no significant effect of time (p = 0.121). Participants presented a higher mean heart rate (+ 3.5%, p = 0.020) and number of repetitions performed (+ 43.7%, p < 0.001) in the TC session compared with the EXG session. There was no difference in enjoyment (p = 0.804) and affective (p = 0.195) valence between the EXG and TC sessions. CONCLUSION: The EXG and TC sessions did not reduce state anxiety levels.

It shares >50% sequence similarity with the human influenza C virus (HICV).

Also, differential diagnosis between zoonotic human influenza C virus and the two clades of IDV are important to assess the zoonotic potential of IDV. We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on two different epitopes HEF and NP and four peptides, and fluorescent focus neutralization assay to differentiate between IDV bovine and swine clades. Calf sera were obtained, and bovine samples underwent surveillance. Our results highlight the importance of position 215 with 212 in determining the heterogeneity between the two lineages. We needed IFA and FFN for tissue cultureCbased analysis and a BSL2 facility for analyzing virus interactions. Unfortunately, these are not available in many veterinary centers. Hence, our second aim was to develop an iELISA using specific epitopes to detect two lineages of IDVs simultaneously. Epitope-iELISA accurately detects neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies against the IDV in non-BSL2 laboratories and veterinary clinics and is cost-effective and sensitive. To differentiate between IDVs and HICVs, whole antigen blocking, polypeptides, and single-peptide ELISAs were developed. A panel of ferret sera against both viruses was used. Results suggested that both IDV and ICV had a common ancestor, and IDV poses a zoonotic risk to individuals with prior or current exposure to cattle. IDV peptides IANAGVK (286C292 aa), KTDSGR (423C428 aa), and RTLTPAT (448C455 aa) could differentiate between the two viruses, whereas peptide AESSVNPGAKPQV (203C215 aa) detected the presence of IDV in human sera but could not deny that it could be ICV, because the only two conserved influenza C peptides shared 52% sequence similarity with IDV and cross-reacted with IDV.

From a clinical perspective, the majority of applications use exosomes as biomarkers of disease. A new approach uses exosomes as biologically active carriers to provide a platform for the enhanced delivery of cargo in vivo.

Opioid tapering (slow dose reduction and/or discontinuation), the logical solution, also appears to be ineffective among many patients on LTOT as it often leads to even worse pain control and function, leaving the patients and providers managing LTOT in a clinical conundrum with little treatment choices. Complex persistent opioid dependence (CPOD) was recently offered as a heuristic to explain this clinical conundrum exemplified by the ineffectiveness of both LTOT and opioid tapering. This manuscript provides a detailed description of the neurobehavioral underpinnings of CPOD, explaining how long-term opioid use can lead to more pain even while experiencing relief with each opioid dose. CPOD is characterized by the allostatic opponent mechanisms of neuroadaptations related to the progression of opioid dependence and tolerance involving nociceptive/anti-nociceptive brain systems causing opioid-induced hyperalgesia and reward/anti-reward systems causing hyperkatefia or suffering that induces pain experience through the cognitive/emotional component of pain mechanisms. \\"Opioid Induced Chronic Pain syndrome\\" (OICP) is offered as an alternate clinical diagnostic term instead of CPOD that has several limitations as a diagnosis term including poor patient acceptance due to stigma towards addiction and clinical confounding with opioid use disorder, a related but separate clinical entity.

Technology is particularly useful for museums to share their collections with audiences and transcend geographical boundaries, and it also allows these institutions to reposition themselves as relevant within the ongoing cultural heritage dialogue and context. However, it is debatable whether online and digital offerings classify as museums. Even if there is no consensus on the textbook definition of museum, pinpointing common traits will help establish their evolution and role for current and future generations.

Limited understanding of complications in cancer progression, its development system, and their interactions are major restrictions towards the progress of optimal and effective treatment strategies. The system-level approach has been designed to explore genetic complexity of the disease and to identify novel oral cancer related genes to detect genomic alterations at molecular level, through cDNA differential analysis. We analyzed 21 oral cancer-related cDNA datasets and listed 30 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among 30, we found 6 significant DEGs including CYP1A1, CYP1B1, ADCY2, C7, SERPINB5, and ANAPC13 and studied their functional role in OC. Our genomic and interactive analysis showed significant enrichment of xenobiotics metabolism, p53 signaling pathway and microRNA pathways, towards OC progression and development. We used human proteomic data for post-translational modifications to interpret disease mutations and inter-individual genetic variations. The mutational analysis revealed the sequence predicted disordered region of 14%, 12.5%, 10.5% for ADCY2, CYP1B1, and C7 respectively. The MiRNA target prediction showed functional molecular annotation including specific miRNA-targets hsa-miR-4282, hsa-miR-2052, hsa-miR-216a-3p, for CYP1B1, C7, and ADCY2 respectively associated with oral cancer. We constructed the system level network and found important gene signatures. The drug-gene interaction of OC source genes with seven FDA approved OC drugs help to design or identify new drug target or establishing novel biomedical linkages regarding disease pathophysiology. This investigation demonstrates the importance of system genetics for identifying 6 OC genes (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, ADCY2, C7, SERPINB5, and ANAPC13) as potential drugs targets.

Thus, patients awaiting a SOT or HSCT face the dilemma of choosing between a life-saving treatment that presents a significant threat of COVID-19 and the risk of waitlist dropout, progression of disease, or mortality. The lack of established literature on COVID-19 complicates the issue as patients, particularly those with inadequate health literacy, may not have the resources needed to navigate these decisions. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a standardized phone survey of patients awaiting SOT or HSCT to assess the prevalence of inadequate health literacy and attitudes toward transplant during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Seventy-one patients completed the survey, with a response rate of 84.5%. Regardless of health literacy, most waitlisted candidates recognized that the current pandemic is a serious situation affecting their care and that COVID-19 poses a significant risk to their health. Despite the increased risks, most patients reported they would choose immediate transplantation if there was no foreseeable end to the pandemic, and especially if the medical urgency did not permit further delay. There were no differences in responses across the patient waitlist groups for heart, kidney, liver, and stem cell transplant. CONCLUSIONS These findings can help transplant centers decide how transplantation services should proceed during this pandemic and can be used to educate patients and guide discussions about informed consent for transplant during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Waitlisted Transplant Candidates' Attitudes and Concerns Toward Transplantation During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Community lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic may influence preterm birth rates, but mechanisms are unclear.

While e-pharmacy businesses were initially the preserve of high-income countries, in the past decade they have been growing rapidly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Public health concerns associated with e-pharmacy include the sale of prescription-only medicines without a prescription and the sale of substandard and falsified medicines. There are also non-health-related risks such as consumer fraud and lack of data privacy. However, e-pharmacy may also have the potential to improve access to medicines. Drawing on existing literature and a set of key informant interviews in Kenya, Nigeria and India, we examine the e-pharmacy regulatory systems in LMICs. None of the study countries had yet enacted a regulatory framework specific to e-pharmacy. Key regulatory challenges included the lack of consensus on regulatory models, lack of regulatory capacity, regulating sales across borders and risks of over-regulation. However, e-pharmacy also presents opportunities to enhance medicine regulation-through consolidation in the sector, and the traceability and transparency that online records offer. The regulatory process needs to be adapted to keep pace with this dynamic landscape and exploit these possibilities. This will require exploration of a range of innovative regulatory options, collaboration with larger, more compliant businesses, and engagement with global regulatory bodies.

This work proposes to treat automatic image meme generation as a translation process, and further present an end to end neural and probabilistic approach to generate an image-based meme for any given sentence using an encoder-decoder architecture. For a given input sentence, an image meme is generated by combining a meme template image and a text caption where the meme template image is selected from a set of popular candidates using a selection module, and the meme caption is generated by an encoder-decoder model. An encoder is used to map the selected meme template and the input sentence into a meme embedding and a decoder is used to decode the meme caption from the meme embedding. The generated natural language meme caption is conditioned on the input sentence and the selected meme template. The model learns the dependencies between the meme captions and the meme template images and generates new memes using the learned dependencies. The quality of the generated captions and the generated memes is evaluated through both automated and human evaluation.

METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted among 573 rural households in Guilan Province in the north of Iran. The food insecurity status of the households was measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. Data on the demographic characteristics of the households and their depression status were collected by interviewing the heads of the households. The socioeconomic status index of the households was constructed using factor analysis, and a multivariate ordinal logistic regression model was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio of the independent predictors of food insecurity. RESULTS The results indicated that approximately half of the households (50.8%) had experienced mild (43.2%), moderate (6.5%) or severe (1.1%) food insecurity. The multivariate model showed that sex, age, depression status of the head of the household and having a patient with a chronic condition in the household were independently associated with food security status. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that food insecurity was highly prevalent among rural households in the north of Iran.

This viral infection (COVID-19) is not the only cause of deaths in this pandemic. A usual complication of viral infections is a secondary superimposed bacterial infection or a superinfection. Based on limited published data, the relatively high incidence of severe infection and mortality in COVID-19 patients is attributed to these infections. It is reasonable to anticipate that nearly half of the patients who have died from COVID-19 had superinfection. Patients who have severe form of the disease and those requiring prolonged stay in intensive care units (ICUs) are more prone to developing super added infection by nosocomial pathogens. The most common type of infection observed among COVID-19 patients is ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), followed by bacteremia with sepsis and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to keep these infections at bay which is promoting antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In developing countries like India, where there is well-established high burden of multidrug-resistant organisms in hospital settings, superinfections in COVID-19 patients can pose a biggest challenge in the treatment leading to increase mortality.

Up to 50% of these cases have been diagnosed to be malignant by cytological/histological results. Ultrasonography (US) and fine-needle aspiration cytology are recommended for thyroid nodules with high FDG uptake (hypermetabolism) that are 1 cm or greater in size. It is important to accurately determine whether a suspicious hypermetabolic TI is malignant or benign. AIM: To distinguish malignant hypermetabolic TIs from benign disease by analyzing F-18 FDG PET-CT parameters and to identify a cut-off value. METHODS: Totally, 12761 images of patients who underwent F-18 FDG PET-CT for non-thyroid purposes at our hospital between January 2016 and December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, and 339 patients [185 men (mean age: 68  11.2) and 154 women (mean age: 63  15.0)] were found to have abnormal, either focal or diffuse, thyroid FDG uptake. After a thorough review of their medical records, US, and cytological/histological reports, 46 eligible patients with focal hypermetabolic TI were included in this study. The TIs were categorized as malignant and benign according to the cytological/histological reports, and four PET parameters [standardized uptake value (SUV)(max), SUV(peak), SUV(mean), and metabolic tumor volume (MTV)] were measured on FDG PET-CT. Total lesion glycolysis (TLG) was calculated by multiplying the SUV(mean )by MTV. Both parametric and non-parametric methods were used to compare the five parameters between malignant and benign lesions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to identify a cut-off value. RESULTS: Each of the 46 patients [12 men (26.1%; mean age: 62  13.1 years) and 34 women (73.9%; mean age: 60  12.0 years)] with focal hypermetabolic TIs had one focal hypermetabolic TI. Among them, 26 (56.5%) were malignant and 20 (43.5%) were benign. SUV(max), SUV(peak), SUV(mean), and TLG were all higher in malignant lesions than benign ones, but the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.012) only for SUV(max). There was a positive linear correlation (r = 0.339) between SUV(max) and the diagnosis of malignancy. ROC curve analysis for SUV(max) revealed an area under the curve of 0.702 (P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.550-0.855) and SUV(max) cut-off of 8.5 with a sensitivity of 0.615 and a specificity of 0.789. CONCLUSION: More than half of focal hypermetabolic TIs on F-18 FDG PET-CT were revealed as malignant lesions, and SUV(max) was the best parameter for discriminating between malignant and benign disease. Unexpected focal hypermetabolic TIs with the SUV(max) above the cut-off value of 8.5 may have a greater than 70% chance of malignancy; therefore, further active assessment is required.","output":"Characterization of focal hypermetabolic thyroid incidentaloma: An analysis with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography parameters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research is a contribution to the sustainable assessment of industrial heritage.

CC motive chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), a chemokine originally described as a chemotactic agent for monocytes, is involved in inflammation, coagulation activation and neoangiogenesis. We investigated the association of CCL2 levels with coagulation derangement and respiratory impairment in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 281 patients admitted to two hospitals in Italy with COVID-19. Among them, CCL2 values were compared in different groups (identified according to D-dimer levels and the lowest PaO2/FiO2 recorded during hospital stay, P/Fnadir) by Jonckheere-Terpstra tests; linear regression analysis was used to analyse the relationship between CCL2 and P/Fnadir. We performed Mann-Whitney test and Kaplan-Meier curves to investigate the role of CCL2 according to different clinical outcomes (survival and endotracheal intubation [ETI]). RESULTS: CCL2 levels were progressively higher in patients with increasing D-dimer levels and with worse gas exchange impairment; there was a statistically significant linear correlation between log CCL2 and log P/Fnadir. CCL2 levels were significantly higher in patients with unfavourable clinical outcomes; Kaplan-Meier curves for the composite outcome death and/or need for ETI showed a significantly worse prognosis for patients with higher (> median) CCL2 levels. CONCLUSIONS: CCL2 correlates with both indices of activation of the coagulation cascade and respiratory impairment severity, which are likely closely related in COVID-19 pathology, thus suggesting that CCL2 could be involved in the thromboinflammatory events characterizing this disease.","output":"C-C motive chemokine ligand 2 and thromboinflammation in COVID-19-associated pneumonia: A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess primary care physicians satisfaction towards initiation of phone consultation during COVID-19 pandemic management in Qatar and to identify the factors associated with dis/satisfaction.

STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Prospective and retrospective studies, case reports and case series. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients assessed for cardiac manifestations after COVID-19 recovery. EXPOSURE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODS: Systematic review. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies (fifteen prospective cohort, seven case reports, five cross-sectional, four case series, three retrospective cohort and one ambidirectional cohort) evaluating cardiac sequelae in 52609 patients were included. Twenty-nine studies utilized objective cardiac assessments, mostly cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in sixteen studies, echocardiography in fifteen, electrocardiography (ECG) in sixteen and cardiac biomarkers in eighteen. Most studies had a fair risk of bias. The median time from diagnosis/recovery to cardiac assessment was 48 days (1-180). Common short-term cardiac abnormalities (<3 months) included increased T1 (proportion: 30%), T2 (16%), pericardial effusion (15%) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE, 11%) on CMR, with symptoms such as chest pain (25%) and dyspnea (36%). In the medium term (3-6 months), common changes included reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain (30%) and LGE (10%) on CMR, diastolic dysfunction (40%) on echocardiography and elevated NT-proBNP (18%).

In these studies, was found that the vaccines led to more than 90% reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 disease. However, there is scarce evidence of the efficacy of these vaccines in real-world scenarios. A few studies have looked at vaccinated cohorts such as health care workers in whom the vaccines had an efficacy similar to the RCTs. In a study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, it was found that mortality in fully vaccinated patients was 12.5% as compared to 31.5% in the unvaccinated cohort. Added-value of this studyThis cohort of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was studied during the peak of the second wave of COVID-19 in India during which the delta variant of concern was the predominant infecting strain and had 26% patients who were partially vaccinated and 71.4% who were unvaccinated. Only 3% of the patients were fully vaccinated and developed a breakthrough infection. At the time of presentation, 13% of the individuals with breakthrough infection and 48{middle dot}5% in the non-vaccinated group were hypoxic. Inflammatory markers were significantly lower in the completely vaccinated patients with breakthrough infection. The need for use of steroids and anti-viral agents such as remdesivir was also significantly low in the breakthrough infection group. A significantly less proportion of the individuals with breakthrough infection required oxygen supplementation or ventilatory support. Very few deteriorated or progressed to critical illness during their hospital stay. Only 3 individuals (5.7%) out of the 53 who developed breakthrough infection succumbed to illness while case fatality rates were significantly higher in the unvaccinated (22.8%) and partially vaccinated (19.5%) groups. Propensity score weighted multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed lower odds of developing hypoxia, critical illness or death in those who were completely vaccinated. Implications of all the available evidenceThe real-world effectiveness of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 seems to be similar to the randomized controlled trials. The vaccines are very effective in reducing the incidence of severe COVID-19, hypoxia, critical illness and death. The reduced need for oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation and the requirement of corticosteroids or other expensive medications such as anti-viral drugs could go a long way in redistributing scarce health care resources. All nations must move forward and vaccinate the citizens, as the current evidence suggests that prevention is better than cure.","output":"The effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in preventing severe illness and death- real-world data from a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Diagnosis and treatment of influenza patients are often provided across several medical specialties. We compared patient outcomes at an infectious diseases (ID), a rheumatology (Rheu) and a pulmonology (Pul) department. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this prospective observational multicenter study we included all influenza positive adults who were hospitalized and treated at flu isolation wards in three hospitals in Vienna during the season 2018/2019. RESULTS A total of 490 patients (49% female) with a median age of 73 years (interquartile range [IQR] 61-82) were included. No differences regarding age, sex and most underlying diseases were present at admission. Frequencies of the most common complications differed: acute kidney failure (ID 12.7%, Rheu 21.2%, Pulm 37.1%, p < 0.001), acute heart failure (ID 4.3%, Rheu 17.1%, Pulm 14.4%, p < 0.001) and respiratory insufficiency (ID 45.1%, Rheu 41.5%, Pulm 56.3%, p = 0.030). Oseltamivir prescription was lowest at the pulmonology flu ward (ID 79.6%, Rheu 90.5%, Pulm 61.7%, p < 0.001). In total 176 patients (35.9%) developed pneumonia. Antibiotic selection varied between the departments: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (ID 28.9%, Rheu 63.8%, Pulm 5.9%, p < 0.001), cefuroxime (ID 28.9%, Rheu 1.3%, Pulm 0%, p < 0.001), 3rd generation cephalosporins (ID 4.4%, Rheu 5%, Pulm 72.5%, p < 0.001), doxycycline (ID 17.8%, Rheu 0%, Pulm 0%, p < 0.001). The median length of stay was significantly different between wards: ID 6 days (IQR 5-8), Rheu 6 days (IQR 5-7) and Pulm 7 days (IQR 5-9.5, p = 0.034). In-hospital mortality was 4.3% and did not differ between specialties. CONCLUSION We detected differences in oseltamivir usage, length of in-hospital stay and antibiotic choices for pneumonia.

Methods: We conducted a prospective study at a quarantine centre for COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We enrolled quarantined people with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting clinical data, travel and contact history, and saliva at enrolment and daily nasopharyngeal throat swabs (NTS) for RT-PCR testing. We compared the natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Results: Between March 10th and April 4th, 2020, 14,000 quarantined people were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 49 were positive. Of these, 30 participated in the study: 13(43%) never had symptoms and 17(57%) were symptomatic. 17(57%) participants acquired their infection outside Vietnam. Compared with symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic people were less likely to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 in NTS samples collected at enrolment (8/13 (62%) vs. 17/17 (100%) P=0.02). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 20/27 (74%) available saliva; 7/11 (64%) in the asymptomatic and 13/16 (81%) in the symptomatic group (P=0.56). Analysis of the probability of RT-PCR positivity showed asymptomatic participants had faster viral clearance than symptomatic participants (P<0.001 for difference over first 19 days). This difference was most pronounced during the first week of follow-up. Two of the asymptomatic individuals appeared to transmit the infection to up to four contacts. Conclusions: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common and can be detected by analysis of saliva or NTS.

To this end, the Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) conducted a national, multi-phase effort to identify and provide guidance on key issues related to optimal care for patients with stage III/IV NSCLC. Methods: The quality improvement (QI) initiative, guided by an expert steering committee, included 5 phases: 1: Site Selection;2: Topic Identification, Quality Measure Development & Education;3: Data Collection & Analysis;4: Implementation of Educational Intervention;5: Analyze & Repeat. After site selection, baseline data were collected to assess key areas (demographics and clinical features, biomarker testing, process of care) across all sites using standardized data collection instruments. Baseline data were reviewed with each project team and a QI topic was selected via planning tele-conferences. An onsite (or virtual) full-day workshop was conducted with multidisciplinary cancer team members, including invited expert faculty, to define goals and develop site-specific QI projects. The main objects were to implement process-level improvements and develop quantitative benchmarks. Follow-up data collection (quantitative, qualitative, and process-level) was specific to each project and site (some were modified due to COVID-19) and all sites provided follow-up data on biomarker testing. Statistical analyses included summary statistics, frequency tables, and chi-square tests. Results: In pre-implementation (baseline) data collected at the six sites from 2018-2019, median patient ages were 65-72 years;50% Stage III and 50% Stage IV. The race distribution of patients and proportions insured under Medicare, Medicaid, or commercial varied substantially across sites. Biomarker testing also varied in 2018-2019, with clinicians having requested testing for 48-94% of Stage IV patients (with four sites >80%). When biomarkers were evaluated, EGFR and ALK were included in 70-100% of tests, BRAF and ROS1 in 14-87% of tests, and NTRK testing was rare. PDL1 was evaluated in 40-97% of patients. Important process-level improvements were achieved with the QI projects in 2020. Two sites focused on immune-related adverse events (irAEs), conducting a clinician survey to assess gaps in knowledge and care around identification and management of irAEs and developing a patient questionnaire to identify early signs of irAEs. A site focused on clinical trial enrollment and education and established a referral partnership with an NCI-designed cancer center. Two sites focused on biomarker testing, making progress towards standardization. Interventions included creation of a process map for ordering, optimizing workflow by standardizing key elements and template order-sets, increasing liquid biopsy use, and implementing pathology-driven reflex testing at diagnosis. Three sites improved testing rates of Stage IV patients from baseline to follow-up (48% to 81%;67% to 100%;80% to 100%). When biomarkers were tested in 2020, the use of panel testing was 87% overall (>70% for every site). Liquid biopsy was used regularly at three sites, testing 23%, 25%, and 40% of patients. Conclusion: This initiative aided six cancer programs in improving processes of care for patients with stage III/IV NSCLC. Despite some COVID-19 disruption, participating sites remained committed to implementing changes around biomarker testing, well-coordinated care delivery, and symptom management.

The Opioid Use Disorder Provider COVID-19 Survey was conducted to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on clinical practice and HCP well-being. METHODS: The cross-sectional survey was e-mailed to listservs with approximately 157,000 subscribers of diverse professions between July 14 and August 15, 2020. Two dependent variables evaluated HCP functioning and work-life balance. Independent variables assessed organizational practices and HCP experiences. Covariates included participant demographic characteristics, addiction board certification, and practice setting. Multilevel multivariate logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: Among 812 survey respondents, most were men, White, and physicians, with 46% located in urban settings. Function-impairing anxiety was reported by 17%, and 28% reported more difficulty with work-life balance. Difficulty with functioning was positively associated with having staff who were sick with COVID-19 and feeling close to patients, and was negatively associated with being male and having no staff changes. Difficulty with work-life balance was positively associated with addiction board certification; working in multiple settings; having layoffs, furloughs, or reduced hours; staff illness with COVID-19; and group well-being check-ins. It was negatively associated with male gender, older age, and no staff changes. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, provider, and organizational-practice variables were associated with reporting negative measures of well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results should inform HCPs and their organizations on factors that may lead to burnout, with particular focus on gender and age-related concerns and the role of well-being check-ins.","output":"Well-Being of Health Care Professionals Treating Opioid Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results From a National Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An emergent pneumonia outbreak, denoted as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) originated in Wuhan City, in late December 2019 and spread at an alarming rate to become a pandemic affecting more than 200 countries.

To get insights into the possible role of the immune system upon COVID-19 infection, 2811 genes of the gene ontology term \\"immune system process GO: 0002376\\" were selected for coexpression analysis of the human targets of SARS-CoV-2 (HT-SARS-CoV-2) ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN in tissue samples from patients with cancer and diabetes mellitus. The network between HT-SARS-CoV-2 and immune system process genes was analyzed based on functional protein associations using STRING. In addition, STITCH was employed to determine druggable targets. DPP4 was the only immune system process gene, which was coexpressed with the three HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes, while eight other immune genes were at least coexpressed with two HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes. STRING analysis between immune and HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes plotted 19 associations of which there were eight common networking genes in mixed healthy (323) and pan-cancer (11003) tissues in addition to normal (87), cancer (90), and diabetic (128) pancreatic tissues. Using this approach, three commonly applicable druggable connections between HT-SARS-CoV-2 and immune system process genes were identified. These include positive associations of ACE2-DPP4 and TMPRSS2-SRC as well as a negative association of FURIN with ADAM17. Furthermore, 16 drugs were extracted from STITCH (score <0.8) with 32 target genes.

Several previous studies indicated that the patients with MAFLD had a higher prevalence of COVID-19 and a tendency to develop severe type of respiratory infection, and others indicated that liver injury would be exacerbated in the patients with MAFLD once infected with COVID-19. The mechanism underlying the relationship between MAFLD and COVID-19 infection has not been thoroughly investigated, and recent studies indicated that multifactorial mechanisms, such as altered host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expression, direct viral attack, disruption of cholangiocyte function, systemic inflammatory reaction, drug-induced liver injury, hepatic ischemic and hypoxic injury, and MAFLD-related glucose and lipid metabolic disorders, might jointly contribute to both of the adverse hepatic and respiratory outcomes.

This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems).

These advances have come with a dramatic increase of input data in the form of faster frame rates, larger fields of view or higher resolution, so high performance solutions are currently widely used for analysis. Tomographic instruments can vary significantly from one to another, including the hardware employed for reconstruction: from single CPU workstations to large scale hybrid CPU/GPU supercomputers. Flexibility on the software interfaces and reconstruction engines are also highly valued to allow for easy development and prototyping. This paper presents a novel software framework for tomographic analysis that tackles all aforementioned requirements. The proposed solution capitalizes on the increased performance of sparse matrix-vector multiplication and exploits multi-CPU and GPU reconstruction over MPI. The solution is implemented in Python and relies on CuPy for fast GPU operators and CUDA kernel integration, and on SciPy for CPU sparse matrix computation. As opposed to previous tomography solutions that are tailor-made for specific use cases or hardware, the proposed software is designed to provide flexible, portable and high-performance operators that can be used for continuous integration at different production environments, but also for prototyping new experimental settings or for algorithmic development. The experimental results demonstrate how our implementation can even outperform state-of-the-art software packages used at advanced X-ray sources worldwide.","output":"Sparse Matrix-Based HPC Tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although women comprise 33% of the HIV-1-carriers in Israel, they have not previously been considered a risk group requiring special attention. Immigration waves from countries in Africa and in East Europe may have changed the local landscape of women diagnosed with HIV-1. Here, we aimed to assess viral and demographic characteristics of HIV-1-positive women identified in Israel between 2010 and 2018. METHODS: All > 16 year-old, HIV-1-infected women, diagnosed in Israel in 2010-2018, (n = 763) registered in the National HIV reference laboratory were included in this cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from the database. Viral subtypes and transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) were determined in 337 (44.2%) randomly selected samples collected from treatment-naive women. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 38 years. Most (73.3%) women were immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) (41.2%, 314) or sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (32.2%, 246) and carried subtype A (79.7%) or C (90.3%), respectively. Only 11.4% (87) were Israeli-born women. Over the years, the prevalence of women from SSA decreased while that of women from FSU increased significantly (p < 0.001). The median CD4+ cell count was 263 cells/mm3, and higher (391 cells/mm3) in Israeli-born women. TDRM were identified in 10.4% of the tested samples; 1.8, 3 and 7.1% had protease inhibitors (PI), nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) TDRM, respectively. The prevalence of women with NNRTI TDRM significantly increased from 4.9% in 2010-2012 to 13.3% in 2016-2018. Israeli-born women had the highest prevalence (16.3%) of NNRTI TDRM (p = 0.014).

The high proportion of women diagnosed with resistance mutations, particularly, the yearly increase in the frequency of NNRTI mutations, support the national policy of resistance testing at baseline.","output":"HIV-1 infection among women in Israel, 2010-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in China in late December 2019. Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply. METHODS: We performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy. FINDINGS: Regardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 5895, 493, and 375 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 22 million. INTERPRETATION: Implementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.","output":"Facemask shortage and the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Reflections on public health measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The carbon footprint of Bitcoin has drawn wide attention, but Bitcoin's long-term impact on the climate remains uncertain. Here we present a framework to overcome uncertainties in previous estimates and project Bitcoin's electricity consumption and carbon footprint in the long term. If we assume Bitcoin's market capitalization grows in line with the one of gold, we find that the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin may increase from 50 to 400 TWh between 2020 and 2100. The future carbon footprint of Bitcoin strongly depends on the decarbonization pathway of the electricity sector. If the electricity sector achieves carbon neutrality by 2050, Bitcoin's carbon footprint has peaked already. However, in the business-as-usual scenario, emissions sum up to 2 gigatons until 2100, an amount comparable to 6% of global emissions in 2018.

Limitations on traveling activities have tremendous adverse consequences on a country's economy, particularly leading in radically expanding economic downturn and a shrinking tourism industry. To overcome this hardship, several countries have eased COVID-19 travel restrictions. However, there are still questions concerning the benefit to society as the impact assessment of this implementation transmitting to an economy has not been explicitly investigated. In response to this, we aim to assess the impacts of this implementation as to provide a guideline to global countries for their future adoption. By calculating the output and household income multipliers from the tourism inputCoutput table, this study utilizes a case study from Thailand to indicate that prolonging the full mobility restrictions of international tourists, which results in a yearly loss of revenue in Thai tourism industry, would cost country production up to 144.97 billion USD and up to 45.4 billion USD for loss of household income. When international travel limitations were relaxed, production and household damage would fall to 142.24 billion USD (+1.88%) and 44.7 billion USD (+1.54%), respectively. At individual sectors level, our calculation identified that the most damage of production activities would exist in public utility, agriculture, and food manufacturing sectors. In the perspective of household income, those in the agricultural sector would have greatest impact. This impact results from the Thai tourism industry positioned as a buyer in an economy, having most impact on sectors selling their products or inputs to the tourism industry. As suggested by the inputCoutput multipliers, we emphasize that strengthening the resilience of tourism-related sectors and reforming the tourism industry in relation to potential consumption and production patterns are critical for sustainable tourism development.","output":"Evidence from Thailand on Easing COVID-19's International Travel Restrictions: An Impact on Economic Production, Household Income, and Sustainable Tourism Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the factors associated with discordance between patient and physician on the presence of a gout flare. METHODS Patients' self-reports of current gout flares were assessed with the question, 'Are you having a gout flare today?' which was then compared with a concurrent, blinded, physician's assessment. Based on agreement or disagreement with physicians on the presence of a gout flare, flares were divided into concordant and discordant groups, respectively. Within the discordant group, two subgroups-patient-reported flare but the physician disagreed and physician-reported flare but the patient disagreed-were identified. The factors associated with discordance were analysed with multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Of 268 gout flares, 81 (30.2%) flares were discordant, with either patient or physician disagreeing on the presence of a flare. Of the discordant flares, in 57 (70.4%) the patient reported a flare but the physician disagreed. In multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for demographics, disagreement among patients and physicians on the presence of a gout flare was associated with lower pain scores at rest [odds ratio (OR) for each point increase on 0-10 point pain scale 0.81 (95% Wald CI 0.73, 0.90), P < 0.0001] and less presence of joint swelling [OR 0.24 (95% CI 0.10, 0.61), P = 0.003] or joint warmth [OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.20, 0.75), P = 0.005].

Materials and Method: The study was prospectively conducted on relatives of patients admitted to tertiary ICU during COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic characteristics of the patients and their relatives were recorded. The Turkish version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire was applied twice to the relatives of 120 patients to determine the symptoms of anxiety and depression in accordance with the PCR results of the patients (PCR positive n=60, PCR negative n=60). Results: The ratios above cut-off values for anxiety and depression among relatives of the patients were 45,8% and 67,5% for the first test and 46,7% and 62,5% for the second test respectively. The anxiety and depression in the relatives of PCR positive patients was more frequent than the PCR negative (p< 0,001 for HADS-A and p=0,034 for HADS-D). The prevalence of anxiety and depression was significantly higher in female participants (p=0,046 for HADS-A and p=0,009 for HADS-A). There was no significant correlation between HADS and age of the patient or education of the participants.

Novel advances included the integration of patient-collected blood pressure data, automated information retrieval and management support, and use of CDS in low-resource/developing-world settings and in pediatrics. Findings suggest that CDS increases hypertension detection/control, yet many children and adults with hypertension remain undetected or undercontrolled. CDS challenges included poor usability (from lack of health record integration, excessive data entry requests, and wireless connectivity challenges) and lack of clinician trust in blood pressure measures. SUMMARY: Hypertension CDS has improved but not closed gaps in the detection and control of hypertension in children and adults.

For broad applicability, we focus on the common yet challenging scenario where patient-level data for a region of interest are not available. Instead, given daily admissions counts, we model aggregated counts of observed resource use, such as the number of patients in the general ward, in the intensive care unit, or on a ventilator. In order to explain how individual patient trajectories produce these counts, we propose an aggregate count explicit-duration hidden Markov model, nicknamed the ACED-HMM, with an interpretable, compact parameterization. We develop an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach that draws samples from the posterior distribution over the model's transition and duration parameters given aggregate counts from a specific location, thus adapting the model to a region or individual hospital site of interest. Samples from this posterior can then be used to produce future forecasts of any counts of interest. Using data from the United States and the United Kingdom, we show our mechanistic approach provides competitive probabilistic forecasts for the future even as the dynamics of the pandemic shift. Furthermore, we show how our model provides insight about recovery probabilities or length of stay distributions, and we suggest its potential to answer challenging what-if questions about the societal value of possible interventions.","output":"Approximate Bayesian Computation for an Explicit-Duration Hidden Markov Model of COVID-19 Hospital Trajectories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exacerbated pre-existing health disparities and disproportionately affected the Latino community.

However, no studies have yet investigated whether these preferences vary over time or in relation to climate, and there is a paucity of data on whether management on reserves can replicate preferred conditions. Here, we build upon existing research to confirm which characteristics Duke of Burgundy prefer for their larval foodplants, whether preferences remain consistent across years, and whether conservation management on reserves can replicate these conditions. Fieldwork was carried out at Totternhoe Quarry Reserve, a chalk grassland site in Bedfordshire, UK. Confirming previous research, we found that large Primula plants in dense patches were chosen for oviposition, but that once chosen there was no preference to lay eggs on a plants largest leaf. Chosen foodplants were also more sheltered and in closer proximity to scrub than their controls. However, at a finer scale, we found little evidence for any preference based on differences in microclimate, or vegetation height immediately surrounding the plants. This suggests features that alter microclimatic conditions at a larger scale are relatively more important for determining the suitability of oviposition sites. Nearly all preferences remained consistent over time and did not vary between years. Management of scrub on the reserve was able to reproduce some preferred habitat features (high plant density), but not others (large plant size). IMPLICATIONS FOR INSECT CONSERVATION: The consistency of findings across years, despite inter-annual variation in temperature, rainfall and number of adults, indicates that the Duke of Burgundy is conservative in its foodplant choice, highlighting its need for specific habitat management. Targeted management for foodplants could form part of a tractable set of tools to support Duke of Burgundy numbers on reserves, but a careful balance is needed to avoid scrub clearance leaving plants in sub-optimal conditions.","output":"Consistent oviposition preferences of the Duke of Burgundy butterfly over 14 years on a chalk grassland reserve in Bedfordshire, UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Delirium incidence and clinical correlates in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pneumonia are still poorly investigated. AIM: To describe the epidemiology of delirium in patients hospitalized for suspect COVID-19 pneumonia during the pandemic peak in an academic hospital of Northern Italy, identify its clinical correlations and evaluate the association with mortality. METHODS: The clinical records of 852 patients admitted for suspect COVID-19 pneumonia, defined as respiratory symptoms or fever or certain history of contact with COVID-19 patients, plus chest CT imaging compatible with alveolar-interstitial pneumonia, were retrospectively analyzed. Delirium was defined after careful revision of daily clinical reports in accordance with the Confusion Assessment Method criteria. Data on age, clinical presentation, comorbidities, drugs, baseline lab tests and outcome were collected. The factors associated with delirium, and the association of delirium with mortality, were evaluated through binary logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients (11%) developed delirium during stay. They were older (median age 82, interquartile range, IQR 78C89, vs 75, IQR 63C84, p < 0.001), had more neuropsychiatric comorbidities and worse respiratory exchanges at baseline. At multivariate models, delirium was independently and positively associated with age [odds ratio (OR) 1.093, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.046C1.143, p < 0.001], use of antipsychotic drugs (OR 4.529, 95% CI 1.204C17.027, p = 0.025), serum urea and lactate-dehydrogenase at admission.

Four stages of COVID-19 have been identified: the first stage is characterised by upper respiratory tract infection; the second by the onset of dyspnoea and pneumonia; the third by a worsening clinical scenario dominated by a cytokine storm and the consequent hyperinflammatory state; and the fourth by death or recovery. Currently, no treatment can act specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the pathological features and different clinical phases of COVID-19, particularly in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the classes of drugs used are antiviral agents, inflammation inhibitors/antirheumatic drugs, low molecular weight heparins, plasma, and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. During this emergency period of the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical researchers are using and testing a variety of possible treatments. Based on these premises, this review aims to discuss the most updated pharmacological treatments to effectively act against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and support researchers and clinicians in relation to any current and future developments in curing COVID-19 patients.","output":"Treatment for COVID-19: An overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study is to investigate the routine blood parameters of COVID-19 patients at the time of admission to the emergency department and their relationship with the severity of the disease and prognosis. A total of 500 patients, who were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 and hospitalized in the intensive care unit between 01.04.2020 and 01.02.2021 in the emergency department of a pandemic hospital, were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of the patients were obtained from the hospital registry system. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were calculated using neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and platelet counts. These patients were divided into two groups: survivors and deceased. All parameters obtained from routine blood analysis were statistically compared between these two groups. While 280 out of 500 patients survived, 220 died. Of all patients, the mean age was 67 years and 51.8% were males. There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, gender, length of hospital stay, need for mechanical ventilation, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, platelet counts, CRP, ferritin, procalcitonin values, NLR, MLR, and PLR (p < 0.001 for all). While NLR alone and MLR + NEU and NLR + PLR + MLR combinations had the highest AUC values (0.930, 0.947, and 0.939, respectively), MLR and PLR alone showed the lowest AUC values (0.875 and 0.797, respectively). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values (NPVs) in the prediction of death according to the cutoff values of the parameters have been determined. A significant correlation was determined between age, NLR, MLR, and PLR and duration of hospital stay (p < 0.001 for all). Routine blood parameters and NLR, MLR, and PLR can assist emergency physicians to identify the severity and early prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","output":"The Relationship between Routine Blood Parameters and the Prognosis of COVID-19 Patients in the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary dysmenorrhoea (PD) is the most common gynaecological complaint that occurs in women.

More and more, this pandemic and its impact have grown. As vaccine development has not been successful yet, herd immunity can only be achieved if about three quarters of the population contract the virusrequiring immunocompromised citizens to be sacrificed for the sake of the country. Moreover, Pakistan has limited testing capacity, so most COVID-19 tests are missing their mark even as the virus spreads. The current scenario is also raising several concerns about the capacity of the government to tackle the prevailing healthcare crisis. In this regard, healthcare professionals suggest that the government must act responsibly to ensure better security provided to healthcare professionals. Identifying suspected cases, introducing personal protective equipment, and taking administrative measures to ensure that better security is provided to healthcare professionals are the needs of the hour to improve outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Testing, tracking, and lockdowns must be focused on areas where clusters are detected.

The incidence of foodborne diseases has been underreported and underestimated, and the asymptomatic presentation of some of the illnesses, worldwide heterogeneities in reporting, and the alternative transmission routes of certain pathogens are among the factors that contribute to this. Globalization, centralization of the food supply, transportation of food products progressively farther from their places of origin, and the multitude of steps where contamination may occur have made it increasingly challenging to investigate foodborne and waterborne outbreaks. Certain foodborne pathogens may be transmitted directly from animals to humans, while others are transmitted through vectors, such as insects, or through food handlers, contaminated food products or food-processing surfaces, or transfer from sponges, cloths, or utensils. Additionally, the airborne route may contribute to the transmission of certain foodborne pathogens. Complicating epidemiological investigations, multiple transmission routes have been described for some foodborne pathogens. Two types of transmission barriers, primary and secondary, have been described for foodborne pathogens, each of them providing opportunities for preventing and controlling outbreaks. Primary barriers, the most effective sites of prophylactic intervention, prevent pathogen entry into the environment, while secondary barriers prevent the multiplication and dissemination of pathogens that have already entered the environment. Understanding pathogen dynamics, monitoring transmission, and implementing preventive measures are complicated by the phenomenon of superspreading, which refers to the concept that, at the level of populations, a minority of hosts is responsible for the majority of transmission events.","output":"Routes of Transmission in the Food Chain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the development and quality of actionable statements that qualify as good practice statements (GPS) reported in COVID-19 guidelines. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review . We searched MEDLINE, MedSci, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), databases of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Guidelines, NICE, WHO and Guidelines International Network (GIN) from March 2020 to September 2021. We included original or adapted recommendations addressing any COVID-19 topic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used GRADE Working Group criteria for assessing the appropriateness of issuing a GPS: (1) clear and actionable; (2) rationale necessitating the message for healthcare practice; (3) practicality of systematically searching for evidence; (4) likely net positive consequences from implementing the GPS and (5) clear link to the indirect evidence. We assessed guideline quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. RESULTS: 253 guidelines from 44 professional societies issued 3726 actionable statements. We classified 2375 (64%) as GPS; of which 27 (1%) were labelled as GPS by guideline developers. 5 (19%) were labelled as GPS by their authors but did not meet GPS criteria. Of the 2375 GPS, 85% were clear and actionable; 59% provided a rationale necessitating the message for healthcare practice, 24% reported the net positive consequences from implementing the GPS. Systematic collection of evidence was deemed impractical for 13% of the GPS, and 39% explained the chain of indirect evidence supporting GPS development. 173/2375 (7.3%) statements explicitly satisfied all five criteria. The guidelines overall quality was poor regardless of the appropriateness of GPS development and labelling.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. However, the RLR role in innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully elucidated. Here, we studied the roles of RLR in cytokine expression responding to SARS-CoV-2 and found that not only MDA5 but also RIG-I are involved in innate immune responses in some types of human cells. Transfection of total RNAs extracted from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells into epithelial cells induced IFN-, IP-10, and Ccl5 mRNA expression. The cytokine expression was reduced by knockout of either RIG-I or MDA5, suggesting that both proteins are required for appropriate innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Two viral genomic RNA regions strongly induced type I IFN expression, and a 200-base fragment of viral RNA preferentially induced type I IFN in a RIG-I-dependent manner. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infectious particles hardly induced cytokine expression, suggesting viral escape from the host response. Viral 9b protein inhibited RIG-I and MAVS interaction, and viral 7a protein destabilized the TBK1 protein, leading to attenuated IRF-3 phosphorylation required for type I IFN expression.

The association of support for conspiracy theories with sociodemographic variables, health literacy (HL) and eHealth literacy (eHL) was studied. The analysis reported here was based on the data from an online survey of a representative sample (n = 1002) of the adult population of Polish Internet users. The multivariate linear regression for the COVID-19-related conspiracy belief score (CCBS) and logistic regression models for the support of individual conspiracy theories was developed. The percentage of supporters of particular conspiracy theories in the study sample ranged from 43% to 56%. The CCBS was significantly associated with age, education level, vocational status and both HL and eHL. However, it was lower for persons with higher HL (regression coefficient (B) = ?0.04, p < 0.001) but higher for those with higher eHL (B = 0.04, p = 0.038). The most influential predictors of CCBS were age (standardised regression coefficient () = ?0.21) and education level ( from 0.08 to 0.16 for respondents with lower education levels and those with masters degrees). In conclusion, younger persons rather than older, those with a lower rather than with a higher level of education, employees rather than students and persons with lower rather than higher HL were more likely to believe the conspiracy theories.

Various recombinant monoclonal antibodies of human origin that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection have been isolated from convalescent patients and will be applied as therapies and prophylaxis. However, the need for dedicated monoclonal antibodies suitable for molecular pathology research is not fully addressed. Here, we produced six mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibodies that exhibit not only robust performance in immunoassays including western blotting, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation, but also demonstrate neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection to VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Due to their mouse origin, our monoclonal antibodies are compatible with the experimental immunoassay setups commonly used in basic molecular biology research laboratories, providing a useful tool for future research.

Communication has been impacted by the immediacy and virality of messages and misinformation has galloped across social platforms. Against this backdrop, memes have emerged as a powerful means to channel citizen sentiment. During the Covid-19 crisis, social sciences and, in particular, the study of social interaction through digital platforms has played a significant role. A study of these digital objects is essential to understanding social network-based communication during the pandemic. The qualitative research reported here analyses the role of memes in communication on Covid-19, studies their development and defends their status as one of this generation's cultural artefacts that, as such, merits preservation. Meme evolution is studied using Kbler-Ross' (1969) stages of grief, which has been applied in a number of contexts involving psychological change. A corpus of 980 memes was analysed according to iconographic and sociological criteria. Studying memes in those terms both brings information on the evolution of citizens' concerns to light and proves useful to identify the trends present in social media communication around the pandemic. The challenges to be faced in meme preservation are defined, along with the ways in which heritage institutions should ensure the conservation of these cultural objects, which mirror early twenty-first century communication and world views and, in this case, provide specific insight into one of the most significant historical circumstances of recent decades. ? 2021.

Effective treatments against COVID-19 can complement the vaccination effort worldwide. Many review articles studied the effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors among COVID-19 patients and found conflicting results. This heterogeneity may be due to different systemic pleiotropic effects of different DPP-4 inhibitors. Sitagliptin appears to be one of the good DPP-4 inhibitors that have antiinflammatory and antithrombotic effect. Therefore, this review assessed the benefits and safety of sitagliptin in the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: A detailed literature review using the electronic databases of Pubmed and Google Scholar was conducted during July and August 2021 to find out studies that published in English language and discussed the role of sitagliptin for COVID-19 patients. Results: 14 articles were eligible and thus included in this narrative review. Nine of these articles agreed to the benefit of sitagliptin in the treatment of COVID-19, while 3 studies considered sitagliptin as non useful or even risky, and one study was neutral in its conclusion towards the usage of sitagliptin in COVID-19. Only one study focused on the safety of sitagliptin and found that it is safe. Conclusion: Sitagliptin has anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and antiapoptotic properties; such effects may be beneficial in reducing risks of COVID-19. Sitagliptin has good safety and fair benefits to reduce mortality among DM patients with COVID-19.

This systematic review aimed to investigate the efficacy of supplemental curcumin treatment on clinical outcomes and inflammation-related biomarker profiles in COVID-19 patients. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Ovid databases up to 30 June 2021 to find studies that assessed the effects of curcumin-related compounds in mild to severe COVID-19 patients. Six studies were identified which showed that curcumin supplementation led to a significant decrease in common symptoms, duration of hospitalization and deaths. In addition, all of these studies showed that the intervention led to amelioration of cytokine storm effects thought to be a driving force in severe COVID-19 cases. This was seen as a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1 and IL6, with a concomitant significant (p < 0.05) increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-. Taken together, these findings suggested that curcumin exerts its beneficial effects through at least partial restoration of pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance. In conclusion, curcumin supplementation may offer an efficacious and safe option for improving COVID-19 disease outcomes.

This pre-specified analysis included Japanese patients in PINNACLE-4. METHODS: In this double-blind randomized study (NCT02343458), patients received GFF MDI (18/9.6 g), glycopyrrolate (GP) MDI (18 g), formoterol fumarate (FF) MDI (9.6 g), or placebo MDI twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) over Weeks 12-24. Secondary lung function endpoints, patient-reported outcomes, and safety were assessed. The Japanese subpopulation (n = 150) analyses were exploratory. RESULTS: GFF MDI improved change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over Weeks 12-24 versus GP MDI, FF MDI, and placebo MDI (least squares mean [LSM] differences [95% confidence interval]: 69 [8-131], 60 [-1 to 121], and 275 [180-370] mL, respectively).

Single-center prospective comparison of right- and left-sided transperitoneal hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (HALDN) is presented. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eighty-two living kidney donors underwent HALDN between 2003 and 2008. Right-sided HALDN was performed in 46 living kidney donors. The operative technique of right-sided HALDN was modified to obtain the maximum length of right renal vessels. Outcome data in donors including quality of life as well as graft outcome in recipients were prospectively collected. RESULTS All procedures were laparoscopically completed with no conversion. Mean operative time was 127 minutes (vs. 138 minutes in left HALDN, p = 0.08). The mean warm ischemia time was 41 seconds (vs. 39 seconds in left HALDN, p = 0.23). There was no renal artery or vein thrombosis in any of the grafts. Mean blood loss was 81 mL (vs. 92 mL in left HALDN, p = 0.09). Hospital discharge was on an average of 3.6 days postoperative. Delayed graft function occurred in two recipients: one in the left group and the other in the right group. One-year graft survival rate was 95% in the left group versus 96.9% in the right group (p = 0.08).

The research result showed that many kindergarten management boards encountered difficulties in fulfilling planned education schedules and had the low achievement of objective targets. The problems existed in teachers, parents, and mainly students. Most teachers faced problems in creating interactive education materials and conducting an evaluation. Parents had hard times in assisting their children due to their busy activities and low pedagogical competence. Children had hard times due to limited resources for online learning. This research suggests solutions such as improving the mastery of information and communication technology (ICT), especially for teachers, parents, and children.

We previously reported the culture of a SARS-CoV-2r GX_P2V from Guangxi pangolins. Here we report the GX_P2V isolate rapidly adapted to Vero cells by acquiring two genomic mutations: an alanine to valine substitution in the nucleoprotein and a 104-nucleotide deletion in the hypervariable region (HVR) of the 3-terminus untranslated region (3-UTR). We further report the characterization of the GX_P2V variant in in vitro and in vivo infection models. In cultured Vero and BGM cells, the GX_P2V variant produced minimal cell damage and small plaques. The GX_P2V variant infected golden hamsters and BALB/c mice but was highly attenuated. Golden hamsters infected intranasally had a short duration of productive infection. These productive infections induced neutralizing antibodies against pseudoviruses of GX_P2V and SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our data show that the GX_P2V variant is highly attenuated in in vitro and in vivo infection models. Attenuation of the variant is likely due to the 104-nt deletion in the HVR in the 3-UTR.

Thus, this study assessed the prevalence rate, associated factors, and predictive models of insomnia during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted during the second wave of the pandemic (within April 1C13, 2021) and collected information on sociodemographic, behavior and health, COVID-19 risk, fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, suicidality, and insomnia. A total of 756 data from Bangladeshi young adults (22.24  4.39 years) were finally analyzed. RESULTS: About 13% of the participants (n = 98 out of a total of 756) had the symptoms of insomnia. Insomnia had a significant gender difference, where females were more prone to be insomniac. Besides, middle class, urban residence, smoking status, not engaging in physical exercise, poor health status, and multi-comorbidities were also profoundly associated with insomnia. In addition, fear of COVID-19, COVID-19 risk, and mental health problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, and suicidality) showed a significant relationship in terms of insomnia. A total of 31.2% variance predicting insomnia was identified considering all of the studied variables.

We performed a retrospective cohort study on 322 patients who visited our clinics at least 2 times from January to December 2020, and their medical records and photographs were reviewed. Patients were divided into normal (n = 155) and late group (n = 167) based on whether experienced treatment delays. As for the active cases, the late group showed higher progression rate than normal group (35 of 86 [40.7%] vs. 10 of 81 [12.3%]; p = 0.002). Moreover, we observed higher recurrence rate in delay group than those of normal group (26 of 81[32.1%] vs. 9 of 74 [12.2%]; p = 0.018) among stable cases. Further univariate and multivariate analysis determined treatment delays as the most important independent risk factor for disease progression and recurrence, and maintenance therapy (>2 years) as a protective factor against recurrence. This study, for the first time, revealed the independent adverse impact of treatment delays on the progression and recurrence of vitiligo and indicated the significance of continuous treatment for halting progression and long-term maintenance therapy for preventing recurrence for vitiligo, which should be highly valued in the management of vitiligo during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of treatment delays on vitiligo during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This research intended to investigate the characteristics of COVID-19, accurately evaluate radiological findings, and compare it with laboratory evidence of coronavirus.

On admission, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels were tested. Computed tomography (CT) findings and scored pulmonary involvement were evaluated. RESULTS: An elevated level of CRP and mildly raised ESR was seen in all patients. ESR showed a meaningful difference between both genders (P < 0.05). Ninety-four (78.3%) patients showed peripheral pulmonary lesions and 119 patients had ground-glass opacity (99.2%), 110 (92.4%) had consolidation, and 9 patients (7.5%) had linear opacities. Of 120 cases, 25 (20%) had bronchial changes, 25 (20%) had air bronchogram, 11 (9.2%) had bronchial distortion, and 2 had mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Since March 2020, measures have been evolving and include a mixture of central and federalistic mitigation strategies across three culturally diverse language regions. The present study investigates a hypothesised heterogeneity in health, social behavior and adherence to mitigation measures across the language regions by studying pre-specified interaction effects. Our findings aim to support the communication of regionally targeted mitigation strategies and to provide evidence to address longterm population-health consequences of the pandemic by accounting for different pandemic contexts and cultural aspects. METHODS: We use data from from the COVID-19 Social Monitor, a longitudinal population-based online survey. We define five mitigation periods between March 2020 and May 2021. We use unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models to investigate a hypothesized interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions on selected study outcomes covering the domains of general health and quality of life, mental health, loneliness/isolation, physical activity, health care use and adherence to mitigation measures. RESULTS: We analyze 2,163 (64%) participants from the German/Romansh-speaking part of Switzerland, 713 (21%) from the French-speaking part and 505 (15%) from the Italian-speaking part. We found evidence for an interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions for adherence to mitigation measures, but not for other study outcomes (social behavior, health). The presence of poor quality of life, lack of energy, no physical activity, health care use, and the adherence to mitigation measures changed similarly over mitigation periods in all language regions. DISCUSSION: As the pandemic unfolded in Switzerland, also health and social behavior changed between March 2020 to May 2021. Changes in adherence to mitigation measures differ between language regions and reflect the COVID-19 incidence patterns in the investigated mitigation periods, with higher adherence in regions with previously higher incidence. Targeted communcation of mitigation measures and policy making should include cultural, geographical and socioeconomic aspects to address yet unknown long-term population health consequences caused by the pandemic.","output":"Health and social behaviour through pandemic phases in Switzerland: Regional time-trends of the COVID-19 Social Monitor panel study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been rapidly spreading worldwide. In Germany, an exponential increase in the number of infections was registered at the beginning of March 2020 and led to a call of the Ministry of Health to create more capacity for intensive medical treatment in hospitals. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (ORL) university hospitals regarding patient care. Materials and methods An online survey was sent out to all chairmen of the 39 ORL university hospitals in Germany. The answers to the questions referred to the defined period from March 15 (th) to April 15 (th) 2020 and were carried out using the online survey tool SurveyMonkey. 87 questions focused on general information, health care, and structural effects in the respective institution. Results All chairmen of the 39 university hospitals in Germany participated in the survey. The collected data prove the considerable impact on organizational, structural and medical aspects of patient care. For example, the surveyed clinics reported a decrease in outpatient cases by 73.8 % to 26.2  14.2 % and in surgical treatments by 65.9 % to 34.1  13.9 %. In contrast, emergency treatment remained unchanged or even increased in 80 % of the facilities and surgical treatment of emergency patients remained unchanged or even increased in more than 90 %. Emergency outpatient and surgical treatment of patients was provided throughout the pandemic in all facilities. In total, about 35 000 outpatients and about 12 000 surgical cases were postponed. As a result of the acute structural changes, the potential danger of falling below current treatment standards was seen in individual areas of patient care. Discussion The assessment of the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is heterogeneous. The majority of the chairmen are critically aware of the risk of falling below current medical treatment standards or guidelines. In the phase of an exponential increase in the number of infections, significant changes in treatment processes had to be accepted for understandable reasons. However, with the currently significantly reduced number of infections, falling below treatment standards and guidelines should not be allowed to remain constant and tolerated. Summary This study shows a differentiated picture with regard to the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on outpatient, inpatient and operative patient care at the ORL university hospitals in Germany and illustrates the importance of these institutions for ensuring patient care during this critical phase.","output":"Auswirkungen der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie auf die universit?re Hals-Nasen-Ohrenheilkunde im Bereich der Krankenversorgung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinically, steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is always prolonged and difficult to treat and easily develops into end-stage renal disease, resulting in a low survival rate. Strategies to reverse steroid resistance and reduce the long-term use of high doses of steroid medicines are urgently needed. In this study, a novel nanoparticle drug system (Pm-GCH) with a coreCshell structure was designed. MetalCorganic frameworks, synthesized by glycyrrhizic acid (G) and calcium ions (Ca(2+)) loaded with hydrocortisone (H) were the core of the nanoparticles. Platelet membrane vesicles were the shells. The natural platelet membrane endows Pm-GCH with good biocompatibility and the ability to promote immune escape. In addition, under the chemotaxis of inflammatory factors, platelet membranes assist Pm-GCH in nonspecific targeting of the inflammatory sites of the kidney. Under an inflammatory acid environment, GCH slowly degrades and releases glycyrrhizic acid and hydrocortisone. Glycyrrhizic acid inhibits the inactivation of hydrocortisone, jointly inhibits the activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and the classic activation pathway of complement C2, blocks the production of inflammatory factors, plays an anti-inflammatory role, and enhances the efficacy of hydrocortisone in the treatment of SRNS. Moreover, glycyrrhizic acid alleviates osteoporosis induced by long-term use of glucocorticoids. These results indicate that Pm-GCH is a promising treatment strategy for SRNS.

Nowadays, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and mpMRI targeted PBx (MRI-TBx) are recommended in repeat PBx. Our objective was to analyze the current value of ASAP, mHGPIN, PIN-ATYP and other histological findings to predict clinically significant PCa (csPCa) risk. METHODS Retrospective analysis of 377 repeat PBxs. MRI-TBx was performed when Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score>3 and 12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) systematic PBx when2. ASAP, HGPIN, mHGPIN, PIN-ATYP, and 8 other histological findings were prospectively reported in negative PBx. CsPCa was defined as ISUP group grade>2. RESULTS Incidence of ASAP, multifocal HGPIN (mHGPIN) and PINATYP was 4.2%, 39.7% and 3.7% respectively, and csPCa rate was statistically similar among men with these histological findings. However, the rate of csPCa was 22.2% when proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) was present, and 36.1% when it was not. PIA was the only histological finding which predicted lower risk of csPCa, with an OR of .54 (95% CI: .308-.945, P=.031). In addition, PIA was an independent predictor of a model combining clinical variables and mpMRI which reached area under de ROC curve of .86 (95% CI: .83-.90).

METHODOLOGY: Three hundred and eight patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups according to whether occlusal reduction was done or not (n=154). For all patients, root canal treatment was carried out in two visits without intracanal medication. Patients assessed their pain using the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) 6h, 12h 24h, 48h after the first visit (Postinstrumentation) and 6h and 12h following root canal filling (Postobturation). Patients, also, recorded their medication intake (Sham or analgesic) postinstrumentation and postobturation; patients initially received a sham capsule, but, if pain persisted, an analgesic was prescribed. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U-test, Friedman's test, Wilcoxon's rank test and Chi2 (&#967;2 ) test. The Relative Risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for binary data. RESULTS: Occlusal reduction was associated with less pain intensity than no occlusal reduction at 12h and 24h postinstrumentation (p<0.05). Pain intensity significantly and gradually decreased with both groups at all postinstrumentation and postobturation timepoints compared to preoperative pain (p<0.05). The RR of moderate-to-severe pain was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.91) 12h postinstrumentation and the RR of pain incidence, regardless of its level, was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.92) 24h postinstrumentation.

METHODS: To fill this gap, we evaluated how college student drinking patterns changed with the onset of restrictions related to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic during spring 2020 relative to spring 2018 and 2019. Participants were 1,365 college students aged 19 and older, including 895 students who reported past\\\\month alcohol use. Daily drinking data were extracted from an online Timeline Followback survey. RESULTS: Negative binomial hurdle models revealed that, with the onset of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in spring 2020, college student drinkers did not increase their drinking frequency as was typical in late spring semester, and the number of drinks per occasion declined substantially (28% reduction), greater than the change observed from early to late spring 2018 (3% reduction) or spring 2019 (8% increase). This reduction in drinking quantity in spring 2020 was larger for college student drinkers who moved residences because of the pandemic (49% reduction) than students who did not move (21% reduction).

Studies of CXR scoring in the European population found a higher score in males than in females and significantly correlated with age. Because there have not been studies in the Mexican-mestizo community, we aimed to compare the differences in CXR scores between males and females and their correlation with age after controlling comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 1000 CXR of Mexican-mestizo patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by RT-PCR. Significant differences between age, age groups, symptoms, comorbidities, and CXR scores between males and females used the Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square tests (&#967; 2), and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The relationship between the total CXR score and age was measured with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (Rs); partial correlation analysis controlled the effect of symptoms, risk factors, and comorbidities. Results: The total CXR score did not show a difference between males and females grouped by age. There was a positive, low correlation between the total CXR score and age in males, Rs = 0.260, p < 0.001 (N = 616), and in females, Rs = 0.170, p = 0.001 (N = 384). Age only explained a <9% variance of CXR severity. Rs decreased its magnitude (from Rs = 0.152 to Rs = 0.046) and lost its significance (change in p value from p < 0.001 to p = 0.145) after controlling the effect of hypertension. Conclusions: There is no significant difference in CXR score between males and females in the Mexican-mestizo population grouped by age. Hypertension cancels the significance of CXR severity with age pointing to its role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Further research using stratified groups by age and gender in other populations needs to be published.","output":"Correlation between Chest X-Ray Severity in COVID-19 and Age in Mexican-Mestizo Patients: An Observational Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: RT-qPCR is the current recommended laboratory method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 acute infection, several factors such as requirement of special equipment, time consuming, high cost and skilled staff limit the use of these techniques. A more rapid and high-throughput method is essential. METHODS: We analyzed clinical data and nasopharyngeal samples, collected during September 2020, from patients attended at the emergency department of a secondary hospital and in two primary healthcare centers in Madrid. The performance of the Panbio? COVID-19 AG Rapid Test Device for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen was compared to RT-qPCR. RESULTS: 255 nasopharyngeal swabs, including 150 from the emergency department and 105 from primary helthcare centers, were tested. 184 patients were symptomatic (72.1 %). Amongst the 60 positive RT-qPCR samples, 40 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 73.3 %. All the samples detected positive with the rapid antigen test were also positive with RT-qPCR. The median cycle threshold was 23.28 (IQR 18.5C30.16). Patients with less than seven days onset of symptoms showed a higher viral load, and sensitivity for rapid antigen test (86.5 %), compared to those with more days (sensitivity of 53.8 %)(p < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid antigen test evaluated in this study showed a high sensitivity and specificity in samples obtained during the first week of symptoms and with high viral loads.

Japan has faced three epidemic waves of COVID-19 from early 2020 through early 2021. Here we narratively review the three waves in Japan, describe the key epidemiologic features of COVID-19, and discuss lessons learned. METHODS: We assessed publicly available surveillance data, routine surveillance reports, and other relevant sourcesDmultiple indicators were monitored to improve interpretation of surveillance data. Weekly trends for each wave were described based on the number of case notifications; number of tests performed; proportion of those tests that were positive for the novel coronavirus; the prevalent number of COVID-19 hospitalizations (total hospitalizations and those categorized as severe); and number of COVID-19 deaths. For each indicator and wave, we recorded the first calendar week to show an increase over two consecutive previous weeks, along with the peak week. RESULTS: The spring wave was characterized by detection of cases imported from China, followed by notifications of sporadic cases without travel history, clusters, and mild/asymptomatic cases. The summer wave saw a large increase in notifications and a younger age distribution, but in the context of increased testing with lower test positivity. The winter wave brought considerable morbidity and mortality, surpassing the cumulative case counts and fatalities from the earlier waves, with high peak values. Overall, relative to the first wave, the burden of severe outcomes was lower in the second and higher in the third wave, but varied by prefecture. In all three waves, severe outcomes peaked after notification counts and test positivity peaked; severe outcomes were also consistently skewed toward the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Important lessons were learned from each wave and across wavesDsome aspects remained constant, while others changed over time. In order to rapidly detect an increase in incidence, continuous, timely, and sensitive surveillanceDusing multiple information sources with careful interpretationsDwill be key in COVID-19 control.","output":"Epidemiology of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Japan: Descriptive Findings and Lessons Learned through Surveillance during the First Three Waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this paper is to understand, in a panoramic way, the ideas that some organized groups of Catholicism have expressed about the pandemic of the new coronavirus.

This study uses data from an extensive questionnaire survey by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People's Republic of China (MOHURD) in 11 cities. This study uses the descriptive statistical method and Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) to study the perception of urban public safety (PUPS) and its influencing factors of floating population with higher education background (FPHEB) from the three levels of city-district-individual. The study finds that (1) when FPHEB is placed in a district and a city at the same time, the influence of the city on PUPS is greater than that of the district; (2) the urban's infrastructure security and economic development security positively affect the floating population; (3) the GDP and the number of stadiums and hospitals of the district are significantly positively correlated with the PUPS of the FPHEB, whereas the increase of population density and road density have negative effects; (4) FPHEB with distinct attributes will make their PUPS also different. This study is not only a reflection on the construction of urban public security after the COVID-19 outbreak but can also be used as a theoretical reference for the government in constructing urban public security.

However, because D-dimer test results vary considerably among assays, resolving harmonization issues is fundamental to translate findings into clinical practice. In this retrospective multicenter study (BIOCOVID study), we aimed to analyze the value of harmonized D-dimer levels upon admission for the prediction of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. All-cause in-hospital mortality was defined as endpoint. For harmonization of D-dimer levels, we designed a model based on the transformation of method-specific regression lines to a reference regression line. The ability of D-dimer for prediction of death was explored by receiver operating characteristic curves analysis and the association with the endpoint by Cox regression analysis. Study population included 2663 patients. In-hospital mortality rate was 14.3%. Harmonized D-dimer upon admission yielded an area under the curve of 0.66, with an optimal cut-off value of 0.945 mg/L FEU. Patients with harmonized D-dimer  0.945 mg/L FEU had a higher mortality rate (22.4% vs. 9.2%; p < 0.001).

In this review, we explore the different microfluidic-based diagnostics kits and how their amalgamation with the various detection techniques has spearheaded their availability throughout the world. Three other online databases, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, were referred for articles. One thousand one hundred sixty-four articles were determined with the search algorithm of microfluidics followed by diagnostics and SARS-CoV-2. We found that most of the materials used to produce microfluidics devices were the polymer materials such as PDMS, PMMA, and others. Centrifugal force is the most commonly used fluid manipulation technique, followed by electrochemical pumping, capillary action, and isotachophoresis. The implementation of the detection technique varied. In the case of antibody detection, spectrometer-based detection was most common, followed by fluorescence-based as well as colorimetry-based. In contrast, antigen detection implemented electrochemical-based detection followed by fluorescence-based detection, and spectrometer-based detection were most common. Finally, nucleic acid detection exclusively implements fluorescence-based detection with a few colorimetry-based detections. It has been further observed that the sensitivity and specificity of most devices varied with implementing the detection-based technique alongside the fluid manipulation technique. Most microfluidics devices are simple and incorporate the detection-based system within the device. This simplifies the deployment of such devices in a wide range of environments.

Based on this, controlling the robust production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages may be applicable as a cellular approach to investigate potential cytokine-targeted therapies against COVID-19. In the current study, we utilized TLR2/MyD88 and TLR3/TRIF co-activated macrophages and evaluated the anti-cytokine storm effect of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula Babaodan (BBD). An RNA-seq-based transcriptomic approach was used to determine the molecular mode of action. Additionally, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of BBD in vivo using a mouse model of post-viral bacterial infection-induced pneumonia and seven severely ill COVID-19 patients. Our study reveals the protective role of BBD against excessive immune responses in macrophages, where the underlying mechanisms involve the inhibition of the NF-&#954;B and MAPK signaling pathways. In vivo, BBD significantly inhibited the release of IL-6, thus resulting in increased survival rates in mice. Based on limited data, we demonstrated that severely ill COVID-19 patients benefited from BBD treatment due to a reduction in the overproduction of IL-6.

Five minutes following the start of continuous intravenous administration of remifentanil at 0.25 g/kg/min, general anaesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation. Infusion of remifentanil was stopped immediately after tracheal intubation. When BIS began to increase > 60, maintenance of anaesthesia was started with an end-tidal desflurane concentration of 4.0% and maintained for 10 min followed by 1-min assessment of BIS taken at 10-s intervals.

Within paediatric emergency medicine, there are vast quantities of resources widely available. Staying up to date with latest resources can be difficult, and for some it can be overwhelming. As a result of a national lockdown during Covid-19 pandemic, medical education has moved primarily to online learning. Managing and organising teaching and education resources may be an added stressor for the busy paediatric trainee.ObjectivesOur primary aim was to create a platform mapped to the RCPCH sub-specialty syllabus which will allow for collaborative input of resources, making it more accessible to stay up to date with latest FOAMed and improving trainee satisfaction. Our secondary aim was to create an online teaching network to allow for regional teaching sessions to be available to all trainees across the United Kingdom, allowing for increasing CPD opportunities.MethodsA survey was designed and distributed to paediatric sub-specialty trainees in the UK, assessing the need for service. Responses were anonymous and voluntary. Feedback suggested this resource would be eagerly welcomed and, therefore, the online platform Trello was used to create an education board using the RCPCH Paediatric Emergency Medicine sub-specialty syllabus learning outcomes. FOAMed was collated from a range of online sources, including national guidelines, medical blogs, and RCPCH and RCEM learning, and linked to each learning outcome. This was accessible to all emergency medicine trainees. Anonymised and voluntary feedback was collected following a period of use.ResultsA total of 31 trainees completed the online survey. 9.6% felt it was impossible to stay up to date with resources, and 61.3% felt it was extremely difficult. 29.0% knew of some resources but found it difficult to organise and remember the location of the those most useful. 87.1% of trainees felt it would be useful to have online resources collated and mapped to the sub-specialty syllabus. Implementation of the Trello board has allowed trainees across the UK to input FOAMed resources. In addition, centres across the UK have engaged with the Trello board, sharing their local teaching sessions, capitalising on the use of online forums.

For this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 880 participants by a self-administered online-based questionnaire relating personal characteristics, self-rate health (SRH), SME, and EME with anxiety. Findings show that around half of the surveyed population experienced a spike of anxiety (49.1%) during the pandemic, ten times higher than the national anxiety rate in 2019. The participants with an increased SME of over four hours per day experienced a higher level of anxiety than individuals with < = 2 hours exposure to social media. Similarly, the anxiety was higher among people with fair/bad SRH compared to individuals with excellent SRH. It is highly recommended to develop active surveillance and effective monitoring systems to reduce the spread of misinformation from both social and electronic media to improve the state of mental health conditions during the pandemic.","output":"Social and electronic media exposure and generalized anxiety disorder among people during COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh: A preliminary observation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is an infectious disease with high rates of mortality and high frequency of severe sequelae. Early identification of causative bacterial and viral pathogens is important for prompt and proper treatment of meningitis and for prevention of life-threatening clinical outcomes. In the present study, we evaluated the value of the Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit (Seegene Inc., Korea), a newly developed multiplex PCR kit employing dual priming oligonucleotide methods, for diagnosing acute meningitis. METHODS: Analytical sensitivity of the kit was studied using reference strains for each pathogen targeted by the kit, while it's analytical specificity was studied using the human genome DNA and 58 clinically well-identified reference strains. For clinical validation experiment, we used 27 control cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and 78 clinical CSF samples collected from patients at the time of diagnosis of acute meningitis. RESULTS: The lower detection limits ranged from 10(1) copies/L to 510(1) copies/L for the 12 viral and bacterial pathogens targeted. No cross-reaction was observed. In the validation study, high detection rate of 56.4% was obtained. None of the control samples tested positive, i.e., false-positive results were absent. CONCLUSIONS: The Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit showed high sensitivity, specificity, and detection rate for the identification of pathogens in clinical CSF samples.

Boophilus microplus infestation caused a marginal decrease in the percentage of T lymphocytes in PBL, which was observed in both lightly (5000 larvae) and heavily (40 000 larvae) infested cattle, and began at the second infestation and continued until the end of the fourth infestation. The percentage of B lymphocytes in heavily tick-infested cattle was less than that in non-infested control cattle after the fourth infestation. The response of PBL from tick-infested cattle to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was always less than that of tick-free cattle after the second infestation. No noteworthy differences were detected between the three stages of tick infestation, that is, 1 week before the peak of adult engorgement, the middle of the peak and 1 week after all ticks had dropped. Boophilus microplus saliva (100 l ml(?1)) suppressed 47% of the response of bovine PBL to PHA in vitro. This suppressive effect of saliva may contribute to the lowerresponsiveness of PBL from tick-infested cattle. Antibody production by tick-infested cattle was examined during the third and fourth heavy tick infestation. Tick-infested cattle showed a diminished response against ovalbumin after the second immunization.

Only small parts of the bilateral alae and the columella base remained after resection, and the frontal area of the septum was also resected. We planned to use an expanded double forehead flap to reconstruct the whole external skin cover and lining of the nose. We chose a 200-mL tissue expander and injected 152 mL of saline over 15 weeks. The expansion course in this patient was slower than that in younger patients because of the limited expansibility of her forehead skin. However, the skin tolerated the repeated expansions well, and the double forehead flap was expanded to the planned size preoperatively. The nasal support grafts were composed of the L-strut and alar battens from the eighth and ninth costal cartilages, and were fixed using nonabsorbable sutures. Histological examination revealed cartilage matrix degeneration and a reduced number of living chondrocytes, yet no calcification or fragility. After 18 months of follow-up, the framework maintained its shape, and the dorsum was straight without warping. The autologous costal cartilage provided a natural nasal shape and nostrils.

We propose a long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up of these children. This protocol details the follow-up at 5 years of age, which aims to (1) confirm our long-term recruitment capacity and (2) determine the spectrum of neurodevelopmental outcomes at preschool age following neonatal DHA supplementation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This long-term follow-up involves children (n=194) born to mothers (n=170) randomised to DHA (n=85) or placebo (n=85) from the five sites in Quebec when they will be 5 years corrected age. The primary outcome measure is related to the long-term recruitment capacity, which we determined as successful if 75% (10%, 95% CI) of the eligible children consent to the 5-year follow-up study. Interviews with mothers will be conducted to assess various aspects of neurodevelopment at preschool age (executive functions, behavioural problems, global development and health-related quality of life), evaluated with standardised neurodevelopmental questionnaires. In addition, a semistructured interview conducted in a subset of the mothers will be used to determine their acceptability and identify barriers and enablers to their eventual participation to the next phase of the trial.

However, achieving and retaining diverse samples is challenging. Barriers to recruitment and retention of diverse participants include socioeconomic and cultural factors and practical challenges (e.g., time and travel commitments). OBJECTIVES The purpose of this paper is to describe the successful recruitment and retention strategies used by two related studies within a National Institute of Nursing Research-funded P20 center focused on precision health research in diverse populations with multiple chronic conditions (MCC), including metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS To address the complexity, biodiversity, and effect of MetS and MCC, we developed culturally appropriate, multipronged recruitment and retention strategies for a pilot intervention study and a longitudinal observational pilot study within our P20 center. The following are the underlying principles that guided the recruitment and retention strategies: (a) flexibility, (b) active listening and bidirectional conversations, and (c) innovative problem-solving. RESULTS The intervention study (Pilot 1) enrolled 49 participants. The longitudinal observational study (Pilot 2) enrolled 45 participants. Women and racial/ethnic minorities were significantly represented in both. In Pilot 1, the majority of the participants completed the intervention and all phases of data collection. In Pilot 2, the majority of participants completed all phases of data collection and chose to provide biorepository specimens. DISCUSSION We developed a recruitment and retention plan building on standard strategies for a general medical population. Our real-world experiences informed the adaption of these strategies to facilitate the participation of individuals who often do not participate in research-specifically, women and racial/ethnic populations.

Although common risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, frequently underlie AF onset, it has been recognized that in 15% of the AF population, AF is familial. In these families, genome and exome sequencing techniques identified variants in the non-coding genome (i.e., variant regulatory elements), genes encoding ion channels, as well as genes encoding cytoskeletal (-associated) proteins. Cytoskeletal protein variants include variants in desmin, lamin A/C, titin, myosin heavy and light chain, junctophilin, nucleoporin, nesprin, and filamin C. These cytoskeletal protein variants have a strong association with the development of cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, AF onset is often represented as the initial manifestation of cardiac disease, sometimes even preceding cardiomyopathy by several years. Although emerging research findings reveal cytoskeletal protein variants to disrupt the cardiomyocyte structure and trigger DNA damage, exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms of genetic AF is still in its infancy.

Omicron is the most mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant that has emerged, resulting in viral phenotype alterations, which can affect transmissibility, disease severity, and immune evasiveness. Genomic surveillance of a highly transmissible variant is important in cities with millions of inhabitants and an economic center such as Mexico City. In this work, we describe the early effects of the Omicron variant in Mexico City, exploring its genomic profile and clinical description. Methodology. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2-positive samples in November and December 2021 using the public database GISAID. Haplotype and phylogenetic analyses were performed to genomically characterize Omicron. We used the Mexican federal database to explore the association with clinical information such as symptoms and vaccination status. Findings. The first case of Omicron was detected on November 16, 2022, and until December 31, 2021, we observed an increase from 88% in sequenced samples. Nineteen nonsynonymous mutations were found in the Omicron RBD, and we further explored the R346K substitution, which was prevalent in 42% of the samples and associated with immune escape by monoclonal antibodies. In the phylogenetic analysis, we found that there were several independent exchanges between Mexico and the world, and there was an event followed by local transmission that gave rise to most of the Omicron diversity in Mexico City. The haplotype analysis allowed us to observe that there was no association between haplotype and vaccination status. Of the patients with clinical data, 66% were vaccinated, none of the reported comorbidities were associated with Omicron, the presence of odynophagia and absence of dysgeusia were significant predictor symptoms for Omicron, and the Ct value on RT-qPCR was lower in Omicron. Conclusions. Genomic surveillance in highly populated and fast-moving urban regions such as Mexico City is key to detecting the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a timely manner, even weeks before the onset of an infection wave, to detect patterns that can inform public health decisions.

METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was delivered to nurses in Hong Kong to assess their attitude towards avian influenza; risk perception, and their relationships with previous level of exposure to SARS patients. RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety-nine respondents were included in data analysis. About half of them perceived there would be an avian influenza outbreak in Hong Kong. The majority accepted a personal risk of infection in the course of their work (72.7%), and prepared to take care of patients infected with avian influenza (84.0%). Respondents were classified into two groups: high exposure (44.1%) and low exposure (55.9%) as defined by having worked in SARS ward or hospitals. High exposure nurses were less likely to avoid patients, less inclined to change their job if they were required to take care of infected patients, and had therefore a more positive attitude towards an impending avian influenza epidemic. About half of the nurses had frequent involuntary recalls of incidents relating to SARS, the frequency of which was positively correlated with knowing a person suffering from long-term complications of SARS.

Methods: We searched OVID Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane and Campbell Databases for Systematic Reviews published up to April 15th 2021. Focusing on community (meso-level) and society (macro-level) level NPIs, we included all study designs, while a geographic restriction was limited to the EU, UK and European Economic Area (EEA) countries. Using the PICO framework, two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed quality using appropriate quality appraisal tools. A qualitative synthesis was performed, with NPIs grouped initially by a) Physical Distancing measures, b) Case detection and management measures, and c) hygiene measures and subsequently by country. Results: Of 17,692 studies initially assessed, 45 met all inclusion criteria. Most studies (n=30) had a modelling study design, while 13 were observational, one quasi-experimental and one experimental. Evidence from across the European continent, presented by country, indicates that the implementations of physical distancing measures (i.e., lockdowns/quarantines), preferably earlier in the pandemic, reduce the number of cases and hospitalisation across settings and for which the timing and duration are essential parameters. Case detection and management measures were also identified as effective measures at certain levels of testing and incidence, while hygiene and safety measures complemented the implementation of physical distancing measures. Conclusions: This literature review represents a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of NPIs in Europe up to April 2021. Despite heterogeneity across studies, NPIs, as assessed within the context of this systematic review at the macro and meso level, are effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and COVID-19 hospitalisation rates and deaths in the European Region and may be applied as response strategies to reduce the burden of COVID-19 in forthcoming waves.","output":"Effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical measures (NPIs) on COVID-19 in Europe: A systematic literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bank BPR Jogja is considered a grassroots entity that has an obligation to contribute to providing stimulus during the pandemic and to drive the welfare of its members in times of uncertain economic growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic Preparation of financial reports has an important factor, namely the openness of cash receipts and disbursements which will be presented through research by measuring 6 aspects of the application of internal control in the cash receipt and disbursement cycle according to the COSO framework in BPR Bank Jogja, namely 1) accountability, 2) control environment, 3) assessment risk, 4) control activities, 5) information and communication, and 6) monitoring This study aims to determine the analysis of the openness of cash receipts and payments and then identify the weaknesses and strengths that have been implemented through the measurement of significance together This study uses a quantitative research method using a fact approach and analysis of its effects directly at the BPR Bank Jogja unit The results of the study concluded that the analysis of the openness of cash receipts and disbursements at Bank BPR Jogja has gone well, in line with the strengths and weaknesses identified","output":"Analisis Keterbukaan Penerimaan Dan Pengeluaran Kas Bagi Sustainability Bpr Bank Jogja Sebagai Wujud Antisipasi Ketidak Pastian Akibat Pandemi COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the constant threat posed by emerging infectious diseases and the limitations of existing approaches used to identify new pathogens, there is a great demand for new technological methods for viral discovery.

At the heart of this was the redeployment of the orthopaedic trainees to support frontline specialties. This paper sheds light on the experience of orthopaedic trainees in redeployment. Methods  In this retrospective study, we asked orthopaedic trainees in the KSS (Kent, Surrey, Sussex) and London Deaneries to complete a survey regarding their experience in redeployment during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study took place in the Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and London regions of the United Kingdom over a period of 8 weeks from 15th of March 2020 until 15th of May 2020. The study was based at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust and participants were recruited from a number of secondary and tertiary care centres across the region. 120 orthopaedic trainees were contacted, working in 21 teaching hospitals. Of these, 40 trainees (30%) from 13 hospitals responded and completed the survey. Results  50% of the surveyed trainees were redeployed to other specialties. Trainees spent varying amounts of time in the redeployed speciality and gave differing views on how comfortable they felt and how useful they felt the experience was. One-third of trainees experienced symptoms and/or tested positive for COVID-19 and the majority of these were redeployed to other specialties.

Zinc (Zn) salts, which are widely used as a dietary supplement in swine nutrition, have shown antiviral effects in vitro as well as in vivo. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of dietary zinc oxide supplementation on vaccination and challenge infection with PRRSV. FINDINGS: The clinical course of PRRS and the success of vaccination with an experimental inactivated vaccine were compared between animals receiving a conventional diet (50 ppm Zn, control group) and diets supplemented with Zn oxide (ZnO) at final Zn concentrations of 150 or 2,500 ppm. Pigs receiving higher dietary Zn levels showed a tendency towards higher neutralizing antibody levels after infection, while dietary Zn levels did not substantially influence the number of antiviral IFN-gamma secreting cells (IFN-gamma-SC) or percentages of blood immune cell subsets after infection. Finally, feeding higher dietary Zn levels reduced neither clinical symptoms nor viral loads. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher levels of dietary ZnO do not have the potential to stimulate or modulate systemic immune responses after vaccination and heterologous PRRSV infection to an extent that could improve the clinical and virological outcome.

We carried out a sequence comparison of 1,000 HIV-1 sequences at the slippery site (UUUUUUA) and found that the site is invariant, which is somewhat surprising for a virus known for its variability. This prompted us to prepare a series of mutations to examine their effect upon frameshifting and viral infectivity. Among the series of mutations were changes of the HIV-1 slippery site to those effectively utilized by other viruses, because such mutations would be anticipated to have a relatively mild effect upon frameshifting. The results demonstrate that any change to the slippery site reduced frameshifting levels and also dramatically inhibited infectivity. Because ribosomal frameshifting is essential for HIV-1 replication and it is surprisingly resistant to mutation, modulation of HIV-1 frameshifting efficiency potentially represents an important target for the development of novel antiviral therapeutics.","output":"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ribosomal frameshifting site is an invariant sequence determinant and an important target for antiviral therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 situation in Maldives have evolved since the epidemic began in March 2020 with unprecedented increase in cases since mid-July 2019 with over 8000 cases at the end of August 2020. OBJECTIVE The aim of the sero-epidemiological investigation is to obtain a sense of the population exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 by measuring the seroprevalence of antibodies to COVID-19 in the general population. METHODS A population-based, age-stratified prospective method was employed to find out the key epidemiological and serologic characteristics of COVID-19 virus in this study. RESULTS The results showed that seroprevalence in the population was 13%. The factors that were associated with antibody results included age (OR: 4.0, CI: 1.7-9.0), nationality (OR: 12.9, CI: 8.3-19.7), being diagnosed for COVID-19 (OR: 24.7, CI: 15.9-38.4) and having symptoms of COVID-19 (OR: 2.0, CI: 1.5-2.8). There was a gradual decrease in the antibody levels from 19 days to 250 days. The mean duration of the presence of antibodies in this study was found to be 124 days. CONCLUSIONS While the seroprevalence provides a measure that can be used to predict community transmission risk of the disease, the extent of functional immunity provided by antibody titres is still not clear.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared about 450 000 deaths in more than 200 countries, until June 2020. SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia develops a stress condition through systemic hypoxygenation with activation of adrenergic pathways. Takotsubo syndrome is characterized by a temporary wall motion abnormality of the left ventricle (LV) and has common features with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), representing a form of myocardial infarction without coronary arteries thrombosis. Among possible causes there are several stress conditions, including physical, psychological, and illnesses, for example interstitial pneumonia. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 54-years-old man, previous smoker, was admitted to emergency room (ER) complaining of dyspnoea and fever, initially treated with ceftriaxone. Physical examination was characterized by tachypnoea (respiratory rate 30 acts/min), tachycardia and hypotension (arterial pressure 90/60 mmHg), and hypoxaemia at transcutaneous saturation (Sat O(2) 85%). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed bilateral interstitial pneumonia with ground glass opacities (visual involvement of 80% of pulmonary parenchymal) (Figure 1). Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and ECG revealed Atrio-Ventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVRNT) with heart rate of 140 b.p.m., partially responsive to Valsalva manoeuver (Figure 2). Echocardiogram showed severe ventricular dysfunction [ejection fraction (EF): 30C35%] with hypokinesia of apical region associated with hyperkinesia of medio-basal segments, mild mitral regurgitation, and slight pericardial effusion (Figure 2). Laboratory tests were TnI hs 10 ng/l first detection C 26 ng/l second detection (normal range: 2.3C17.8 ng/l), PCR >250 mg/l (normal range 0.5C5 mg/l), d-dimer 1893 ng/ml (normal range: <500 ng/ml), PCT 3.10 ng/ml (normal range: 0C0.5 ng/ml). The worsening of clinical condition needed an orotracheal intubation and a transfer to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient was treated with many antiviral drugs (darunavir, ritonavir), tocilizumab, steroid therapy, colchicine, and plasmapheresis. We observed a progressive clinical and echocardiography improvement, evidenced by partial recovery of EF (45%). CT scan revealed a normal coronary tree. The patient underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) that showed typical Takotsubo cardiomyopathy characterized by thinning and hypo-akinesias of apical wall of left ventricle (apical ballooning) and normokinesis of basal/medium segments; no late gadolinium enhancements (LGEs); no oedema in T2 weighted images (Figure 3). Follow-up echocardiogram confirmed recovery of EF (50%) associated with mild hypokinesia of apical segments. Acute myocardial injury, as evidenced by elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers or electrocardiogram abnormalities, was observed in 7C20% of patients with COVID-19 in early studies in China (4). In a multicentre cohort study of 191 patients with COVID-19, 33 patients (17%) had acute cardiac injury, of whom 32 died. Whether typical clinical features of myocarditis were present in patients, who had elevated levels of cardiac troponins during the course of COVID-19 is unclear because most of the early studies did not include echocardiography or MRI data. By contrast, several case reports have described typical signs of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19. A woman aged 53 years with myocardial injury, as evidenced by elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers and diffuse ST segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, had diffuse biventricular hypokinesis on cardiac MRI, especially in the apical segments, in addition to severe LV dysfunction (LVEF = 35%). MRI data also revealed marked biventricular interstitial oedema, diffuse LGE and circumferential pericardial effusion, features that are consistent with acute myocarditis. Furthermore, in a man aged 37 years with chest pain and ST segment elevation, echocardiography revealed an enlarged heart. The Lake-Louise Criteria gave good diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected myocarditis, evaluating the principle tissue targets in myocarditis, including: myocardial oedema, using T2-based imaging; hyperaemia and capillary leak, using early gadolinium enhancement (EGE) imaging; and myocyte necrosis and fibrosis, using LGE imaging [14]. The presence of myocardial injury was associated with a significantly worse prognosis. In the initial report of 41 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, five patients had myocardial injury with elevated levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (>28 pg/ml), and four of these five patients were admitted to an ICU. Histological evidence of myocardial injury or myocarditis in COVID-19 is also limited. An autopsy of a patient with COVID-19 and ARDS who died of a sudden cardiac arrest showed no evidence of myocardial structural involvement, suggesting that COVID-19 did not directly impair the heart. By contrast, another case report described a patient with low-grade myocardial inflammation and myocardial localization of coronavirus particles (outside of cardiomyocytes), as measured by endomyocardial biopsy, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might infect the myocardium directly. In this case report, CMR showed typical Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (with hypokinesis of apical wall of left ventricle and normokinesis of basal/medium segments), but it showed no oedema in T2-weighted images, no hyperaemia nor capillary leakage (no myocardial EGE), no signs of necrosis or fibrosis (no LGE), no pericardial effusion. This case-report CMR images demonstrated the absence of typical myocardial injury caused by myocarditis, evidenced by the absence of the main tissue markers. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the ventricular dysfunction, presented with Takotsubo syndrome typical pattern, could hypothetically be secondary to systemic hypoxygenation and stress condition caused by the systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction developed by SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia. About the current diagnostic possibilities, CMR is a valuable option for the assessment of inflammatory heart diseases.","output":"353 SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary vasculitis and Takotsubo myocarditis syndrome.

This study aimed to reveal the medium-term impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on case volumes and quality of intensive care for critically ill non-COVID-19 patients. Methods: Administrative data were used to investigate the trends in case volumes of admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) compared with the previous years. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of non-COVID-19 ICU patients were calculated in each wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. Results: The ratios of new ICU admissions of non-COVID-19 patients to those in the corresponding months before the epidemic: 21% in May 2020, 8% in August 2020, 9% in February 2021, and 14% in May 2021, approximately concurrent with the peaks in COVID-19 infections. The decrease was greatest for new ICU admissions of non-COVID patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) on the first day of ICU admission: 26%, 15%, 19%, and 19% in the first, second, third, and fourth waves, respectively. No statistically significant change in SMR was observed in any wave of the epidemic; SMRs were 0.990 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.962-1.019), 0.979 (95% CI, 0.953-1.006), 0.996 (95% CI, 0.980-1.013), and 0.989 (95% CI, 0.964-1.014), in the first, second, third, and fourth waves of the epidemic, respectively.

A total of 22 COVID-19 suspected medical personnel and their cohabitation families without hypoxia and lung diseases, who came to the adult fever clinic were studied. All patients received oseltamivir and antibacterial therapy together. The median age was 40 years. The study patients were divided into 2 groups;individuals who currently smoke in 11 patients (current smokers) and never smoked in 11 (never smokers). Four (36%) of 11 current smokers experienced constant cough even after oseltamivir administration, compared with 0% of never smokers (2=4.90;p<0.05). The cough score decreased from 1.50.5 at baseline to 0.30.5 during the one week after ciclesonide administration (p<0.001) and constant cough disappeared in three cases out of four current smokers. Because current smokers are at a higher risk to develop constant cough which is resistant to oseltamivir therapy for suspected COVID-19 as compared to never smokers, smoking cessation should be recommended at an early stage.

Furthermore, there is no clear cut-off point to consider PVR statistically significant. The aim of the study is to perform a systematic review of the current evidence behind the use of the PVR bladder scan as a diagnostic tool for CES diagnosis.

Previously, we demonstrated that DING regulates HIV-1 gene transcription by dephosphorylation and inactivation of CTD RNA polymerase II, the major elongating factor of HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeats (LTR). Because the transcription of HIV-1 is controlled by several viral and cellular factors, including p65/p50 subunits of NF-B, we hypothesized that DING phosphatase can also affect the phosphorylation and activity of p65 NF-B, in addition to C-terminal Domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), to suppress HIV-1 gene transcription and inhibit HIV-1 infection. METHODS: Here, we describe the inhibition of HIV-1 infection and the p65/p50 NF-B phosphorylation by DING protein, analyzed by ELISA and northern-blot assays, western-blot assays, cell fractionation, and promoter-reporter assays in DING-expressing cells, using a pTet-on inducible system. RESULTS: Results from HIV-1 infection assays demonstrate a strong inhibition of HIV-1 and HIV-LTR RNA expression by DING protein, determined by p24 ELISA and by northern blot assay. Results from the western blot assays and cell fractionation assays show that there is an increase in the level of hypo-phosphorylated form of p65 NF-B in DING-expressing cells. Both fractions of p65/p50, nuclear or cytoplasmic, are affected by DING phosphatase, but more cytoplasmic accumulation of p65 NF-B was found in the presence of DING, suggesting that subsequent activation and nuclear import of active NF-B is affected by DING. The major portion of nuclear p65 was dephosphorylated in DING-expressing cells. The promoter-reporter assay demonstrated that DING-mediated dephosphorylation and dysregulation of NF-B p65 lead to the suppression of its binding to HIV-1 LTR, and resulted in the inhibition of p65-mediated activation of LTR transcription. Mapping of the region within LTR that was affected by DING revealed that both, NF-B and CTD RNA Polymerase II binding sites were important, and cooperativity of these cellular factors was diminished by DING. In addition, mapping of the region within DING-p38SJ that affected LTR transcription, revealed that phosphate-binding domain is essential for this inhibitory activity. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the effect of DING phosphatases on HIV-1 infection, phosphorylation of p65 NF-B, and transcription of HIV-1 LTR. Our studies suggest that one possible mechanism by which DING can regulate the expression of HIV-1 LTR can be through dysregulation of the transcription factor NF-B p65 by preventing its phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus and binding to the HIV-1 LTR, an action that could contribute to the utility of DING p38SJ as an antiviral agent. Importantly, DING not only inhibits HIV-1 LTR gene transcription in the presence of increased p65 NF-B, but also suppresses HIV-1 infection. DING protein improved inhibitory effects of the known anti-retroviral drugs, Tenofovir (TFV) and Emtricitabine (FTS) on HIV-1, since in the combination with these drugs; the suppression of HIV-1 by DNG was significantly higher when it was in combination with these drugs, compared to controls or cases without DING. Thus, our data support the use of neuroprotective DING proteins as novel therapeutic antiviral drugs that suppress HIV-1 LTR transcription by interfering with the function of NF-B.","output":"DING Protein Inhibits Transcription of HIV-1 Gene through Suppression of Phosphorylation of NF-B p65"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The opioid epidemic continues to affect pregnant women with opioid use disorder adversely in unique and enduring ways.

This model is unique in its recognition of the important role of nursing regulatory bodies in these partnerships. The practice-academic partnership model creates clinical education opportunities for students during a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the model could be applied to meet the chronic challenges nursing education programs have often faced in securing clinical sites, even in the absence of a global or national public health emergency.

Noncommunicable diseases like cardio-vascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mental disorders are affecting developing countries with an increasing trend. In parallel, 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_5343 such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, acute respiratory infections and diarrheal disease are causing high mortality rates especially in low and middle income countries.

Neutralizing antibodies and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells have been detected in convalescent and immunized immunocompetent individuals. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and its treatment, particularly anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis), blunt the antibody response to vaccines. To understand the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with CLL, assessment of the T-cell response is urgently needed. Between December 22, 2020 and May 7, 2021, 57 patients with CLL were immunized with either 2 doses of BNT162b2 (n = 30) or mRNA-1273 (n = 25) or 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S (n = 2). Qualitative and semi-quantitative anti-spike antibodies were measured with serology tests authorized by the FDA under Emergency Use Authorization. A positive humoral response to vaccination was defined as the detection of anti-spike antibodies. Ultra-deep TCR? sequencing (Adaptive Biotechnologies) was performed on total peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected before and after vaccination. These data were analyzed in the immunoSEQ Analyzer. Differential abundance was calculated using the beta-binomial model and two-sided =.05. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells were identified in the T-MAP COVID ImmuneCODE database. A positive cellular response to vaccination was defined as significant expansion of 1 spike-specific clonotype. Anti-spike antibodies were detected in 61% (35/57) of patients at a median (interquartile range, IQR) of 45 (30-56) days after the last dose of vaccine. The median (IQR) antibody titer was 19.1 U/mL (3.6-150.9) among 27 patients with humoral response. There were 4 patients with titers above the upper limit of quantification (>250 U/mL) and 4 patients who had qualitative testing only. The rate of humoral response was 71% (15/21) in treatment na?ve (TN) patients, 57% (16/28) in patients treated with BTKi, and 0% (0/4) in patients treated with venetoclax and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Among 16 BTKi-treated patients with anti-spike antibodies, 2 interrupted BTKi during the vaccination period. One patient treated with venetoclax monotherapy and 3 previously treated patients had detectable anti-spike antibodies. The immediate prior therapies were acalabrutinib >1 year before vaccination for 2 patients and chemoimmunotherapy >8 years before vaccination for 1 patient. Vaccination with mRNA-1273 induced numerically higher titers compared to BNT162b2 (median 85.5 U/mL versus 11.0 U/mL; P=.1), but the rate of seroconversion was not significantly different (P=.4). No patients reported a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies were negative in 100% (50/50) of patients tested. Circulating CD8 + T cells increased from a median (IQR) of 13.2% (7.8-18.8) at baseline to 14.3% (8.8-20.6) after vaccination (P=.015). CD3 + and CD4 + T cells did not significantly change. TCR? sequencing results are available in 7 patients (Table). The median (IQR) number of productive templates, which corresponds to the number of T cells sequenced in each sample, was 447,805 (377,738-503,097). Cellular response was observed in 57% (4/7) of patients. A total of 10 expanded spike-specific clonotypes were identified and ranged between 1 and 6 clonotypes per patient. The cumulative frequency of spike-specific clonotypes after vaccination ranged between 0.0036% and 1.55% per patient. None of these clonotypes were found at baseline despite the large number of productive templates generated in each sample. Spike-specific T cells were detected in 50% (2/4) of patients with anti-spike antibodies and 67% (2/3) of patients without seroconversion. In conclusion, patients with CLL have impaired humoral and cellular responses to COVID-19 vaccination. Seroconversion occurred less often in patients treated with BTKi than TN patients and was absent in patients treated with venetoclax and anti-CD20 mAb. Cellular responses were seen in the absence of humoral responses. TCR? sequencing is ongoing in additional patients. Updated data will be presented at the meeting.

In present study, we mainly aimed to evaluate specimen types and specimen collection timepoint on the positive detection of 2019 novel coronavirus from patients at infection late stage based on RT-PCR testing. METHODS: Paired nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs and anal swabs were collected from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during infection late stage before washing in the morning and afternoon on the same day. Then virus RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV identification by RT-PCR within 24 h. RESULTS: Viral load was low at late infection stage. Specimens collected before washing in the morning would increase the detection ratio of 2019-nCoV. Detection ratio of nasopharyngeal swab [65 (95 % CI: 49.51-77.87) vs 42.5(95 % CI: 28.51-57.8)] or nasal swab [57.5 (95 % CI: 42.2-71.49) vs 35 (95 % CI: 22.13-50.49)] is higher not only than oropharyngeal swab[22.5 (95 % CI: 12.32-37.5) vs 7.5 (95 % CI: 2.58-19.86)], but also anal swab[2.5 (95 % CI: 0.44-12.88) vs 5 (95 % CI: 1.38-16.5)].

WHO Quality of Life Instrument-Short Form (WHOQOL-BREF) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire-BREF (IPAQ-BREF) questionnaires were used to assess QoL and PA intensities. The main findings of the present study showed that MAG and HEPAG have better total PA, physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL domains scores than IG (all, p < 0.01). Small to large correlations (r ranging from 0.14 to 0.72) were also observed between total PA, total walking activity, total moderate-intensity PA, total vigorous-intensity PA, and QoL domains (all, p < 0.01).

METHODS: We conducted a population cohort study using linked data from adults attending public sector health facilities in the Western Cape, South Africa. We used Cox-proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, location and comorbidities to examine the association between HIV, tuberculosis and COVID-19 death from 1 March-9 June 2020 among (i) public sector active patients (1 visit in the 3 years before March 2020), (ii) laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases and (iii) hospitalized COVID-19 cases. We calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for COVID-19 comparing HIV positive vs. negative adults using modelled population estimates. RESULTS: Among 3,460,932 patients (16% HIV positive), 22,308 were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 625 died. COVID-19 death was associated with male sex, increasing age, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. HIV was associated with COVID-19 mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70-2.70), with similar risks across strata of viral load and immunosuppression. Current and previous tuberculosis were associated with COVID-19 death (aHR [95%CI] 2.70 [1.81-4.04] and 1.51 [1.18-1.93] respectively). The SMR for COVID-19 death associated with HIV was 2.39 (95%CI 1.96-2.86); population attributable fraction 8.5% (95%CI 6.1-11.1). CONCLUSION: While our findings may over-estimate HIV- and tuberculosis-associated COVID-19 mortality risks due to residual confounding, both HIV and current tuberculosis were independently associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. The associations between age, sex and other comorbidities and COVID-19 mortality were similar to other settings.","output":"Risk factors for COVID-19 death in a population cohort study from the Western Cape Province, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) is invested in co-design to assure that key applications are ready for exascale computing.

AIM To investigate the cause of chronic constipation in a patient with complete absence of spontaneous bowel movements. METHODS High-resolution colonic manometry was performed to assess motor functions of the colon, rectum, the sphincter of O'Beirne and the anal sphincters. RESULTS Normal colonic motor patterns were observed, even at baseline, but a prominent high-pressure zone at the rectosigmoid junction, the sphincter of O'Beirne, was consistently present. In response to high-amplitude propagating pressure waves (HAPWs) that were not consciously perceived, the sphincter and the anal sphincters would not relax and paradoxically contract, identified as autonomous dyssynergia. Rectal bisacodyl evoked marked HAPW activity with complete relaxation of the sphincter of O'Beirne and the anal sphincters, indicating that all neural pathways to generate the coloanal reflex were intact but had low sensitivity to physiological stimuli. A retrograde propagating cyclic motor pattern initiated at the sphincter of O'Beirne, likely contributing to failure of content to move into the rectum. CONCLUSIONS Chronic constipation without the presence of spontaneous bowel movements can be associated with normal colonic motor patterns but a highly exaggerated pressure at the rectosigmoid junction: the sphincter of O'Beirne, and failure of this sphincter and the anal sphincters to relax associated with propulsive motor patterns. The sphincter of O'Beirne can be an important part of the pathophysiology of chronic constipation.","output":"The Sphincter of O'Beirne-Part 2: Report of a Case of Chronic Constipation with Autonomous Dyssynergia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdowns were used worldwide to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

We also demonstrate why bankruptcy is the wrong tool to address the problems of these types of firms. The current pandemic threatens lives and livelihoods across the world. A key difference compared to previous market shocks is that lockdowns and related measures have, in certain instances, made it impossible for businesses to conduct their operations. This has resulted in a very specific type of distress, one that bankruptcy is not in the best position to address effectively. If there are no revenues, the design of bankruptcy laws makes them an inadequate tool C and the sheer volume of companies going through the process may put severe stress on the system. The difficulties that the vast majority of companies are encountering may be better solved using different tools: bailouts, bail-ins or a combination thereof, deployed by the government in wide-ranging statutory schemes. However, these schemes may not adequately address the issues of all companies;and the preservation of some of them C those that we refer to as critical/systemic C may be of such significant value to society that more intense assistance from the government is justified. We engage with the characteristics of firms that should be considered critical/systemic and the principles that should guide ad hoc rescues of those companies by the government. Firms are critical/systemic if their failure imposes significant negative externalities on the economy (or, conversely, their preservation generates significant positive externalities) or if they provide the public with an infrastructure not otherwise provided by the private sector. If firms are critical/systemic, the government should have the ability to bail them out, going beyond applicable statutory schemes and ensuring that the relevant externalities are considered when deciding whether to keep these companies as going concerns. Bankruptcy is a private process. It is not designed to vindicate such public considerations. Government bailouts, however, should be governed by principles, as any government intervention in the economy, and its associated efficiency and distributional effects must be considered with care. The guiding principles that we propose and elaborate on are (i) proportionality, (ii) efficiency, (iii) equity and (iv) transparency. The application of these principles should ensure that, if the government takes ownership of a private firm through an ad hoc bailout, this is a tool of last resort, and not more than temporary C and that the pre-distress investors properly contribute to the necessary measures.","output":"Towards a Principled Approach for Bailouts of COVID-Distressed Critical/Systemic Firms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrhea is considered to be associated with microbial dysbiosis caused by infection of pathogens but poorly understood. We herein characterized the colonic microbiota of diarrheal early-weaning piglets infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and Campylobacter. Campylobacter infection significantly decreased species richness and Shannon diversity index of colonic microbiota together with a significant increase in the proportion of Campylobacter and Enterobacteriaceae, whereas no significant difference on the above indexes was observed in piglets infected with PCV2 compared with healthy piglets. PCV2 and Campylobacter infection could disturb the homeostasis of colonic microbiota through deterioration of ecological network within microbial community, and specially Campylobacter performed as a module hub in ecological networks. The microbial dysbiosis caused metabolic dysfunction and led to a remarkable reduction in production of short chain fatty acids, following by a higher pH level in colon cavity. Campylobacter infection disturbed the function of colonic tract barrier observed in terms of significant lower relative expression of claudin-1, occluding, and zonula occludens protein-1 genes, and PCV2 infection induced intestinal inflammation together with a higher permeability of colon.

METHODS From February 23 to March 5, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 863 medical care workers from seven provinces in China using standard questionnaires measuring adverse psychological outcomes including Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale(DASS)and related psychosocial factors like perceived threat, social support and coping strategies. Exploratory Factor analysis was performed to identify the dimensions of perceived threat by study participants. Multivariate regression was used to examine the determinants of adverse psychological outcomes. RESULTS Posttraumatic stress (PTS) were prevalent in this sample of health care professionals, and 40.2% indicated positive screens for significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The proportion of having mild to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were 13.6, 13.9 and 8.6%, respectively. Perceived threat and passive coping strategies were positively correlated to PTS and DASS scores, while perceived social support and active coping strategies were negatively correlated to DASS scores. Nurses were more likely to be anxious than others among medical care workers during the COVID-19 epidemic.

Most previous studies have only focused on inter-subject classification with single-mode neuroimaging data. However, whether this classification can truly reflect the changes in the structure and function of the brain region in disease progression remains unverified. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the classification framework, which combines structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) metrics, to distinguish mild cognitive impairment non-converters (MCInc)/AD from MCI converters (MCIc) by using graph theory and machine learning. METHODS: With the intra-subject (MCInc vs. MCIc) and inter-subject (MCIc vs. AD) design, we employed cortical thickness features, structural brain network features, and sub-frequency (full-band, slow-4, slow-5) functional brain network features for classification. Three feature selection methods [random subset feature selection algorithm (RSFS), minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR), and sparse linear regression feature selection algorithm based on stationary selection (SS-LR)] were used respectively to select discriminative features in the iterative combinations of MRI and network measures. Then support vector machine (SVM) classifier with nested cross-validation was employed for classification. We also compared the performance of multiple classifiers (Random Forest, K-nearest neighbor, Adaboost, SVM) and verified the reliability of our results by upsampling. RESULTS: We found that in the classifications of MCIc vs. MCInc, and MCIc vs. AD, the proposed RSFS algorithm achieved the best accuracies (84.71, 89.80%) than the other algorithms. And the high-sensitivity brain regions found with the two classification groups were inconsistent. Specifically, in MCIc vs. MCInc, the high-sensitivity brain regions associated with both structural and functional features included frontal, temporal, caudate, entorhinal, parahippocampal, and calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex. While in MCIc vs. AD, the high-sensitivity brain regions associated only with functional features included frontal, temporal, thalamus, olfactory, and angular. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that our proposed method could effectively predict the conversion of MCI to AD, and the inconsistency of specific brain regions provides a novel insight for clinical AD diagnosis.","output":"Predicting MCI to AD Conversation Using Integrated sMRI and rs-fMRI: Machine Learning and Graph Theory Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently all folks experiencing emotions, thought and situations we've never experienced before.

This study was a secondary analysis drawn from a larger study on the SCS. RESULTS: SCI total score had a significant positive relationship with SB at the 1-month follow-up for patients with lower levels of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness, respectively. Hence, these four traits were protective against SB. There was an association between SCI and SB for patients with high levels of neuroticism at the 1-month follow-up.

Brazil is a priority not only because of its megadiversity, high rates of endemism, and frequent descriptions of new species but also because of its high levels of deforestation. Among the species groups prioritized for conservation is the anurans (Amphibia: Anura), the population of which is severely declining. One group of anurans is the genus Brachycephalus, which includes 37 endemic species in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. Some of these species have highly restricted distributions (<100 ha). Thirty new species have been described since 2000, and 55.3% of all species are threatened with extinction. Brachycephalus tridactylus was only recently described and remains restricted to its type locality. Because of its reduced geographical distribution (0.41 km(2)), it has been proposed to be considered as Vulnerable. The objective of this study is to reevaluate the conservation status of Brachycephalus tridactylus and propose conservation measures. METHODS: We searched for new populations during 2016C2020, evaluated in loco impacts and potential impacts on the species population, and performed an analysis of the density of this population and estimated its size. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria were used to assess the conservation status of the species.

We estimated the area of occupancy as 148.44 km(2), densities as one calling male per 4.05 m(2) and 130.00 m(2), and a total population size of 4,429,722 adult individuals. Based on our finding, we proposed three lines of management: (1) formation of fire brigades, (2) management of residents mules in the conservation unit and surrounding areas, and (3) management of degraded areas. We recommend changing the species conservation status from Vulnerable to Endangered because of its fragmented distribution and decline in the area of occupancy and in the quality of its habitat. Our results have expanded the species previous geographic distribution and delimited areas without previous records. Our estimates of population density and size are in accordance with those verified for congeners. The conservation of this species benefits the environments and other species that inhabit them, being, therefore, strategic for receiving conservation actions that will spread throughout the ecosystem.","output":"An estimate of the area of occupancy and population size of Brachycephalus tridactylus (Anura: Brachycephalidae) to reassess its conservation status, with a proposal for conservation measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Radionuclide imaging of insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression in tumours might be used for selection of patients who would benefit from IGF-1R-targeted therapy. We have previously shown the feasibility of IGF-1R imaging using the Affibody molecule (111)In-DOTA-His(6)-Z(IGF1R:4551). The use of (99m)Tc instead of (111)In should improve sensitivity and resolution of imaging, and reduce the dose burden to patients. We hypothesized that inclusion of a HEHEHE tag instead of a His(6) tag in Z(IGF1R:4551) would permit its convenient purification using IMAC, enable labelling with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+), and improve its biodistribution. METHODS Z(IGF1R:4551) was expressed with a HEHEHE tag in the N terminus. The resulting (HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) construct was labelled with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+). Targeting of IGF-1R-expressing cells using [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+)-(HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS (HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) was stably labelled with (99m)Tc with preserved specific binding to IGF-1R-expressing DU-145 prostate cancer cells in vitro. In mice, [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+)-(HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) accumulated in IGF-1R-expressing organs (pancreas, stomach, lung and salivary gland). [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+)-(HE)(3)-Z(IGF1R:4551) demonstrated 3.6-fold lower accumulation in the liver and spleen than (111)In-DOTA-Z(IGF1R:4551).

Data are needed regarding the effect of the fourth dose on rates of confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). METHODS: Using the Israeli Ministry of Health database, we extracted data on 1,252,331 persons who were 60 years of age or older and eligible for the fourth dose during a period in which the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of SARS-CoV-2 was predominant (January 10 through March 2, 2022). We estimated the rate of confirmed infection and severe Covid-19 as a function of time starting at 8 days after receipt of a fourth dose (four-dose groups) as compared with that among persons who had received only three doses (three-dose group) and among persons who had received a fourth dose 3 to 7 days earlier (internal control group). For the estimation of rates, we used quasi-Poisson regression with adjustment for age, sex, demographic group, and calendar day. RESULTS: The number of cases of severe Covid-19 per 100,000 person-days (unadjusted rate) was 1.5 in the aggregated four-dose groups, 3.9 in the three-dose group, and 4.2 in the internal control group. In the quasi-Poisson analysis, the adjusted rate of severe Covid-19 in the fourth week after receipt of the fourth dose was lower than that in the three-dose group by a factor of 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7 to 4.6) and was lower than that in the internal control group by a factor of 2.3 (95% CI, 1.7 to 3.3). Protection against severe illness did not wane during the 6 weeks after receipt of the fourth dose. The number of cases of confirmed infection per 100,000 person-days (unadjusted rate) was 177 in the aggregated four-dose groups, 361 in the three-dose group, and 388 in the internal control group. In the quasi-Poisson analysis, the adjusted rate of confirmed infection in the fourth week after receipt of the fourth dose was lower than that in the three-dose group by a factor of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.1) and was lower than that in the internal control group by a factor of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.7 to 1.9). However, this protection waned in later weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe Covid-19 were lower after a fourth dose of BNT162b2 vaccine than after only three doses.

We first validated our model using the well-studied influenza viruses and then compared the pathogenesis processes between the two viruses. The interaction between host innate and adaptive immune responses was found to be a potential cause for the higher severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the timing mismatch between the two immune responses has a major impact on disease progression. The adaptive immune response of the COVID-19 patients is more likely to come before the peak of viral load, while the opposite is true for influenza patients. This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs in COVID-19 patients while enhancing viral clearance in influenza patients. Stronger adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients can potentially lead to longer recovery time and more severe secondary complications. Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during the early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high-risk COVID-19 patients. Suppressing the adaptive immune response temporarily and avoiding its interference with the innate immune response may allow the innate immunity to more efficiently clear the virus.","output":"Mathematical modeling of interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses in COVID-19 and implications for viral pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In this study we report the outcome of salvage mastectomy and reconstruction in 11 BRCA mutation carrier patients that participated in a clinical trial of prophylactic contralateral breast irradiation and suffered reoccurrences of breast cancer in either the ipsilateral or contralateral breast or elected to have the procedure for risk reduction. Patients satisfaction and physicians assessment of the cosmetic outcome were not inferior for previously irradiated compared to non-irradiated breasts. These results are encouraging and support continuing research as well as a discussion of risk-reduction alternatives besides mastectomy, including prophylactic breast irradiation, in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. ABSTRACT: Risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) is often advocated for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who face a heightened lifetime risk of breast cancer. However, many carrier patients seek alternative risk-reducing measures. In a phase II nonrandomized trial, we previously reported that prophylactic irradiation to the contralateral breast among BRCA carriers undergoing breast-conserving treatment significantly reduced subsequent contralateral breast cancer. Herein, we report the outcome of salvage mastectomy and reconstruction in 11 patients that suffered reoccurrences of breast cancer in either the ipsilateral or contralateral breast or elected to have the procedure for risk reduction during the eight-year follow-up period. Patients satisfaction with the procedure and physicians assessment of the cosmetic outcome were not inferior for previously irradiated compared to non-irradiated breasts. Although the numbers are small, the results are encouraging and sustain hope in a challenging population.

Full-dose anticoagulation limits requirements for organ support interventions in moderately ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given this benefit, it is important to evaluate response to therapeutic anticoagulation in this population. Objectives The aim of this study was to assess therapeutic UFH infusions and associated bleeding risk in patients with COVID-19. Patients/Methods This retrospective cohort study includes patients at Brigham and Women?s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, receiving weight-based nursing-nomogram titrated UFH infusion during a 10-week surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations. Of 358 patients on therapeutic UFH during this interval, 97 (27.1%) had confirmed COVID-19. Patient characteristics, laboratory values, and information regarding UFH infusion and bleeding events were obtained from the electronic medical record. Results Patients who were COVID-19 positive had fewer therapeutic activatrd partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared to COVID-19?negative patients (median rate, 40.0% vs 53.1%;P &lt; .0005). Both major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were increased in COVID-19?positive patients, with major bleeding observed in 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7%-17.9%) of patients who were COVID-19 positive and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.6%-5.9%) of patients who were COVID-19 negative (P &lt; .005). In logistic regression, bleeding events were associated with receiving UFH for longer than 7 days, but not platelet count, coagulation, or inflammatory measurements. Conclusions Our data indicate a higher incidence of bleeding complications in patients with COVID-19 receiving weight-based nursing-nomogram titrated UFH infusions despite a higher prevalence of subtherapeutic aPTTs in this population. These data underscore the need for prospective studies aimed at improving the quality and safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Management of therapeutic unfractionated heparin in COVID-19 patients: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stress-related sleep disturbances are distressing clinical symptoms in posttraumatic stress disorder patients. Intensely stressful events and their memories change rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in animal models. REM sleep varies with individual differences of stress resilience or vulnerability. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a primary mediator of the effects of stress and fear memories on sleep. However, the molecular mechanisms in BLA regulating the effects of fear conditioning, shock training (ST) and context re-exposure (CTX) on REM sleep are not well known. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs and posttranscriptional gene regulators of diverse biological processes. The aim of this study is to investigate ST- and CTX-altered miRNAs in the BLA of resilience and vulnerable animals and on REM sleep regulation. MiRNAs expression profiles in BLA were generated following ST and CTX using the Taqman Low Density rodent microRNA array. The altered BLA miRNAs expression and REM sleep reduction observed in ST and CTX vulnerable animals. AntagomiR-221 microinjection into BLA for one of the upregulated miRNAs, miR-221 in BLA, attenuated the REM sleep reduction.

This paper has the aim to measure the cost of a missed integration, by highlighting what GDP growth would be in case of a missed integration. It does so by building a scenario of missed integration and compares it with a reference scenario. Scenarios are based on the Macroeconomics, Social, Sectoral, Territorial (MASST) model that has recently been updated to its fourth generation, whereby regional economic relations are tested econometrically. The estimated causeCeffect chains are then the basis to build new scenarios simulated under complex sets of internally coherent assumptions in a simulation stage. The reference scenario presented is not a simple extrapolation of past trends; the post-crisis period registered structural changes to be taken into account for the future. In the integration scenario, we assume further integration within the EU to take place through the following changes: (1) higher trade flows among EU countries (production integration effect); (2) higher decrease in non-tariffs barriers (proximity effect to larger markets); (3) higher trust within and among countries (social effect); (4) higher quality of government (institutional effect); (5) stronger cooperation networks among cities (cooperation effect); and (6) higher exports (market integration effect). Results show that a more integrated scenario leads to faster economic growth across all EU countries.

METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective study to reveal the outcome of COVID-19 patients on tocilizumab and proposed \\"the Cerrahpasa-PREDICT score\\", a new clinical scoring system using clinical and laboratory parameters that would help predicting the 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients (median age: 59 years) were included of whom 75.8% were male. Tocilizumab use significantly improved clinical and laboratory parameters. The 28-day mortality rate on tocilizumab was 16.1%. The Cerrahpasa-PREDICT score, consisting of platelet counts, procalcitonin, D-dimer levels, SO2R and the time from symptom onset to tocilizumab administration had a positive predictive value of 94.5% and negative predictive value of 92.9% for anticipating 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 should closely be monitored for the signs of hyperinflammation.

To date, the pathogenetic role of aPL and the trend over time is still unknown. Objectives: Aim of the study was to investigate whether aPL positivity was correlated with thrombosis in COVID-19 patients and whether it was a transient or persistent. Methods: We included all consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome from April 1, 2020 to June 7, 2020. In these patients, serum levels of anti-cardiolipin (aCL) IgM, IgG, IgA, anti-2glycoprotein I (a2GPI) IgM, IgG were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) was detected with coagulatory tests in patients not in treatment with anticoagulant drugs. Results: Five out of 73 (6.8%) patients resulted positive for aCL IgM, 3 of them also tested positive for a2GPI IgM. aCL IgA were tested positive in 14 out of 46 patients (30.4%). Overall 18 patients resulted positive for at least one test. Seven (9.6%) patients developed thrombotic events during hospitalization, 3 of them resulting positive for aPL (Table 1. below). We observed that patients showing double positivity for aCL IgM and a2GPI IgM had a likelihood positive ratio of 6.3 for thrombotic events (p=0.012) and a likelihood positive ratio of 4.9 for increased D-dimer levels (p=0.027). aCL IgA, the most prevalent aPL in this cohort, was not associated with thrombosis. Of the 18 aPL positive patients, 5 died, 3 were lost to follow-up, and 10 were tested on a second occasion at least 12 weeks, two patients confirmed positivity without clinical signs suggestive of APS. Conclusion: These results suggest that double positivity for aCL and a2GPI IgM increases the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients, unlike aCL IgA.

Due to AZT background in the treatment of known viral infections mentioned above (which is described in this study), in the early stages of COVID-19 (a new zoonotic disease caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) development, AZT drew attention to itself due to its antiviral and immunomodulatory effects as a valuable candidate for COVID-19 treatment. AZT usage instructions for treating different viral infections have always been under observation, and COVID-19 is no exception. There are still debates about the use of AZT in COVID-19 treatment. However, eventually, novel researches convinced WHO to announce the discontinuation of AZT use (alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine) in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research aims to study the structure of all of the viruses mentioned above and the molecular and clinical effects of AZT against the virus.","output":"Antiviral effects of azithromycin: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digitalization of any manufacture industry is a key step in any progress of the production process. The process of digitalization includes both increased use of robotics, automatization solutions and computerization, thereby allowing to reduce costs, to improve efficiency and productivity, and to be flexible to changes. Pharmaceutical Industry (PI) has however been resistant to digitalization, mainly due to fair experience and complexity of the entailed development and manufacture processes. Nevertheless, there is a clear need to digitalize PI as the demand in both traditional and new drugs is constantly growing. Contract Development Manufacture Organizations (CDMOs) have a special digitalizing challenge. Digitalization of PI, and CDMO precisely, should be tightly related to the main aspects of Good Manufacture Practice (GMP), and, to succeed in PI digitalizing requires constant focus on GMP. Close collaboration with constantly changing stakeholders is another important factor which should be in focus during digitalization of CDMO.

We sought to assess the controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) model as a means of studying naturally acquired immunity in Kenyan adults with varying malaria exposure. METHODS: We analysed data from 142 Kenyan adults from three locations representing distinct areas of malaria endemicity (Ahero, Kilifi North and Kilifi South) enrolled in a CHMI study with Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites NF54 strain (Sanaria? PfSPZ Challenge). To identify the in vivo outcomes that most closely reflected naturally acquired immunity, parameters based on qPCR measurements were compared with anti-schizont antibody levels and residence as proxy markers of naturally acquired immunity. RESULTS: Time to endpoint correlated more closely with anti-schizont antibodies and location of residence than other parasite parameters such as growth rate or mean parasite density. Compared to observational field-based studies in children where 0.8% of the variability in malaria outcome was observed to be explained by anti-schizont antibodies, in the CHMI model the dichotomized anti-schizont antibodies explained 17% of the variability. CONCLUSIONS: The CHMI model is highly effective in studying markers of naturally acquired immunity to malaria. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov number NCT02739763.

We found that relative to mild COVID-19 cases, individuals with severe disease exhibited elevated authentic virus-neutralizing titers and antibody levels against nucleocapsid (N) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 region of spike protein. Unlike disease severity, age and sex played lesser roles in serological responses. All cases, including asymptomatic individuals, seroconverted by 2 weeks post-PCR confirmation. RBD- and S2-specific and neutralizing antibody titers remained elevated and stable for at least 2C3 months post-onset, whereas those against N were more variable with rapid declines in many samples. Testing of 5882 self-recruited members of the local community demonstrated that 1.24% of individuals showed antibody reactivity to RBD. However, 18% (13/73) of these putative seropositive samples failed to neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Each of the neutralizing, but only 1 of the non-neutralizing samples, also displayed potent reactivity to S2. Thus, inclusion of multiple independent assays markedly improved the accuracy of antibody tests in low seroprevalence communities and revealed differences in antibody kinetics depending on the viral antigen. In contrast to other reports, we conclude that immunity is durable for at least several months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Detection, prevalence, and duration of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 under conditions of limited population exposure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe COVID-19 has a high mortality rate. Comprehensive pathological descriptions of COVID-19 are scarce and limited in scope. We aimed to describe the histopathological findings and viral tropism in patients who died of severe COVID-19. Methods: In this case series, patients were considered eligible if they were older than 18 years, with premortem diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and COVID-19 listed clinically as the direct cause of death. Between March 1 and April 30, 2020, full post-mortem examinations were done on nine patients with confirmed COVID-19, including sampling of all major organs. A limited autopsy was done on one additional patient. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were done, and histopathological findings were reported by subspecialist pathologists. Viral quantitative RT-PCR analysis was done on tissue samples from a subset of patients. Findings: The median age at death of our cohort of ten patients was 73 years (IQR 52-79). Thrombotic features were observed in at least one major organ in all full autopsies, predominantly in the lung (eight [89%] of nine patients), heart (five [56%]), and kidney (four [44%]). Diffuse alveolar damage was the most consistent lung finding (all ten patients); however, organisation was noted in patients with a longer clinical course. We documented lymphocyte depletion (particularly CD8-positive T cells) in haematological organs and haemophagocytosis. Evidence of acute tubular injury was noted in all nine patients examined. Major unexpected findings were acute pancreatitis (two [22%] of nine patients), adrenal micro-infarction (three [33%]), pericarditis (two [22%]), disseminated mucormycosis (one [10%] of ten patients), aortic dissection (one [11%] of nine patients), and marantic endocarditis (one [11%]). Viral genomes were detected outside of the respiratory tract in four of five patients. The presence of subgenomic viral RNA transcripts provided evidence of active viral replication outside the respiratory tract in three of five patients. Interpretation: Our series supports clinical data showing that the four dominant interrelated pathological processes in severe COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage, thrombosis, haemophagocytosis, and immune cell depletion. Additionally, we report here several novel autopsy findings including pancreatitis, pericarditis, adrenal micro-infarction, secondary disseminated mucormycosis, and brain microglial activation, which require additional investigation to understand their role in COVID-19.

We tested the hypothesis that self-reported changes in alcohol use during the pandemic (frequency, quantity, heavy episodic drinking) would relate to perceptions of peers' changes in alcohol use. In April of 2020, 507 college students self-reported changes in their alcohol use and perceived changes in use for typical students at their university (i.e., norms). Most students in our sample reported decreased alcohol use and perceived decreases in peers' alcohol use. Perceptions of peers' changes in alcohol use behavior strongly related to changes in students' own alcohol use. Findings provide strong support for norms-based strategies that can correct normative misperceptions by highlighting the fact that most college students are not in fact engaging in heavier alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Changes in college student alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Are perceived drinking norms still relevant?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most public health measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are based on preventing the pathogen spread, and the use of oral antiseptics has been proposed as a strategy to reduce transmission risk.

This is a multi-centre, blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial that tests the effect of four mouthwashes (cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, povidone-iodine and hydrogen peroxide) in SARS-CoV-2 salivary load measured by qPCR at baseline and 30, 60 and 120 min after the mouthrinse.

There were no statistically significant changes in salivary viral load after the use of the different mouthwashes. Although oral antiseptics have shown virucidal effects in vitro, our data show that salivary viral load in COVID-19 patients was not affected by the tested treatments. This could reflect that those mouthwashes are not effective in vivo, or that viral particles are not infective but viral RNA is still detected by PCR. Viral infectivity studies after the use of mouthwashes are therefore required.

We developed a process including acid leaching, solvent extraction and stripping in order to recycle spent catalyst. In this study, we conducted selective recovery of molybdenum through focus on finding an optimized extraction and stripping process by comparing different extractants and stripping agents. To separate molybdenum from other metals efficiently and figure out the mechanism of extraction process, the five different extractants of methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride, tri-n-octylamine, tris(2-ethylhexyl) amine, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate and tributyl phosphate with different functional groups were examined, the extraction ability and extraction mechanism of these five extractants were systematically studied under the same system for the first time. It was found that more than 98% of the molybdenum could be extracted with an organic phase consisting of tri-n-octylamine or methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride under the optimal conditions. The result indicated that the tri-n-octylamine and methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride possess excellent molybdenum extraction ability, the extraction capacity of the rest extractants was in the order of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate > tris(2-ethylhexyl) amine > tributyl phosphate. In the stripping process, NH4OH, NaOH and H2SO4 were chosen as stripping agent to strip the molybdenum from the loaded tri-n-octylamine organic phase. the stripping ability of the three studied stripping agent were in the order NaOH > NH4OH > H2SO4.

Therefore, understanding differences in the local and systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between children and adults may provide important clues about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this, we first generated a healthy reference multi-omics single cell data set from children (n=30) in whom we have profiled triple matched samples: nasal and tracheal brushings and PBMCs, where we track the developmental changes for 42 airway and 31 blood cell populations from infancy, through childhood to adolescence. This has revealed the presence of naive B and T lymphocytes in neonates and infants with a unique gene expression signature bearing hallmarks of innate immunity. We then contrast the healthy reference with equivalent data from severe paediatric and adult COVID-19 patients (total n=27), from the same three types of samples: upper and lower airways and blood. We found striking differences: children with COVID-19 as opposed to adults had a higher proportion of innate lymphoid and non-clonally expanded naive T cells in peripheral blood, and a limited interferon-response signature. In the airway epithelium, we found the highest viral load in goblet and ciliated cells and describe a novel inflammatory epithelial cell population. These cells represent a transitional regenerative state between secretory and ciliated cells; they were found in healthy children and were enriched in pediatric and adult COVID-19 patients. Epithelial cells display an antiviral and neutrophil-recruiting gene signature that is weaker in severe paediatric versus adult COVID-19. Our matched blood and airway samples allowed us to study the spatial dynamics of infection.

However, with the escalating number of suspected cases, traditional diagnosis via CXR fails to deliver results within a short period of time. Therefore, it is crucial to employ artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance CXRs for obtaining quick and accurate diagnoses. Previous studies have reported the feasibility of utilizing deep learning methods to screen for COVID-19 using CXR and CT results. However, these models only use a single deep learning network for chest radiograph detection; the accuracy of this approach required further improvement. METHODS: In this study, we propose a three-step hybrid ensemble model, including a feature extractor, a feature selector, and a classifier. First, a pre-trained AlexNet with an improved structure extracts the original image features. Then, the ReliefF algorithm is adopted to sort the extracted features, and a trial-and-error approach is used to select the n most important features to reduce the feature dimension. Finally, an SVM classifier provides classification results based on the n selected features. RESULTS: Compared to five existing models (InceptionV3: 97.916  0.408%; SqueezeNet: 97.189  0.526%; VGG19: 96.520  1.220%; ResNet50: 97.476  0.513%; ResNet101: 98.241  0.209%), the proposed model demonstrated the best performance in terms of overall accuracy rate (98.642  0.398%).

The prognosis for patients with carotid artery injury, especially when combined with multi-organ trauma, is the gravest. Significantly better treatment results were achieved with both acute and iatrogenic injuries. This is mainly due to easier and quicker diagnosis and better conditions for assisting patients.

METHODS: A systematic research was conducted in the electronic database MEDLINE (PubMed) in June 2017-July 2020, collecting evidences without time restrictions. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The keywords used were OM 85 BV AND chronic bronchitis and OM 85 BV AND COPD. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed considering the costs for a treatment with OM-8BV, the costs for the treatment of an acute exacerbation and the number of prevented exacerbations. RESULTS: 59 publications were found, but the meta-analysis was conducted on 13 studies that met the inclusion criteria.

During the COVID-19 outbreak and aftermath, studies examining loneliness in older adults reported mixed results with increased, decreased, and static levels of loneliness. These inconsistent findings likely relate to pandemic-related phenomena of amplified social isolation (e.g., quarantines, social distancing, remote work) for some, and an increased sense of social connectedness (e.g., shared interests, challenges and experiences, greater media engagement) for others. To our knowledge, only one study has examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults with pre-existing major depression. Most were resilient, with no overall change in depression, anxiety, and suicidality scores, however loneliness was not explicitly considered. As such, since loneliness and depression are interrelated in older adults, we sought to examine whether loneliness in non-remitted older depressed patients was impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A brief survey instrument was developed that included relevant socio-demographic information, a modified Older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) scale for assessing perceived health status, a question on communication during the pandemic adapted from the Questionnaire for Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Older Adults (QAICPOA), a question on consumption of COVID-19 related news coverage, and the UCLA 3-item Loneliness Scale for three different time points: prior to the pandemic (retrospective self-rating), during the height of the pandemic (defined as between the declaration of a formal pandemic in March 2020 until vaccinations began in December 2020) (retrospective self-rating), and currently at the time of survey administration in Fall 2021 (contemporaneous rating). To ensure a homogeneous patient population, eligibility criteria included a primary diagnosis of a major depressive disorder without psychosis, cognitive impairment, secondary psychiatric disorders, or a remitted state. All patients were active registrants in the Zucker Hillside Hospital (ZHH) Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic. A list of eligible patient names and contacts were generated through the IT department by abstracting information from the electronic health record. As per Northwell's IRB review, this survey project met the criteria outlined in 45 CFR 46.101 for IRB exemption. Eligible patients were called and asked to complete the survey over the phone. Data for the current pilot sample were analyzed using a two-tailed paired t-test with a threshold of significance of p 0.05. Results 106 patients met eligibility criteria. To date, 30 patients completed telephone surveys. The mean age of these respondents was 73.5 (SD  6.39) years. 73.3% (n = 22) were female and 26.1% (n = 8) were male. 63.3% of patients were white, 16.6% were Black, 13.3% were Hispanic, and 6.6% were Asian. 50% of patients were married, 26.6% were divorced, and 23.3% were widowed. 10% of patients were still working, while the remaining 90% were retired. 33.3% of patients had an associate, bachelor's, or graduate/advanced degree, 63.3% of patients completed high school, and 3.3% had not. 73% lived with at least one other person and 27% lived alone. 86.7% had one or more children and 13.3% were childless. The mean OARS score was 3.16 (SD  1.88) (range 0-6, worse to best perceived health). Compared to prior to the pandemic, 46.6 % of patients reported less communication with friends and family, 46.6 % reported they communicated the same, and 6.7% said they communicated more. Mean COVID-related news consumption rating (range 1-5, 5 = most) was 3.8 (SD  1.3). Mean UCLA 3-item loneliness scale (range 3-9) scores were 4.97 (SD  1.85) prior to the pandemic, 6.47 (SD  1.89) during the height of the pandemic, and 5.37 (SD  2.11) in the Fall 2021 vaccination period. A significant difference existed between loneliness scores prior to the pandemic and worsening loneliness during the height of the pandemic (p<0.0001). A significant difference also was found between loneliness scores during the height of the pandemic and improving loneliness during the less acute pandemic vaccination period (p < 0.005). There was no significant difference between loneliness prior to and after the height of the pandemic. Conclusions In a representative pilot sample (expansion ongoing) of older depressed adults, loneliness increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of prior findings of largely stable mental health parameters and resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak in a similar population, this suggests that loneliness is a unique human experience not necessarily alleviated by effective coping strategies. That loneliness significantly improved with a likely sense of incipient normalization reenforces that it is a dynamic psychological state subject to intervention.

Contact precautions by means of personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to remove PPE, and how to make sure HCW use PPE as instructed. OBJECTIVES To evaluate which type of full body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of self-contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE (PubMed up to 15 July 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Trials (CENTRAL up to 18 June 2019), Scopus (Scopus 18 June 2019), CINAHL (EBSCOhost 31 July 2018), and OSH-Update (up to 31 December 2018). We also screened reference lists of included trials and relevant reviews, and contacted NGOs and manufacturers of PPE. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all controlled studies that compared the effects of PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases with serious consequences, such as Ebola or SARS, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. This included studies that used simulated contamination with fluorescent markers or a non-pathogenic virus.We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training in PPE use on the same outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included trials. We planned to perform meta-analyses but did not find sufficiently similar studies to combine their results. MAIN RESULTS We included 17 studies with 1950 participants evaluating 21 interventions. Ten studies are Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), one is a quasi RCT and six have a non-randomised controlled design. Two studies are awaiting assessment.Ten studies compared types of PPE but only six of these reported sufficient data. Six studies compared different types of donning and doffing and three studies evaluated different types of training. Fifteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless viruses. In simulation studies, contamination rates varied from 10% to 100% of participants for all types of PPE. In one study HCW were exposed to Ebola and in another to SARS.Evidence for all outcomes is based on single studies and is very low quality.Different types of PPEPPE made of more breathable material may not lead to more contamination spots on the trunk (Mean Difference (MD) 1.60 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -0.15 to 3.35) than more water repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46; 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5).Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (MD large patches -1.36 95% CI -1.78 to -0.94).The use of a powered air-purifying respirator may protect better than a simple ensemble of PPE without such respirator (Relative Risk (RR) 0.27; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.43).Five different PPE ensembles (such as gown vs. coverall, boots with or without covers, hood vs. cap, length and number of gloves) were evaluated in one study, but there were no event data available for compared groups.Alterations to PPE design may lead to less contamination such as added tabs to grab masks (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31), a sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), or a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55) compared to standard PPE.Different methods of donning and doffing proceduresDouble gloving may lead to less contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.78).Following CDC recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (MD small patches -5.44; 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45).Alcohol-based hand rub used during the doffing process may not lead to less contamination than the use of a hypochlorite based solution (MD 4.00; 95% CI 0.47 to 34.24).Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4).Different types of trainingThe use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7).A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70; 95% CI 20.14,41.26) than a traditional lecture.Face to face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only.There were no studies on effects of training in the long term or on resource use.The quality of the evidence is very low for all comparisons because of high risk of bias in all studies, indirectness of evidence, and small numbers of participants. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found very low quality evidence that more breathable types of PPE may not lead to more contamination, but may have greater user satisfaction. Alterations to PPE, such as tabs to grab may decrease contamination. Double gloving, following CDC doffing guidance, and spoken instructions during doffing may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than video or folder based training. Because data come from single small studies with high risk of bias, we are uncertain about the estimates of effects.We still need randomised controlled trials to find out which training works best in the long term. We need better simulation studies conducted with several dozen participants to find out which PPE protects best, and what is the safest way to remove PPE. Consensus on the best way to conduct simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should have their use of PPE registered and should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection in the field.","output":"Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plants such as climbers characterized by stems or tendrils need to find a potential support (e.g., pole, stick, other plants or trees) to reach greater light exposure. Since the time when Darwin carried out research on climbing plants, several studies on plants' searching and attachment behaviors have demonstrated their unique ability to process some features of a support to modulate their movements accordingly. Nevertheless, the strategies underlying this ability have yet to be uncovered. The present research tries to fill this gap by investigating how the interaction between above- (i.e., stems, tendrils, ) and below-ground (i.e., the root system) plant organs influences the kinematics of their approach-to-grasp movements. Using three-dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis, we characterized the movements of pea plants (Pisum sativum L.) as they leaned towards supports whose below- and above-ground parts were characterized by different thicknesses (i.e., thin below- thick above-ground, or the opposite). As a control condition, the plants were placed next to supports with the same thickness below and above ground (i.e., either entirely thin or thick). The results suggest that the information regarding below- and above-ground parts of a support appears to be integrated and modulates the reach-to-grasp behavior of the plant. Information about the support conveyed by the root system seems to be particularly important to achieve the end-goal of movement.","output":"Kinematic Evidence of Root-to-Shoot Signaling for the Coding of Support Thickness in Pea Plants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019 the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has hit the world, causing the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic. With the emergence and spread of the new infection, there has been unprecedented pressure on health care systems around the world. The time constraints associated with receiving routine care also affected the risk group - cancer patients, as some hospitals were quarantined. Violation of the terms of both systemic drug, radiation and surgical treatment of cancer patients could lead to the progression of the tumor process and lead to the death of the patient. In connection with the current situation, doctors had to quickly change the tactics of managing cancer patients, due to the lack of accurate data on the basis of which it is possible to determine the optimal approach to the use of therapy, they had to make decisions in conditions of lack of data. The article shows an example of the treatment of 113 patients being treated in the department of surgical treatment of bone and soft tissue tumors in National Medical Research Radiological Center of the Ministry of Health of Russia during the first wave of the pandemic from March 30 to July 1, 2020. Surgical treatment was performed in 103 patients. During the period of stay in the hospital, 11 patients showed signs of coronavirus infection. Of these, 10 patients were diagnosed with coronavirus infection in the postoperative period. According to the study, the nosocomial incidence of COVID-19 is 10%. With timely diagnosis and specialized treatment, the survival rate was 100% in the given example. Consequently, if epidemiological measures are observed at all stages of hospitalization, it is possible to carry out planned surgical treatment for patients with primary and secondary lesions of bones and soft tissues.

We found that, compared to seronegative controls, mice that were seropositive at least to Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and Mycoplasma pulmonis: (i) exhibited a higher interindividual variability in all the parameters quantifying metastatic progression; (ii) had elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines both before and at the end of the experiment; (iii) were more susceptible to hepatic metastasis. Interestingly, final levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-18 correlated with the extent of hepatic colonization by the melanoma cells. To confirm the metastasis-enhancing effect of MHV and M. pulmonis we measured the ability of B16M cells to metastasize in pathogen-free animals housed for increasing time-intervals in the vicinity of MHV(+) animals. Notably, susceptibility to metastasis was lower in animals seronegative to MHV than in MHV(+) mice, whereas the latter were less susceptible to metastasis than MHV(+) M. pulmonis(+) mice. Seropositive animals had increased levels of TNF- and IL-18 suggesting that MHV and M. pulmonis enhance the metastatic ability of melanoma cells by inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines. While our results highlight the importance of using pathogen-free animals in metastasis studies, they emphasize the need for a comprehensive health monitoring of the mice used in such studies, particularly in case of using facilities lacking appropriate containment measures.","output":"Effect of Asymptomatic Natural Infections due to Common Mouse Pathogens on the Metastatic Progression of B16 Murine Melanoma in C57BL/6 Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to describe the incidence of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in pregnant COVID-19 patients, explore the association between LFTs with current medication, and provide a reference for medical therapy of pregnant patients with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective single tertiary center cohort study included 122 pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted and treated from April 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020. We defined abnormal LFTs as the elevation of the following liver enzymes in serum per our hospital's laboratory reference range standards: AST > 35 U/L, ALT > 35 U/L, and TBIL > 1.2 mg/dL. We evaluated patients for demographic and clinical features, laboratory parameters, medications, and hospital length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Patients in this cohort had clinical presentations of fever (84.4%), dry cough (78.6%), and shortness of breathing (6.5%). In total, 17 (13.9%) patients had abnormal LFTs during hospitalization. Critically ill patients were three-fold higher in the abnormal LFTs group (11.8%) than in the normal LFTs group (3.8%, p = 0.16). The proportion of patients who used hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir were significantly higher in patients with abnormal LFTs (88.2% and 35.3%, respectively) than those with normal LFTs (62.9% and 15.2%, p = 0.04 and p = 0.04, respectively). The hospital length of stay (LOS) was significantly longer in the abnormal LFTs group (8.2  5.8 days) than in the normal LFT group (6.0  2.8 days, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 may induce liver injury and the LFT abnormality was generally mild in pregnant patients with COVID-19. Abnormal LFTs are associated with prolonged hospital LOS. Drug use was the most crucial risk factor for liver injury during hospitalization. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine were significantly higher, and the course of treatment of these drugs was significantly longer in pregnant women with abnormal LFTs than the patients with normal LFTs. Therefore, pregnant women with COVID-19 who received antiviral treatment should be closely monitored for evaluating LFTs.","output":"Abnormal liver function tests in pregnant patients with COVID-19 - a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection is associated with a hypercoagulable state. Severe COVID-19 patients present with high plasma fibrinogen levels, continuous deposition of fibrin and the presence of microthrombi in their lungs, accompanied by significant fibrinolysis, resulting in high D-dimer levels. Due to the role of FXIII in fibrin crosslinking and clot stabilization, we analyzed its activity levels and dynamics in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: FXIII levels were measured in thirty four COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the ICU and in fourteen non-severe COVID-19 patients. FVIII levels were measured for comparison. Laboratory data and clinical variables were recorded. RESULTS: The average FXIII activity level in 34 ICU hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 69.933 %, significantly lower compared to an average of 12020.9 % FXIII activity in 14 non-severe COVID-19 patients. FXIII activity levels were below the low normal value (< 79 % FXIII activity) in 74 % of the ICU hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In contrast, high FVIII activity was measured among all severe COVID-19 patients. Consecutive measurements, performed in fourteen ICU hospitalized COVID-19 patients, pointed to a significant decrease in FXIII activity from the average of 85.728.2 %, (which is in the normal range), to an average of 68.020.4 %, below the low normal range, within 6.43.4 days of ICU hospitalization. Liver functions did not differentiate between patients with low and normal FXIII activity. No inhibitor to FXIII activity was found in the plasma of severe COVID-19 patients. Levels of FXIII-A antigen correlated with FXIII activity, and were low in severe COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low FXIII activity levels were found in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the ICU, with gradual decline during their hospitalization.

METHODS: Digital databases were queried to study the safety of RAASi in COVID-19. The primary outcome of interest was mortality. The secondary outcome was seropositivity improvement/viral clearance, clinical manifestation progression, and progression to intensive care units. A random-effect model was used to compute an unadjusted odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: A total of 49 observational studies were included in the analysis consisting of 83,269 COVID-19 patients (RAASi n = 34,691; non-RAASi n = 48,578). The mean age of the sample was 64, and 56% were males. We found that RAASi was associated with similar mortality outcomes as compared to non-RAASi groups (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.99-1.15; p > 0.05). RAASi was associated with seropositivity improvement including negative RT-PCR or antibodies, (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99; p < 0.05). There was no association between RAASi versus control with progression to ICU admission (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.79-1.23; p > 0.05) or higher odds of worsening of clinical manifestations (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.97-1.11; p > 0.05).

VR remote communication applications offer a greater sense of co-presence and mutual sensing of emotions between remote users. Previous research on these applications has shown that realistic point cloud user reconstructions offer better immersion and communication as compared to synthetic user avatars. However, photorealistic point clouds require a large volume of data per frame and are challenging to transmit over bandwidth-limited networks.

MAIN MEASURES The primary outcome was the likelihood of intervening around an observed racist encounter or a racist policy. Predictor variables included age, gender identity, race/ethnicity, and attitudes about racism. KEY RESULTS Although the majority of the 948 respondents endorsed the impact of racism on health and other societal effects, levels of endorsement were lower among older individuals, or those reporting male gender identity or selecting other race. Higher endorsement of the impact of racism on health was associated with increased odds of speaking up about a racist encounter or racist policy, with odds ratios from 1.18 to 1.30 across scenarios.

Results: Until then, the most clinical trials were set up in China. Treatment approaches are the most frequent purpose of the registered studies. Chloroquine, interferon, and antiviral agents such as remdesivir, lopinavir, and ritonavir are agents under investigation in these trials. Conclusions: In this study, we introduced the promising therapeutic options that many researchers and clinicians are interested in, and to address the hidden issues behind clinical trials in this COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A Comprehensive Analysis of Clinical Trials in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends continuing azithromycin mass drug administration (MDA) for trachoma until endemic regions drop below 5% prevalence of active trachoma in children aged 1C9 years. Azithromycin targets the ocular strains of Chlamydia trachomatis that cause trachoma. Regions with low prevalence of active trachoma may have little if any ocular chlamydia, and, thus, may not benefit from azithromycin treatment. Understanding what happens to active trachoma and ocular chlamydia prevalence after stopping azithromycin MDA may improve future treatment decisions. We systematically reviewed published evidence for community prevalence of both active trachoma and ocular chlamydia after cessation of azithromycin distribution. We searched electronic databases for all peer-reviewed studies published before May 2020 that included at least 2 post-MDA surveillance surveys of ocular chlamydia and/or the active trachoma marker, trachomatous inflammationCfollicular (TF) prevalence. We assessed trends in the prevalence of both indicators over time after stopping azithromycin MDA. Of 140 identified studies, 21 met inclusion criteria and were used for qualitative synthesis. Post-MDA, we found a gradual increase in ocular chlamydia infection prevalence over time, while TF prevalence generally gradually declined. Ocular chlamydia infection may be a better measurement tool compared to TF for detecting trachoma recrudescence in communities after stopping azithromycin MDA. These findings may guide future trachoma treatment and surveillance efforts.","output":"Stopping azithromycin mass drug administration for trachoma: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With unclear characteristics of post-infection and post-vaccination immunity, the multiple sclerosis community lacks evidence to guide patients on their continued coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection risk. As disease modifying treatments all modulate the immune system, we expect their use to alter acquired immunity to COVID-19, but the specific impact of individual treatments is unclear. To address this, we analyzed the patient and COVID-19 specific characteristics associated with post-infection humoral immunity in 58 patients with central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disorders in the Boston metropolitan area. Univariate analysis of variance was performed using Mann Whitney U test for continuous variables, and Chi Square or Fisher Exact test for nominal variables. Univariate and stepwise multivariate nominal logistic regression identified clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19 specific nucleocapsid IgG antibody formation post-infection. Our cohort demonstrated a 42% post-infection seropositive rate with a significantly higher rate observed with shorter duration between infection and antibody collection and use of natalizumab over no/other treatment. Use of anti-CD20 treatments compared to no/other treatment was associated with a significantly lower rate of seropositivity. However, only shorter duration between infection and antibody collection as well as use of no/other treatment compared to anti-CD20 treatment were found to be independently associated with increased likelihood of post-infection seropositivity. Additionally, we demonstrate durability of antibody response up to 9 months in a small subset of patients. Thus, our data supports that patients with CNS demyelinating disorders regardless of DMT are able to form a measurable antibody response after COVID-19 infection, and that patients on anti-CD20 treatments form less robust immunity after COVID-19 infection.","output":"Blunted Post-COVID-19 Humoral Immunity in Patients With CNS Demyelinating Disorders on Anti-CD20 Treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main goal of this study is to analyze the relation between commercial trade and pandemic severity in society, in order to support new hypotheses which can explain transmission dynamics of COVID-19, as well as promote policy responses to cope with future epidemics similar to COVID-19. This study considers the role of trade in the dynamics of pandemic diffusion, within and between countries, which has not been investigated yet in this emerging field of research. We focus on three large countries in Europe: Italy, France, and Spain. The analysis is performed at regional level (involving in total 52 European regions). Results suggest that the association between trade and pandemic severity seems to be supported by empirical evidence, making it possible to introduce new hypotheses for explaining transmission dynamics of COVID-19 within and between countries. In particular, international trade data is supposed to be used as a comprehensive indicator accounting for population density, economic dynamism, and human mobility. The statistical analyses, also in a multivariate context, strongly support this hypothesis and suggest that crisis management has to focus in the very first place on infections occurring outside the national boundaries, in order to cope with pandemic threat of new waves of COVID-19 and future similar epidemics/pandemics.","output":"Can commercial trade represent the main indicator of the COVID-19 diffusion due to human-to-human interactions?

As B.1.1.7 can be sensitively detected using the Thermo Fisher TaqPath S-gene RT-PCR test, contact tracing and isolation programs appear well-suited to slowing the spread of the new variant, which is still rare in most of the dozens of countries in which it has been identified. However, key determinants of outcomes such as data-sharing, trace success, and isolation compliance vary widely between regions, which may discourage public health agencies from explicitly redirecting existing contact tracers to contain B.1.1.7. Here we apply a branching-process model to estimate the effectiveness of implementing a B.1.1.7-focused testing, contact tracing, and isolation strategy with realistic levels of performance. Our model indicates that bidirectional contact tracing can substantially slow the spread of B.1.1.7 even in regions where a large fraction of the population refuses to cooperate with contact tracers or to abide by quarantine and isolation requests.","output":"The feasibility of targeted test-trace-isolate for the control of B.1.1.7"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicated the calcium-binding protein S100A12 to be involved in the pathophysiology of pulmonary inflammatory diseases. However, the role of S100A12 has remained elusive in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Therefore, the purpose of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate the association between serum S100A12 with severity and prognosis in CAP patients. METHODS: Two groups with either 239 CAP patients or 239 healthy controls were enrolled in our study. Fasting blood and clinical characteristics were collected. On admission, serum S100A12 was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Serum S100A12 was increased in CAP patients compared to control subjects. Furthermore, serum S100A12 was elevated according to the severity of CAP. Correlative analysis suggested that the level of serum S100A12 was associated with blood routine indices, renal function markers, inflammatory cytokines and other clinical parameters among CAP patients. Additionally, linear and logistical regression analyses indicated that serum S100A12 was positively associated with CAP severity scores in CAP patients. In addition, the association of high serum S100A12 and prognosis was accessed using a follow-up research. Elevated serum S100A12 on admission increased the risk of death and hospital stay in CAP patients during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum S100A12 on admission is positively associated with the severity and adverse prognosis in CAP patients, suggesting that S100A12 may involve in the pathophysiological process of CAP.

A well-accepted strategy is to definitively reduce and fix one part of the fracture (commonly the posterior articular surface in a pilon or tibial plateau fracture) with the patient in one position, and then reposition the patient to access the other side of the fracture. The change of position prolongs the anaesthetic and surgical time. In the context of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it also causes concern with donning and doffing. We describe a mobile floppy lateral position that enables dual approaches to the ankle, distal tibia, tibial plateau, and the acetabulum without having to change the patient positioning. The patient is positioned lateral on a radiolucent table, usually with the affected side on top. No supports are placed around the pelvis, allowing the patient's pelvis to flop forwards or backwards. Two supports are placed around the chest and a strap is placed to secure the patient to the table if deemed necessary. The initial surgical procedure can be performed by flopping the patient's pelvis forwards, allowing access to the posterior leg, knee or hip. Once satisfactory fixation is achieved, the pelvis is rolled backwards to allow access to the anterior aspect of the fracture.","output":"Reinventing the floppy lateral position for dual approaches in COVID-19 times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought numerous ethical dilemmas to the forefront of clinical care, including for resident and fellow physician trainees.

These dilemmas are related to personal health risk, resource allocation, health care inequities, and media relations. The authors use a framework of microethics to underscore how these dilemmas are highly contextualized within trainees institutions, their specific roles, and the patient populations to which they provide care. They argue that frequent ethical dilemmas, compounded by the intense physical and emotional stress of medical training and the pandemic itself, increase the potential for trainees to experience moral distress. Recurrent moral distress may, in turn, put trainees at risk for moral injury with consequences for their mental health and overall well-being. It is imperative to gain a clear understanding of this issue, not only for those trainees who have experienced or are at risk for experiencing personal consequences but also because it may help identify ways to better support the well-being of providers and the care of patients going forward.","output":"Ethical Dilemmas, Moral Distress, and the Risk of Moral Injury: Experiences of Residents and Fellows During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ERG11 sequencing of 28 Candida auris clade III isolates revealed the presence of concomitant V125A and F126L substitutions.

Given that Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) are known to be activated during and participate in inflammatory processes, we examined whether HERV dysregulation signatures are present in COVID-19 patients. Results: By comparing transcriptomes of Peripheral Blood Monocytes (PBMCs) and Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) from patients and normal controls we have shown that HERVs are intensely dysregulated in BALF, but not in PBMCs. In particular, upregulation in the expression of multiple HERV families was detected in BALF samples of COVID-19 patients, with HERV-W being the most highly upregulated family among the families analysed. In addition, we compared the expression of HERVs in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (HBECs) without and after senescence induction in an oncogene-induced senescence model, in order to quantitatively measure changes in the expression of HERVs in bronchial cells during the processes of cellular senescence. Conclusions: This apparent difference of HERV dysregulation between PBMCs and BALF warrants further studies in involvement of HERVs in inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms as well as exploration of HERVs as potential biomarkers for disease progression. Furthermore, the increase in the expression of HERVs in senescent HBECs in comparison to non-induced HBECs provides a potential link for increased COVID-19 severity and mortality in aged populations.","output":"Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retroviruses in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid of COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The deadly pandemic of 21st century has spread its wings across the globe with an exponential increase in the number of cases in many countries The novel corona virus, responsible for the pandemic originated from Hubei province of China and the highly contagious nature of the virus soon crippled the world This work presents a framework to predict the growth rate of the corona virus disease in the upcoming week in China and hence forth predict the rate of spread of the disease in the upcoming week Using available data about the confirmed cases, death cases and recovery cases, this study defines the status of the disease in terms of Total Active Cases percentage till a given date, cumulatively ? 2020, Research Trend All rights reserved","output":"Predicting the rate of growth of the novel corona virus 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are in the high-risk group of getting COVID-19 infection and experiencing a severe course.

The level of fear in the patient group having adjuvant therapy has been found statistically to be significantly higher compared with groups having neoadjuvant and metastatic/palliative therapy (p: 0.004).

METHODS: Data was extracted from the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a probability sample of the Dutch population, with assessments on loneliness in October 2019 (T1) and June 2020 (T4), and anxiety and depression symptoms in November 2019 (T2), March 2020 (T3) and June 2020 (T4; Ntotal = 4,084). Loneliness was examined with the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale and anxiety and depression symptoms with the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). RESULTS: Repeated measures multivariate logistic regression analyses (RMMLRA) showed a statistical significant lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms after the outbreak (T4 = 15.3%) than before (T2 = 16.8%) and during the COVID-19 outbreak (T3 = 17.2%). According to the Reliable Change Index, the distribution of recovery categories (remission, improvement, unchanged and worsening symptoms) after the outbreak did not differ significantly from the distribution of these categories before the outbreak. RMMLRA revealed that the prevalence of emotional loneliness increased significantly after the outbreak (T1 = 18.4%, T4 = 24.8%). Among individuals who were not lonely before and after the outbreak the prevalence of symptoms decreased significantly (T2 = 7.0%, T4 = 4.4%) and, likewise, among those who were not lonely anymore after the outbreak (T2 = 21.5%, T4 = 14.5%). However, the prevalence of symptoms increased significantly among those who became lonely during the pandemic (T2 = 17.9%, T4 = 26.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that this pandemic did not negatively affect the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms nor the normal recovery of symptoms among the general population during the first four months, but that emotional loneliness increased.","output":"Anxiety and depression symptoms, the recovery from symptoms, and loneliness before and after the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population: Findings from a Dutch population-based longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 forced institutions to think and act differently. Southeast Missouri State University launched a HyFlex pilot with 100 sections in fall 2020. AY350 (Animal Reproduction) is one course that converted to HyFlex and offered two sections in the pilot. The objective of this study was to determine if students were more successful in HyFlex courses compared to the traditional course, grades were compared from 2019 and 2020. A survey of Chief Online Officers identified that institutions on average converted more than 1500 sections as an emergency response to the pandemic (Garrett, et al., 2020). HyFlex is one approach institutions used to provide more flexible learning opportunities for students. In a HyFlex course, students can choose to learn in face-to-face, fully online, or synchronously online (Beatty, 2019). Research on student success in Hyflex is scant, however early research shows no significant difference in student success across modalities (Rhoads, 2020). Using a One Way T-test, we analyzed letter grade outcomes for students who enrolled in traditional (n=25) mode to those that enrolled in the HyFlex (n=44) modality. Findings show an increase in A and B course grades and a decrease in C grades, and conflicts with the Rhoads (2020) research which found no significant difference. Additionally, no students failed the HyFlex section(s). Specific variables of Test 3 (p< 0.02) and Final exams (p< 0.002) contributed to significant grade changes. Overall, using a traditional grade point average (GPA) scale where A=4.0, B=3.0, etc. the HyFlex course GPA mean was 3.269 and face-to-face 2.65 (p=0.002). Future research is planned to explore student success in HyFlex across the institution.

METHODS We collected data of 757 patients with pulmonary metastasis from colorectal cancer who underwent curative metastasectomy between 2004 and 2008 from 46 Japanese institutions, from which we extracted data on patients who previously received curative hepatic metastasectomy. Disease-free survival, overall survival, and prognostic factors were analyzed. RESULTS The subjects of this study were 160 patients, of whom 44% had primary rectal tumor, 73% had a single pulmonary metastasis, 11% had a bilateral pulmonary metastasis, and 39% had high (>5 ng/mL) serum carcinoembryonic antigen. Patients' median age was 66 years, and 58% were male. The median follow-up was 64 months. Five-year overall survival and disease-free survival were 65.2% (95% confidence interval, 56.8-72.5) and 33.5% (95% confidence interval, 26.1-41.0), respectively. In multivariable analyses, high prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen level was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-3.47) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.41-3.12). Five-year overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with normal prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen level were 76.4% (95% confidence interval, 66.1-83.9) and 40.7% (95% confidence interval, 30.5-50.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS After pulmonary metastasectomy, approximately two thirds of patients with colorectal cancer with a history of curative hepatic metastasectomy survived for 5 years-half of them disease-free.

First, we isolated and characterized cASCs and cASCs-EVs to use for the improvement of canine atopic dermatitis. Here, we investigated the effect of cASCs or cASC-EVs on DNCB-induced AD in mice, before using for canine AD. Interestingly, we found that cASCs and cASC-EVs improved AD-like dermatitis, and markedly decreased levels of serum IgE, (49.6%, p = 0.002 and 32.1%, p = 0.016 respectively) epidermal inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-4 (32%, p = 0.197 and 44%, p = 0.094 respectively), IL-13 (47.4%, p = 0.163, and 50.0%, p = 0.039 respectively), IL-31 (64.3%, p = 0.030 and 76.2%, p = 0.016 respectively), RANTES (66.7%, p = 0.002 and 55.6%, p = 0.007) and TARC (64%, p = 0.016 and 86%, p = 0.010 respectively). In addition, cASCs or cASC-EVs promoted skin barrier repair by restoring transepidermal water loss, enhancing stratum corneum hydration and upregulating the expression levels of epidermal differentiation proteins. Moreover, cASCs or cASC-EVs reduced IL-31/TRPA1-mediated pruritus and activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Taken together, these results suggest the potential of cASCs or cASC-EVs for the treatment of chronic inflammation and damaged skin barrier in AD or canine AD.","output":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Canine Adipose Tissue Ameliorates Inflammation, Skin Barrier Function and Pruritus by Reducing JAK/STAT Signaling in Atopic Dermatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, public perceptions and behaviours have had to adapt rapidly to new risk scenarios and radical behavioural restrictions. AIM: To identify major drivers of acceptance of protective behaviours during the 4-week transition from virtually no COVID-19 cases to the nationwide lockdown in Germany (3C25 March 2020). METHODS: A serial cross-sectional online survey was administered weekly to ca 1,000 unique individuals for four data collection rounds in March 2020 using non-probability quota samples, representative of the German adult population between 18 and 74 years in terms of age  sex and federal state (n = 3,910). Acceptance of restrictions was regressed on sociodemographic variables, time and psychological variables, e.g. trust, risk perceptions, self-efficacy. Extraction of homogenous clusters was based on knowledge and behaviour. RESULTS: Acceptance of restrictive policies increased with participants age and employment in the healthcare sector; cognitive and particularly affective risk perceptions were further significant predictors. Acceptance increased over time, as trust in institutions became more relevant and trust in media became less relevant. The cluster analysis further indicated that having a higher education increased the gap between knowledge and behaviour. Trust in institutions was related to conversion of knowledge into action. CONCLUSION: Identifying relevant principles that increase acceptance will remain crucial to the development of strategies that help adjust behaviour to control the pandemic, possibly for years to come. Based on our findings, we provide operational recommendations for health authorities regarding data collection, health communication and outreach.","output":"The four weeks before lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: a weekly serial cross-sectional survey on risk perceptions, knowledge, public trust and behaviour, 3 to 25 March 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the strict quarantine measures ease and the availability of vaccines, reports have proposed that people of varying ages are now less likely to wear mask despite its added protection and safety against COVID-19.

This study assessed a short-term evolution of vitamin D status and its influence upon different clinical parameters in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: A prospective analytical study in which 37 critically ill volunteers between 41 and 71 years of age with COVID-19 were evaluated at baseline and three days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. 25-OH-D(3) and 25-OH-D(2) were analyzed by liquid chromatographyCtandem mass spectrometry and total 25-OH-D levels were calculated as the sum of both. Results: All patients presented low 25-OH-D levels at baseline, decreasing total 25-OH-D (p = 0.011) mainly through 25-OH-D(2) (p = 0.006) levels during ICU stay. 25-OH-D(2) levels decreased a mean of 41.6%  89.6% versus 7.0%  23.4% for the 25-OH-D(3) form during the ICU stay. Patients who did not need invasive mechanical ventilation presented higher levels of 25-OH-D(2) at baseline and follow-up. Lower 25-OH-D and 25-OH-D(3) levels were associated with higher D-dimer at baseline (p = 0.003; p = 0.001) and at follow up (p = 0.029), higher procalcitonin levels (p = 0.002; p = 0.018) at follow up, and lower percentage lymphocyte counts (p = 0.044; p = 0.040) during ICU stay. Conclusions: Deficient vitamin D status in critical patients was established at the admission and further worsened after three days of stay. Lower vitamin D levels were related to key altered clinical and biochemical parameters on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the different response of the 25-OH-D(3) and 25-OH-D(2) forms, it would be useful to monitor them on the evolution of the critically ill patient.","output":"Bad Prognosis in Critical Ill Patients with COVID-19 during Short-Term ICU Stay regarding Vitamin D Levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a causal factor of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

When adjusted effects were unavailable, unadjusted data were analysed. RESULTS: Of 42 observational studies (38 retrospective), 7 reported adjusted outcomes for ICIs and 2 provided sufficient individual patient data to calculate adjusted outcomes.

The market has seen a recent influx of unproven extraoral scavengers (EOSs), which claim to reduce the risk of particulate spread.Aims To investigate the efficacy of a commercially available EOS device on contamination reduction during dental aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). The secondary aim was to investigate differences between open and closed dental operatories.Method Dental procedures were simulated on a dental manikin using citric acid (10%) added to the water lines with universal indicating paper (UIP) placed in strategic locations in the operatory, on the clinician and assistant. Chromatic change related to settling of splatter containing citric acid on the UIP was analysed to calculate percentage intensity of splatter contamination.Results EOSs resulted in 20% reduction in frequency and 75% reduction in mean intensity of contamination of operatory sites. There was a 33% and 76% reduction in mean intensity contamination for clinician and assistant, respectively. Use of rubber dam and four-handed dentistry resulted in further reduction.Discussion This exploratory study demonstrates contamination by splatter in a simulated dental setting. The concern in dentistry regarding aerosol requires further quantitative investigation of smaller particles.Conclusions The routine use of four-handed dentistry and rubber dam should continue where possible to maximise risk mitigation during AGPs. However, on the basis of our findings, the use of an EOS device can further mitigate the magnitude and concentration of splatter.","output":"The efficacy of an extraoral scavenging device on reduction of splatter contamination during dental aerosol generating procedures: an exploratory study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which is spreading all over the world and causing huge human and economic losses.

However, the precise underlying mechanisms through which PM2.5 promotes the development of COPD remains largely unknown. METHODS: Mouse alveolar destruction were determined by histological analysis of lung tissues and lung function test. Alveolar type II cells (AT2) to alveolar type I cells (AT1) transition in PM2.5-induced COPD mouse model was confirmed via immunofluorescence staining and qPCR analysis. The differentially expressed genes in PM2.5-induced COPD mouse model were identified by RNA-sequencing of alveolar epithelial organoids and generated by bioinformatics analysis. RESULTS: In this study, we found that 6 months exposure of PM2.5 induced a significantly decreased pulmonary compliance and resulted in pulmonary emphysema in mice. We showed that PM2.5 exposure significantly reduced the AT2 to AT1 cell transition in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we found a reduced expression of the intermediate AT2-AT1 cell process marker claudin 4 (CLDN4) at day 4 of differentiation in mouse alveolar organoids treated with PM2.5, suggesting that PM2.5 exposure inhibited AT2 cells from entering the transdifferentiation process. RNA-sequencing of mouse alveolar organoids showed that several key signaling pathways that involved in the AT2 to AT1 cell transition were significantly altered including the Wnt signaling, MAPK signaling and signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells following PM2.5 exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these data demonstrate a critical role of AT2 to AT1 cell transition in PM2.5-induced COPD mouse model and reveal the signaling pathways that potentially regulate AT2 to AT1 cell transition during this process. Our findings therefore advance the current knowledge of PM2.5-induced COPD and may lead to a novel therapeutic strategy to treat this disease.

Inflexible responding is observed early in the course of the illness and contributes to the financial and social morbidities of FTD. Reversal learning is an established cognitive paradigm that indexes flexible responding in the face of feedback signaling a change in reinforcement contingencies, with components of reversal learning associated with specific neurotransmitter systems. The objective of the study was to evaluate the neural mechanisms underlying impaired flexible behavioural responding in FTD using a reversal learning paradigm combined with fMRI. METHODS Twenty-two patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for FTD and twenty-one healthy controls completed the study. Participants completed an fMRI-adapted reversal learning task that indexes behavioural flexibility when provided positive and negative feedback. RESULTS Patients with FTD demonstrated poorer behavioural flexibility relative to controls and abnormal BOLD responses within the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to incorrect responses made during the learning phase, and during correct responses when reward contingencies were reversed. As well, patients showed decreased activity within the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex to incorrect responses compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that reversal learning impairments in patients with FTD, in particular those with frontal predominant atrophy, may be related to impaired flexible motor responding when selecting among several choices and deficient attention to relevant stimuli during instances of conflict (i.e., receiving negative feedback). These results and the associated neurotransmitter systems mediating these regions may provide targets for future pharmacological or behavioural interventions mediating these cognitive deficits.","output":"Neural correlates of reversal learning in frontotemporal dementia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide health emergency caused by COVID-19 is a new challenge for humanity which individuals respond to in a diversity of ways.

Procedures were performed in a hybrid operating suite using the ARTIS Pheno cone beam computerized tomography scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, German). Patient information included past history of malignancy as well as lesion size, depth, location, and histology result. Surgical complications and length of stay were also recorded. RESULTS: Five procedures were performed on 4 patients during the study period. One patient underwent bilateral procedures 4 weeks apart. All patients underwent at least 1 ablation and 1 wedge resection during the combined procedure. Patient ages ranged from 40 to 66 years and the majority (75%) were men. All had a past history of cancer. Lesions were treated in every lobe. Size and depth ranged from 6 to 24 mm and 21 to 33 mm, respectively, for ablated nodules and 5 to 27 mm and 0 to 22 mm, respectively, for the wedge resected nodules. Three procedures were completed uniportal and operative time ranged from 51 to 210 minutes. All cases sustained <10 mL blood loss. There were 2 intraoperative pneumothorax, 1 prevented successful completion of the ablation. One patient required a prolonged period of postoperative physiotherapy and was discharged on day 6.

However, there has been considerable controversy surrounding some treatments. This includes hydroxychloroquine where the initial hype and misinformation lead to shortages, price rises and suicides. Price rises and shortages have also been seen for PPE. Such activities can have catastrophic effects on patients where there are high co-payment levels and issues of affordability. Consequently, there is a need to investigate this further. Objective: Assess changes in the availability, utilization and prices of relevant medicines and PPE during the pandemic among a range of Asian countries. Our approach: Narrative literature review combined with interviews among community pharmacists to assess changes in consumption, prices and shortages of medicines and PPE from the beginning of March 2020 until end of May 2020. In addition, suggestions on ways to reduce misinformation. Results: 308 pharmacists took part from five Asian countries. There was an appreciable increase in the utilization of antimicrobials in Pakistan (in over 88% of pharmacies), with lower increases or no change in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia and Vietnam. Encouragingly, there was increased use of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE across the countries, as well as limited price rises for antimicrobials in India, Malaysia and Vietnam, although greater price rises seen for analgesics and vitamin C/immune boosters.

The national government enforced an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) that restricted the movement of the population. The Philippine General Hospital (PGH), a tertiary government hospital, was designated as one of three COVID-19 referral centers in the capital. These curtailed the delivery of services offered to non-COVID-19 cases, such as malignancy. Cancer management, however, should remain a priority as any delay would potentially cause disease progression. For locally-advanced, non-metastatic rectal cancer, neoadjuvant therapy may be given for specific indications. At the PGH, long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT) followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy is the often-employed regimen for patients with stage II-III rectal cancer. Methods/Interventions: This was an observational single cohort study that included all patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer who were managed at the PGH from March 16 to May 31, 2020, coinciding with the lockdown. The management received, including modifications;and their outcomes were investigated. Results/Outcome(s): Of the 52 patients included-majority were female (58%), belonging to the 50-69 years age group (54%), and residing outside the capital (60%). On following-up them up, 13 (25%) had no disease progression, 8 (15%) had local progression, 15 (29%) had metastatic progression, 10 (19%) have died, and 6 (12%) were lost to follow-up. Among those with non-metastatic disease, 2 were to undergo outright resection, but 1 decided to have her surgery done in her locality. The remaining 19 required neoadjuvant therapy-9 LCCRT, 5 LCCRT with chemotherapy, 2 short-course radiotherapy with chemotherapy (RAPIDO), 3 neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As of writing, 8 have completed their neoadjuvant treatment, 8 are undergoing treatment, 2 had their treatment interrupted, and 1 has yet to begin treatment. No treatment-associated complication was reported. The initial plan for 10 patients, as agreed upon by a multidisciplinary team, was changed. Among those who completed neoadjuvant therapy (9 patients), only 1 was able to undergo resection on time. The rest were delayed, with a median time of 4 months. One had postoperative complications (i.e. ileus and superficial surgical site infection). One has repeatedly failed to arrive for her surgery. There was one adjuvant chemotherapy- related mortality. Conclusions/Discussion: Delays in rectal cancer management due to the pandemic resulted in disease progression in several patients. Alternative neoadjuvant treatment options based on sound evidence should be considered, while taking into account oncologic outcomes, acceptable toxicity, and limitation of potential COVID-19 exposure. Investigating the long-term effects of these management principles in a larger population may provide data that support the applicability of these regimens in our setting.","output":"Modifications to treatment plan of rectal cancer in response to COVID-19 at the Philippine general hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiological models assume gravity-like interactions of individuals across space without microfoundations.

This study aimed to investigate the influence of the pandemic on consultation status and initial treatment in patients with primary oesophageal cancer. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among 546 patients with oesophageal cancer who visited our hospital from April 2018 to March 2021. Pre-pandemic and pandemic data were compared with the clinical features, oncological factors and initial treatment as outcome measures. RESULTS: Diagnoses of oesophageal cancer decreased during the early phase of the pandemic from April to June (P = 0.048); however, there was no significant difference between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods throughout the year. The proportion of patients diagnosed with distant metastases significantly increased during the pandemic (P = 0.026), while the proportion of those who underwent initial radical treatment decreased (P = 0.044).

Yet, how mRNA vaccines stimulate the immune system to elicit protective immune responses is unknown. Here we used a systems biological approach to comprehensively profile the innate and adaptive immune responses in 56 healthy volunteers vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Vaccination resulted in robust production of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the parent strain and the variant of concern, B.1.351, but no induction of autoantibodies, and significant increases in antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells after the second dose. The innate response induced within the first 2 days of booster vaccination was profoundly increased, relative to the response at corresponding times after priming. Thus, there was a striking increase in the: (i) frequency of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes;(ii) concentration of IFN- y in the plasma, which correlated with enhanced pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 levels in monocytes and T cells;and (iii) transcriptional signatures of innate responses characteristic of antiviral vaccine responses against pandemic influenza, HIV and Ebola, within 2 days following booster vaccination compared to primary vaccination. Consistent with these observations, single-cell transcriptomics analysis of 242,479 leukocytes demonstrated a ~100-fold increase in the frequency of a myeloid cluster, enriched in a signature of interferon-response transcription factors (TFs) and reduced in AP-1 TFs, one day after secondary immunization, at day 21. Finally, we delineated distinct molecular pathways of innate activation that correlate with CD8 T cell and nAb responses and identified an early monocyte-related signature that was associated with the breadth of the nAb response against the B1.351 variant strain.

Based on the pathomechanisms related to the compromised mitochondrial health and in the context of primary, secondary, and tertiary care, a broad spectrum of conditions can significantly benefit from robust quantification systems using MHI/BHI as a prototype to be further improved. Following health conditions can benefit from that: planned pregnancies (improved outcomes for mother and offspring health), suboptimal health conditions with reversible health damage, suboptimal life-style patterns and metabolic syndrome(s) predisposition, multi-factorial stress conditions, genotoxic environment, ischemic stroke of unclear aetiology, phenotypic predisposition to aggressive cancer subtypes, pathologies associated with premature aging and neuro/degeneration, acute infectious diseases such as COVID-19 pandemics, among others.","output":"Mitochondrial health quality control: measurements and interpretation in the framework of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study examined the causes and consequences of stress generation in university students in Japan. A two-wave longitudinal study with an 8- or 9-week interval was conducted in the fall of 2020. Undergraduate and graduate students at four universities in Japan (N = 201) completed self-report measures assessing experiences of negative interpersonal dependent events, negative non-interpersonal events, and negative independent events at two times. At the same time, they also responded to measures of aggressive behaviors, trait rumination, and depressive symptoms. Path analyses revealed that baseline aggressive behaviors were positively associated with an increase in subsequent negative interpersonal dependent events, even after controlling for the influences of negative interpersonal dependent events, rumination, and depressive symptoms at baseline. However, aggressive behaviors were not significantly associated with subsequent negative non-interpersonal dependent events or negative independent events. These findings suggest that aggressive behaviors may have been a factor leading to interpersonal stress generation. Furthermore, all categories of negative event experiences predicted an increase in subsequent depressive symptoms, but not subsequent rumination, and rumination was not significantly associated with subsequent depressive symptoms. This research extends previous studies on the causes and consequences of stress generation conducted in the US by using specific measures of aggressive behaviors and including a non-restricted sample of university students in Japan.

Understanding institutional volume patterns allows training directors to create a schedule that maximizes learning opportunities while also adequately staffing the ED. Our primary objective of this study was to utilize heat-mapping software to optimize resident staffing in an academic ED. Methods Heat-mapping tools within Microsoft Excel were utilized to overlay ED patient arrival patterns on top of the potential patients per hour based on published productivity data for trainees and historical averages for advanced practice providers at our institution. Time frames for under- and overstaffing were identified and color-coded. This analysis informed a revised schedule template and the same heat-mapping process was used to determine the appropriateness of the revised staffing template. Results The heat map for the original schedule template revealed understaffing in the morning and overstaffing the rest of the day. Informed by these findings, schedule adjustments were made. There was no net increase in the number of resident or advanced practice provider coverage hours. Prior to implementation, the ED was understaffed by 5% or more during 18.4% of operating hours. Following changes to the staffing template, only 5.9% of operating hours were understaffed (p < 0.001). Furthermore, significant understaffing (20% or more) decreased from 16.6% to 3.1% (p < 0.001).

We hypothesized that characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity correlate with disease severity. METHODS: In this study, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells and antibodies were characterized in uninfected controls and patients with different COVID-19 related disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells were flow-cytometrically quantified after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools and analyzed for expression of cytokines (IFN?3, IL-2 and TNF&#945;) and markers for activation, proliferation and functional anergy. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies were quantified using ELISA. Moreover, global characteristics of lymphocyte subpopulations were compared between patient groups and uninfected controlsResults: Despite severe lymphopenia affecting all major lymphocyte subpopulations, patients with severe disease mounted significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells as compared to convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T-cells dominated over CD8 T-cells and closely correlated with the number of plasmablasts and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA- and IgG-levels. Unlike in convalescents, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells in patients with severe disease showed marked alterations in phenotypical and functional properties, which also extended to CD4 and CD8 T-cells in general. CONCLUSION: Given the strong induction of specific immunity to control viral replication in patients with severe disease, the functionally altered characteristics may result from the need for contraction of specific and general immunity to counteract excessive immunopathology in the lung.

METHODS This is a two-arm, prospectively-enrolled, observational, patient-reported outcomes study, performed between 06/2019-11/2020 at a single academic medical center. Inclusion criteria were men undergoing an outpatient ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (transrectal or transperineal approach, without MRI guidance). Patients with a history of Gleason 7+ prostate cancer were excluded. Validated survey instruments were utilized to assess baseline (Short Form 12) and testing-related (testing morbidities index [TMI]) health utility states. The primary outcome was the TMI summary testing-related quality-of-life score (summary utility score; scale: 0=death and 1=perfect health). The TMI is comprised of 7 domains, spanning pre-, during- and post-testing experiences. Each domain is scored from 1 (no health impact) to 5 (extreme health impact). Testing-related quality-of-life measures were compared with Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS Enrollment rates were 80% (60/75; transrectal) and 86% (60/70; transperineal).

Though classically associated to pathology, reports on novel functional roles of these proteins have increasingly emerged in the past decade. Moreover, the recent discovery that amyloids formed with rationally designed small peptides can exhibit catalytic reactivity has opened up new opportunities in both biology and biotechnology. The observed activities typically require the binding of divalent metals, giving rise to active metal-amyloid complexes. METHODS: Peptide (SDIDVFI) was aggregated in vitro. The structure of the self-assembled species was analyzed using fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, circular dichroism and computational modeling. A kinetic characterization of the emerging catalytic activity was performed. RESULTS: The peptide self-assembled into canonical amyloids that exhibited catalytic activity towards hydrolysis of the phosphoanhydride bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), partially mimicking an ATPase-like enzyme. Both amyloid formation and activity are shown to depend on manganese (Mn2+) binding. The activity was not restricted to ATP but also affected all other ribonucleotides (GTP, CTP and UTP). Peptides carrying a single aspartate exhibited a similar activity. CONCLUSIONS: The phosphoanhydride bonds appear as the main specificity target of the Mn2+-amyloid complex. A single aspartate per peptide is sufficient to enable the hydrolytic activity. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Catalytic amyloids are shown for the first time to catalyze the hydrolysis of all four ribonucleotides.

Omicron variant did not evolve out of one of the early VOCs, but instead it belongs to a complete different genetic lineage from previous ones. Strains classified as Omicron variants evolved from ancestors that existed around May 15th, 2020, suggesting that this VOC may have been circulating undetected for a period of time until its emergence was observed in South Africa. A rate of evolution of 5.61  10?4 substitutions/site/year was found for Omicron strains enrolled in these analyses. The results of these studies demonstrate that S genes have suitable genetic information for clear assignment of emerging VOCs to its specific genotypes.","output":"An evolutionary insight into Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Omicron variant of concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we contribute a multi-faceted study into Pavlovian signalling -- a process by which learned, temporally extended predictions made by one agent inform decision-making by another agent. Signalling is intimately connected to time and timing. In service of generating and receiving signals, humans and other animals are known to represent time, determine time since past events, predict the time until a future stimulus, and both recognize and generate patterns that unfold in time. We investigate how different temporal processes impact coordination and signalling between learning agents by introducing a partially observable decision-making domain we call the Frost Hollow. In this domain, a prediction learning agent and a reinforcement learning agent are coupled into a two-part decision-making system that works to acquire sparse reward while avoiding time-conditional hazards. We evaluate two domain variations: machine agents interacting in a seven-state linear walk, and human-machine interaction in a virtual-reality environment. Our results showcase the speed of learning for Pavlovian signalling, the impact that different temporal representations do (and do not) have on agent-agent coordination, and how temporal aliasing impacts agent-agent and human-agent interactions differently. As a main contribution, we establish Pavlovian signalling as a natural bridge between fixed signalling paradigms and fully adaptive communication learning between two agents. We further show how to computationally build this adaptive signalling process out of a fixed signalling process, characterized by fast continual prediction learning and minimal constraints on the nature of the agent receiving signals. Our results therefore suggest an actionable, constructivist path towards communication learning between reinforcement learning agents.","output":"Pavlovian Signalling with General Value Functions in Agent-Agent Temporal Decision Making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Postoperative bleeding is a common and potentially life-threatening complication. Precise identification of risk factors in addition to the basic ones, such as coagulation parameters, is certainly very desirable. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify other possible risk factors for bleeding after adenoidectomy in children. DESIGN: This observational prospective study enrolled children undergoing adenoidectomy from October 2019 to February 2020, then evaluated the influence of possible risk factors for bleeding. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric otorhinolaryngology center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 288 children aged 0C18 years undergoing adenoidectomy for recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, recurrent acute otitis media, secretory otitis media, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Increased blood pressure and time of surgery were identified as risk factors for bleeding after adenoidectomy. RESULTS: Elevated systolic (p = 0.046), diastolic (p = 0.012), and mean arterial blood pressure (p = 0.007) (MannCWhitney U test) as adjusted for age-specific distributions and with corrections for height and weight, as well as time length of surgery (p < 0.001) (Fishers exact test) were revealed as statistically significant risk factors for postoperative bleeding. Atmospheric pressure, surgeons level of experiences, chronic inflammatory content in adenoid vegetation (AV), size of AV, recidivism of AV, recurrent infections of the upper respiratory tract, type of anesthesia, long-term using of drugs, and positive coagulation questionnaire or pathology in standard coagulation tests were not found to be risk factors for bleeding after adenoidectomy.

The data from past and present outbreaks indicate that individuals with comorbidities are significantly more susceptible to infections and yield poorer clinical outcomes. Our simulation study revealed that the prevention of morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease bears an enormous potential to decrease the COVID-19 death toll.

However, due to the very high demands of face masks, especially the N95-type mask typically worn by medical workers, the public faces a shortage of face masks. Many papers have been published recently that focus on developing new and facile techniques to reuse and reinforce commercially available face masks. For instance, the N95 mask uses a polymer-based (membrane) filter inside, and the filter membrane can be replaced if needed. Another polymer sputtering technique by using a simple cotton candy machine could provide a cheap and robust solution for face mask fabrication. This review discuss the novel approaches of face mask reuse and reinforcement specifically by using membrane-based technology.

Brushite and its anhydrous form monetite are among the most interesting resorbable calcium phosphate phases that can be applied as cements and for in situ fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) implants. Of these two dicalcium phosphate compounds, monetite is more stable and undergoes slower degradation than brushite. The purpose of the current study is to synthesize and dope monetite with the antimicrobial elements silver and zinc and the osteoinductive element strontium and investigate the possible structural variations as well as their biocompatibility and antimicrobial effectiveness. For this, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) were used to thoroughly study the synthesized structures. Moreover, the ASTM E-2149-01 protocol and a cell proliferation assay were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and the cytocompatibility of the different phases with the Soas-2 cell line, respectively. The results confirm the successful synthesis and doping procedures, such that zinc was the most incorporated element into the monetite phase and strontium was the least incorporated element. The microbiological studies revealed that silver is a very effective antimicrobial agent at low concentrations but unsuitable at high concentrations because its cytotoxicity would prevail. On the other hand, doping the compounds with zinc led to a reasonable antimicrobial activity without compromising the biocompatibility to obviously high concentrations. The study also highlights that strontium, widely known for its osteoinductivity, bears an antimicrobial effect at high concentrations. The generated doped compounds could be beneficial for prospective studies as bone cements or for scaffold biomaterial applications.","output":"Probing the Structure, Cytocompatibility, and Antimicrobial Efficacy of Silver-, Strontium-, and Zinc-Doped Monetite"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease and a major global health-related issue.

We examined the changes in incidence rates of selected encounter-based outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We assembled a cohort of members from 8 Vaccine Safety Datalink sites from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2020. Using ICD-10 diagnosis codes or laboratory criteria, we identified 21 incident outcomes in traditional in-person settings and all settings. We defined 4 periods in 2020: January-February (pre-pandemic), April-June (early pandemic), July-September (middle pandemic), and October-December (late pandemic). We defined four corresponding periods in each year during 2017C2019. We calculated incidence rates, conducted difference in difference (DiD) analyses, and reported ratios of incidence rate ratios (RRR) to examine changes in rates from pre-pandemic to early, middle, and late pandemic in 2020, after adjusting for changes across similar periods in 2017C2019. RESULTS: Among >10 million members, regardless of setting and after adjusting for changes during 2017C2019, we found that incidence rates of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, encephalitis/myelitis/encephalomyelitis/meningoencephalitis, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura did not significantly change from the pre-pandemic to early, middle or late pandemic periods (p-values0.05).

We selected patients from the Amsterdam University Medical Centers COVID-19 Biobank, in which patients admitted to hospital in March and April 2020, with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction proven severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection, were prospectively included. Specifically, we included postmenopausal women (>55 years) and age-matched men, with a mortality of 50% in each group. Residual plasma samples were used to measure testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and albumin. We investigated the association of the levels of these hormones with mortality in men and women. We included 16 women and 24 men in March and April 2020 of whom 7 (44%) and 13 (54%), respectively, died. Median age was 69 years (interquartile range [IQR] 64C75).

METHODS: Pregnant women are enrolled from health posts across four zones of Madre de Dios, Peru. Data are collected at enrollment, childbirth, and (planned) 36-48 months. At enrollment, hair samples for mercury assessment, demographic and clinical data are obtained. At birth, we obtain venous and cord blood, placenta, hair, toenails, and saliva. FINDINGS: Two hundred seventy mothers were enrolled at an average 20 weeks gestational age with no differences in maternal characteristics across zones. Two hundred fifteen mothers were successfully followed at birth. We obtained 214 maternal and cord blood samples, 211 maternal and 212 infant hair samples, 212 placenta samples, 210 infant saliva samples, and 214 infant dried blood spots.

RESULTS: A total of 48 research articles reporting analysis of first-hand clinical data from over 40,000 COVID-19 patients were surveyed. The patients studied therein were diagnosed with COVID-19 before May 2020. A total of 18 commonly-occurring phenotypes in these COVID-19 patients were first identified and then classified into different hierarchical groups based on the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). This meta-analytic approach revealed that fever, cough, and the loss of smell and taste were ranked as the most commonly-occurring phenotype in China, the US, and Italy, respectively. We also found that the patients from Europe and the US appeared to have more frequent occurrence of many nervous and abdominal symptom phenotypes (e.g., loss of smell, loss of taste, and diarrhea) than patients from China during the early pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board; informed consent waived. Retrospective analysis of the 65-79-year-old cohort (n = 577) from the University of Wisconsin CT colonography screening program (n = 5176) was undertaken. Performance and outcome measures including advanced neoplasia prevalence and colonoscopy referral, extracolonic finding, extracolonic work-up, and complication rates were obtained by using a CT colonography database and review of medical records. Comparisons between the older cohort and the general screening population were made by using the Student t, Pearson chi(2), and Fisher exact tests. A P value <or= .05 was considered to indicate a significant difference. RESULTS With a 6-mm threshold for positivity, the overall referral rate to optical colonoscopy was 15.3% (88 of 577), leading to 277 polypectomies and the removal of 103 nondiminutive adenomas. For adenomas, the per-patient positivity rates were 10.9% (63 of 577) and 6.8% (39 of 577) at the 6- and 10-mm thresholds, respectively. The prevalence of advanced neoplasia was 7.6% (44 of 577). Fifty-four adenomas met advanced status, and five unsuspected cancers were detected. The advanced neoplasias identified were typically large, with a mean size of 21 mm. Potentially important extracolonic findings were seen in 15.4% (89 of 577) of patients, with a work-up rate of 7.8% (45 of 577). The majority of important extracolonic diagnoses were vascular aneurysms (n = 18). No major complications were encountered.

In this report, we describe an autopsy case of a COVID-19 patient who showed two undiagnosed ulcers at the level of the anterior and posterior walls of the hypopharynx. Molecular testing of viruses involved in pharyngeal ulcers demonstrated the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome C coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, together with herpes simplex virus 1 DNA. Histopathologic analysis demonstrated full-thickness lympho-monocytic infiltration (mainly composed of CD68-positive cells), with hemorrhagic foci and necrosis of both the mucosal layer and deep skeletal muscle fibers. Fibrin and platelet microthrombi were also found. Cytological signs of HSV-1 induced damage were not found. Cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit 1 were immunohistochemically identified in the inflammatory infiltrations. Immunohistochemistry for HSV1 showed general negativity for inflammatory infiltration, although in the presence of some positive cells. Thus, histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular findings supported a direct role by SARS-CoV-2 in producing local ulcerative damage, although a possible contributory role by HSV-1 reactivation cannot be excluded. From a clinical perspective, this autopsy report of two undiagnosed lesions put the question if ulcers along the GI tract could be more common (but frequently neglected) in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Hypopharyngeal Ulcers in COVID-19: Histopathological and Virological Analyses C A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 73-year-old woman developed cognitive decline over 1 year.

We aimed to evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections in the general population in Austria. Methods This is a retrospective observational study using national SARS-CoV-2 infection data from the Austrian epidemiological reporting system. As the primary outcome, we aim to compare the odds of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections of COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (February to April 30, 2020) versus the odds of first infections in the remainder general population by tracking polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed infections of both groups during the second wave from September 1 to November 30, 2020. Re-infection counts are tentative, since it cannot be excluded that the positive PCR in the first and/or second wave might have been a false positive. Results We recorded 40 tentative re-infections in 14,840 COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (0.27%) and 253,581 infections in 8,885,640 individuals of the remaining general population (2.85%) translating into an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.09 (0.07 to 0.13).

This should be evaluated through the awareness and readiness of healthcare workers to adopt E-Health technology to reduce health information technology failures. METHODS: This study investigated the relationship between the perceived attributes of innovation and E-Health adoption decisions of healthcare workers as part of a preimplementation process. Using a cross-sectional quantitative approach, the dimensions of the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory were used to assess the E-Health readiness of 110 healthcare workers in a Mauritian specialized hospital. RESULTS: A strong inclination towards E-Health adoption was observed, where the prime stimulators were perceived as modernization of healthcare management (84.1%, ?=4.19), increased work efficiency through reduction of duplication (77.6%, ?=4.10) and faster generation of results (71.1%, ?=4.07). The findings of this study also validated the use of five DOI dimensions (i.e. relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability) in a predictability model (F(5, 101)=17.067, p<0.001) towards E-Health adoption. A significant association between adopter category and willingness to recommend E-Health adoption ((2)(8)=74.89, p<0.001) endorsed the fact that physicians and nursing managers have central roles within a social ecosystem to facilitate the diffusion of technology and influence the adoption of innovation. CONCLUSION: This is the first study of its kind in Mauritius to successfully characterize each adopter's profile and demonstrate the applicability of the DOI framework to predict the diffusion rate of E-Health platforms, while also highlighting the importance of identifying key opinion leaders who can be primed by innovators regarding the benefits of E-Health platforms, thus ensuring non-disruptive evolutionary innovation in the Mauritian healthcare sector.","output":"Assessing E-Health adoption readiness using diffusion of innovation theory and the role mediated by each adopter's category in a Mauritian context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertensive retinopathy refers to the retinal vascular changes associated with systemic arterial hypertension. Hypertensive retinopathy can be divided into chronic and acute phases. A cross-sectional study was performed to explore a method of measurement in the diameters of retinal vessels for diagnosis of chronic hypertensive retinopathy based on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The central retinal artery diameter (CRAD), the central retinal vein diameter (CRVD), and the artery-to-vein ratio (AVR) were measured. A total of 119 subjects with 119 eyes were included in this study, in which 56 subjects with 56 eyes were included in hypertensive group and 63 subjects with 63 eyes were included in normotensive group. There were significant differences between the two groups in the CRAD (t = -2.14, P = .04) and the AVR (t = -2.59, P = .01). The cutoff point of 0.75 was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (area under the curve, AUC 0.786; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 0.70-0.87). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the probability of AVR below to 0.75 was more in patients with high systolic blood pressure (odds ratio OR 4.39; P = .048), more in male (OR 4.15; P = .004) and more in smokers (OR 5.80; P = .01). Bland-Altman plots showed small mean bias between the measurements of the two technicians in the CRAD, the CRVD, and the AVR.

Using heart rate variability (HRV) as an indicator of autonomic function, we present a bottom-up genotypeCphenotype analysis to investigate the association between -AR gene polymorphisms and heart rate dynamics. METHODS: A total of 221 healthy Han Chinese adults (59 males and 162 females, aged 33.610.8 years, range 19 to 63 years) were recruited and genotyped for three common -AR polymorphisms: (1)-AR Ser49Gly, (2)-AR Arg16Gly and (2)-AR Gln27Glu. Each subject underwent two hours of electrocardiogram monitoring at rest. We applied an information-based similarity (IBS) index to measure the pairwise dissimilarity of heart rate dynamics among study subjects. RESULTS: With the aid of agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, we categorized subjects into major clusters, which were found to have significantly different distributions of (2)-AR Arg16Gly genotype. Furthermore, the non-randomness index, a nonlinear HRV measure derived from the IBS method, was significantly lower in Arg16 homozygotes than in Gly16 carriers. The non-randomness index was negatively correlated with parasympathetic-related HRV variables and positively correlated with those HRV indices reflecting a sympathovagal shift toward sympathetic activity. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a bottom-up categorization approach combining the IBS method and hierarchical cluster analysis to detect subgroups of subjects with HRV phenotypes associated with -AR polymorphisms.

Foreigner fertility in the three south Mediterranean countries differs significantly from that of nationals, with the former having higher fertility rates and lower mean age at childbearing. However, although foreigners make a large contribution to births, their impact on period fertility (total fertility rate or TFR) is limited.

However, after 2014, the foreigner period fertility among the three countries differs as a relative stabilisation is observed in Spain and Italy, while indicators rise in Greece.

Up to 99% of them are cared for by their family caregivers. Family caregivers are confronted with considerable difficulties and challenges while providing care. They often experience high levels of emotional, physical, financial, and social burdens. Caregivers in rural areas experience an even higher level of burden compared to their counterparts in urban areas due to fewer health resources for dementia care. However, so far, no intervention study has been conducted to support family caregivers in rural areas of China. The aim of this proposed study is to adapt and evaluate an evidence-based and culturally-tailored individualized telephone-based care support (ITBCS) program for family caregivers of people with dementia in rural China. METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the ITBCS compared with usual care for Chinese rural family caregivers of people with dementia. A total sample of 168 rural family caregivers will be recruited. The intervention components consist of a 3-month intensive telephone-based care support intervention followed by telephone-based follow-up consultations for 6 months. The control group will receive usual care services available for them. Outcome measures include carers subjective burden, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, social support, caregiving self-efficacy, and care recipients difficult behaviours and competence in activities of daily living at 3, 9 and 15 months after baseline. The potential cost-effectiveness of the ITBCS compared with usual care will be assessed as well. DISCUSSION: If effective, the ITBCS program can be adapted and used in rural areas of China as a blueprint to improve the quality of home-based care for people with dementia.

Secondary outcomes included muscle strength, functional independence, organ failure, nutritional status, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), length of ICU stay, and ICU mortality at ICU discharge. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled and equally distributed into the three groups. Patients undergoing routine care only were more susceptible to ICU-AW upon ICU discharge than those in the EM or EMN groups (16% vs. 2%; p = 0.014 for both), and had a lower Barthel Index than others (control vs. EM/EMN: 57.5 vs 70.0; p = 0.022). The EMN group had improved muscle strength (p = 0.028) and better nutritional status than the control group (p = 0.031). Both interventions were associated with a lower ICU-AW (EM vs. control: p = 0.027, OR [95% CI] = 0.066 [0.006C0.739]; EMN vs. control: p = 0.016, OR [95% CI] = 0.065 [0.007C0.607]). CONCLUSION: EM and EMN had positive effects. There was little difference between the effects of EM and EMN, except for muscle strength improvement. Both EM and EMN may lead to a lower occurrence of ICU-AW and better functional independence than standard care. EMN might benefit nutritional status more than usual care and promote improvement in muscle strength.","output":"Effect of early mobilization combined with early nutrition on acquired weakness in critically ill patients (EMAS): A dual-center, randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic, the overall mental health of the US population declined. Given higher rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths experienced by communities of color along with greater exposure to pandemic-related stressors (e.g., unemployment, food insecurity), we expect that the decline in mental health during the pandemic was more pronounced among Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults, with these groups also having less access to mental health services. We examine two nationally representative US surveys: the 2019 National Household Interview Survey (NHIS; N = 30,368) and the 2020C2021 Household Pulse Survey (HPS; N = 1,677,238). We find mental health of Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents worsened relative to White respondents during the pandemic, with significant increases in depression and anxiety among racialized minorities compared to Whites. There is also evidence of especially high mental health burden for Black adults around the murder of George Floyd by police and for Asian adults around the murder of six Asian women in Atlanta. White respondents are most likely to receive professional mental health care before and during the pandemic, and Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents demonstrate higher levels of unmet mental health care needs during the pandemic than White respondents. Our results indicate that within the current environment, White adults are at a large and systemic advantage buffering them from unexpected criseslike the COVID-19 pandemic. Without targeted interventions, the long-term social consequences of the pandemic and other co-occurring events (e.g., death of Black and Hispanic people by police) will likely include widening mental health disparities between racial/ethnic groups.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the relative properties of four leading candidate trial designs - 'single-factor', 'multi-arm', 'all-in-one', and 'factorial' designs - for assessing individual and/or combination prevention intervention approaches. METHODS: Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted, assuming a putative combination approach could choose its components from two candidate biomedical interventions, i.e. Treatment-as-Prevention (TasP) and Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), and three candidate behavioral interventions, i.e. linkage-to-care, counseling, and use of condoms. Various scenarios for individual components' effect sizes, their possible interaction, and the sample size based on real clinical studies are considered. RESULTS: The all-in-one and factorial designs used to assess a combination approach and the multi-arm design used to assess multiple individual components are consistently more powerful than single-factor designs. The all-in-one design is powerful when the individual components are effective without negative interaction, while the factorial design is more consistently powerful across a broad array of settings. CONCLUSIONS: The multi-arm design is useful for evaluating single factor regimens, while the all-in-one and factorial designs are sensitive in assessing the overall efficacy when there is interest in combining individual component regimens anticipated to have complementary mechanisms. The factorial design is a preferred approach when assessing combination regimens due to its favorable power properties and since it is the only design providing direct insights about the contribution of individual components to the combination approach's overall efficacy and about potential interactions.","output":"Trial designs for evaluating combination HIV prevention approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The challenges of the modern world require transformations in the energy market towards the possible reduction of consumption and greater use of renewable sources.

After SPR-based binding affinity assay, 15 compounds were found to show binding affinities to CypA at submicro-molar or micro-molar level (compounds 1C15). Seven compounds were selected as the starting point for the further structure modification in considering binding activity, synthesis difficulty, and structure similarity.

Another interesting approach would be the use of GRPR radioligands for pre-operative imaging and subsequent radio-guided surgery, with the goal to improve surgical outcome. GRPR radioligands were successfully implemented in clinical studies, especially Sarabesin 3 (SB3) is an appealing GRPR antagonist with high receptor affinity. Gallium-68 labeled SB3 has good in vivo stability, after labeling with Indium-111; however, the molecule shows poor in vivo stability, which negatively impacts tumor-targeting capacity. A novel approach to increase in vivo stability of radiopeptides is by co-administration of the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, phosphoramidon (PA). We studied in vivo stability and biodistribution of [111In]SB3 without/with (-/+) PA in mice. Furthermore, SPECT/MRI on a novel, state-of-the-art platform was performed. PROCEDURES GRPR affinity of SB3 was determined on PC295 xenograft sections using [125I]Tyr4-bombesin with tracer only or with increasing concentrations of SB3. For in vivo stability, mice were injected with 200/2000 pmol [111In]SB3 -/+ 300 g PA. Blood was collected and analyzed. Biodistribution and SPECT/MRI studies were performed at 1, 4, and 24 h postinjection (p.i.) of 2.5 MBq/200 pmol or 25 MBq/200 pmol [111In]SB3 -/+ 300 g PA in PC-3-xenografted mice. RESULTS SB3 showed high affinity for GRPR (IC50 3.5 nM). Co-administration of PA resulted in twice higher intact peptide in vivo vs [111In]SB3 alone. Biodistribution studies at 1, 4, and 24 h p.i. show higher tumor uptake values with PA co-administration (19.7  3.5 vs 10.2  1.5, 17.6  5.1 vs 8.3  1.1, 6.5  3.3 vs 3.1  1.9 % ID/g tissue (P < 0.0001)).

Monogastrics are sensitive to vomitoxin, while poultry and ruminants appear to be less sensitive to some trichothecenes through microbial metabolism of trichothecenes in the gastrointestinal tract. Trichothecene mycotoxins occur worldwide however both total concentrations and the particular mix of toxins present vary with environmental conditions. Proper agricultural practices such as avoiding late harvests, removing overwintered stubble from fields, and avoiding a corn/wheat rotation that favors Fusarium growth in residue can reduce trichothecene contamination of grains. Due to the vague nature of toxic effects attributed to low concentrations of trichothecenes, a solid link between low level exposure and a specific trichothecene is difficult to establish. Multiple factors, such as nutrition, management, and environmental conditions impact animal health and need to be evaluated with the knowledge of the mycotoxin and concentrations known to cause adverse health effects.

This is because severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is most contagious before symptom onset.

The greatest threat of transmission in healthcare facilities may therefore be patients and healthcare workers with early occult infection.

The conventional methods use manual segmentation to measure brain tissues, which is very time-consuming and inefficient. Recent deep learning achieves excellent performance in computer vision, but it is still unsatisfactory for segmenting magnetic resonance images of neonatal brains because they are immature with unique attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-modulated multi-branch convolutional neural network for neonatal brain tissue segmentation. The proposed network is built on the encoder-decoder framework by introducing both multi-scale convolutions in the encoding path and multi-branch attention modules in the decoding path. Multi-scale convolutions with different kernels are used to extract rich semantic features across large receptive fields in the encoding path. Multi-branch attention modules are used to capture abundant contextual information in the decoding path for segmenting brain tissues by fusing both local features and their corresponding global dependencies. Spatial attention connections between the encoding and decoding paths are designed to increase feature propagation for both avoiding information loss during downsampling and accelerating model training convergence. The proposed network was implemented in comparison with baseline methods on three neonatal brain datasets. Our network achieves the average Dice similarity coefficients/the average Hausdorff distances of 0.9116/8.1289, 0.9367/9.8212 and 0.8931/8.1612 on the customized dCBP2021 dataset, 0.8786/11.7863, 0.8965/13.4296 and 0.8539/10.462 on the public NBAtlas dataset, as well as 0.9253/7.7968, 0.9448/9.5472 and 0.9132/7.5877 on the public dHCP2017 dataset in partitioning the brain into gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively.

In this study we aim at assessing the presence of asymptomatic abnormalities in peripheral nerves conduction during the acute phase of COVID-19 and, their correlation with blood circulating inflammatory markers. Methods: Thirty-nine patients with COVID-19 were assessed by electroneurographic study of lower limbs and blood tests within one week of hospital admission (T0) and after 30  10 days (T1). Results: Electroneurographic changes were found at least on one nerve at T0 in 12 patients, consisting of axonal or demyelinating changes. Two biological markers were found to be significantly correlated with the presence of neuropathic changes: Reactive Protein C and lymphocyte count. Patients with pathological electrophysiology at T0 showed significant improvement of electrophysiological parameters at T1. The improvements in electroneurographic data were significantly correlated with the trend of laboratory parameters, in particular with fibrinogen, D-Dimer, ferritin, C Reactive protein and lymphocytes. None of the patients with neuropathic changes developed clinical evidence of a full-blown peripheral neuropathy over time. Conclusions: Our study shows that asymptomatic alterations of the PNS can be found during the acute phase of COVID-19. These alterations significantly improve after 20C40 days from the acute phase of infection and that the improvement correlates significantly with the trend of laboratory parameters.

Our previous research showed that HCQ suppressed RA development by inhibiting T follicular helper (Tfh) cells directly. Dendritic cells (DCs) serve as the link between innate and acquired immunity. Whether HCQ suppressed Tfh cell through DCs was not clear. In current study, we found that HCQ efficiently inhibited CD86, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression and interferon- (IFN-) secretion of healthy donor derived purified DCs stimulated by RA patient serum. To mimic RA, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was used and treated with HCQ daily for fifty-four days prior to sacrifice. We found HCQ inhibited DC maturation and migration to lymph nodes (LNs), manifested as down-regulated expression of CD40, CD80, CD86, MHCII (I-A(q)) on LN DCs. In addition, HCQ reduced the level of chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and L-selectin on peripheral blood DCs and diminished percentage of LN DCs. Of note, HCQ only inhibited CpG ODN 1826-induced IL-12 secretion by bone marrow DCs (BMDCs) stimulated by various toll like receptor (TLR) agonists. Mechanistically, HCQ down-regulated the expression of TLR9 not only in healthy donor PBMC-derived DCs stimulated by RA patient serum, but also in LN DCs of CIA mice and CpG-activated BMDCs. Furthermore, arthritis scores in TLR9(?/?) mice were much lower than that in wild type mice with impaired maturity and migration capability of DCs.

Harm reduction (HR) services, which aim to reduce the negative effects of drug use on health, are likely to be diminished in a pandemic. However, innovative HR interventions and messaging may also develop in response to such a crisis. It is vital to understand the most effective ways to deliver HR in pandemic situations so that guidance can be provided for current and future disruptions to service provision. METHODS: A rapid evidence review was conducted with the aim of exploring what HR interventions and messaging are most effective during a pandemic-type situation. Ten health databases were systematically searched using terms relevant to the research aim. A search was also made of grey literature, including a targeted search of HR messaging from key national and service provider websites. RESULTS: In the initial search, 121 pieces of evidence were identified which, after screening and de-duplication, resulted in 60 for inclusion. The included evidence consists mainly of non-peer reviewed, pre-publication or expert opinion pieces. The rapid findings suggest that HR services should be deemed essential during a pandemic, with staff supported to work safely and social distancing adaptations implemented. Services should be encouraged to operate more flexibly; for instance, in deciding the amounts of take-home supplies of injecting equipment and medications. The evidence on HR communication was very limited but key messages on infection control, uncertain drug supply and accessing services were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid evidence review identifies implications for national policy makers, commissioners and HR service providers. A person-centred rather than disease-centred approach to HR delivered by collaborating partners, as well as prioritizing tailored HR messaging, is recommended. Further research evaluating the delivery of HR services and messaging, particularly focusing on health inequalities, is urgently needed.","output":"Rapid evidence review of harm reduction interventions and messaging for people who inject drugs during pandemic events: implications for the ongoing COVID-19 response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since making its debut on the global stage in December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has afflicted nearly four million people and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths.

PHEV shares the same genomic organization, replication strategy, and expression of viral proteins as other nidoviruses. PHEV produces vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and/or encephalomyelitis, being the only known neurotropic coronavirus affecting pigs. First clinical outbreak was reported in 1957 in Ontario, Canada. Although pigs are the only species susceptible to natural PHEV infections, the virus displays neurotropism in mice and Wistar rats. Clinical disease, morbidity, and mortality is age-dependent and generally reported only in piglets under 4 weeks old. The primary site of replication of PHEV in pigs is the respiratory tract, and it can be further spread to the central nervous system through the peripheral nervous system via different pathways. The diagnosis of PHEV can be made using a combination of direct and indirect detection methods. The virus can be isolated from different tissues within the acute phase of the clinical signs using primary and secondary pig-derived cell lines. PHEV agglutinates the erythrocytes of mice, rats, chickens, and several other animals. PCR-based methods are useful to identify and subsequently isolate animals that are actively shedding the virus. The ability to detect antibodies allows producers to know the status of first-litter gilts and evaluate their risk of tier offspring to infection. PHEV is highly prevalent and circulates subclinically in most swine herds worldwide. PHEV-related disease is not clinically relevant in most of the swine-producing countries, most likely because of dams are immune to PHEV which may confer passive immunity to their offspring. However, PHEV should be considered a major source of economic loss because of the high mortality on farms with high gilt replacement rates, specific pathogen-free animals, and gnotobiotic swine herds. Thus, in the absence of current PHEV vaccines, promoting virus circulation on farms with early exposure to gilts and young sows could induce maternal immunity and prevent disease in piglets.","output":"Porcine Hemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has continued its global spread since the first documented case in late 2019 in Wuhan, China.

Before the transition, the Caltagirone pathology laboratory was characterized by a non-tracked workflow, based on paper requests, hand-written blocks and slides, as well as manual assembling and delivering of the cases and glass slides to the pathologists. Moreover, the arrangement of the spaces and offices in the department was illogical and under-productive for the linearity of the workflow. For these reasons, an adequate 2D barcode system for tracking purposes, the redistribution of the spaces inside the laboratory and the implementation of the whole-slide imaging (WSI) technology based on a laboratory information system (LIS)-centric approach were adopted as a needed prerequisite to switch to a digital workflow. The adoption of a dedicated connection for transfer of clinical and administrative data between different software and interfaces using an internationally recognised standard (Health Level 7, HL7) in the pathology department further facilitated the transition, helping in the integration of the LIS with WSI scanners.

RESULTS The sample included 99 pediatric primary care practices and 1228 staff (physicians n = 169, advanced practice providers n = 70, nurses n = 338, and administration/management n = 651). The \\"teamwork\\" domain had the highest positive ratings (81.6% positive responses), whereas the \\"work pressure and pace\\" domain had the lowest positive ratings (28.6% positive response). There were no differences in perceptions of safety or quality based on practice size or ownership. However, there were differences based on staff roles, specifically between administration/management and direct care staff. CONCLUSIONS Overall, perceptions of the culture of safety and quality in pediatric primary care practices were positive. Differences in perceptions existed based on staff role. Future studies are needed to determine whether differences are clinically meaningful and how to narrow differences in perceptions among staff and improve of the culture of safety as a mechanism to improve the safety and quality of pediatric primary care.","output":"Evaluation of the Culture of Safety and Quality in Pediatric Primary Care Practices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Removal (SIR) model with time fused coefficients.

In September 2020 most schools and universities in Spain reopened and teachers felt great uncertainty due to this unprecedented situation. Teachers have accumulated psychological symptoms since the beginning of the pandemic. During the lockdown they had to introduce online teaching and in view of the reopening of schools they have shown great concern for the new unprecedented teaching situation. The present study aims to measure the symptomatology shown by teaching staff in the Basque Autonomous Community at the time when schools were reopened. To do this, we recruited a sample of 1,633 teachers who were given an online questionnaire which, in addition to collecting socio-demographic data, measured stress, anxiety and depression using the DASS-21scale. The results revealed that a high percentage of teachers showed anxiety, depression and stress symptoms. Furthermore, variables such as gender, age, job stability, the level of education at which they teach and parental status also influence this symptomatology. We argue for the need to safeguard the mental health of teachers in order to improve both the quality of teaching and the mental health of students.","output":"The Psychological State of Teachers During the COVID-19 Crisis: The Challenge of Returning to Face-to-Face Teaching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a need to better understand protective factors for mental and psychological wellbeing beyond the absence of disease. The current review sought to synthesise empirical (qualitative and quantitative) evidence on this topic to inform the development of future mental health and wellbeing interventions for Australian adults. Systematic searches of health and behavioural science databases were conducted to identify studies on protective factors for mental and psychological wellbeing in Australian adults. A total of 38 studies were included based on the following criteria: studies conducted in Australia from 2009 to present;articles written in English;articles which reported on empirical research, articles that were peer-reviewed, and research where study participants were Australian adults (>18 years). Data extraction was conducted using Covidence, and design quality was assessed according to the Levels of Evidence hierarchy. There was consistent evidence that components of social capital, physical and other lifestyle factors, individual attributes and creative arts constitute protective factors for mental and psychological wellbeing in Australian adults. The high prevalence of cross-sectional and self-report studies suggests more randomised and longitudinal research is needed. Additional qualitative research would facilitate a more detailed understanding of participants' lived experiences and perspectives. Existing evidence indicates a significant, positive relationship between social capital, physical and other lifestyle factors, individual attributes and creative arts engagement, and mental and psychological wellbeing among particular groups of Australian adults.

Indole is widely used as a medical material owing to its astounding biological activities. Indole and its derivatives belong to a significant category of heterocyclic compounds that have been used as a crucial component for several syntheses of medicine. A straightforward one-pot three-component synthesis of indole, coupled with Mannich base derivatives 1aC1j, was synthesized without a catalyst. The products were confirmed by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, mass spectra, and elemental analysis. The indole derivatives were tested for cytotoxic activity, using three cancer cell lines and normal cell lines of Human embryonic kidney cell (HEK293), liver cell (LO2), and lung cell (MRC5) by MTT assay using doxorubicin as the standard drug. The result of cytotoxicity indole compound 1c (HepG2, LC(50)?0.9 m, MCF?7, LC(50)?0.55 m, HeLa, LC(50)?0.50 m) was found to have high activity compared with other compounds used for the same purpose.

A viable alternative in the telemedicine field to guarantee patient nutritional care is telenutrition. Telenutrition involves the interactive use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to implement the nutrition care process with patients at a remote location. Information regarding the experience with this methodology and its potential effect on patients nutritional goals, does not exist in Peru. The aim of the study was to report the effect of the evaluation type (telenutrition vs. in-person) on weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and relative fat mass (RFM) in overweight and obese adult patients. Methods: This retrospective study included 100 eligible patients in a single nutritional center, from January 2019 to March 2021. Telenutrition and in-person continuous variables were compared with independent sample t-test or U Mann-Whitney test. Results: There were significant differences in weight, BMI, WC and RFM by the end of follow-up period, in both evaluation modalities. Patients on the telenutrition group had a mean decrease of 6.80  4.87 cm in WC, whereas the mean difference observed for the in-person group was 6.74  4.55 cm. There were no significant differences in the changes of any anthropometric parameters when comparing both systems. Reductions were observed in weight (5.93  3.88 kg vs. 4.92  3.29 kg), BMI (2.23  1.39 kg/ m2 vs. 1.83  1.23 kg/ m2), WC (6.80  4.87 cm vs. 6.74  4.55 cm) and RFM (2.43  1.78 vs. 2.63  1.73) in telenutrition and in-person evaluation, respectively by the end of the follow-up period.

While the global source sink dynamics of the different seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, its local spread remains less clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective reproduction number changed over the course of the season. We find trends in transmission dynamics correlated positively with trends in temperature, but not relative humidity nor school holidays. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network, while school children likely drove the spread within the remaining transmission network. These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other influenza seasons and cities. Author summary As shown with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, respiratory diseases can quickly spread around the globe. While it can be hugely important to understand how diseases spread around the globe, local spread is most often the main driver of novel infections of respiratory diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We here use genetic sequence data alongside patient information to better understand what the drives the local spread of influenza by looking at the 2016/2017 influenza season in Basel, Switzerland as an example. The genetic sequence data allows us to reconstruct the how the transmission dynamics changed over the course of the season, which we correlate to changes, but not humidity or school holidays. Additionally, the genetic sequence data allows us to see how individual cases are connected. Using patient information, such as age and household status our analyses suggest that the elderly mainly transmit within their own transmission network. Additionally, they suggest that school aged children, but not pre-school aged children are important drivers of the local spread of influenza.","output":"Characterising the epidemic spread of Influenza A/H3N2 within a city through phylogenetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cellular localization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the lungs of patients with SARS is important in confirming the etiological association of the virus with disease as well as in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. To our knowledge, there have been no comprehensive studies investigating viral infection at the cellular level in humans. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected the largest series of fatal cases of SARS with autopsy material to date by merging the pathological material from two regions involved in the 2003 worldwide SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, China, and Toronto, Canada. We developed a monoclonal antibody against the SARS-CoV nucleoprotein and used it together with in situ hybridization (ISH) to analyze the autopsy lung tissues of 32 patients with SARS from Hong Kong and Toronto. We compared the results of these assays with the pulmonary pathologies and the clinical course of illness for each patient. SARS-CoV nucleoprotein and RNA were detected by immunohistochemistry and ISH, respectively, primarily in alveolar pneumocytes and, less frequently, in macrophages. Such localization was detected in four of the seven patients who died within two weeks of illness onset, and in none of the 25 patients who died later than two weeks after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: The pulmonary alveolar epithelium is the chief target of SARS-CoV, with macrophages infected subsequently. Viral replication appears to be limited to the first two weeks after symptom onset, with little evidence of continued widespread replication after this period. If antiviral therapy is considered for future treatment, it should be focused on this two-week period of acute clinical disease.","output":"Time Course and Cellular Localization of SARS-CoV Nucleoprotein and RNA in Lungs from Fatal Cases of SARS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) level, a known risk factor for vascular disease, is reported to be an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in most studies. tHcy may also be associated with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Objective: To investigate the association between plasma tHcy levels and DLB or AD. Methods: This is a case-control study including 132 DLB patients, 264 AD patients, and 295 age-matched healthy controls. We used multivariate logistic regression model to analyze the data with adjustments for confounding variables. Results: The highest tHcy tertile (>13.9 mol/L) was significantly independently associated with DLB [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 4.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.95-11.10, P = 0.001] and AD (adjusted OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.02-3.23, P = 0.041) compared to the lowest tertile (<10.7 mol/L). The cumulative frequency plots showed a shift in the distribution of the tHcy concentrations to higher values in patients with DLB compared to AD. The mean tHcy levels were stable and not altered by the duration of cognitive impairment prior to the collection of blood samples from DLB patients. Conclusion: Elevated plasma tHcy levels were independently associated with DLB, and the association was stronger for DLB than for AD. The lack of a relationship between tHcy levels and symptom duration may refute these observed associations being a consequence of DLB, and future longitudinal studies will be required to confirm whether tHcy plays a causative role in DLB.","output":"Association of Elevated Plasma Total Homocysteine With Dementia With Lewy Bodies: A Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information is the most potent protective weapon we have to combat a pandemic, at both the individual and global level.

Fully leveraging the power of information, however, requires large amounts of data and access to it. To achieve this, we are making steps to form an international consortium, Coronavirus Census Collective (CCC, coronaviruscensuscollective.org), that will serve as a hub for integrating information from multiple data sources that can be utilized to understand, monitor, predict, and combat global pandemics.

To assess the analytical performance of the SD BIOLINE Rota/Adeno Rapid kit, we determined its detection limit, reproducibility, cross-reactivity, and analytical reactivity for adenovirus subtypes, and performed interference studies. RESULTS: The overall agreement rates among the tested methods were 91.5% for rotavirus and 85.5% for adenovirus.

Understanding the psychological consequences of the UKs lockdown for children and adolescents, the associated risk factors, and how trajectories may vary for children and adolescents in different circumstances is essential so that the most vulnerable children and adolescents can be identified and appropriate support can be implemented. Methods Parents and carers (n = 2988) in the U.K. with children and adolescents aged between 4 and 16 years completed an online survey about their childs mental health. Growth curve analysis was used to examine the changes in conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and emotional symptoms between the end of March/beginning of April and July using data from four monthly assessments. Additionally, growth mixture modelling identified mental health trajectories for conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and emotional symptoms separately and subsequent regression models were used to estimate predictors of mental health trajectory membership. Results Overall levels of hyperactivity and conduct problems increased over time whereas emotional symptoms remained relatively stable, though declined somewhat between June and July. Change over time varied according to child age, the presence of siblings, and with Special Educational Needs (SEN)/ Neurodevelopmental Disorders (ND). Subsequent growth mixture modelling identified three, four and five trajectories for hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems and emotional symptoms, respectively. Though many children maintained stable3low symptoms, others experienced elevated symptoms by July. These children were more likely to have a parent/carer with higher levels of psychological distress, to have SEN/ND, or to be younger in age.

The cases are increasing quickly with global mortality rate of 2.12%. The main cause of COVID-19 death is hypoxic respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Endothelial cell damage has a central role in ARDS pathogenesis and multi-organ failure in COVID-19. The endothelium, under homeostasis condition, is surrounded by mural cells (pericytes), which maintain vascular integrity and barrier function. These cells prevent inflammation by limiting the interaction of endothelial cells with immune cells and platelets and inhibit coagulation by expressing coagulation inhibitors and blood-clotting enzymes and producing glycocalyx. Vascular endothelial glycocalyx has a crucial role in endothelial function and is degraded systemically in elderly conditions and various comorbidities, which can be a potential mechanism for the development of lethal complications from COVID-19. Glycocalyx degradation due to endotheliopathy in SARS-CoV-2 infection causes increased levels of its fragments such as syndecan-1 and hyaluronan in the blood. Data from previous studies showed that the levels of these two biomarkers increased significantly in septic patient and several viral infections such as Kawasaki and dengue. These biomarkers are also markers of organ damage. Therefore, it can be indicated that hyaluronan and syndecan-1 are significant prognostic markers for morbidity and survival in COVID-19 patient. ? 2021 Teikyo University School of Medicine.

Furthermore, molecular clock dating has suggested a Cambrian-Ordovician terrestrialization event for arachnids [3], some 60 Ma before their first fossils in the Silurian, although these estimates assume that arachnids evolved from a fully aquatic ancestor. Eurypterids, the sister clade to terrestrial arachnids [4-6], are known to have undergone major macroecological shifts in transitioning from marine to freshwater environments during the Devonian [7, 8]. Discoveries of apparently subaerial eurypterid trackways [9, 10] have led to the suggestion that eurypterids were even able to venture on land and possibly breathe air [11]. However, modern horseshoe crabs undertake amphibious excursions onto land to reproduce [12], rendering trace fossil evidence alone inconclusive.

Univariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to describe, explore, and predict risk factors correlated with food insecurity among Jordanians, during the first four weeks of the quarantine. RESULTS: A total of 3129 Jordanians had responded to the assessment and fully answered the questionnaire. 23.1% of the total participants were severe food insecure, while 36.1% were moderate food insecure, 40.7% were food secure. The regression model demonstrated the monthly income per capita below the poverty line and a number of the family member (1C4 and 5C7) associated significantly with moderate food insecurity (OR: 5.33; 95% CI: 4.44C6.40, OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.47C0.86, OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.58C0.98, respectively). As well as with the severe food insecurity (OR: 6.87; 95% CI: 5.542C8.512, OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.37C0.74, 0.64; 95% CI: 0.48C0.87, respectively). Age 18C30 years old (OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.23C2.65) and living in a rented house (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.01C1.69) were associated significantly with severe food insecurity. Carbohydrates and the meat group were significantly related to food insecurity (p-value was <0.001 for both groups). CONCLUSION: Covid-19 and its subsequent quarantine have a tangible impact on food security levels for the populations. Awareness and strategies to support individuals at higher risks should be guided not only by the income but also by other risk factors identified in the present study as the number of persons in the family, younger adults (18C30 years old), and those who do not own their houses).","output":"Effect of Covid-19 on food security y: A cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the covid19 crisis, public transport (PT) systems are facing new challenges Regarding restrictive measures such as physical distancing and the successive returning of passengers after the \\"intelligent lockdown\\", significant lack of transport capacity can be expected In this paper, the transport capacity of a PT network is assessed, using a mathematical passenger route choice and train scheduling model By analysing the overall number of transported passengers and the resulting link and train utilization;the networks capabilities of facilitating different demands under capacity restrictions (e g physical distancing) are addressed The analysis is performed on the Dutch railway network The results show that at most 50% of the pre-covid19 demand can be transported, while most of the trains will be highly utilized reaching their maximum occupation Thus, significantly more parts of the network are becoming highly utilized, leading to a more congested and vulnerable system than in normal conditions before covid19","output":"Estimating impacts of covid19 on transport capacity in railway networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Numerous studies investigate the association between the ABO blood groups and the occurrence of COVID-19 infection; discordant findings were reported.

In Cape Verde, the first confirmed case of infection by SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on the island of Boa Vista on March 19, 2020. Since then, the pandemic has spread to several islands, and by July, 2020, only two of the nine inhabited islands had not yet been affected. The general objective of this study was to analyze the seroprevalence and the profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Cape Verdean population.Methods: 1184 households were surveyed, corresponding to a total of 5348 individuals from 10 to 80 years old, stratified at the level of municipalities. A questionnaire containing information on sociodemographic characteristics, living conditions, behavior and symptoms related to COVID-19 was applied to all respondents, and they were all subjected to a rapid test (TDR) to detect total antibodies.Findings: Seroprevalence was 0.4%, being higher in females, 86%, and in the younger age group (10 to 20 years). The counties where positive TDR results were detected were Sal 66%, Maio 15%, Praia 10%, S?o Domingos 5% and Ribeira Brava de S?o Nicolau 5%.Other risk factors associated with any significance found were: (i) taking trips outside the municipalities of origin, during the state of emergency, in public transport and (ii) failure to comply with the correct use of a mask whenever one is in place with crowds of people Interpretation: The results of this study allow us to conclude that the Cape Verdean population is susceptible to the virus and, in the near future, there may be an increase in cases of COVID-19.Funding: Ministry of Health and Social Security of Cape Verde, National Institute of Public Health, and Bureau of the World Health Organization in Cape Verde.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no conflict of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: The study was submitted to the Cape Verde National Health Research Ethics Committee and the National Data Protection Commission.

The potential impact of applied therapy and chest X-rays on DNA damage was also estimated. The study population included 24 severely COVID-19 patients and 15 healthy control subjects. The level of DNA damage was measured as genetic damage index (GDI) by comet assay. The standard laboratory methods and certified enzymatic reagents for the appropriate autoanalyzers were performed for the determination of the biochemical and hematological parameters. COVID-19 patients had significantly higher level of DNA damage compared with control subjects. The absolute number of neutrophil leukocytes was statistically higher, while the absolute number of lymphocytes was statistically lower in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. The analysis of the relationship between DNA damage and laboratory parameters indicated that GDI was positively correlated with interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentration and negatively with platelet count in COVID-19 patients. The level of DNA damage was slightly higher in female patients, in whom it was demonstrated a positive correlation of GDI with C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin. Likewise, there was a negative relationship of GDI and platelet count, and positive relationship of GDI and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in female population. The applied therapy (antibiotics, corticosteroid, anticoagulant, and antiviral therapy) as well as chest X rays has been shown to have genotoxic potential. The level of DNA damage significantly corresponds to the inflammatory markers and parameters of hemostasis in COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of MLR and subsequent MLR when relapse occurred (R-MLR) on prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with ablation. METHODS A prospective analysis was conducted on 606 patients with HCC who were treated with TACE combined with local ablation in Beijing You'an Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2016. MLR or R-MLR were stratified according to the optimal cut-off values. The cumulative recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) , and recurrence-death survival (RDS) rates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportion hazard model and logistic regression analysis was conducted to screen for independent predictive factors for indicating early relapse and long-term prognosis. RESULTS High MLR was significantly associated with relapse, early recurrence, and overall survival. After a median follow-up of 59.4 months, The cumulative 1-, 3-, 5-year RFS rates of low MLR were 74.6%, 43.8%, and 34.0%; while 66.1%, 32.2%, and 22.6% for high group (P < 0.001). There were also significant differences in corresponding OS rates of the two groups (P = 0.003).

The globalization of food systems has engendered significant changes to the operation and structure of FSCs. Alongside increasing consumer demands for safe and sustainable food products, FSCs are challenged with issues related to information transparency and consumer trust. Uncertainty in matters of transparency and trust arises from the growing information asymmetry between food producers and food consumers, in particular, how and where food is cultivated, harvested, processed, and under what conditions. FSCs are tasked with guaranteeing the highest standards in food quality and food safetyensuring the use of safe and authentic ingredients, limiting product perishability, and mitigating the risk of opportunism, such as quality cheating or falsification of information. A sustainable, food-secure world will require multidirectional sharing of information and enhanced information symmetry between food producers and food consumers. The need for information symmetry will drive transformational changes in FSCs methods of practice and will require a coherent standardized framework of best practice recommendations to manage logistic units in the food chain.

Comparisons of distance of droplet and bone dust contamination and surgeon contamination were made under differing conditions. Irrigation speed, use of microscope and drill burr size and type were compared. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of the distance of field contamination while performing simulated mastoidectomy and location of surgeon contamination. RESULTS: There was a greater distance field contamination and surgeon contamination without the use of the microscope. Contamination was reduced by using a smaller drill burr and by using a diamond burr when compared to a cutting burr. The use of goggles and a face mask provided good protection for the surgeon. However, the microscope alone may provide sufficient protection to negate the need for goggles.

The objectives of this study are to estimate the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases among U.S. prison staff over time and compare it to the prison inmate population and the general U.S. population, overall, and to examine risk of COVID-19 infection among prison staff across jurisdictions. METHODS: We use publicly available data (April 22, 2020 to January 15, 2021) to estimate COVID-19 crude case rates per 1000 with 95% confidence intervals over the study period for prison staff, incarcerated population, and general population. We also compare COVID-19 case rates between prison staff and the general population within jurisdictions. RESULTS: Over the study period, prison staff have reported consistently higher rates of COVID-19 compared to the general population, with prison staff case rates more closely mirroring the incarcerated population case rates. The rolling 7-day average case rates for prison staff, prison population, and general population on January 15, 2021 were 196.04 per 1000 (95%CI 194.81, 197.26), 219.16 (95%CI 218.45, 219.86), and 69.80 (95%CI 69.78, 69.83), respectively.

RESULTS All 3 participants were Latinx; 2 were first-generation college students. Participants had no surgical mentorship and limited research exposure, citing a desire to learn research methodology, connect with mentors, and build towards a career working with underserved communities as motivating factors for participation. Perceived barriers to a surgical career included surgical culture, burnout, and lack of research expertise or academic network necessary for success. At completion of the program, participants described several themes: (1) new positive perspective on academic surgical culture, (2) interest and confidence in research, (3) hope for improving health disparities, (4) networking and longitudinal mentorship connections contributing to a sense of surgical community, and (5) eagerness to share resources with colleagues at their home institutions.

To elucidate the specific role of each of the single envelope glycoproteins during viral entry, pseudotypes were generated bearing the BVDV envelope proteins in different combinations. Pseudoviruses that contained E1 and E2 but not Erns were infectious, indicating that Erns is dispensable for virus entry.

The fact that E1-E2 heterodimers were not detected if one of the proteins was chimeric indicated that the heterodimers are crucial for BVDV entry. It was shown by site-directed mutagenesis that the charged amino acids in the transmembrane domains of BVDV E1 (lysine and arginine) and the charged amino acid in the transmembrane domain of E2 (arginine) play a key role in heterodimer formation.

We manually reviewed subsets of retrieved posts, and prepared annotation guidelines to categorize tweets into IPV-report or non-IPV-report. We manually annotated a random subset of the collected tweets according to the guidelines, and used them to train and evaluate multiple supervised classification models. For the best classification strategy, we examined the model errors, bias, and trustworthiness through manual and automated content analysis. Results We annotated a total of 6,348 tweets, with inter-annotator agreement (IAA) of 0.86 (Cohen's kappa) among 1,834 double-annotated tweets. The dataset had substantial class imbalance, with only 668 (~11%) tweets representing IPV-reports. The RoBERTa model achieved the best classification performance (accuracy: 95%; IPV-report F1-score 0.76; non-IPV-report F1-score 0.97). Content analysis of the tweets revealed that the RoBERTa model sometimes misclassified as it focused on IPV-irrelevant words or symbols during decision making. Classification outcome and word importance analyses showed that our developed model is not biased toward gender or ethnicity while making classification decisions. Conclusion Our study developed an effective NLP model to identify IPV-reporting tweets automatically and in real time. The developed model can be an essential component for providing proactive social media based intervention and support for victims. It may also be used for population-level surveillance and conducting large-scale cohort studies.","output":"Natural Language Model for Automatic Identification of Intimate Partner Violence Reports from Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Given projected shortages of critical care capacity in public hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, the South African government embarked on an initiative to purchase this capacity from private hospitals. In order to inform purchasing decisions, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of intensive care management for admitted COVID-19 patients across the public and private health systems in South Africa. METHODS: Using a modelling framework and health system perspective, costs and health outcomes of inpatient management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients in (1) general ward and intensive care (GW + ICU) versus (2) general ward only (GW) were assessed. Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were evaluated and the cost per admission in public and private sectors was determined. The model made use of four variables: mortality rates, utilisation of inpatient days for each management approach, disability weights associated with severity of disease, and the unit cost per general ward day and per ICU day in public and private hospitals. Unit costs were multiplied by utilisation estimates to determine the cost per admission. DALYs were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) - representing difference in costs and health outcomes of the two management strategies - was compared to a cost-effectiveness threshold to determine the value for money of expansion in ICU services during COVID-19 surges. RESULTS: A cost per admission of ZAR 75,127 was estimated for inpatient management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients in GW as opposed to ZAR 103,030 in GW + ICU. DALYs were 1.48 and 1.10 in GW versus GW + ICU, respectively. The ratio of difference in costs and health outcomes between the two management strategies produced an ICER of ZAR 73,091 per DALY averted, a value above the cost-effectiveness threshold of ZAR 38,465. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that purchasing ICU capacity from the private sector during COVID-19 surges may not be a cost-effective investment. The real time, rapid, pragmatic, and transparent nature of this analysis demonstrates an approach for evidence generation for decision making relating to the COVID-19 pandemic response and South Africas wider priority setting agenda.","output":"Cost\\\\effectiveness of intensive care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients: experience from South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The study was conducted to assess the performance regarding presentation and communication skills of the undergraduate medical students and to explore the perceptions and challenges while adopting to virtual mode of presentation held during the 1(st) wave of coronavirus disease pandemic lock down in the first ever online scholars day.

Research on previous epidemics/pandemics suggest that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk, but this population has yet to be examined. The current study (1) described prevalence rates of maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms from an online convenience sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) identified risk and protective factors for elevated symptoms, and (3) described current mental health service use and barriers. Methods: Participants (N = 641) were mothers of children age 0-8 years, including expectant mothers. Mothers completed an online survey assessing mental health, sociodemographic information, and COVID-19-related variables. Results: Clinically-relevant depression was indicated in 33.16%, 42.55%, and 43.37% of mothers of children age 0-18 months, 18 months to 4 years, and 5 to 8 years, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety was 36.27%, 32.62%, and 29.59% for mothers across age groups, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated significant associations between risk factors and depression/anxiety across child age groups. Limitations: Cross-sectional data was used to describe maternal mental health problems during COVID-19 limiting the ability to make inferences about the long-term impact of maternal depression and anxiety on family well-being. Conclusions: Maternal depression and anxiety appear to be elevated in the context of COVID-19 compared to previously reported population norms. Identified risk factors for depression and anxiety across different child age ranges can inform targeted early intervention strategies to prevent long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family well-being and child development.","output":"Maternal Psychological Distress & Mental Health Service Use during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global coronavirus pandemic has burdened the human population with mass fatalities and disastrous socio-economic consequences.

In this review, we have critically compared the antiviral activities and mechanisms of action of lysine and its possible analogues in the form of linear, hyperbranched, dendrimer and nanoparticle polymers. The polycationic nature, as well as the structure of polylysine in its various forms, favours the electrostatic interaction with viruses by inhibiting their replication and endocytosis. In the case of lysine alone, the antiviral action is instead carried out inside the cell.

However, while valuable insights are available, there is a shortage of robust and rigorous research on what factors shape COVID-19 transmissions at the city cluster level. Therefore, to bridge the research gap, we adopted a data-driven hierarchical modeling approach to identify the most influential factors in shaping COVID-19 transmissions across different Chinese cities and clusters. The data used in this study are from Chinese officials, and hierarchical modeling conclusions drawn from the analysis are systematic, multifaceted, and comprehensive. To further improve research rigor, the study utilizes SPSS, Python and RStudio to conduct multiple linear regression and polynomial best subset regression (PBSR) analysis for the hierarchical modeling. The regression model utilizes the magnitude of various relative factors in nine Chinese city clusters, including 45 cities at a different level of clusters, to examine these aspects from the city cluster scale, exploring the correlation between various factors of the cities. These initial 12 factors are comprised of Urban population ratio, Retail sales of consumer goods, Number of tourists, Tourism Income, Ratio of the elderly population (> 60 year old) in this city, population density, Mobility scale (move in/inbound) during the spring festival, Ratio of Population and Health facilities, Jobless rate (%), The straight-line distance from original epicenter Wuhan to this city, urban per capita GDP, and the prevalence of the COVID-19. The studys results provide rigorously-tested and evidence-based insights on most instrumental factors that shape COVID-19 transmissions across cities and regions in China. Overall, the study findings found that per capita GDP and population mobility rates were the most affected factors in the prevalence of COVID-19 in a city, which could inform health experts and government officials to design and develop evidence-based and effective public health policies that could curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A hierarchical study for urban statistical indicators on the prevalence of COVID-19 in Chinese city clusters based on multiple linear regression (MLR) and polynomial best subset regression (PBSR) analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and government lockdown restrictions have had an impact on children and young people worldwide.

In this work, we provide a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the impact of mask-wearing. To this end, we propose a novel agent-based model of viral spread on networks where agents may either wear no mask, or wear one of several types of masks with different properties (e.g., cloth or surgical). We derive analytical expressions for three key epidemiological quantities: the probability of emergence, the epidemic threshold, and the expected epidemic size. In particular, we show how the aforementioned quantities depend on the structure of the contact network, viral transmission dynamics, and the distribution of the different types of masks within the population. Through extensive simulations, we then investigate the impact of different allocations of masks within the population. We also investigate trade-offs between masks with high outward efficiency but low inward efficiency and masks with high inward efficiency but low outward efficiency. Interestingly, we find that the former type of mask is most useful for controlling the spread in the early stages of an epidemic, while the latter type is most useful in mitigating the impact of an already large spread. Lastly, we study whether degree-based mask allocation is more effective in reducing probability as well as epidemic size compared to random allocation. The result echoes the previous findings that spreading processes should be treated with two different stages that source-control before epidemic starts and self-protection after epidemic forms.","output":"The Role of Masks in Mitigating Viral Spread on Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In facing the outbreak of pandemic Covid-19, it is important to understand factors that influence how people behave and react towards health marketing done by the health provider.

Yet, older adults may be uniquely able to cope given their life experiences and coping mechanisms. This study explores older adults' coping experiences and strategies during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Midwestern sample of 76 older adults aged 70-97 completed a phone interview about their experiences with social distancing due to COVID-19. Interviews were conducted during early weeks of regional social distancing (March 28-April 20, 2020). Participants rated their level of perceived coping and responded to open-ended questions about their daily life and coping. RESULTS: Mean perceived coping level (on a scale from 1-10) was 7.9, with 87% of participants rating their coping positively. Primary themes that emerged included: 1) staying busy, 2) seeking social support, and 3) having a positive mindset. These emotion-focused coping strategies appeared adaptive in the early weeks of the pandemic for most older adults. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Contrary to predominant messaging about the vulnerability of older adults, these findings highlight the resilient nature of older adults in terms of their psychological coping and adaptability during COVID-19. Future research should build upon these findings to better understand and promote late-life coping during crises.

The sewage sludge produced in the two wastewater treatment plants contained pathogenic bacteria such as pathogenic E. coli, Shigella flexneri, and Citrobacter freundii. The environmental strain of EAEC isolated from the sludge was resistant to eight types of antibiotics. It could also enter the dormant state after 4.5 h of treatment at 55 C and regrow at 37 C, while maintaining its antibiotic resistance. Our results indicate that the dormancy of EAEC might be why it is heat-resistant and could not be killed completely during the sludge heat treatment process. Owing to the regrowth of the dormant pathogenic bacteria, it is risky to apply the sludge to land even if the sludge is heat-treated, and there is also a risk of spreading antibiotic resistance.","output":"Multidrug-resistant enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) enters dormant state during heat treatment: A potential hazard in municipal sludge."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 emergency and consequent lockdowns left many parents struggling to balance childcare and paid employment, exposing the crucial role of work-life balance policies and practices.

Although Vietnam has successfully controlled the COVID-19 pandemic to date, there is a sign of initial community transmission. An estimate of possible scenarios to prepare health resources in the future is needed. We used modelling methods to estimate impacts of mitigation measures on the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. Methods: SEIR model built in the COVIDSIM1.1 tool was adopted using available data for estimation. The herd immunization scenario was with no intervention implemented. Other scenarios consisted of isolation and social distancing at different levels (25%, 50%, 75% and 10%, 20%, 30%, respectively). Outcomes include epidemic apex, daily new and cumulative cases, deaths, hospitalized patients and ICU beds needed. Results: By April 8, 2020, there would be 465 infected cases with COVID-19 in Viet Nam, of those 50% were detected. Cumulatively, there would be 1,400 cases and 30 deaths by end of 2020, if 75% of cases was detected and isolated, and 30% of social distancing could be maintained. The most effective intervention scenario is the detection and isolation of 75% infected cases and reduction of 10% social contacts. This will require an expansion of testing capacity at health facilities and in the community, posing a challenge to identify high-risk groups to prioritized testing.

METHODS: This case-control study nested within a cohort of cDMARD users was conducted in the Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany and Lazio regions and Reggio Emilia province. Claims databases were linked to COVID-19 surveillance registries. Risk of COVID-19-related outcomes was estimated using a multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis, comparing HCQ/CLQ vs methotrexate, vs other cDMARDs and vs non-use of these drugs. Presence of rheumatic diseases vs their absence in a non-nested population was investigated. RESULTS: 1275 cases hospitalized due to COVID-19 were matched to 12 734 controls. Compared with recent use of methotrexate, no association between HCQ/CLQ monotherapy and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR 0.83 [95%CI, 0.69-1.00]) or mortality (OR 1.19 [95%CI, 0.85-1.67]) was observed. A lower risk was found when comparing HCQ/CLQ use to the concomitant use of other cDMARDs and glucocorticoids. HCQ/CLQ was not associated with COVID-19 hospitalization as compared with non-use. An increased risk for recent use of either methotrexate monotherapy (OR 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05-1.34]) or other cDMARDs (OR 1.21 [95% CI, 1.08-1.36]) vs non-use was found.

In this study, one new dammarane-type triterpenoid saponin (1), along with fourteen known analogs (2-15) were isolated and identified from the roots of P. notoginseng. The anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenetic and anti-dengue virus effects of these isolated compounds were further evaluated. Compounds 1, 3, 5-7 and 10-12 exerted anti-inflammatory effects in two different zebrafish inflammatory models. Among them, 11, with the most significant activities, alleviated the inflammatory response by blocking the MyD88/NF-B and STAT3 pathways. Moreover, compound 15 showed anti-angiogenetic activities in Tg(fli1:EGFP) and Tg(flk1:GFP) zebrafish, while 3 and 5 only inhibited angiogenesis in Tg(fli1:EGFP) zebrafish. Additionally, compounds 1, 3, 6, 8, 9 and 12 suppressed the replication of dengue virus either at the viral adsorption and entry stages or at the intracellular replication step.

In our case, we recently synchronized a protocol of stimulus presentations shown on a laptop display, with webcam video made of participants (who were two year old children) facial and eye movements as they were shown trials of stimulus containing moving dots (a random dot kinematogram or RDK). The purpose was to assess eye movements in response to these RDK stimulus as a part of a potential neurological assessment for children. The video contained audio signals such as beeps and musical interludes that indicated the start and end of trials, thereby providing a convenient opportunity to align these audio events with the timing of known events in the video record. The process of alignment can be performed manually, but this is a tedious and time consuming task when considering, for example, large databases of videos. In this paper, we tested two alternate methods for synchronizing known audio events using: 1) a deep learning based model, and a 2) standard template matching algorithm. These methods were used to synchronize the known protocol of stimulus events in videos by processing the audio contents of the recording. The deep learning approach utilized simple mel-spectrum audio signal feature extraction, whilst we adopted a cross-correlation algorithm that detected an audio template in the time domain. We found that whilst correlation was not effective as a means of beep detection; but our machine learning-based technique was robust with 90% accuracy in the testing dataset and did not the same amount of remediation required of the correlation approach.","output":"A Comparison of Approaches for Synchronizing Events in Video Streams Using Audio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E. coli is associated with high rates of infection and resistance to drugs not only in China but also the rest of the world. In addition, the number of E. coli biofilm infections continue to increase with time. Notably, biofilms are attractive targets for the prevention of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Moreover, the pgaABCD-encoded Poly-?-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) plays an important role in biofilm formation. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the specific effect of the (R)-(+)-pulegone (PU) on growth and biofilm formation in multi-drug resistant E. coli. The molecular mechanisms involved were also examined. The results showed that PU had significant antibacterial and antibiofilm formation activity against E. coli K1, with MIC and MBC values of 23.68 and 47.35 mg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, the maximum inhibition rate for biofilm formation in the bacterium was 52.36 % at 94.70 mg/mL of PU. qRT-PCR data showed that PU significantly down-regulated expression of the pgaABCD genes (P < 0.05). PU was also broadly effective against biofilm formation in MG1655 and MG1655/&#916;pgaABCD, exhibiting the maximum inhibition rates were 98.23 % and 93.35 %, respectively. In addition, PU destroyed pre-formed mature biofilm in both MG1655 and MG1655/&#916;pgaABCD about 95.03 % and 92.4 %, respectively. The study therefore verified that pgaA was a potential and key target for PU in E. coli although it was not the only one. Overall, the findings indicated that PU is a potential and novel inhibitor of drug resistance, This therefore gives insights on new ways of preventing and treating biofilm-associated infections in the food industry as well as in clinical practice.","output":"The specific effect of (R)-(+)-pulegone on growth and biofilm formation in multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli and molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of pgaABCD genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 in China marked the third outbreak of a highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans.

To improve survival, adding hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been suggested. Whether HIPEC entails disproportional short-term mortality is unknown and a prospectively determined adverse events profile is lacking. Since both pancreatic resection and HIPEC may relevantly influence morbidity and mortality, this uncontrolled single-arm, open-label, phase I/II pilot trial was designed to assess the 30-day mortality rate, treatment feasibility, and adverse events connected with HIPEC after oncological pancreatic surgery. METHODS: This trial recruited patients scheduled for PDAC resection. A sample size of 16 patients receiving study interventions was estimated to establish a predefined margin of treatment-associated short-term mortality with a power of > 80%. Patients achieving complete macroscopic resection received HIPEC with gemcitabine administered at 1000 mg/m(2) body surface area heated to 42 C for 1 hour. RESULTS: Within 30 days after intervention, no patient died or experienced any adverse events higher than grade 3 that were related to HIPEC. Furthermore, treatment-related adverse events were prospectively documented and categorized as expected or unexpected. This trial supports that the actual mortality rate after PDAC resection and HIPEC is below 10%. HIPEC treatment proved feasible in 89% of patients allocated to intervention. Pancreatic fistulas, as key complications after pancreas surgery, occurred in 3/13 patients under risk. CONCLUSION: Combined pancreas resection and gemcitabine HIPEC proved feasible and safe, with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Based on these results, further clinical evaluation can be justified.

In Colombia, this care modality was implemented between 2019 and 2020, under national considerations, it was implemented for outpatient care in a highly complex university hospital in Cali, Colombia. METHODS: A descriptive study with prospective information collection was used to describe the implementation of the outpatient teleconsultation care model for patients. We constructed the clinical and process indicators with which we evaluated the model. FINDINGS: A total of 56,560 patients from our institution were treated by virtual outpatient consultation during the first nine months of the health emergency declared by COVID 19 in Colombia. The strategy made it possible to achieve coverage more significant than 100% in Cali and the departments of Colombia. Attention by teleconsultation was 19% of the total ambulatory care. The effectiveness in carrying out scheduled teleconsultations had an overall result of 91.5%. The accessibility results demonstrated the need to strengthen connectivity and accessibility to payments and strengthen technology adoption in the institution, health personnel, and patients. INTERPRETATION: Implementing an outpatient teleconsultation model allowed the continuity of the management with comprehensive coverage nationwide from a highly complex hospital in southwestern Colombia.

Here, we describe a novel, multiplex immunofluorescence imaging method, termed SeqStain, that uses fluorescent-DNA labelled antibodies for immunofluorescence staining of cells and tissues, and nuclease treatment for de-staining that allows selective enzymatic removal of the fluorescent signal. SeqStain can be used with primary antibodies, secondary antibodies and antibody fragments, such as Fabs, to efficiently analyse complex cells and tissues in multiple rounds of staining and de-staining. Additionally, incorporation of specific endonuclease restriction sites in antibody labels allows for selective removal of fluorescent signals, while retaining other signals that can serve as marks for subsequent analyses.

RESULTS: Many laboratory indicators, such as neutrophils, AST, ?3-GT, ALP, LDH, NT-proBNP, Hs-cTnT, PT, APTT, D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, CRP, ferritin and procalcitonin, were all significantly increased in deceased patients compared with recovered patients on admission. In contrast, other indicators such as lymphocytes, platelets, total protein and albumin were significantly decreased in deceased patients on admission. Some indicators such as neutrophils and procalcitonin, others such as lymphocytes and platelets, continuously increased or decreased from admission to death in deceased patients respectively. Using these indicators alone had moderate performance in differentiating between recovered and deceased COVID-19 patients.

Some quantitative studies have investigated this topic in spine surgery, but none has provided direct thematic feedback from physicians. This qualitative study aimed to identify the impact of this phenomenon in the practice of spine neurosurgeons. METHODS: We proposed a qualitative study using grounded theory approach. Twenty-three purposively selected private neurosurgeons participated. Inclusion took place until data saturation was reached. Data were collected through individual interviews and analyzed thematically and independently by three researchers (an anthropologist, a psychiatrist, and a neurosurgeon). RESULTS: Data analysis identified five superordinate themes that were based on items that recurred in interviews: (1) private practice of spinal surgery (high-risk surgery based on frequent functional symptoms, in an unfavorable medicolegal context); (2) societal transformation of the doctor-patient relationship (new societal demands, impact of the internet and social network); (3) judicialization of spine surgery (surgeons feelings about the frequency and motivation of the complaints they receive, and their own management of them); (4) coping strategies (identification and solutions for at risk situations and patients); and (5) professional disenchantment (impact of these events on surgeons daily practice and career planning). Selected quotes of interviews were reported to support these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights several elements that can alter the quality of care in a context of societal change and the judicialization of medicine. The alteration of the doctor-patient relationship and the permanent pressure of a possible complaint encourage surgeons to adopt defensive attitudes in order to minimize the risks of litigation and increased insurance premiums.

Results: In-app daily mood assessments were strongly correlated with their corresponding gold standard clinical assessment. Sleep variance among students was correlated to depression scores (&#961; = .28) and stress scores (&#961; = .27). Conclusions: Digital Phenotyping among college students is feasible on both an individual and a sample level. Studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to understand population trends, but there are practical applications of the data today.","output":"Digital phenotyping of student mental health during COVID-19: an observational study of 100 college students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of COVID-19 serves as a reminder of the might of microbes in the era of modern medicine. For years, another threat has preoccupied infectious disease experts and public health officials alike: rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Resistance is exceeding stewardship efforts as well as the rates of new drug development and approval in the market. A dry antimicrobial pipeline is threatening regression to a preantibiotic era. While the consequences of resistance may seem far removed from daily clinical practice, awareness of AMR is essential to dermatological care given that dermatologists prescribe more antibiotics per physician than other providers. Antibiotics in dermatology are often used for prolonged courses, with significant potential for microbiome alteration and antibiotic-related adverse effects.

Since the pandemic took the whole world by surprise, many existing drugs were rapidly repurposed and tested in COVID-19 clinical trials and some of the trials are revealing promising results, it is clear that the long-term solution will come in the form of vaccines. While vaccines are being developed, the antiviral agent Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is being repurposed for use in human clinical trials but this is being done without acknowledging the significant efforts that went into development for treating cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly fatal immune-mediated vasculitis in cats which is caused by a feline coronavirus. There are many other antiviral drugs and immune modulating treatments that are currently being trialed that have animal health origins in terms of discovery and clinical development. Closer collaboration between the animal health and human health sectors is likely to accelerate progress in the fight against COVID-19. There is much that we do not yet know about COVID-19 and its causative agent SARS-CoV-2 but we will learn and progress much faster if we increase interdisciplinary collaboration and communication between human and animal health researchers and taking a genuine One Health approach to this and other emerging viral pathogens.

However, few studies have focused on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after hospitalization for COVID-19. METHODS: In this multi-center study, we followed 1529 COVID-19 patients for at least 45 days after hospital discharge, who underwent routine telephone follow-up. In case of signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), they were invited for an in-hospital visit with a pulmonologist. The primary outcome was symptomatic VTE within 45 days of hospital discharge. RESULTS: Of 1529 COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital, a total of 228 (14.9%) reported potential signs or symptoms of PE or DVT and were seen for an in-hospital visit. Of these, 13 and 12 received Doppler ultrasounds or pulmonary CT angiography, respectively, of whom only one patient was diagnosed with symptomatic PE. Of 51 (3.3%) patients who died after discharge, two deaths were attributed to VTE corresponding to a 45-day cumulative rate of symptomatic VTE of 0.2% (95%CI 0.1%-0.6%; n = 3). There was no evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in these patients. Other deaths after hospital discharge included myocardial infarction (n = 13), heart failure (n = 9), and stroke (n = 9).

We used change of diagnosis within an episode of infection as a guide of diagnostic uncertainty in a nationally representative cohort of Taiwanese children (n = 13 284) followed from birth to the 9th birthday through electronic health records.

We used age-specific CDRs to calibrate the weekly EVI burden in children aged 3-5 years in 2008, and the difference between observed and calibrated weekly EVI burdens was small.

However, increased global demand has led to a shortage of commercial SARS-CoV-2 sequencing kits, and not every country has the technological capability or the funds for high-throughput sequencing platforms. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a rapid, cost-efficient genome sequencing protocol that uses supplies, equipment, and methodologic expertise available in standard molecular or diagnostic laboratories to identify circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. MethodsSets of primers flanking the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene were designed using SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences retrieved from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) Database and synthesized in-house. Primer specificity and final sequences were verified using online prediction analyses with BLAST. The primers were validated using 282 nasopharyngeal samples collected from patients assessed as positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the diagnostic laboratory of the hospital. The patient samples were subjected to RNA extraction followed by cDNA synthesis, conventional polymerase chain reaction, and Sanger sequencing. Protocol specificity was confirmed by comparing these results with SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing of the same samples. ResultsSanger sequencing using the newly designed primers and next-generation whole genome sequencing of 282 patient samples indicated identical VOCs results: 123 samples contained the alpha variant (B.1.1.7); 78, beta (B.1.351), 0, gamma (P.1), and 13, delta (B.1.617.2). The remaining samples were not 100% identical to the reference genome; however, 99.97% identity indicated that there was minimal variation as the virus spread throughout the nation. Only four samples had poor sequence quality by Sanger sequencing owing to a low RNA count (Ct value >38). Therefore, mutation calls were >98% accurate. ConclusionsSanger sequencing method using in-house primers is an alternative approach that can be used in facilities with existing equipment to mitigate limitations in high throughput supplies required to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Aim: To identify where the perceived gaps in knowledge, skills, guidance and research around infections and antibiotic use lie from the general practitioner (GP) viewpoint. Design and Setting: An online questionnaire survey. Method: The survey, based on questions asked of Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) members in 1999, and covering letter were electronically sent to GPs between May and August 2017 via various primary care dissemination routes. Results: Four hundred and twenty-eight GPs responded.

RESULTS: A total of 18 articles were included. The use of analgesia, anti-inflammatories, steroids, anticoagulants, antibiotics, vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin D and their potential impact on COVID-19 patients were reported. CONCLUSION: Eight main recommendations were derived from the review. Firstly, paracetamol remains the first line of analgesia and antipyretic. Secondly, there is no need to avoid NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, opioids have the potential for immunosuppression in addition to respiratory depression and, therefore, should be prescribed with care in COVID-19 patients. Fourthly, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to be efficacious can continue to receive their steroids; otherwise, systemic steroids are not recommended for COVID-19 patients. Fifthly, orthopaedic surgeons following up on COVID-19 patients who are using steroids should continue to follow them up for possible avascular necrosis. Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin. Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients.

Method: We recruited 120 LC patients and 36 controls. For all participants, we assessed the lowest SpO2 and peak body temperature during acute COVID-19, and the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMD/HAMA) and Fibro Fatigue (FF) scales 3 to 4 months later. Results: Lowered SpO2 and increased body temperature during the acute phase and female sex predict 60.7% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of LC. Using unsupervised learning techniques we were able to delineate a new endophenotype class, which comprises around 26.7% of the LC patients and is characterized by very low SpO2 and very high body temperature, and depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and autonomic and gastro-intestinal symptoms scores. Single latent vectors could be extracted from both biomarkers, depression, anxiety and FF symptoms or from both biomarkers, insomnia, chronic fatigue, gastro-intestinal and autonomic symptoms. Conclusion: The newly constructed endophenotype class and pathway phenotypes indicate that the physio-affective phenome of LC is at least in part the consequence of the pathophysiology of acute COVID-19, namely the combined effects of lowered SpO2, increased body temperature and the associated immune-inflammatory processes and lung lesions.","output":"Lowered oxygen saturation and increased body temperature in acute COVID-19 largely predict chronic fatigue syndrome and affective symptoms due to LONG COVID: a precision nomothetic approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) frequently exhibit excessive inflammatory responses, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, and organ damage.

Sequential samples at 1 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies in 95 patients.RESULTSAntibodies developed rapidly against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens in 95% of patients by 4 weeks after symptom onset and IgG to the RBD increased until the third month of follow-up. We observed a major synchronous expansion of antibodies to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 spike S2.

The results of this proposed model infer that the combined recursive feature elimination and gradient boosting algorithm achieves the highest accuracy (89.7 %). Further, with an area under the curve of 0.84, the proposed RFE-GB algorithm was found superior and had obtained a substantial gain over other techniques. Thus, the proposed RFE-GB algorithm will serve as a prominent model for CVD estimation and treatment.","output":"Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Recursive Feature Elimination and Gradient Boosting Classification Techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant disruption to teaching and learning activities at all levels. Faculty, students, institutions, and parents have had to rapidly adapt and adopt measures to make the best use of available resources, tools and teaching strategies. While much of the online teaching pedagogies have been theoretically and practically explored to a limited extent, the scale at which these were deployed was unprecedented. This has led a large number of researchers to share challenges, solutions and knowledge gleaned during this period. The main aim of this work was to thematically model the literature related to teaching and learning during, and about, COVID-19. Abstracts and metadata of literature were extracted from Scopus, and topic modeling was used to identify the key research themes. The research encompassed diverse scientific disciplines, including social sciences, computer science, and life sciences, as well as learnings in support systems, including libraries, information technology, and mental health. The following six key themes were identified: (i) the impact of COVID-19 on higher education institutions, and challenges faced by these institutions;(ii) the use of various tools and teaching strategies employed by these institutions;(iii) the teaching and learning experience of schools and school teachers;(iv) the impact of COVID-19 on the training of healthcare workers;(v) the learnings about COVID-19, and treatment strategies from patients;and (vi) the mental health of students as a result of COVID-19 and e-learning. Regardless of the key themes, what stood out was the inequities in education as a result of the digital divide. This has had a huge impact not only in middle- and low-income nations, but also in several parts of the developed world. Several important lessons have been learned, which, no doubt, will be actively incorporated into teaching and learning practices and teacher training. Nonetheless, the full effect of these unprecedented educational adaptions on basic education, expert training, and mental health of all stakeholders is yet to be fully fathomed.","output":"Teaching and Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Topic Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biogen's announcement last fall that it will seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for its Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, aducanumab, 7 months after the drug was declared a failure, buoyed patients and families, but put health payers and policymakers on alert.

Decisions regarding treatment omission can lead to patient uncertainty (decisional conflict), which may be lessened with patient decision aids (PDA). PRIMETIME (ISRCTN 41579286) is a UK-led biomarker-directed study evaluating omission of adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer; an embedded Study Within A Trial (SWAT) investigated whether PDA reduces decisional conflict using a cluster stepped-wedge trial design. METHODS: PDA diagrams and a video explaining risks and benefits of radiotherapy were developed in close collaboration between patient advocates and PRIMETIME trialists. The SWAT used a cluster stepped-wedge trial design, where each cluster represented the radiotherapy centre and referring peripheral centres. All clusters began in the standard information group (patient information and diagrams) and were randomised to cross-over to the enhanced information group (standard information plus video) at 2, 4 or 6 months. Primary endpoint was the decisional conflict scale (0C100, higher scores indicating greater conflict) which was assessed on an individual participant level. Multilevel mixed effects models used a random effect for cluster and a fixed effect for each step to adjust for calendar time and clustering. Robust standard errors were also adjusted for the clustering effect. RESULTS: Five hundred twenty-one evaluable questionnaires were returned from 809 eligible patients (64%) in 24 clusters between April 2018 and October 2019. Mean decisional conflict scores in the standard group (N = 184) were 10.88 (SD 11.82) and 8.99 (SD 11.82) in the enhanced group (N = 337), with no statistically significant difference [mean difference ? 1.78, 95%CI ? 3.82C0.25, p = 0.09]. Compliance with patient information and diagrams was high in both groups although in the enhanced group only 121/337 (36%) reported watching the video. CONCLUSION: The low levels of decisional conflict in PRIMETIME are reassuring and may reflect the high-quality information provision, such that not everyone required the video. This reinforces the importance of working with patients as partners in clinical trials especially in the development of patient-centred information and decision aids.

Wild rats abundant in urban environments may transmit diseases to humans and other animals, including laboratory rodents used for biomedical research in research facilities, possibly compromising research data. In order to gather information about the various diseases present around such facilities, it is important to conduct routine surveillance of wild rodents in the area. In this pilot study, we surveyed 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts for 19 microorganisms. Information gained from such surveillance data would be beneficial in assessing regional public health risks and when implementing routine laboratory rodent health monitoring protocols. ABSTRACT: A pilot seroprevalence study was conducted to document exposure to selected pathogens in wild rats inhabiting the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. Serum samples collected from 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) were tested for the presence of antibodies to various rodent pathogens using a rat MFI2 serology panel. The samples were positive for cilia-associated respiratory bacillus (13/22; 59.1%), Clostridium piliforme (4/22; 18.2%), Mycoplasma pulmonis (4/22; 18.2%), Pneumocystis carinii (1/22; 4.5%), mouse adenovirus type 2 (16/22; 72.7%), Kilham rat virus (15/22; 68.2%), reovirus type 3 (9/22; 40.9%), rat parvovirus (4/22; 18.2%), rat minute virus (4/22; 18.2%), rat theilovirus (2/22; 9.1%), and infectious diarrhea of infant rats strain of group B rotavirus (rat rotavirus) (1/22; 4.5%). This study provides the first evidence of exposure to various rodent pathogens in wild rats on the island of St. Kitts. Periodic pathogen surveillance in the wild rat population would be beneficial in assessing potential regional zoonotic risks as well as in enhancing the current knowledge when implementing routine animal health monitoring protocols in facilities with laboratory rodent colonies.","output":"Seroprevalence of Rodent Pathogens in Wild Rats from the Island of St. Kitts, West Indies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was to improve the feasibility and economic benefits of intelligent medical system Doppler ultrasound (DUS) imaging technology combined with fetal heart detection to predict the fetal distress in pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), so as to reduce the risk of deterioration of the patient's condition. The characteristics of DUS images were analyzed, and a diffusion filter reducing the specificity was adopted to improve the smooth speckle noise of DUS images. 120 pregnant women in hospital were the subjects of the study, all of whom received ultrasound cord blood flow testing and fetal heart monitoring. 88 PIH patients with fetal distress were diagnosed and included in the observation group, and 32 healthy pregnant women tested during the same period were identified as the control group. Clinical data were reviewed and analyzed. The diagnostic rates of fetal distress by simple fetal heart monitoring and DUS detection combined with fetal heart monitoring were compared. The results showed that 26.7% of fetal distress were diagnosed by fetal heart monitoring alone, and 73.3% of fetal distress were diagnosed by combined testing, so the diagnostic accuracy of the combined detection method was greatly higher than the single fetal heart detection (P < 0.05). The Pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), and S/D values detected by the umbilical artery in the observation group were 1.48, 0.85, and 4.31, respectively. The PI, RI, and S/D values detected by the umbilical artery in the control group were 0.96, 0.64, and 3.59, respectively. The results of arterial detection were significantly higher than those of the control group, and the difference was of significant scientific significance (P < 0.05). In summary, the PI and RI values of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) detected by DUS diagnosis can effectively reflect the current status of the fetus in the uterus and reduce the mortality of the fetus. The images guided by DUS imaging technology can clearly show the current status of the fetus in the uterus, effectively improve the medical diagnostic efficiency, and have important reference value for the development of intelligent medical equipment.","output":"Doppler Ultrasound Imaging Combined with Fetal Heart Detection in Predicting Fetal Distress in Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension under the Guidance of Artificial Intelligence Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of machine learning methods in classical and quantum systems has led to novel techniques to classify ordered and disordered phases, as well as uncover transition points in critical phenomena. Efforts to extend these methods to dynamical processes in complex networks is a field of active research. Network-percolation, a measure of resilience and robustness to structural failures, as well as a proxy for spreading processes, has numerous applications in social, technological, and infrastructural systems. A particular challenge is to identify the existence of a percolation cluster in a network in the face of noisy data. Here, we consider bond-percolation, and introduce a sampling approach that leverages the core-periphery structure of such networks at a microscopic scale, using onion decomposition, a refined version of the k-core. By selecting subsets of nodes in a particular layer of the onion spectrum that follow similar trajectories in the percolation process, percolating phases can be distinguished from non-percolating ones through an unsupervised clustering method. Accuracy in the initial step is essential for extracting samples with information-rich content, that are subsequently used to predict the critical transition point through the confusion scheme, a recently introduced learning method. The method circumvents the difficulty of missing data or noisy measurements, as it allows for sampling nodes from both the core and periphery, as well as intermediate layers. We validate the effectiveness of our sampling strategy on a spectrum of synthetic network topologies, as well as on two real-word case studies: the integration time of the US domestic airport network, and the identification of the epidemic cluster of COVID-19 outbreaks in three major US states.

Limited school attendance, such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups, does not appear to significantly affect community transmission. In countries where community transmission is generally low, such as Denmark or Norway, a large-scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible. However, school reopening can contribute to statistically significant increases in the growth rate in countries like Germany, where community transmission is relatively high.

PARTICIPANTS: 2956 participants aged 16 and above completed the study and were included in the analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Nationwide COVID-19 survey. Demographics and self-reported compliance with four personal protective measureshome quarantine, mask-wearing, temperature-taking and hand-sanitising were collected. Outbreak severity and timeliness of personal protection order were obtained from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention website. Logistic regression models were employed to examine the association between demographic and social indicators and behavioural compliance. RESULTS: Compliance with home quarantine was only associated with gender (men, OR=0.61 (0.51C0.73), inverse association) but no other indicators. In contrast, men had higher compliance with mask-wearing (OR=1.79 (1.49C2.16)) and temperature-taking (OR=1.27 (1.05C1.53)).

RESULTS: Overall STAI-S scores were 29+/-5.4, a subjective feeling of anxiety increase was reported in 40.3% of respondents (43.9% significantly > in females), worsening to clinical anxiety in 2.1% (2.4% > in females). 54.2% of respondents reported decreased physical activity, 33.1% gained weight, 72% used internet more often, 52.6% experienced worries related to the information about COVID-19 (56.8% > in females). 88% experienced worsened sleep quality, 69.2% stayed up until late, 23.2% took sleeping pills, and 31% had nightmares in which they felt trapped. To ANOVA, such life habits as reduced physical activity during the lockdown, increased time spent online, internet browsing about COVID-19, tendency to stay up late, use of sleeping pills and disturbing dreams with scenario of being trapped were significantly related to worsening of clinical anxiety. However, eating behaviour, weight changes, and social media use did not contribute to the clinical anxiety increase. CONCLUSIONS: Factors of decreased physical activity and sleep disturbances related to the lockdown, as well as excessive internet browsing for information about COVID-19, emerged as risk factors for increased anxiety, more notably in women than in men. Preventive measures should be targeted against relevant factors imparting anxiety in the vulnerable population.","output":"Interactions between Anxiety Levels and Life Habits Changes in General Population during the Pandemic Lockdown: Decreased Physical Activity, Falling Asleep Late and Internet Browsing about COVID-19 Are Risk Factors for Anxiety, whereas Social Media Use Is not"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 had caused more than 2.8 million deaths globally, and the epidemic will persist for an extended period of time. We analyzed clinical features of patients in the early stage of the epidemic, so as to deepen the understanding of the disease. Methods: : In this retrospective study, we included 84 confirmed cases of COVID-19 during February 1, 2020 and March 31, 2020. Baseline data were used to classify patients as moderate (57%) or severe/critical based on Chinese protocol. We focused on analyzing the differences in chest computed tomography (CT) between the two groups. Results: Of the 84 cases, 50 were male and the median age was 69 years. 55 (65%) patients had comorbidities at admission, more in the severe/critical group (P=0.040). 94% patients had bilateral lesions on CT, up to 68% had lesions involving all lobes. Ground glass opacification (GGO) (96%), consolidation (44%), Linear opacities (50%) and Air bronchogram (23%) were the mainly lesions. The lesion was gradually absorbed over time, but imaging abnormalities can persist for a long time. Compared with moderate cases, the severe/critical group had more pulmonary consolidation changes (P=0.044) and significantly higher CT severity Score (CTSS) (P=0.040). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower (P=0.011) and NLR were higher (P=0.029) in severe/critical cases. Conclusions: : Chest CT showed bilateral and multiple GGO and consolidation mainly. After treatment, pulmonary lesions were gradually absorbed over time, and imaging abnormalities can be persistent for a long time. Lung consolidation, CTSS, comorbidity, lymphocyte counts, and NLR may be predictors of severe COVID-19.","output":"Chest CT and Clinical Features of COVID-19 Patients in the Early Stage of the Epidemic: An Observational Study from China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effects of regionalism on trade have been extensively evaluated within a gravity model framework With the expected exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), the prospect of regional disintegration has brought about a new impetus to studying trade policy effects Using actual and forecast data for a panel of bilateral imports between the EU15 and the rest of the world, this paper examines the trade effects of EU economic integration agreements (EIAs), their evolution over time and the related counterfactual Brexit trade policy scenarios Distinct trade effects are obtained for the EU trade related agreements;positive, significant and of similar magnitude for the EU and free trade agreement (FTA) coefficients, but negative and significant (and smaller in magnitude) for the regional economic partnership agreements (EPAs) The subperiod results suggest the positive coefficients of EU and FTA membership tend to diminish over time, implying earlier membership of EIAs came with greater trade benefits Finally, in generating the predicted values for the trade effects of three alternative counterfactual Brexit scenarios (hard Brexit, hard Brexit plus, global Britain), the findings suggest an asymmetric effect depending on the perspective of the UK versus the EU Whereas the UKs trade would decline substantially with all three country groups (the EU, the FTAs and regional EPAs) and rise substantially with the rest of the world, only minor percentage changes are predicted for EU bilateral trade","output":"EU economic integration agreements, Brexit and trade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The countries of the MENA region cover an area with a diverse geography and a diverse tourist capital The natural and cultural assets of the region appeal to different target groups, but have not yet been fully exploited, are not usable or have been irrevocably destroyed by unrest, uprisings, and wars In many countries in the region, structural problems in tourism policy and the economy aggravate the situation As a result, international tourist arrivals and income from tourist expenditures have developed differently in the various countries of the region Using selected examples, this special issue provides a deeper but necessarily selective insight into the many facets of tourism in the countries of the MENA region and highlights at least some of the broad spectrum of phenomena associated with tourism geography This editorial provides a framework to position the selected case studies within broader aspects of tourism development in the MENA region It assesses the spatial differentiation of tourism supply and demand and looks at the political situation, especially since the so-called 'Arab Spring' and the related challenges for the tourism industry The current effects of the so-called coronavirus crisis are not considered, as the special issue was conceived before the crisis began (German) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of TW: Zeitschrift fuer Tourismuswissenschaft is the property of De Gruyter and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Tourism Geography of the MENA Region: Potential, Challenges and Risks: Editorial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present two complementary model-based methods for calculating the risk of international spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 from the outbreak epicentre.

We describe the development of an interdisciplinary rapid message testing model to quickly create, test, and share messages with public health officials for use in health campaigns and policy briefings. METHODS: An interdisciplinary research team from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill assembled in March 2020 to assist the state health department in developing evidence-based messages to influence social distancing behaviors in the state. We developed and iteratively executed a rapid message testing model; the components of the 4-step model were message creation, survey development, survey administration, and analysis and presentation to health department officials. The model was executed 4 times, each during a 7-day period in April and May, and each subsequent survey included new phrasing and/or messaging informed by the previous week's survey. A total of 917 adults from North Carolina participated in the 4 surveys. RESULTS: Survey participants rated messages focused on protecting oneself and others higher than messages focused on norms and fear-based approaches. Pairing behaviors with motivations increased participants' desire to social distance across all themes and subgroups. For example, adding \\"Protect your grandmother, your neighbor with cancer, and your best friend with asthma,\\" to messaging received a 0.9-point higher score than the base message, \\"Stay 6 feet apart from others when out in public.\\" PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our model to promote social distancing in North Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic can be used for rapid, iterative message testing during public health emergencies.","output":"Development and Application of an Interdisciplinary Rapid Message Testing Model for COVID-19 in North Carolina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We briefly review post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and the morbidities associated with critical illness that led to the intensive care unit (ICU) liberation movement. We review each element of the ICU liberation bundle, including pediatric support data, as well as tips and strategies for implementation in a pediatric ICU (PICU) setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous studies have found children have cognitive, physical, and psychiatric deficits after a PICU stay. The effects of the full ICU liberation bundle in children have not been published, but in adults, bundle implementation (even partial) resulted in significant improvement in survival, mechanical ventilation use, coma, delirium, restraint-free care, ICU readmissions, and post-ICU discharge disposition. SUMMARY: Although initially described in adults, children also suffer from PICS. The ICU liberation bundle is feasible in children and may ameliorate the effects of a PICU stay.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated reported mental health and changes in lifestyle practices among Jordanian mothers during COVID-19 quarantine. The specific objectives included studying the level of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and their potential statistical associations with demographic and lifestyle variables. Furthermore, the study aimed to investigate differences in mental health between different demographic and socio-economic groups and to examine the major lifestyle changes that occurred on mothers during the quarantine. METHODS: An online survey was developed and administered to 2103 mothers. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and a lifestyle section comparing the life of mothers before and during the quarantine. Reported scores of depression, anxiety, and stress were calculated and compared across different levels of demographics including income, education level, employment status, and city of residence. RESULTS: This study found that mothers with lower income, lower education, not employed, or living in cities outside the capital of Jordan reported having more depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (p < .005). Changes in their lifestyle practices included weight gain, increased time allocated for teaching children at home, increased familial violence at home, and increased time allocated for caring for their family members (average increase of 5 hours daily). CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: The unprecedented times of quarantine have put mothers in unprecedented reported mental health problems.

While there have been a number of studies of youth self-harm in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is currently no systematic review of studies of prevalence rates and risk and protective factors. AIM To systematically review the evidence relating to the prevalence rates and forms of self-harm in youth in LMICs and its relationship to family economic status, family functioning, relationship with the peer group, social relationships and academic performance. METHODS Electronic searches of three databases, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Scopus, were performed. In total, 27 school-, community- and hospital-based studies evaluating self-harm in LMICs with youth focus (with participants between 12 and 25 years) were included. RESULTS The self-harm was divided into suicidal and non-suicidal depending on the nature of self-harm. The 12-month prevalence rates of non-suicidal self-harm varied from 15.5% to 31.3%, and the range of suicidal behaviour rates was from 3.2% to 4.7%. Banging and hitting were the most common in the community-based studies, followed by cutting, scratching and wound picking. Self-poisoning with pesticides was most commonly reported in hospital-based studies. Risk factors for self-harm were family conflict, peer groups with members indulging in self-harm, truancy and school absenteeism. Protective factors were having an understanding family, having friends and higher school competence. Risk factors for suicidal thoughts and attempts were lack of close friends and history of suicide by a friend. CONCLUSION The 12-month prevalence rates of youth self-harm in LMICs are comparable to high-income countries (HICs). The profile of risk and protective factors suggests that family-based interventions could be useful in treatment and prevention. Future studies should aim for greater consistency in assessment methods and the constructs under evaluation.","output":"Youth self-harm in low- and middle-income countries: Systematic review of the risk and protective factors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An impact of viral mutations on the extent of an epidemic is examined.

Viral RNA mutations can arise from misincorporation by RNA-polymerases and modification by host factors. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence from patients showed a strong bias toward C-to-U mutation, suggesting a potential mutational role by host APOBEC cytosine deaminases that possess broad anti-viral activity. We report the first experimental evidence demonstrating that APOBEC3A, APOBEC1, and APOBEC3G can edit on specific sites of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to produce C-to-U mutations. However, SARS-CoV-2 replication and viral progeny production in Caco-2 cells are not inhibited by the expression of these APOBECs. Instead, expression of wild-type APOBEC3 greatly promotes viral replication/propagation, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the APOBEC-mediated mutations for fitness and evolution. Unlike the random mutations, this study suggests the predictability of all possible viral genome mutations by these APOBECs based on the UC/AC motifs and the viral genomic RNA structure.","output":"The Roles of APOBEC-mediated RNA Editing in SARS-CoV-2 Mutations, Replication and Fitness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in March 2020, small business lending through fintech lenders collapsed.

I then discuss some of the economic changes that have led some to question where occupations stand as a vehicle for analyzing social inequality, and then turn to a summary of the contributions to this issue. This summary is framed as a friendly family debate between those who wish to fix and refurbish the old reliable occupational perspective and those who think that researchers should trade in the old perspective for one focusing on firms and jobs. My review of the contributions to this issue suggests several avenues for future research including (1) new efforts to improve the quality of occupational coding, (2) a renewed focus on local labor markets as a better representation of where most people find employment, (3) an examination of whether occupational structures mattered more for explaining social inequalities in prior historical periods compared to the present, (4) examinations of how and where occupations matter cross-nationally, and finally (5) a renewed focus on units of measurement that people actually carry around with them and spend (dollars, euros, etc.) as opposed to logged earnings and socioeconomic status points.

The Play & Grow Cohort was established to investigate child growth in relation to parent-child interactions in mealtime and non-mealtime settings. PARTICIPANTS: Between December 2017 and May 2019, 300 toddlers and primary caregivers were recruited from records of a large paediatric care provider in Columbus, Ohio, USA. This report describes recruitment of the cohort and outlines the data collection protocols for two toddler and two preschool-age visits. The first study visit coincided with enrolment and occurred when children (57% boys) were a mean (SD) calendar age of 18.2 (0.7) months. FINDINGS TO DATE: Children in the cohort are diverse relative to gestational age at birth (16%, 28C31 completed weeks gestation; 21%, 32C36 weeks gestation; 63%, 37 weeks gestation) and race/ethnicity (8%, Hispanic; 35%, non-Hispanic black; 46%, non-Hispanic white). Caregivers enrolled in the cohort are primarily the childs biological mother (93%) and are diverse in age (range 18C54 years), education (23%, high school or less; 20% graduate degree) and annual household income (27%, <US$20 000 24%, US$90 000). Parent-child interactions were video-recorded during play in the laboratory at 18 months (n=299) and during play, reading and mealtime in the home (n=284) at 24 months. The preschool phase of the study was impacted by COVID-19. Parent-child interactions were video-recorded during play and mealtime at home at 36 months (n=141) and during a standardised buffet meal in the laboratory at 42 months (n=50).

Key to understanding their function is recognition of their pleiotropism and often overlapping and functional redundancies. Classified here into 9 main families, most of the 23 approved cytokine preparations (19 different cytokines and 4 pegylated), all in recombinant human (rh) form, are grouped in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon (IFN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor  (TGF) families. In the hematopoietin family, approved cytokines are aldesleukin (rhIL-2), oprelvekin (rhIL-11), filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim (rhG-CSF), sargramostim (rhGM-CSF), metreleptin (rh-leptin), ancestim (rh-SCF), and the rh-erythropoietins, epoetin and darbepoetin alfa. Anakinra, a recombinant receptor antagonist for IL-1, is in the IL-1 family; recombinant interferons alfa-1, alfa-2, beta-1, and gamma-1 make up the interferon family; palifermin (rhKGF) and becaplermin (rhPDGF) are in the PDGF family; and rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7 represent the TGF family. The main physicochemical features, FDA-approved indications, modes of action and side effects of these approved cytokines are presented. Underlying each adverse events profile is their pleiotropism, potency and capacity to release other cytokines producing cytokine cocktails. Side effects, some serious, occur despite cytokines being endogenous proteins, and this therefore demands caution in attempts to introduce individual members into the clinic.

PARTICIPANTS: All the employees of the hospital on a voluntary base, for a total of 4055 participants among 4572 HCWs (88.7%). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive serology according to working area. Association of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive serology to selected variables (age, gender, country of origin, body mass index, smoking, symptoms and contact with confirmed cases). RESULTS: From 27 April 2020 to 12 June 2020, 4055 HCWs were tested and 309 (7.6%) had a serological positive test. No relevant difference was found between men and women (8.3% vs 7.3%, p=0.3), whereas a higher prevalence was observed among foreign-born workers (27/186, 14.5%, p<0.001), employees younger than 30 (64/668, 9.6%, p=0.02) or older than 60 years (38/383, 9.9%, p=0.02) and among healthcare assistants (40/320, 12.5%, p=0.06). Working as frontline HCWs was not associated with an increased frequency of positive serology (p=0.42). A positive association was found with presence and number of symptoms (p<0.001). The symptoms most frequently associated with a positive serology were taste and smell alterations (OR 4.62, 95% CI: 2.99 to 7.15) and fever (OR 4.37, 95% CI: 3.11 to 6.13). No symptoms were reported in 84/309 (27.2%) HCWs with positive IgG levels.

The descriptive method is used in this research. Observations were made with interview techniques and documentation because they were very appropriate for studying descriptive social problems such as this research. The reasons for farmers and farm laborers to continue their activities are: First farm workers in PGL think that the COVID-19 pandemic will not hit their area;they believe they will remain healthy because of their work patterns that are outdoors and exposed to direct sunlight. The two economic factors and difficulties in fulfilling the necessities of life the third is the lack of public awareness of farmworkers about the dangers of COVID-19. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengkaji permasalahan tentang berbagai perilaku masyarakat dalam menghadapi ancaman COVID-19 terutama masyarakat kalangan buruh tani yang berada di kawasan Kecamatan PGL Kabupaten Bdg. Alasan mendasar dari penelitian ini adalah di tengah usaha pemerintah yang begitu besar dalam upaya menekan penyebaran virus ini dengan membatasi aktivitas masyarakat baik social distancing ataupun anjuran untuk stay at home di berbagai wilayah tetapi masyarakat kecamatan PGL khususnya pada kalangan petani dan buruh tani masih menjalankan aktivitasnya seperti sebelum terjadi pandemi COVID-19. Metode deskriptif digunakan dalam penelitian ini. Pengamatan dilakukan dengan teknik wawancara dan dokumentasi karena sangat tepat untuk mengkaji permasalahan sosial yang bersifat deskripsi seperti penelitian ini. Alasan para buruh tani tetap beraktivitas adalah: Pertama buruh tani di PGL beranggapan pandemik COVID-19 tidak akan melanda wilayahnya mereka berkeyakinan tetap sehat karena pola kerja mereka yang berada di luar ruangan dan terkena sinar matahari langsung. Kedua faktor ekonomi dan kesulitan dalam pemenuhan kebutuhan hidup;ketiga kurangnya kesadaran masyarakat kalangan buruh tani akan bahaya dari COVID-19.","output":"Sikap buruh tani di Kecamatan PGL BDG menghadapi anjuran stay at home"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to compare the gross and histopathologic changes following 1- versus 2-layer hand-sewn suture techniques in laparoscopic gastrointestinal anastomosis in dogs. METHODS This was an experimental prospective study of 16 healthy mixed breed male and female dogs. Animals were randomly divided into 2 groups. Two-layer side-to-side hand-sewn laparoscopic gastrojejunostomies were performed in group A, so that simple interrupted sutures were placed in the outer layer and simple continuous suture was used in the inner layer. The 1-layer simple continuous anastomosis between the stomach and jejunum was done in group B precisely. Specimen were collected from the sites of anastomosis, and H&E statining was performed for light microscopic studies. RESULTS All animals survived the surgery. There was no gross inflammation, ischemia, apparent granulation tissue, abscess or fistula formation, leakage or stricture formation, and all sites of anastomosis were patent. Several adhesion formations were found in the abdomen with the higher incidence in the control group. Mean scores of leukocyte infiltration and granulation tissue formation at the sites of anastomosis were statistically insignificant between groups (P>0.05).

The procoagulant tissue factor (TF) is thought to play a role in the coagulation disorders that characterize filoviral infections. In this study, we evaluated the pathogenesis of lethal infection with the Angola strain of Marburg virus (MARV-Ang) in rhesus macaques and tested the efficacy of recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), an inhibitor of TF/factor VIIa, as a potential treatment. Methods. Twelve rhesus macaques were challenged with a high dose (1000 pfu) of MARV-Ang. Six macaques were treated with rNAPc2, and 6 macaques served as control animals. Results. All 6 control animals succumbed to MARV-Ang challenge by day 8 (mean, 7.3 days), whereas 5 of 6 rNAPc2-treated animals died on day 9 and 1 rNAPc2-treated animal survived. The disease course for MARVAng infection appeared to progress more rapidly in rhesus macaques than has been previously reported for other strains of MARV. In contrast to Ebola virus (EBOV) infection in macaques, up-regulation of TF was not as striking, and deposition of fibrin was a less prominent pathologic feature of disease in these animals. Conclusions. These data show that the pathogenicity of MARV-Ang infection appears to be consistent with the apparent increased human virulence attributed to this strain. The apparent reduced efficacy of rNAPc2 against MARV-Ang infection, compared with its efficacy against EBOV infection, appears to be associated with differences in TF induction and fibrin deposition.","output":"Marburg Virus Angola Infection of Rhesus Macaques: Pathogenesis and Treatment with Recombinant Nematode Anticoagulant Protein c2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several independent risk factors have been reported to influence viral shedding following COVID-19 infection, but the influence of host-related molecular factors has not yet been described. We report a case of a cancer patient with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC) who manifested SARS-CoV-2 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) positivity for at least 54 days after contracting mild COVID-19 illness. We propose that deficient mismatch repair (MMR) may play a role in the prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. CASE PRESENTATION: A patient with Lynch syndrome was under surveillance for metastatic adenocarcinoma after completing palliative chemotherapy in October 2019. Between the period of April 2020 to June 2020, he was admitted multiple times to address several clinical needs mainly related to his underlying malignancy. These included progressive disease observed in the aortocaval lymph nodes leading to recurrent episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration resulting in acute kidney injury and a short-lived episode of pyrexia. A SARS-CoV-2 PCR of the nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was positive at his initial admission with mild COVID-19 symptoms. He remained positive on subsequent admissions when tested routinely for SARS-CoV-2 without demonstrating any apparent clinical features of COVID-19 infection. The MMR pathway, a component of DNA damage response (DDR), is impaired in Lynch syndrome due to an inherited genetic mutation. This pathway is also required for viral clearance from the host cells following certain RNA viral infections like influenza virus and other coronaviridae. Here we provide a current understanding of the importance of DDR deficiencies in the clearance of RNA virus and suggest how this may play a similar role in the clearance of COVID-19, as evident in our case that demonstrated persistent positivity. CONCLUSION: The importance of understanding the scientific basis of extended viral shedding during the COVID-19 pandemic is now centre-stage in the establishment of robust track and trace services to allow the recovery and function of societies and economies. This patient with Lynch syndrome recovered from infection but had prolonged viral positivity, which might merit further investigation to better understand the effect of this condition on infection duration and outcome.","output":"Deficient DNA mismatch repair and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding: a case report of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer with COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We provide a predictive analysis of the spread of COVID-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2, using the dataset made publicly available online by the Johns Hopkins University.

For this article, we draw on policy network approaches and network theory to analyze Twitter discussions around digital learning and homeschooling during the period of school closures in Germany due to the COVID-19 crisis. We use social network analysis to identify the actors involved and their influences in the issue-specific Twitter communication network. In recent years, Twitter has been increasingly used for exchanges on education policy content, mainly by political and civil society actors. Our study shows that with respect to digital learning and homeschooling, it was primarily individual experts and consultants as well as corporations which influenced the discourse.

The Gender Similarities Hypothesis suggests there are more similarities than differences and the Divorce Stress Adjustment Perspective suggests that structural inequalities may contribute to adverse postdivorce outcomes. We conducted secondary analyses from an RCT study to investigate if there were gender-specific trajectories and whether gender was associated with outcomes (self-perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatization, general hostility, and overall mental and physical health) after controlling for effects of the intervention, income, and number of children using linear mixed-effect regression modeling, and whether number of children and income influenced these outcomes. Participants were 1,239 women and 617 men from the Cooperation after Divorce (CAD) study, conducted in Denmark, a country with less income disparity, high gender equality, shared childrearing by men and women, and societal acceptance of divorce. The analyses assessing the relationship between gender and 12-month postdivorce adjustment in terms of physical and mental health outcomes revealed that for self-perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatization, hostility, and overall mental and physical health in this sample postdivorce adjustment trajectories were not gender-specific, and gender was only significantly associated with stress and somatization as a time-invariant additive effect. These findings suggest gender similarities in postdivorce adjustment and contribute to the Gender Similarities Hypothesis and the Divorce-Stress-Adjustment-Perspective by assessing individuals' postdivorce adjustment in a low-stigma and relatively egalitarian setting, providing a clearer assessment of the role of gender without potentially confounding issues of structural inequalities.

Here, the authors compared demographic variables, aneurysm-related variables, and comorbidities in patients who received microsurgical or endovascular treatment and those who were conservatively managed to determine which factors push the surgeon toward recommending treatment. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients diagnosed with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm at their institution between January 1, 2013, and January 1, 2016. These patients were dichotomized based on whether their aneurysm was treated. Demographic, geographic, socioeconomic, comorbidity, and aneurysm-related information was analyzed to assess which factors were associated with the decision to treat. RESULTS A total of 424 patients were identified, 163 who were treated surgically or endovascularly and 261 who were managed conservatively. In a multivariable model, an age < 65 years (OR 2.913, 95% CI 1.298-6.541, p = 0.010), a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 1.536, 95% CI 1.274-1.855, p < 0.001), a larger aneurysm size (OR 1.176, 95% CI 1.100-1.257, p < 0.001), multiple aneurysms (OR 2.093, 95% CI 1.121-3.907, p = 0.020), a white race (OR 2.288, 95% CI 1.245-4.204, p = 0.008), and living further from the medical center (OR 2.125, 95% CI 1.281-3.522, p = 0.003) were all associated with the decision to treat rather than observe. CONCLUSIONS Whereas several factors were expected to be considered in the decision to treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms, including age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, aneurysm size, and multiple aneurysms, other factors such as race and proximity to the medical center were unanticipated.

Clinical practices and perceptions of palliative physicians towards depression care have not been characterised in this setting. The objective of this study was to characterise current palliative clinicians reported practices and perceptions in depression screening, assessment and management in the very poor prognosis setting. METHODS: In this cross-sectional cohort study, 72 palliative physicians and 32 psychiatrists were recruited from Australian and New Zealand Society of Palliative Medicine and Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists between February and July 2020 using a 23-item anonymous online survey. RESULTS: Only palliative physicians results were reported due to poor psychiatry representation. Palliative physicians perceived depression care in this setting to be complex and challenging. 40.0% reported screening for depression. All experienced uncertainty when assessing depression aetiology. Approaches to somatic symptom assessment varied. Physicians were generally less likely to intervene for depression than in the better prognosis setting. Most reported barriers to care included the perceived lack of rapidly effective therapeutic options (77.3%), concerns of patient burden and intolerance (71.2%), and the complexity in diagnostic differentiation (53.0%). 66.7% desired better collaboration between palliative care and psychiatry. CONCLUSIONS: Palliative physicians perceived depression care in patients with very poor prognoses to be complex and challenging. The lack of screening, variations in assessment approaches, and the reduced likelihood of intervening in comparison to the better prognosis setting necessitate better collaboration between palliative care and psychiatry in service delivery, training and research.

In a pivotal study, a recently approved oral TRT only 26% of patients did not require any dose adjustment. Typically, patients start on a sub-therapeutic dose with gradual dose increases to attain efficacy resulting in additional visit(s) to clinic and pharmacy. Physician research data (N=402) suggested it typically takes 3-6 months of titrations to reach an efficacious dose for majority of patients, a significant barrier in effecting a switch without a period of efficacy gap. The requirement of additional visit(s) presents significant challenges for new and current patients desiring to start and to switch to a convenient TRT option, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Recent reports suggest increase of disease severity/mortality in men with low testosterone is possibly due to underlying co-morbidities commonly associated with male hypogonadism. There remains a need for an effective, safe, and easy to use and prescribe product that does not require dose titration. TLANDO is a triglyceride-free oral single strength TRT with single dose designed to lymphatically deliver effective and safe levels of testosterone regardless of meal fat content. Moreover, dose titration is prone to some inherent titration decision errors and requires understanding of often complex titration rules. The objective is to assess whether TLANDO, an oral TRT without requiring dose titration, safely restores effective testosterone (T) levels in hypogonadal men. An open-label, single-arm, multicenter study (NCT03242590) was performed with TLANDO in hypogonadal males (N=95). Subjects received orally 225 mg twice a day testosterone undecanoate (TU) for 24 days without dose adjustment. Efficacy was evaluated by % of subjects who achieved daily T Cavg within the eugonadal range. Using 450mg daily dose without dose adjustment, 80% of subjects (95% CI of 72% to 88%) achieved a T Cavg in the normal range and safely restored with mean T Cavg of 476184 ng/dL post steady state. T restoration was comparable to other non-oral TRT products. TLANDO was well tolerated with no deaths, no drug-related severe AEs, and no hepatic AEs. In conclusion, effective T restoration using TLANDO, an easy to use and prescribe oral TRT option, was confirmed. Minimal AEs were reported with no hepatic AEs. Upon approval, TLANDO will be the first convenient TRT option without requiring dose adjustments;therefore, enabling selection of an efficacious dose from the start of therapy.

METHODS The clinical records of patients with macular dystrophy and biallelic variants in CDHR1 were reviewed. Data analysed included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus images: autofluorescence (AF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT); full field electroretinography (ERG) and pattern ERG (PERG). RESULTS Seven patients from six pedigrees were ascertained. One patient was homozygous for a known synonymous variant p.(Pro261=), four were compound heterozygous for the p.(Pro261=) variant and a novel allele of CDHR1: p.(Gly188Ser), p.(Met1?), or p.(Val458Asp); one patient was compound heterozygous for two previously unreported variants: c.297+1G>T in trans with p.(Pro735Thr). The range of BCVA at the last clinic review was (6/5-6/60). Autofluorescence showed macular flecks of increased AF in mild cases and patches of reduced AF in severe cases. The OCT showed attenuation of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in mild cases and loss of the EZ and the outer nuclear layer in severe cases; one patient had subfoveal hyporeflective region between the EZ and the retinal pigment epithelium. The full field ERG was normal or borderline subnormal in all cases, and the PERG was subnormal in mild cases or undetectable in severe cases.

Twenty-one days later, the US identified its first case--a man who had traveled from Wuhan to the state of Washington. Recent studies in the Wuhan and Seattle metropolitan areas retrospectively tested samples taken from patients with COVID-like symptoms. In the Wuhan study, there were 4 SARS-CoV-2 positives and 7 influenza positives out of 26 adults outpatients who sought care for influenza-like-illness at two central hospitals prior to January 12, 2020. The Seattle study reported 25 SARS-CoV-2 positives and 442 influenza positives out of 2353 children and adults who reported acute respiratory illness prior to March 9, 2020. Here, we use these findings to extrapolate the early prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in Wuhan and Seattle. Methods: For each city, we estimate the ratio of COVID-19 to influenza infections from the retrospective testing data and estimate the age-specific prevalence of influenza from surveillance reports during the same time period. Combining these, we approximate the total number of symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Findings: In Wuhan, there were an estimated 1386 [95% CrI: 420-3793] symptomatic cases over 30 of COVID-19 between December 30, 2019 and January 12, 2020. In Seattle, we estimate that 2268 [95% CrI: 498, 6069] children under 18 and 4367 [95% CrI: 2776, 6526] adults were symptomatically infected between February 24 and March 9, 2020. We also find that the initial pandemic wave in Wuhan likely originated with a single infected case who developed symptoms sometime between October 26 and December 13, 2019; in Seattle, the seeding likely occurred between December 25, 2019 and January 15, 2020. Interpretation: The spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Seattle was far more extensive than initially reported. The virus likely spread for months in Wuhan before the lockdown. Given that COVID-19 appears to be overwhelmingly mild in children, our high estimate for symptomatic pediatric cases in Seattle suggests that there may have been thousands more mild cases at the time.","output":"Using the COVID-19 to influenza ratio to estimate early pandemic spread in Wuhan, China and Seattle, US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study evaluated the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 and adverse outcomes in patients with comorbidities (outcome: death).

We sought to evaluate this question using a well-validated scoring system (the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema [RALE] score) using data over 6 months from a large, multi-hospital healthcare system including all adult (age &gt;= 18) patients. Methods: We collected CXRs, demographic, historic and clinical data from patients with a nasoand/ or oropharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR visiting the ED for COVID-19-related complaints between March and September 2020. Two independent reviewers quantified radiographic edema using the RALE scoring system. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was calculated using 1 liter per minute (lpm) supplemental O2 to 3% FiO2 conversion and capped at 15 lpm O2. We examined the association of radiographic edema with hypoxemia, need for hospital admission, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation within 7 days of admission and 30-day mortality. Results: 453 patients met criteria for inclusion (median age 54, 51% female). Inter-rate agreement for RALE score was excellent (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.89, 95% CI 0.87-0.92, p &lt; 0.0001). 99 patients had a normal (RALE = 0) CXR on ED visit. Median RALE score was 3. RALE scores negatively correlated with degree of hypoxemia as quantified by SpO2-FiO2 (SF) ratio (r =-0.34, p &lt; 0.001). Patients admitted to the hospital had higher RALE scores than those who were discharged home (median 2 IQR [0, 6] vs 3 [10, 17], p &lt; 0.001). Among 199 patients admitted to the hospital, RALE scores were higher in those requiring admission to the ICU compared to those who did not (7 [14,20], 2 [8,16], p = 0.007). Patients in the 3rd and 4th RALE quartiles were more likely to require mechanical ventilation and had higher 30-day mortality compared to those with RALE scores below the median, even after adjustment for age, SF ratio and history of diabetes (p &lt; 0.02 for all). Conclusions: The RALE score is highly reproducible and easily implementable in adult patients presenting to the ED with COVID-19. Its association with physiologic parameters and outcomes makes it a readily available tool for prognostication and early ICU triage, particularly in patients with severe radiographic edema as quantified by the RALE score.","output":"Emergency department chest x-ray severity in patients with COVID-19 is associated with hypoxemia and clinical outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adequate characterization of chemical entities made for biological screening in the drug discovery context is critical. Incorrectly characterized structures lead to mistakes in the interpretation of structure-activity relationships and confuse an already multidimensional optimization problem.

Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) represents the gold standard for diagnostic assays even if it cannot precisely quantify viral RNA copies. Thus, we decided to compare qRT-PCR with digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR), which is able to give an accurate number of RNA copies that can be found in a specimen. However, the aforementioned methods are not capable to discriminate if the detected RNA is infectious or not. For this purpose, it is necessary to perform an endpoint titration on cell cultures, which is largely used in the research field and provides a tissue culture infecting dose per mL (TCID50/mL) value. Both research and diagnostics call for a model that allows the comparison between the results obtained employing different analytical methods. The aim of this study is to define a comparison among two qRT-PCR protocols (one with preliminary RNA extraction and purification and an extraction-free qRT-PCR), a dPCR and a titration on cell cultures. The resulting correlations yield a faithful estimation of the total number of RNA copies and of the infectious viral burden from a Ct value obtained with diagnostic routine tests.

AIM To provide insight into existing initiatives to support the practice of continuous sedation until death and assess their feasibility and effectiveness. DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis, registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020149630). DATA SOURCES Records were searched through MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Web of Science from inception to April 16 2020. Peer-reviewed studies reporting original data on initiatives to support the practice of continuous sedation were included for review. RESULTS Twenty-one studies met the criteria and were included. Initiatives were focused on assessment tools of consciousness and discomfort (9), the use of guidelines and protocols (8), and expert consultation (3). All initiatives were reported as useful, acceptable, and feasible. Studies on the use of monitoring devices showed that a small proportion of patients were found to be awake, despite the patient being unresponsive according to the observer-based sedation scales. However, the wide range of values of these monitoring devices for comfortable and adequately sedated patients seems to hamper its overall implementation in daily clinical practice. Physicians reported changes in practice conform to guideline recommendations but the shift was modest at best. Expert consultation was regarded as supportive when sufficient expertise is lacking and helpful in avoiding possibly unnecessary sedations.

In the structure of mental health disorders associated with the COVID-19 epidemic, there is a large range of adaptation disorders: fear, frustration, a sense of hopelessness, expectation of threat, loneliness, social isolation and alienation. In the situation of COVID-19, there is often a depletion of mental resources and maladaptation, a disorder of adaptive reactions. Anxiety disorders occur in the form of adaptation disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, somato-form disorders, including panic attacks. Timely diagnosis of these disorders is possible not only by the psychiatric service, but also with the involvement of internists who possess screening diagnostic tools with automated conclusions (scales, mobile applications to smartphones, etc.). A brief review of domestic and foreign studies on the assessment of methods for the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders is presented.

The pathology of COVID-19 in children is not known; the proposed pathogenesis for severe cases includes immune-mediated mechanisms or the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on tissues. We describe the autopsy findings in five cases of paediatric COVID-19 and provide mechanistic insight into the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Children and adolescents who died with COVID-19 between March 18 and August 15, 2020 were autopsied with a minimally invasive method. Tissue samples from all vital organs were analysed by histology, electron microscopy (EM), reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). FINDINGS: Five patients were included, one male and four female, aged 7 months to 15 years. Two patients had severe diseases before SARS-CoV-2 infection: adrenal carcinoma and Edwards syndrome. Three patients were previously healthy and had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with distinct clinical presentations: myocarditis, colitis, and acute encephalopathy with status epilepticus. Autopsy findings varied amongst patients and included mild to severe COVID-19 pneumonia, pulmonary microthrombosis, cerebral oedema with reactive gliosis, myocarditis, intestinal inflammation, and haemophagocytosis. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all patients in lungs, heart and kidneys by at least one method (RT-PCR, IHC or EM), and in endothelial cells from heart and brain in two patients with MIS-C (IHC). In addition, we show for the first time the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain tissue of a child with MIS-C with acute encephalopathy, and in the intestinal tissue of a child with acute colitis. Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 can infect several cell and tissue types in paediatric patients, and the target organ for the clinical manifestation varies amongst individuals. Two major patterns of severe COVID-19 were observed: a primarily pulmonary disease, with severe acute respiratory disease and diffuse alveolar damage, or a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with the involvement of several organs. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in several organs, associated with cellular ultrastructural changes, reinforces the hypothesis that a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on tissues is involved in the pathogenesis of MIS-C.

The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODOLOGY: We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained daily blanket testing rate of &#8805; 7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of &#8805; 10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of &#8805; 4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our model predicts that active isolation of COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic individuals, through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for the control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia, but it would come at a high cost.","output":"Assessing required SARS-CoV-2 blanket testing rates for possible control of the outbreak in the epicentre Lusaka province of Zambia with consideration for asymptomatic individuals: A simple mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The link between crude oil price and stock returns of the Group of Seven (G7) countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) was analyzed in this study using monthly data from January 1999 to March 2020.

Owing to its economic strength and imbalances, South Africa is of particular relevance with regard to the drastic measures to prevent the spread of this novel coronavirus. In March 2020, South Africa imposed one of the most severe lockdowns worldwide and subsequently faced the number of infections slowing down considerably. In May 2020, this lockdown was partially relaxed and further easing of restrictions was envisaged. In July and August 2020, daily new infections peaked and declined subsequently. Lockdown measures were further relaxed. This study aims to assess the recent and upcoming measures from an epidemiological perspective. Agent-based epidemic simulations are used to depict the effects of policy measures on the further course of this epidemic. The results indicate that measures that are either lifted too early or are too lenient have no sufficient mitigating effects on infection rates. Consequently, continuous exponential infection growth rates or a second significant peak of infected people occur. These outcomes are likely to cause higher mortality rates once healthcare capacities are occupied and no longer capable to treat all severely and critically infected COVID-19 patients. In contrast, strict measures appear to be a suitable way to contain the virus.

Although they have proven to be very effective in the general population, little is known about their efficacy in immunocompromised patients. HIV-infected individuals response to vaccine may vary according to the type of vaccine and their level of immunosuppression. We evaluated immunogenicity of an mRNA anti-SARS CoV-2 vaccine in HIV-positive individuals. MethodsHIV-positive individuals (n=121) were recruited from HIV clinics in Montreal and stratified according to their CD4 counts. A control group of 20 health care workers naive to SARS CoV-2 was used. The participants Anti-RBD IgG responses were measured by ELISA at baseline and 3 to 4 weeks after receiving the first dose of an mRNA vaccine). ResultsEleven of 121 participants had anti-COVID-19 antibodies at baseline, and a further 4 had incomplete data for the analysis. Mean anti-RBD IgG responses were similar between between the HIV negative control group (n=20) and the combined HIV+ group (n=106) (p = 0.72). However, these responses were significantly lower in the group with <250 CD4 cells/mm3. (p<0.0001). Increasing age was independently associated with decreased immunogenicity. ConclusionHIV-positive individuals with CD4 counts over 250 cells/mm3 have an anti-RBD IgG response similar to the general population. However, HIV-positive individuals with the lowest CD4 counts (<250 cells/mm3) have a weaker response.

Yet, biotic and abiotic environmental factors can strongly affect disease dynamics, and ultimately, hostCparasite coevolution. Here, we review research on how environmental context alters virulenceCtransmission relationships, focusing on the off-host portion of the parasite life cycle, and how variation in parasite survival affects the evolution of virulence and transmission. We review three inter-related approaches that have dominated the study of the evolution of virulence and transmission for different hostCparasite systems: (i) evolutionary trade-off theory, (ii) parasite local adaptation and (iii) parasite phylodynamics. These approaches consider the role of the environment in virulence and transmission evolution from different angles, which entail different advantages and potential biases. We suggest improvements to how to investigate virulenceCtransmission relationships, through conceptual and methodological developments and taking environmental context into consideration. By combining developments in life-history evolution, phylogenetics, adaptive dynamics and comparative genomics, we can improve our understanding of virulenceCtransmission relationships across a diversity of hostCparasite systems that have eluded experimental study of parasite life history.","output":"The roles of environmental variation and parasite survival in virulenceCtransmission relationships"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: For protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Korean government recommended the KF94 mask or that a mask at the same level as the KF94 should be worn when contacting a patient with COVID-19. Furthermore, adequately fitted N95 respirators and KF94 masks are essential. We investigated the fit tests to determine whether healthcare workers had adequate protection with N95 respirators and KF94 masks. METHODS: In this prospective single-center simulation study, five N95 respirators (two made in the USA by 3M and three made in Korea) and six KF94 masks, the Korean standard medical masks, were tested. The fit factor (FF) and leakage rate were evaluated using a two-fit test device. Adequate protection (defined as FF &#8805; 100 or leakage rate &#8804; 5) rates were compared between N95 respirators and KF94 masks, and between made in Korea and the 3M N95 respirators. For KF94 masks, adequate protection rates were compared before and after ear strap fixation. RESULTS: Overall, 30 participants were enrolled, and 330 fit tests were performed for FF and leakage rate. Adequate protection rates of all tested N95 respirators and KF94 masks were 22.7% (n = 75) by FF and 20.6% (n = 68) by leakage rate. N95 respirators showed a significantly higher adequate protection rate than KF94 masks for FF (48.7% vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001) and leakage rate (42.0% vs. 2.8%, P < 0.001). Adequate protection rate of 3M-made N95 respirators was significantly higher than that of those made in Korea (83.3% vs. 25.6% in FF, P < 0.001; 73.3% vs. 21.1% in leakage rate, P < 0.001). In KF94 masks, after fixation of ear strap with a hook, adequate protection rate improved significantly (1.1% vs. 12.8% in FF, P < 0.001; 2.8% vs. 11.1%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although adequate protection rate of N95 respirators was higher than that of KF94 masks, N95 respirator protection rate was not optimum. Thus, it is necessary to minimize exposure to risk by selecting an appropriate mask or respirator that adequately fits each person, and by wearing respirators or masks appropriately, before contacting the patients. With their superior protection rate, wearing N95 respirators is recommended instead of KF94 masks, especially when performing aerosol-generating procedures.","output":"Fit Test for N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators and KF94 Masks for Healthcare Workers: a Prospective Single-center Simulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a pandemic, infecting more than 4,000,000 people worldwide. This review describes the main clinical features of COVID-19 and potential role of microbiota in COVID-19. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 79.5% nucleotide sequence identity and use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter host cells. The distribution of ACE2 may determine how SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory and digestive tract. SARS and COVID-19 share similar clinical features, although the estimated fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower. The communication between the microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 and the role of this association in diagnosis and treatment are unclear. Changes in the lung microbiota were identified in COVID-19 patients, and the enrichment of the lung microbiota with bacteria found in the intestinal tract is correlated with the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome and long-term outcomes. ACE2 regulates the gut microbiota by indirectly controlling the secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Moreover, the gut microbiota enhances antiviral immunity by increasing the number and function of immune cells, decreasing immunopathology, and stimulating interferon production. In turn, respiratory viruses are known to influence microbial composition in the lung and intestine. Therefore, the analysis of changes in the microbiota during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help predict patient outcomes and allow the development of microbiota-based therapies.","output":"Main Clinical Features of COVID-19 and Potential Prognostic and Therapeutic Value of the Microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: 3D printed patient-specific anatomical models have been applied clinically to orthopaedic care for surgical planning and patient education. The estimated cost and print time per model for 3D printers have not yet been compared with clinically representative models across multiple printing technologies. This study investigates six commercially-available 3D printers: Prusa i3 MK3S, Formlabs Form 2, Formlabs Form 3, LulzBot TAZ 6, Stratasys F370, and Stratasys J750 Digital Anatomy. METHODS: Seven representative orthopaedic standard tessellation models derived from CT scans were imported into the respective slicing software for each 3D printer. For each printer and corresponding print setting, the slicing software provides a print time and material use estimate. Material quantity was used to calculate estimated model cost. Print settings investigated were infill percentage, layer height, and model orientation on the print bed. The slicing software investigated are Cura LulzBot Edition 3.6.20, GrabCAD Print 1.43, PreForm 3.4.6, and PrusaSlicer 2.2.0. RESULTS: The effect of changing infill between 15% and 20% on estimated print time and material use was negligible. Orientation of the model has considerable impact on time and cost with worst-case differences being as much as 39.30% added print time and 34.56% added costs. Averaged across all investigated settings, horizontal model orientation on the print bed minimizes estimated print time for all 3D printers, while vertical model orientation minimizes cost with the exception of Stratasys J750 Digital Anatomy, in which horizontal orientation also minimized cost. Decreasing layer height for all investigated printers increased estimated print time and decreased estimated cost with the exception of Stratasys F370, in which cost increased. The difference in material cost was two orders of magnitude between the least and most-expensive printers. The difference in build rate (cm(3)/min) was one order of magnitude between the fastest and slowest printers. CONCLUSIONS: All investigated 3D printers in this study have the potential for clinical utility. Print time and print cost are dependent on orientation of anatomy and the printers and settings selected. Cost-effective clinical 3D printing of anatomic models should consider an appropriate printer for the complexity of the anatomy and the experience of the printer technicians.

In comparison to common cases, severe cases showed older age, more comorbidities, abnormal immune responses, as well as liver, renal, cardiac and coagulation disorders. Multivariable logistic regression identified that older age , combining with arrhythmia, abnormal lymphocyte percentage, elevated hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) and myocardial injury were the independent risk factors for the incidence of severe cases. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with myocardial injury had increasing risks of mortality, incidence of severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Particularly, myocardial injury patients co-existed with any other risk factor further deteriorated the clinical outcomes.

As one of the pioneers, the U.S. Center for Disease Control proposes a phased plan to promote the vaccination process. This plan starts with vaccinating the high-priority population in Phase I, then turns to the remainder of the public in Phase II, and ends with a scale-back network in Phase III. The phased plan not only provides a sense of hope to impacted communities that this global pandemic can be defeated, but can serve as a template for other countries. To enhance this plan, this paper develops a generalizable framework for designing a hub-and-spoke vaccination dispensing network to achieve the goals in the Phase 2, which aims to expand the vaccination coverage for the general public. We introduce a new coverage index to measure the priority of different potential dispensing sites based on geo-data and develop an optimization model for network design. The hub-and-spoke network enhances the accessibility of the vaccines to various communities and helps to overcome the challenges related to ultra-cold storage facility shortage. A case study of Middlesex County in New Jersey is presented to demonstrate the application of the framework and provide insights for the Phase 2. Results from the baseline scenario show that increasing the driving time limit from 10 minutes to 25 minutes can improve the total coverage index from 40.8 to 55.9. Additionally, we explore how the changes of parameters impact the network design and discuss potential solutions for some special cases. When we allow 4 outreach nodes per hub, all potential 45 outreach points can be covered in the vaccination network within a 20-minute drive, and the total coverage index reaches its maximum value of 58.3.","output":"A Hub-and-spoke Design for Ultra-cold COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim To study the knowledge, anxiety level and perceptions on prevention protocol towards COVID19 among medical and dental students Methodology: The study population was under graduate and post graduate students of medical and dental colleges of India whose conventional academic curriculum was withdrawn due to COVID19 lockdown An online semi-structured questionnaire was developed based on Current interim guidelines for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO and circulated This online self-reported questionnaire contained the following three sections related to knowledge anxiety and perception on prevention protocol among medical and dental students There were 7 multiple choice questions in the knowledge section Anxiety related section and perception on prevention protocol related to novel coronavirus contained 9 items that were to be rated in the 5-point Likert scale The data was statistically analysed Result: Around 52% of the students have good knowledge about COVID19 transmission and diagnosis Most of the students (55 7%) are comfortable with their virtual classrooms and around 54 5% of students showed self-interest to volunteer patient care without more anxiety Over 42 2% of students needed faculty supervision and other health professionals acting within their scope of practice and around 82% of students wanted to follow strict preventive protocols to protect themselves from COVID19 infection Conclusion: Most of the students are having good knowledge about COVID19 even though they are anxious about their academic curriculum and risk of exposure at present situation The perception on prevention protocol evaluation showed that there should be strong need to implement infection control measures for COVID19 across all healthcare institutions","output":"Knowledge, anxiety level and perceptions on prevention protocol of covid19 among medical and dental graduates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present article is being written against the backdrop of the worldwide microeconomic crisis, which has raised a question mark on our very existence.

Our study objective was to understand changes in emergency department (ED) utilization following a nonfatal opioid overdose during COVID-19 compared to historical controls in 6 healthcare systems across the United States. METHODS: Opioid overdoses were retrospectively identified among adult visits to 25 EDs in Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island from January 2018 to December 2020. Overdose visit counts and rates per 100 all-cause ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with the levels predicted based on 2018 and 2019 visits using graphical analysis and an epidemiologic outbreak detection cumulative sum algorithm. RESULTS: Overdose visit counts increased by 10.5% (n=3486; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.18% to 17.0%) in 2020 compared with the counts in 2018 and 2019 (n=3020 and n=3285, respectively), despite a 14% decline in all-cause ED visits. Opioid overdose rates increased by 28.5% (95% CI 23.3% to 34.0%) from 0.25 per 100 ED visits in 2018 to 2019 to 0.32 per 100 ED visits in 2020. Although all 6 studied health care systems experienced overdose ED visit rates more than the 95th percentile prediction in 6 or more weeks of 2020 (compared with 2.6 weeks as expected by chance), 2 health care systems experienced sustained outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Despite decreases in ED visits for other medical emergencies, the numbers and rates of opioid overdose-related ED visits in 6 health care systems increased during 2020, suggesting a widespread increase in opioid-related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, a cross-correlation analysis has been performed to find a synthetic indicator of the time delay between the predictor and the infected time series. Our results show that Twitter data are more related to social and political dynamics, while the emergency calls trends can be further evaluated as a powerful tool to potentially forecast new stress periods.

A potential alternative method is the determination of affinity maturation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, expressed as the SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity. METHODS SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentration and avidity were measured in sera of hospitalized COVID-19 patients sampled at two weeks and 12 weeks post symptom onset using an in-house developed protocol based on EUROIMMUN (anti-spike) and EDI? (anti-nucleocapsid) SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA protocols. RESULTS We included 68 confirmed COVID-19 patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in both the initial and follow-up specimen sampled at a median of 14 (range 10-18) days and 120 (range 84-189) days, respectively, post symptom onset. The median anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity response was 40% (range 9-93%) and 72% (range 27-104%), respectively, for the first sample, and 66% (range 28-90%) and 57% (range 25-94%), respectively, for the second sample. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity results 60% was significantly lower for anti-spike compared to anti-nucleocapsid IgG for initial samples (p< 0.01) and vice versa for follow-up samples (p< 0.01). CONCLUSION Anti-nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 IgG maturation occurs faster and avidity decreases faster than anti-spike IgG, indicating different kinetics of anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG. Further, affinity maturation after SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently incomplete.","output":"Different long-term avidity maturation for IgG anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that emerged in human populations recently. Severely ill COVID-19 patients exhibit the elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, and such an unbalanced production of proinflammatory cytokines is linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome with high mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our study provides evidence that the ORF3a, M, ORF7a, and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were NF-B activators. The viral sequence from infected zoo lions belonged to clade V, and a single mutation of G251V is found for ORF3a gene compared to all other clades. No significant functional difference was found for clade V ORF3a, indicating the NF-B activation is conserved among COVID-19 variants. Of the four viral proteins, the ORF7a protein induced the NF-B dictated proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-, and IFN. The ORF7a protein also induced IL-3, IL-4, IL-7, IL-23. Of 15 different chemokines examined in the study, CCL11, CCL17, CCL19, CCL20, CCL21, CCL22, CCL25, CCL26, CCL27, and CXCL9 were significantly upregulated by ORF7. These cytokines and chemokines were frequently elevated in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Our data provide an insight into how SARS-CoV-2 modulates NF-B signaling and inflammatory cytokine expressions.

Mesh fixation with sutures may be a contributing factor to this pain. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of chronic pain and limitation of activities of daily living following inguinal hernia repair using a sutured mesh to a self-adhesive mesh, 6 months and 1 year following surgery. METHODS All consecutive patients presenting to NHS Fife for open hernia repair between January 2009 and January 2010 were included in our analysis. A prospective survey of postoperative pain and activities of daily living was conducted at 6 months and 1 year following hernia repair. Chronic pain was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. The primary end points for analysis were incidence of chronic pain and limitation of activities of daily living. RESULTS Overall, 132 of 215 patients completed the questionnaire, 69 in the sutured group and 63 in the self-adhesive mesh group. The need for analgesics was similar during the first 24 h after surgery. Wound infections were detected in one patient in the Lichtenstein group and two in the second group. The incidence of chronic pain was 21 and 7.9% at 6 months and 18.8 and 6.3% at 1 year (p < 0.05). Moderate and vigorous activities were found to be limited some to all of the time in nine patients (60%) in the suture fixation group and in one patient in the self-adhesive group (20%, p < 0.02).

The authors use probabilistic models to determine the conditions under which quarantine is expected to be useful. Results demonstrate that the number of infections averted (per initially infected individual) through the use of quarantine is expected to be very low provided that isolation is effective, but it increases abruptly and at an accelerating rate as the effectiveness of isolation diminishes.

Both the development and the production of these vaccines opened a path of hope, but the inequality in vaccine distribution raises great concerns about the possibility of effectively eradicating the virus. Methods It is particularly important to analyse the extent to which vaccines are equally distributed and investigate the possible effects of vaccine inequalities as well as its major drivers. For this purpose, this paper investigates the extent of equitable vaccine distribution using some well-known inequality measures and disentangles the main drivers of the share of vaccination. In addition, the paper analyses the relationship between the vaccination rate, the GDP growth, and the incidence of the coronavirus disease, with the aim of providing empirical evidence on existing relationships worldwide. Results Our findings show that the situation is more challenging in less developed countries, especially African countries, due to weak health systems and low rates of vaccination. Moreover, we find a positive relationship between the share of vaccinated individuals and GDP. Consequently, the poorest, least developed countries with a lower rate of vaccine uptake will experience lower GDP growth. Conclusions Vaccines and the vaccination process reveal the existing inequalities between countries and how they, in turn, impact the well-being of their citizens. People who live in less developed countries have a lower probability of being vaccinated, which translates into a greater probability of dying from COVID. Countries are seeing their economic future compromised by low vaccination levels, given the positive and significant relationship between the vaccination rate and GDP growth. In short, while some countries are trying to get back to some sort of normality, even with some pandemic protocols, the situation in less developed countries is more challenging due to weak health systems and low rates of vaccination. Consequently, the poorest, least developed countries with a lower rate of vaccine penetration will experience lower GDP growth, and the pandemic will have a greater effect on their economy due to low vaccination rates.","output":"Is COVID-19 vaccine inequality undermining the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has shocked the world causing more victims than the latest global epidemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012.

Morphological operators, Gabor filter banks and attribute filters are used for contextual feature extraction. Then, two convolutional filters are applied to the contextual feature cube to extract the nonlinear sub-features and hidden relationships among the contextual features.

The period after lockdown included the lockdown phase (March 22 to May 31, 2020) and unlock phase (June 1 to November 5, 2020). Mothers delivered during this period in the study area were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted in a subsample to understand the experiences, challenges, and factors for underutilization of healthcare services. FINDINGS: The survey covered a total population of 21,025 in 4,762 households; 199 eligible mothers (mean age 27.4 years) were interviewed. In women who delivered after lockdown against before lockdown, adjusted odds of having >2 antenatal care visits in the third trimester was 80% lower (aOR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1C0.5); proportion of institutional deliveries was lower (93 vs. 97%); exclusive breastfeeding during first 6 months of birth (64.5 vs. 75.7%) and health worker home visitation within 6 weeks of birth (median, 1 vs. 3 visits) were substantially lower. Fear of contracting COVID-19, poor quality of services, lack of transportation and financial constraints were key issues faced by mothers in accessing health care. More than three-fourth (81%) of the mothers reported feeling down, depressed or hopeless after lockdown.

By incorporating cognitive and physical function assessment, this study aimed to evaluate prevalence and factors associated with cognitive and physical dysfunction in older diabetic people. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was performed from August 1, 2017 to November 30, 2018. The patients aged 65 years or older with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled and the disease was routinely evaluated by blood hemoglobin A1c (A1C), blood pressure, lipids, and kidney function measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin-creatinine rate (UACR). Besides, cognitive dysfunction through Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), and functional disabilities by Activities of Daily Living (ADL) questionnaire were assessed simultaneously. RESULTS: Among 863 patients (48.3% men) with a median age of 72.0 years (interquartile range or IQR: 67.0C78.0 years), 159 (18.5%) had cognitive impairment assessed by MMSE, while 40 (4.6%) experienced at least one problem in ADL. With different A1C stratifications, it was shown that both MMSE and ADL scores were associated with glycemic control. Patients with impaired MMSE and ADL scores were older, had lower eGFR, lower blood pressure, and higher UACR levels. After adjustment of possible confounders, it was shown that age and eGFR predicted MMSE and ADL score impairment. CONCLUSION: By incorporating physical and cognitive function screening program into routine care at a diabetes outpatient clinic, our study found that both cognitive and physical function impairment were common in older diabetic patients, and their relevant factors, including older age, and lower eGFR. It was recommended that in older individuals with diabetes, particularly those with risk factors, an additional assessment of cognitive and physical functions can be integrated into routine clinical process to provide more comprehensive management plans.","output":"Kidney Function and Risk of Physical and Cognitive Impairment in Older Persons with Type 2 Diabetes at an Outpatient Clinic with Geriatric Assessment Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an acute, febrile, and potentially fatal tick-borne disease caused by the SFTS Phlebovirus.

Complications were observed in 37/58 (63.8%) and 25/83 (30.1%) patients in the steroid and non-steroid groups, respectively (P < .001). Survival analysis after propensity score matching showed a significant difference in mean 30-day survival time between the non-steroid and steroid groups in patients with a mild condition [Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score <14; 29.2 (95% CI 27.70C30.73] vs. 24.9 (95% CI 21.21C28.53], P = .022]. Survival times for the early steroid (5 days from the start of therapy after symptom onset), late steroid (>5 days), and non-steroid groups, were 18.4, 22.4, and 27.3 days, respectively (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: After steroid therapy, an increase in complications was observed among patients with SFTS. Steroid therapy should be used with caution, considering the possible negative effects of steroid therapy within 5 days of symptom onset or in patients with mild disease (APACHE II score <14).","output":"Effects of steroid therapy in patients with severe fever with Thrombocytopenia syndrome: A multicenter clinical cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Editorial Comment discusses the following AJR article: Imaging Findings in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with COVID-19.","output":"Editorial Comment on \\"Imaging Findings in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with COVID-19\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental learning in the 21st century requires a high level of thinking ability, especially to solve environmental problems when COVID-19 pandemic This was to develop a new level of thinking, namely Higher Order Thinking Skills of Environmental Problem (HOTSEP) which is a revision of Anderson's Taxonomy The purpose of this study was to measure students HOTSEP in the context of environmental problems related to COVID-19 The research method used in this research was descriptive The sample used 277 university students from several cities in Indonesia The instrument used HOTSEP which has 3 categories of thinking level start from develop innovation about environment (C6), solve environmental problem (C5), criticize environmental problem (C4) The results showed that students HOTSEP were still in the very low category (33 64) This study concludes that the HOTSEP of students was still low and needs to be improved to the understanding of COVID-19 concept in environmental learning Suggestion for further research was HOTSEP need to implement in school or university for several environmental learning topics in many subjects/courses start from Natural Science, Social Science, Engineering, and others relevant subject HOTSEP can be measured not only in school or university, HOTSEP can be implement in community and public ? 2020 The Author(s) Open Access - This article is under the CC BY license (https://creativecommons org/licenses/by/4 0/)","output":"HOTSEP: Revised Anderson's taxonomy in environmental learning of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific information on the impact of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on the health of pregnant women, fetuses and newborns is considered of limited confidence, lacking good-quality evidence, and drawing biased conclusions.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all successive COVID-19 patients, hospitalized in four ICUs, with secondary deterioration and one or more respiratory samples sent to the mycology department. We used a strengthened IPA testing strategy including seven mycological criteria. Patients were classified as probable IPA according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (MSGERC) classification if immunocompromised, and according to the recent COVID-19-associated IPA classification otherwise. RESULTS: Probable IPA was diagnosed in 21 out of the 366 COVID-19 patients (5.7%) admitted to the ICU and in the 108 patients (19.4%) who underwent respiratory sampling for deterioration. No significant differences were observed between patients with and without IPA regarding age, gender, medical history and severity on admission and during hospitalization. Treatment with azithromycin for &gt;=3 days was associated with the diagnosis of probable IPA (odds ratio 3.1, 95% confidence interval 1.1-8.5, p = 0.02).

Accurate detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of efforts to treat individual patients and to contain spread of the virus in the community. The purpose of this review is to describe current diagnostic modalities for SARS-CoV-2 and outline their use. Special considerations for pediatric age groups are included. RECENT FINDINGS RNA PCR from the upper respiratory tract remains the gold standard for detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Antigen testing is being widely deployed as a faster and more convenient alternative to PCR, but is less sensitive and should only be used for diagnosis early after symptom onset. Serologic assays can document prior infection and are helpful in diagnosing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Serologic testing should not be used to diagnose acute or active infection. Immune assays are likely to provide a useful measure of protection against COVID19 in the future as knowledge of protective responses improves.

Tests used at home were the 6-minute walk test (6MWT, two studies), sit-to-stand tests (STS, five studies), Timed Up and Go (TUG, 4 studies) and step tests (two studies). Exercise tests administered remotely were the 6MWT (two studies) and step test (one study). Compared to centre-based testing the 6MWT distance was similar when performed outdoors but shorter when performed at home (two studies). The STS, TUG and step tests were feasible, reliable (intra-class correlation coefficients >0.80), valid (concurrent and known groups validity) and moderately responsive to pulmonary rehabilitation (medium effect sizes). These tests elicited less desaturation than the 6MWT, and validated methods to prescribe exercise were not reported. DISCUSSION: The STS, step and TUG tests can be performed at home, but do not accurately document desaturation with walking or allow exercise prescription. Patients at risk of desaturation should be prioritised for centre-based exercise testing when this is available.","output":"Home-based or remote exercise testing in chronic respiratory disease, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: A rapid review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La protinurie et linsuffisance rnale aigu? sont frquentes au cours du COVID-19, et associes  la morbi-mortalit, mais la pathognicit directe du SARS-CoV-2 sur le rein reste dbattue.

PCV2 replication could be promoted by low doses of ochratoxin A (OTA) as in our previous study and selenium has been shown to attenuate PCV2 replication. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of selenomethionine (SeMet), the major component of organic selenium, on OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion and its potential mechanism. The present study demonstrates that OTA could promote PCV2 replication as measured by cap protein expression, viral titer, viral DNA copies and the number of infected cells. In addition, OTA could activate autophagy as indicated by up-regulated light chain 3 (LC3)-II and autophagy-related protein 5 expressions and autophagosome formation. Further, OTA could down-regulate p-AKT and p-mTOR expressions and OTA-induced autophagy was inhibited when insulin was applied. SeMet at 2, 4 and 6 M had significant inhibiting effects against OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion. Furthermore, SeMet could attenuate OTA-induced autophagy and up-regulate OTA-induced p-AKT and p-mTOR expression inhibition. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of AKT/mTOR, could reverse the effects of SeMet on OTA-induced autophagy and the PCV2 replication promotion. In conclusion, SeMet could block OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion by inhibiting autophagy by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway. Therefore, SeMet supplementation could be an effective prophylactic strategy against PCV2 infections and autophagy may be a potential marker to develop novel anti-PCV2 drugs.","output":"SeMet attenuates OTA-induced PCV2 replication promotion by inhibiting autophagy by activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Drug delivery is crucial for therapeutic efficacy and gap junction communication channels (GJIC) facilitate movement within the tumour.

METHODS: Cell lines (NT8E, and HeLa) were pre-treated with Valproic Acid (VPA) (1 mM), 4 Phenyl Butyrate (4PB) (2 mM), ATRA (10 M) and Dexamethasone (1 M). Protein quantitated with the Bicinchoninic (BCA) assay for cell lysates, membrane and soluble fractions was assessed with Western blotting for Connexins (43, 26 and 32) and E-Cadherin. A qRT-PCR was done for CX 43-GJA1, CX 26-GJB2, CX 32-GJB1 and E-Cadherin, and normalized with Glyceraldehyde Phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Further, localization of Connexins (CX) and E-Cadherin, GJIC competence, pre-clinical in-vitro studies and the mechanism of cell death were evaluated. RESULTS: There was no toxicity or change in growth patterns observed with the drugs. In both the cell lines CX 43 localized to the membrane whereas CX 32 and CX 26 were present but not membrane bound. E-Cadherin was present on the membrane in NT8E and completely absent in HeLa cells.

Here, we modeled stability of SARS-CoV-2 on skin, paper currency, and clothing to determine if these surfaces may factor in the fomite transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Skin, currency, and clothing samples were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 under laboratory conditions and incubated at three different temperatures (4 deg C + or - 2 degC, 22 deg C + or - 2 deg C, and 37 deg C + or - 2 deg C).

Virus remained stable on skin for at least 96 h at 22 deg C and for at least 8h at 37 deg C. There were minimal differences between the tested currency samples. The virus remained stable on the $1 U.S.A. Bank Note for at least 96 h at 4 deg C while we did not detect viable virus on the $20 U.S.A. Bank Note samples beyond 72 h.

To continue longitudinal sleep research in this population we sought to test the feasibility of remotely conducting at-home sleep and memory research and to compare two ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) devices for ongoing home sleep testing. METHODS: 20 older (age=65.65.5 years) cognitively normal adults (65% female) who had previously undergone 2 nights in-lab sleep, memory and vigilance testing were delivered equipment for 2 nights at-home, technician-guided remote PSG set-up (1 night each for Somt [EEG: Fp1-M2, Cz-M1] and Sleep Profiler (SP) [EEG: Fp1-Fp2] devices- randomized presentation), and 6 timed trials on a 3D spatial maze navigation memory plus morning psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT). The night-to-night differences for devices and in-lab versus at-home testing environments were compared for sleep macro and EEG microarchitecture using paired Wilcoxon rank sum and t-tests where appropriate. First-night maze completion time (CT) and PVT reaction time and lapses were also compared. RESULTS: 19 people completed 2 nights at-home PSG, 18 completed PVT and 9 completed all 6 maze trials. Quality frontal EEG signals were obtained for 16 SP and 11 Somt recordings. There was no significant night to night differences (night 1Cnight 2) between in-lab and at-home environments for total sleep time (mean difference: in-lab= -0.27 vs at-home = 0.35 hours), wake after sleep onset (WASO) (median difference: in-lab= 3.0 vs at-home = 0.7 %WASO), or slow wave sleep (SWS) (mean difference: in-lab= -0.70 vs at-home = 2.3 %SWS). Relative frontal slow wave activity and spindle density were not significantly different between devices or environments. K-complex density (SP= 1.0 vs Somt =2.7/minNREM2, p=0.004) was significantly reduced with the SP device compared to Somt devices. There were no significant differences for maze CT and PVT measures between in-lab and at-home environments. CONCLUSION: The night-to-night differences in sleep macroarchitecture do not appear to be influenced by environment or device however measures of EEG microstructure such as K-complexes, which are amplitude-dependent, may be underestimated with the Sleep Profiler device due to smaller EEG amplitude from a derivation with short inter-electrode distances.

Here, we use ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and parallel RNA sequencing (RNASeq) to characterise the transcriptome and translatome of both species of PRRSV and analyse the host response to infection. We quantified viral gene expression over a timecourse of infection, and calculated the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) at both sites on the viral genome. At the nsp2 frameshift site (a rare example of protein-stimulated frameshifting), ?2 PRF efficiency increases over time, likely facilitated by accumulation of the PRF- stimulatory viral protein (nsp1) during infection. This marks arteriviruses as the second example of temporally regulated PRF. Surprisingly, we also found PRF efficiency at the canonical ORF1ab frameshift site increases over time, in apparent contradiction of the common assumption that RNA structure-directed frameshift sites operate at a fixed efficiency. This has potential implications for the numerous other viruses with canonical PRF sites. Furthermore, we discovered several highly translated additional viral ORFs, the translation of which may be facilitated by multiple novel viral transcripts. For example, we found a 125-codon ORF overlapping nsp12, which is expressed as highly as nsp12 itself at late stages of replication, and is likely translated from novel subgenomic (sg) RNA transcripts that overlap the 3 end of ORF1b. Similar transcripts were discovered for both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV- 2, suggesting a potential conserved mechanism for temporal regulation of expression of the 3-proximal region of ORF1b. In addition, we identified a highly translated, short upstream ORF (uORF) in the 5 UTR, the presence of which is highly conserved amongst PRRSV-2 isolates. This is the first application of RiboSeq to arterivirus-infected cells, and reveals new features which add to the complexity of gene expression programmes in this important family of nidoviruses.","output":"Ribosome profiling of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus reveals novel features of viral gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustainable smart city initiatives around the world have recently had great impact on the lives of citizens and brought significant changes to society.

All outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results: Among 600 randomized patients, 562 (93.7%) were included in the primary analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 62 [50-71] years; 237 [42.2%] women). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 126 patients (45.7%) in the intermediate-dose group and 126 patients (44.1%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (absolute risk difference, 1.5% [95% CI, -6.6% to 9.8%]; odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.76-1.48]; P = .70). Major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (2.5%) in the intermediate-dose group and 4 patients (1.4%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (risk difference, 1.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -&#8734; to 3.4%]; odds ratio, 1.83 [1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.00-5.93]), not meeting the noninferiority criteria (P for noninferiority >.99). Severe thrombocytopenia occurred only in patients assigned to the intermediate-dose group (6 vs 0 patients; risk difference, 2.2% [95% CI, 0.4%-3.8%]; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, did not result in a significant difference in the primary outcome of a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days. These results do not support the routine empirical use of intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in unselected patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19.

Only a few thousand viruses have been isolated, sequenced, and assigned a taxonomy, which limits the ability to identify and quantify viruses in the microbiome. Additionally, the vast diversity of viruses represents a challenge for classification, not only in constructing a viral taxonomy, but also in identifying similarities between a virus genotype and its phenotype. However, the diversity of viral sequences can be leveraged to classify their sequences in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples, even if they do not have a taxonomy. To identify and quantify viruses in transcriptomic and genomic samples, we developed a dynamic programming algorithm for creating a classification tree out of 715,672 metagenome viruses. To create the classification tree, we clustered proportional similarity scores generated from the k-mer profiles of each of the metagenome viruses to create a database of metagenomic viruses. The resulting Kraken2 database of the metagenomic viruses can be found here: https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1615774 and is compatible with Kraken2. We then integrated the viral classification database with databases created with genomes from NCBI for use with ParaKraken (a parallelized version of Kraken provided in Supplemental Zip 1), a metagenomic/transcriptomic classifier. To illustrate the breadth of our utility for classifying metagenome viruses, we analyzed data from a plant metagenome study identifying genotypic and compartment specific differences between two Populus genotypes in three different compartments. We also identified a significant increase in abundance of eight viral sequences in post mortem brains in a human metatranscriptome study comparing Autism Spectrum Disorder patients and controls. We also show the potential accuracy for classifying viruses by utilizing both the JGI and NCBI viral databases to identify the uniqueness of viral sequences. Finally, we validate the accuracy of viral classification with NCBI databases containing viruses with taxonomy to identify pathogenic viruses in known COVID-19 and cassava brown streak virus infection samples. Our method represents the compulsory first step in better understanding the role of viruses in the microbiome by allowing for a more complete identification of sequences without taxonomy. Better classification of viruses will improve identifying associations between viruses and their hosts as well as viruses and other microbiome members. Despite the lack of taxonomy, this database of metagenomic viruses can be used with any tool that utilizes a taxonomy, such as Kraken, for accurate classification of viruses.","output":"A k-mer based approach for classifying viruses without taxonomy identifies viral associations in human autism and plant microbiomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Troponin elevation is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but underlying aetiologies are ill-defined. We used multi-parametric cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to assess myocardial injury in recovered COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight patients (64  12 years, 70% male) with severe COVID-19 infection [all requiring hospital admission, 48 (32%) requiring ventilatory support] and troponin elevation discharged from six hospitals underwent convalescent CMR (including adenosine stress perfusion if indicated) at median 68 days. Left ventricular (LV) function was normal in 89% (ejection fraction 67%  11%). Late gadolinium enhancement and/or ischaemia was found in 54% (80/148). This comprised myocarditis-like scar in 26% (39/148), infarction and/or ischaemia in 22% (32/148) and dual pathology in 6% (9/148). Myocarditis-like injury was limited to three or less myocardial segments in 88% (35/40) of cases with no associated LV dysfunction; of these, 30% had active myocarditis. Myocardial infarction was found in 19% (28/148) and inducible ischaemia in 26% (20/76) of those undergoing stress perfusion (including 7 with both infarction and ischaemia). Of patients with ischaemic injury pattern, 66% (27/41) had no past history of coronary disease. There was no evidence of diffuse fibrosis or oedema in the remote myocardium (T1: COVID-19 patients 1033  41 ms vs. matched controls 1028  35 ms; T2: COVID-19 46  3 ms vs. matched controls 47  3 ms). CONCLUSIONS: During convalescence after severe COVID-19 infection with troponin elevation, myocarditis-like injury can be encountered, with limited extent and minimal functional consequence. In a proportion of patients, there is evidence of possible ongoing localized inflammation. A quarter of patients had ischaemic heart disease, of which two-thirds had no previous history. Whether these observed findings represent pre-existing clinically silent disease or de novo COVID-19-related changes remain undetermined.

The establishment of a rapid detection method applicable in field conditions will be conducive to early detection of pathogen and implementation of relevant treatment. A novel nucleic acid amplification method, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), has been widely used for infectious disease diagnosis. RESULTS: In the present study, a reverse transcription (RT)-RPA assay combined with lateral flow dipstrip (LFD) was established for the visual detection of PEDV by targeting the N gene. The RT-RPA-LFD assay detected as low as 10(2) copies/L of PEDV genomic RNA standard. Moreover, the novel RT-RPA-LFD assay did not show cross-reactivity with common swine pathogens, demonstrating high specificity. The performance of the assay for detection of clinical samples was also evaluated. A total number of 86 clinical samples were tested by RT-RPA-LFD and RT-PCR. The detection results of RT-RPA-LFD were compared with those of RT-PCR, with a coincidence rate of 96.5%.

This review aims to describe whether mutations and thus decreased susceptibility to disinfectants occur in bacteria during disinfectant exposure. A systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted with the databases PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science. For the final analysis, 28 sources that remained of interest were included.

While penicillin remains the only appropriate treatment for maternal syphilis, we hypothesized that low non-treponemal titers (<1:16) may lead to reduced penicillin treatment in Brazil. METHODS: Using Brazilian Ministry of Health data on women diagnosed with maternal syphilis between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, we conducted a random-effects logistic regression model with a cluster correction at the state level to evaluate predictive factors of penicillin treatment. RESULTS: We observed yearly increases in cases of pregnant women with syphilis from 2010 to 2018. There was significant variation by state: 52,451 cases were reported in S?o Paulo, followed by 26,838 in Rio de Janeiro. Among 215,937 cases of maternal syphilis, 913% received penicillin. In the random-effects model, a non-treponemal titer &#8805;1:16 was associated with 144 higher odds of receiving penicillin (95% confidence interval [CI]: 139148), and prenatal care was associated with a 212 increased odds of receiving penicillin (95% CI: 202221). Although there is an association between the absence of prenatal care and inadequate treatment for syphilis, 832% of women in this cohort who did not receive penicillin were engaged in prenatal care. CONCLUSIONS: Providers may inappropriately exclude low non-treponemal titers and thereby fail to use penicillin treatment in maternal syphilis. While the cause of the maternal syphilis epidemic in Brazil is multifactorial, we believe our findings can be used to develop targeted interventions throughout Brazil as well as shape public health initiatives globally.","output":"Failure to recognize Low non-treponemal titer syphilis infections in pregnancy May lead to widespread under-treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The EU adopted a new enlargement strategy for the Western Balkans countries in 2018, provided a time frame for Serbia and Montenegro potentially to join the Union by 2025, and outlined the next steps for accession for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and North Macedonia.

Early diagnosis through non-invasive biomarkers may render GBM more easily treatable, improving the prognosis of this currently incurable disease.

EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography from sera of 23 GBM and 5 grade 3 glioma (GIII) patients, and 10 unaffected controls (UC). The expression of two candidate circRNAs (circSMARCA5 and circHIPK3) was assayed by droplet digital PCR. CircSMARCA5 and circHIPK3 were significantly less abundant in sEVs from GBM patients with respect to UC (fold-change (FC) of ?2.15 and ?1.92, respectively) and GIII (FC of ?1.75 and ?1.4, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, based on the expression of sEV-derived circSMARCA5 and circHIPK3, allowed us to distinguish GBM from UC (area under the curve (AUC) 0.823 (0.667C0.979) and 0.855 (0.704 to 1.000), with a 95% confidence interval (CI), respectively).

Method and materials A prospective, observational study has been conducted in a health care institute in western Rajasthan from January 2019 to July 2020. This study included 64 patients who had major upper or lower limb amputations. We analyzed the sociodemographic factors of the patients, the type of procedure, postoperative hospital stay, complications, and follow-up status with both the SF-12 and the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-BREF questionnaires. Mean, median, range, standard deviation, percentages, univariable, and multivariable logistic regression were analyzed with SPSS version 23.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results The mean age of the study patients was 53.6 years (SD 2.6) and they were mostly male (71.9%). Atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease (PVD) was the most common indication (37.5%) of amputation, and below-the-knee amputation (46.88%) was the most commonly performed procedure.

METHODS: Preliminary cross-sectional data were analysed from a cohort study (n=4378). Clinical and non-clinical staff of three London-based NHS Trusts, including acute and mental health Trusts, took part in an online baseline survey. The primary outcome measure used is the presence of probable common mental disorders (CMDs), measured by the General Health Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are probable anxiety (seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder), depression (nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (six-item Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder checklist), suicidal ideation (Clinical Interview Schedule) and alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test). Moral injury is measured using the Moray Injury Event Scale. RESULTS: Analyses showed substantial levels of probable CMDs (58.9%, 95% CI 58.1 to 60.8) and of PTSD (30.2%, 95% CI 28.1 to 32.5) with lower levels of depression (27.3%, 95% CI 25.3 to 29.4), anxiety (23.2%, 95% CI 21.3 to 25.3) and alcohol misuse (10.5%, 95% CI 9.2 to 11.9).

Data on the containment effectiveness of equipment and laboratories are scarce and fragmented. Laboratory-acquired infections (LAIs) are therefore important for evaluating the effectiveness of biosafety. For the majority of LAIs there appears to be no direct cause, suggesting that failures of biosafety were not noticed or that containment may have been insufficient.

Objectives To determine the prevalence of medical and medication-related problems reported by people with chronic diseases during the pandemic. Secondary objective was to identify the barriers and contributing factors related to these medical and medication-related problems. Methods The anonymous and voluntary, web-based survey was filled out by interested adult respondents with chronic disease(s) across Michigan between 9/1/2020 and 1/1/2021. Primary outcome included self-reported medical- and medication-related problems during the pandemic. Secondary outcomes included potential risk factors for medical- and medication-related problems. Descriptive statistics was used to describe respondents demographics, chronic disease(s) characteristics, medication adherence, medical- and medication-related problems, and COVID-19Crelated factors. The multivariable Firth logistic regression was used to analyze correlations between potential risk factors associated with medical- and medication-related problems. Results 1,103 respondents completed the survey and were included in the analysis. Approximately, 51% of respondents reported an medication-related problem with 19.6% reported problems obtaining medication(s) and 31.7% reported forgetting/not taking their medication(s). The top reason for problems obtaining medication(s) was doctors office being closed for in-person visit(s). Additionally, of all responses, more than half reported worsening symptoms of their chronic disease(s) during the pandemic especially with psychiatric disorders (79.5%) and inflammatory bowel disease (60%). Respondents with significantly higher risk of medication-related problems included being younger, being female, and having psychiatric disorder(s), diabetes or arthritis/lupus and of medical-related problems included having multiple chronic diseases, psychiatric disorder(s) and heart failure.

However, a review of literature reveals no blueprint to guide this systematically in practice. This Statement of Intent proposes how diverse trials may be integrated within or alongside Generation Victoria (GenV), a whole-of-state Australian birth cohort in planning, and delineates potential processes and opportunities. METHODS: Parents of all newborns (estimated 160,000) in the state of Victoria, Australia, will be approached for two full years from 2021. The cohort design comprises four elements: (1) consent soon after birth to follow the child and parent/s until study end or withdrawal; retrospective and prospective (2) linkage to clinical and administrative datasets and (3) banking of universal and clinical biosamples; and (4) GenV-collected biosamples and data. GenV-collected data will focus on overarching outcome and phenotypic measures using low-burden, universal-capable electronic interfaces, with funding-dependent face-to-face assessments tailored to universal settings during the early childhood, school and/or adult years. RESULTS: For population or registry-type trials within GenV, GenV will provide all outcomes data and consent via traditional, waiver, or Trials Within Cohorts models. Trials alongside GenV consent their own participants born within the GenV window; GenV may help identify potential participants via opt-in or opt-out expression of interest. Data sharing enriches trials with outcomes, prior data, and/or access to linked data contingent on custodians agreements, and supports modeling of causal effects to the population and between-trials comparisons of costs, benefits and utility.

According to the regression analysis of 367 questionnaires from heavily polluting enterprises, it can be seen that managers green environmental awareness is positively correlated with green product technological innovation and design innovation strategies. Managers meta-cognitive strategic intelligence does not have a moderating effect on the relationship between green environmental awareness and green product technological innovation strategy, but has a significant positive moderating effect on the green product design innovation strategy. Managers motivational strategic intelligence has a positive influence on the relationship between green environmental awareness and green product technology and design innovation strategy. In addition, the implementation of green product innovation strategies directly promotes the improvement of marketing performance. The above conclusions can provide inspiration or companies during the new opportunity period to transform managers' environmental awareness and strategic intelligence into corporate performance by using green product innovation strategies.","output":"Research on the impact of managers green environmental awareness and strategic intelligence on corporate green product innovation strategic performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Host response biomarkers offer a promising alternative diagnostic solution for identifying acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases involving influenza infection. However, most of the published panels involve multiple genes, which is problematic in clinical settings because polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technology is the most widely used genomic technology in these settings, and it can only be used to measure a small number of targets. This study aimed to identify a single-gene biomarker with a high diagnostic accuracy by using integrated bioinformatics analysis with XGBoost. The gene expression profiles in dataset GSE68310 were used to construct a co-expression network using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Fourteen hub genes related to influenza infection (blue module) that were common to both the co-expression network and the proteinCprotein interaction network were identified. Thereafter, a single hub gene was selected using XGBoost, with feature selection conducted using recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV). The identified biomarker was oligoadenylate synthetases-like (OASL). The robustness of this biomarker was further examined using three external datasets. OASL expression profiling triggered by various infections was different enough to discriminate between influenza and non-influenza ARI infections. Thus, this study presented a workflow to identify a single-gene classifier across multiple datasets. Moreover, OASL was revealed as a biomarker that could identify influenza patients from among those with flu-like ARI. OASL has great potential for improving influenza diagnosis accuracy in ARI patients in the clinical setting.","output":"OASL as a Diagnostic Marker for Influenza Infection Revealed by Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis With XGBoost"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, several people have been hanging out or sharing rental house with others.

The aim of this study was to describe RSV subtype circulation patterns and associated disease severity to inform on potential impact of an RSV-specific prevention strategy. METHODS Single-centre retrospective observational study of children aged <16 years with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection from 2014 to 2018 inclusive. We described the features and frequency of all RSV subtype detections. We selected a random sample of RSV-A and RSV-B cases from each year (n = 200), described demographic and clinical features of these cases, and compared indicators of disease severity between subtypes. RESULTS We identified 3591 RSV detections over a 5-year period and found consistent co-circulation of subtypes with alternating predominance. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between children presenting with RSV-A and RSV-B infections. There was no difference in indicators of severity between the subtypes except for paediatric intensive care unit length of stay which was longer in the RSV-B group (3 vs. 5 days, P = 0.006). Respiratory co-infections were more frequent in the RSV-B group (41.8% vs. 27.4%, P = 0.035). When these were excluded there was no longer a detectable difference in paediatric intensive care unit length of stay. CONCLUSIONS We found co-circulation of RSV subtypes and no convincing evidence of a difference in disease severity between subtypes. RSV-specific interventions will need to be equally effective against both RSV-A and RSV-B to have the greatest impact on reducing severe RSV disease in this population.","output":"Respiratory syncytial virus subtype circulation and associated disease severity at an Australian paediatric referral hospital, 2014-2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Endothelial-specific molecule 1 (endocan) has emerged as an inflammatory biomarker in recent years. The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of serum endocan levels in the prediction of COVID-19 disease among patients with a false-negative reverse transcription polymerase change reaction (RT-PCR) test, and also to determine its correlation with the clinical severity of the disease. METHODS: Thirty patients with positive RT-PCR results and 30 with false-negative RT-PCR results, both with suspected COVID-19 in terms of clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings, were included in the study. Thirty healthy controls were also enrolled. RESULTS: Serum endocan levels were estimated to be 821.8  99.3 pg/mL in COVID-19 RT-PCR (+) patients, 803.9  97.0 pg/mL in RT-PCR false (C) patients with suspected COVID-19, and 382.9  37.5 pg/mL in the control group. No significant difference was observed between RT-PCR (+) and RT-PCR false (C) patients (P = 0.68). However, serum endocan levels differed significantly between patient groups and control group (P < 0.05). With a cut-off value of 444.2 pg/mL serum endocan levels differentiated COVID-19 cases from healthy individuals with 92% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed between serum endocan levels and clinical severity (P < 0.01, r = 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for different laboratory markers capable of assisting diagnosis and showing COVID-19 infection in suspected COVID-19 RT-PCR false-negative patients.

With social distancing, telemedicine may become the preferred communication channel between caregivers and patients. Implications for cerebral palsy (CP) children are that this will pose a challenge within this transformation. CP, as a discreet entity, is not considered a risk factor. However, specific comorbidities in individuals with CP, such as chronic lung disease, are known as COVID-19 risk factors. The overall risk for the CP population is probably a factor of age and comorbidities. Staying at home for CP children is both a challenge and an opportunity. Escalation of behavioral conflicts or improved participation and equality within the household may emerge. Interestingly, restricted mobility for the general population narrows existing gaps of ambulation. Telemedicine is the primary way of providing services for chronic conditions during the pandemic and is expected to expand beyond pre-Coronavirus era use. The advantages of telemedicine vary, more so during pandemic times, according to severity, restrictions, and availably of telemedicine. A multidisciplinary therapeutic presence is more accessible with telemedicine, bringing together various specialties and approaches to the child's natural environment. Accessible, continuous care is expected to lower comorbidities, as demonstrated for other chronic conditions.

Currently, a number of vaccines have been approved for use and vaccination campaigns have already started in several countries. This paper designs a mathematical model considering the impact of vaccination to study the spread dynamics of COVID-19. Some basic properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproductive number [Formula: see text] of the model is obtained, and the conditions for the existence of endemic equilibria are provided. There exist two endemic equilibria when [Formula: see text] under certain conditions, which will lead to backward bifurcation. The stability of equilibria are analyzed, and the condition for the backward bifurcation is given. Due to the existence of backward bifurcation, even if [Formula: see text] , COVID-19 may remain prevalent. Sensitivity analysis and simulations show that improving vaccine efficacy can control the spread of COVID-19 faster, while increasing the vaccination rate can reduce and postpone the peak of infection to a greater extent. However, in reality, the improvement of vaccine efficacy cannot be realized in a short time, and relying only on increasing the vaccination rate cannot quickly achieve the control of COVID-19. Therefore, relying only on vaccination may not completely and quickly control COVID-19. Some non-pharmaceutical interventions should continue to be enforced to combat the virus. According to the sensitivity analysis, we improve the model by including some non-pharmaceutical interventions. Combining the sensitivity analysis with the simulation of the improved model, we conclude that together with vaccination, reducing the contact rate of people and increasing the isolation rate of infected individuals will greatly reduce the number of infections and shorten the time of COVID-19 spread.

This paper compares telehealth responses to (COrona VIrus Disease 2019) COVID-19 across ten countries to identify lessons learned about the complexity of telehealth during critical response such as in response to a global pandemic. Our overall objective is to develop a health systems-based framework for telehealth implementation to support critical response. METHODS: We sought responses from the members of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Telehealth Working Group (WG) on their practices and perception of telehealth practices during the times of COVID-19 pandemic in their respective countries. We then analysed their responses to identify six emerging themes that we mapped to the World Health Organization (WHO) model of health systems. RESULTS: Our analysis identified six emergent themes. (1) Government, legal or regulatory aspects of telehealth; (2) Increase in telehealth capacity and delivery; (3) Regulated and unregulated telehealth; (4) Changes in the uptake and perception of telemedicine; (5) Public engagement in telehealth responses to COVID-19; and (6) Implications for training and education. We discuss these themes and then use them to develop a systems framework for telehealth support in critical response. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has introduced new challenges for telehealth support in times of critical response. Our themes and systems framework extend the WHO systems model and highlight that telemedicine usage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and multidimensional.

Here we evaluated, by targeted disruption of the APN gene, whether APN participates in blood vessel formation and function under normal conditions. Surprisingly, APN-null mice developed with no gross or histological abnormalities. Standard neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, locomotor, and hematological studies revealed no alterations. Nonetheless, in oxygen-induced retinopathy experiments, APN-deficient mice had a marked and dose-dependent deficiency of the expected retinal neovascularization. Moreover, gelfoams embedded with growth factors failed to induce functional blood vessel formation in APN-null mice. These findings establish that APN-null mice develop normally without physiological alterations and can undergo physiological angiogenesis but show a severely impaired angiogenic response under pathological conditions.

Although these viral factors are not homologous and use distinct mechanisms to target mRNA, many of them display striking parallels in their strategies for executing RNA degradation and invoke key features of cellular RNA quality control pathways. In some cases, there is a lack of selectivity for degradation of host versus viral mRNA, indicating that the purposes of virus-induced mRNA degradation extend beyond redirecting cellular resources towards viral gene expression. In addition, several antiviral pathways use RNA degradation as a viral restriction mechanism, and we will summarize new findings related to how these host-encoded ribonucleases target and destroy viral RNA.","output":"Emerging roles for RNA degradation in viral replication and antiviral defense"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiological studies have yielded conflicting results regarding climate and incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, and seasonality of infection rates is debated.

The exposure of interest was average temperature and other weather conditions, measured at 25 days prior and 25 days after the first reported COVID-19 death was collected in the OECD countries and US states. The outcome of interest was cumulative COVID-19 mortality, assessed for each region at 25, 30, 35, and 40 days after the first reported death. Analyses were performed with negative binomial regression and adjusted for other weather conditions, particulate matter, sociodemographic factors, smoking, obesity, ICU beds, and social distancing.

Bladed Bangiales were identified and quantified across four intertidal elevations and four seasons for one year, at five rocky intertidal sites (between 39 S and 43 S) in southern Chile. Species determination was based on partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene amplification. To assess species gross morphology, thallus shape, color, and maximum length and width were recorded. Hundreds of organisms were classified into nine Bangiales species belonging to three genera (i.e., Fuscifolium, Porphyra, and Pyropia), including five frequent (>97% of specimens) and four infrequent species. All species, except for Pyropia saldanhae, had been previously reported along the coasts of Chile. The thallus shape and color were very variable, and a large overlap of the maximum width and length supported the cryptic status of these species. Multivariate analyses showed that the main variable affecting species composition was intertidal elevation. Species such as Py. orbicularis were more abundant in low and mid intertidal zones, while others, such as Po. mumfordii and Po. sp. FIH, were principally observed in high and spray elevations. Despite all numerically dominant species being present all year long, a slight effect of seasonal variation on species composition was also detected.

Such animal models may help us gain better understanding of the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and will be effective tools for the evaluation and licensure of therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. This review provides a summary of the attempts made till to develop a suitable animal model to understand pathophysiology and effectiveness of therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"An overview of preclinical animal models for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction has been reported as characteristic symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study evaluated olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in mild COVID-19 patients using validated assessment methods. METHODS: A prospective surveillance study was conducted for mild COVID-19 patients who were isolated at the Gyeonggi International Living and Treatment Support Center (LTSC), Korea. Olfactory function was assessed using the Korean version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) and Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT). Gustatory function was assessed using an 11-point Likert scale and 6-n-propylthiouracil, phenylthiocarbamide, and control strips. All patients underwent nasal and oral cavity endoscopic examination. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients at the LTSC, 15 patients (24.2%) complained of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction on admission. Four of 10 patients who underwent functional evaluation did not have general symptoms and 2 were asymptomatic. The mean short version of QOD-negative statements and QOD-visual analogue scale scores were 13  6 and 4.7  3.6, respectively. The mean CC-SIT score was 8  2. No patients showed anatomical abnormalities associated with olfactory dysfunction on endoscopic examination. The mean Likert scale score for function was 8  2, and there were no abnormal lesions in the oral cavity of any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was 24.2% in mild COVID-19 patients. All patients had hyposmia due to sensorineural olfactory dysfunction, which was confirmed using validated olfactory and gustatory evaluation methods and endoscopic examination.

The impact of mobility of people across the countries or states in the spread of epidemics has been significant. The spread of disease due to factors local to the population under consideration is termed the endogenous spread. The spread due to external factors like migration, mobility, etc. is called the exogenous spread. In this paper, we introduce the Exo-SIR model, an extension of the popular SIR model and a few variants of the model. The novelty in our model is that it captures both the exogenous and endogenous spread of the virus. First, we present an analytical study. Second, we simulate the Exo-SIR model with and without assuming contact network for the population. Third, we implement the Exo-SIR model on real datasets regarding Covid-19 and Ebola. We found that endogenous infection is influenced by exogenous infection. Furthermore, we found that the Exo-SIR model predicts the peak time better than the SIR model. Hence, the Exo-SIR model would be helpful for governments to plan policy interventions at the time of a pandemic.","output":"Exo-SIR: An Epidemiological Model to Analyze the Impact of Exogenous Spread of Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses the development, content, implementation, and evaluation of an interprofessional ethics curriculum that has been integrated as a required component of learning in the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of British Columbia (UBC), along with 12 other health professional programs.

We aimed to assess the accuracy of endoluminal confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) and laparoscopic fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER), using near-infrared imaging and fluorescence from injected Indocyanine Green, to identify the transition from ischemic to vascular areas in a porcine model of mesenteric ischemia. METHODS Six pigs underwent 1-h sigmoid segmental ischemia. The ischemic area was evaluated by clinical assessment and FLER to determine presumed viable margins. For each sigmoid colon, 5 regions of interest (ROIs) were identified: ischemic (ROI 1), presumed viable margins ROI 2a (distal) and 2b (proximal), and vascular areas 3a (distal) and 3b (proximal). After injection of fluorescein, CLE scanning of the mucosa from the ischemic area toward viable margins was performed. Capillary blood samples were obtained by puncturing the serosa at the ROIs, and capillary lactates were measured with the EDGE(?) analyzer. RESULTS Capillary lactates were significantly higher at ROI 1 (4.91 mmol/L) when compared to resection margins (2.8 mmol/L; mean difference: 2.11; p < 0.05) identified by FLER. There was no significant difference in lactates between ROI1 and resection margins identified by clinical evaluation. In 50 % of cases, ROI 2aCLINIC-2bCLINIC were considered to match (<1 cm distance) with ROI 2aFLER-2bFLER. Confocal analysis revealed specific clues to identify the transition from ischemic to viable areas corresponding to those assessed by FLER in 11/12 cases versus 7/12 for those identified by clinical evaluation.

However, assessing the associations between these medication adherence trajectories and health-related outcomes remains challenging. The purpose of this review is to identify and systematically review the methods used to assess the association between medication adherence trajectories, estimated from the GBTM method, and health-related outcomes. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review according to the recommendations of the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions 6.2. Results will be reported following PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) recommendations. We will search in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. Two reviewers will independently select articles and extract data. Discrepancies at every step will be resolved through discussion, and consensus will be reached for all disagreed articles. A third reviewer will act as a referee if needed. We will produce tables to synthesize the modalities used to estimate medication adherence trajectories with GBTM. We will also synthesize the modalities used to assess the association between these medication adherence trajectories and health-related outcomes by identifying the types of health-related outcomes studied and how they are defined, the statistical models used, and how the medication adherence trajectories were used in these models, and the effect measure yield. We will also review the limitations and biases reported by the authors and their attempts to mitigate them. We will provide a narrative synthesis.

This pilot program, conducted at our company facilities, evaluated the suitability of diagnostic tools in our setting for program upscaling. METHODS: We used different marketed in vitro diagnostics (including tests for antibodies against spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and nucleocapsid [N] protein) combined with medical history, symptoms and likelihood of infection. We evaluated the testing strategy over four visits in 141 employees (known positive COVID-19 history, n = 20; unknown status, n = 121) between April and June 2020 at four company locations in Germany. Digital self-monitoring over the pilot program duration was also included. RESULTS: No incident infections were detected. Based on immune status, medical history and likelihood of infection, 10 participants (8.3%) with previously unknown history of COVID-19 were identified to have been infected before entering the program. These participants, who recalled no or mild symptoms in the preceding months, were primarily identified using an assay that detected both S1 and S2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G. The frequency of positive lateral flow assay (LFA) results (IgM or IgG directed against the N-protein) in this cohort was lower compared with participants with a known history of COVID-19 (0a??10.8% vs. 33.8a??75.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this pilot program suggest that LFA for antibodies may not always reliably detect current, recent or past infections; consequently, these have not been included in our upscaled occupational healthcare program. Regular testing strategies for viral RNA and antibodies directed against different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, combined with hygiene rules and a comprehensive baseline assessment, are recommended to ensure avoidance of infections at workplace as reliably as possible.","output":"Pilot study of an occupational healthcare program to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune status of employees in a large pharmaceutical company"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An unknown virus was isolated from a lung biopsy sample and multiple other samples from a patient who developed a lethal case of pneumonia following a peripheral blood stem cell transplant.

Vaccines can prevent infectious diseases, including against seasonal influenza, pneumococcal diseases, herpes zoster and COVID\\\\19. However, the uptake of vaccination among older adults varies across settings and groups. Communication with healthcare workers can play an important role in older people's decisions to vaccinate. To support an informed decision about vaccination, healthcare workers should be able to identify the older person's knowledge gaps, needs and concerns. They should also be able to share and discuss information about the person's disease risk and disease severity; the vaccine's effectiveness and safety; and practical information about how the person can access vaccines. Therefore, healthcare workers need good communication skills and to actively keep up\\\\to\\\\date with the latest evidence. An understanding of their perceptions and experiences of this communication can help us train and support healthcare workers and design good communication strategies. OBJECTIVES: To explore healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communicating with older adults about vaccination. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and Scopus on 21 March 2020. We also searched Epistemonikos for related reviews, searched grey literature sources, and carried out reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. We searched for studies in any language. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included qualitative studies and mixed\\\\methods studies with an identifiable qualitative component. We included studies that explored the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers and other health system staff towards communication with adults over the age of 50 years or their informal caregivers about vaccination. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this review. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of predefined criteria. We extracted and assessed data regarding study authors' motivations for carrying out their study. We used a thematic synthesis approach to analyse and synthesise the evidence. We used the GRADE\\\\CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each review finding to identify factors that may influence intervention implementation and we developed implications for practice. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 studies in our review. Most studies explored healthcare workers' views and experiences about vaccination of older adults more broadly but also mentioned communication issues specifically. All studies were from high\\\\income countries. The studies focused on doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others working in hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and nursing homes. These healthcare workers discussed different types of vaccines, including influenza, pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccines. The review was carried out before COVID\\\\19 vaccines were available. We downgraded our confidence in several of the findings from high confidence to moderate, low or very low confidence. One reason for this was that some findings were based on only small amounts of data. Another reason was that the findings were based on studies from only a few countries, making us unsure about the relevance of these findings to other settings. Healthcare workers reported that older adults asked about vaccination to different extents, ranging from not asking about vaccines at all, to great demand for information (high confidence finding). When the topic of vaccination was discussed, healthcare workers described a lack of information, and presence of misinformation, fears and concerns about vaccines among older adults (moderate confidence). The ways in which healthcare workers discussed vaccines with older adults appeared to be linked to what they saw as the aim of vaccination communication. Healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions of this aim and about their own roles and the roles of older adults in vaccine decisions. Some healthcare workers thought it was important to provide information but emphasised the right and responsibility of older adults to decide for themselves. Others used information to persuade and convince older adults to vaccinate in order to increase 'compliance' and 'improve' vaccination rates, and in some cases to gain financial benefits. Other healthcare workers tailored their approach to what they believed the older adult needed or wanted (moderate confidence). Healthcare workers believed that older adults' decisions could be influenced by several factors, including the nature of the healthcare workerCpatient relationship, the healthcare worker's status, and the extent to which healthcare workers led by example (low confidence). Our review also identified factors that are likely to influence how communication between healthcare workers and older adults take place. These included issues tied to healthcare workers' views and experiences regarding the diseases in question and the vaccines; as well as their views and experiences of the organisational and practical implementation of vaccine services. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is little research focusing specifically on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communication with older adults about vaccination. The studies we identified suggest that healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions about the aim of this communication and about the role of older adults in vaccine decisions. Based on these findings and the other findings in our review, we have developed a set of questions or prompts that may help health system planners or programme managers when planning or implementing strategies for vaccination communication between healthcare workers and older adults.","output":"Healthcare workers perceptions and experiences of communicating with people over 50 years of age about vaccination: a qualitative evidence synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With funding from the AHRQ Effective Health Care Program, the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center produced two reports on telehealth: (1) in 2016 an evidence mapon the impact of telehealth on patient outcomes7 and (2) in 2019 a systematic review of the evidence about telehealth for acute- and chronic-care consultations (8) In this commentary, we summarize evidence on selected topics from these reports that may be relevant in the context of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"The Evidence Base for Telehealth: Reassurance in the Face of Rapid Expansion During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background SARS-CoV2 infection in patients with comorbidities, particularly T2DM, has been a major challenge globally and has been shown to be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Here, we did whole blood immunophenotyping along with plasma cytokine, chemokine, antibody isotyping, and viral load from oropharyngeal swab to understand the immune pathology in the T2DM patients infected with SARS-CoV2. Methods Blood samples from 25 Covid-19 positive patients having T2DM, 10 Covid-19 positive patients not having T2DM, and 10 Covid-19 negative, non-diabetic healthy controls were assessed for various immune cells by analyzing for their signature surface proteins in mass cytometry. Circulating cytokines, chemokines, and antibody isotypes were determined from plasma while viral copy number was determined from oropharyngeal swabs. All our representative data corroborated with laboratory findings. Results Our observations encompass T2DM patients having elevated levels of both type I and type II cytokines and higher levels of circulating IgA, IgM, IgG1, and IgG2 as compared to NDM and healthy volunteers. They also displayed higher percentages of granulocytes, mDCs, plasmablasts, Th2-like cells, CD4+ EM cells, and CD8+ TE cells as compared to healthy volunteers.

Methods: Cross-sectional assessments using standardized World Health Organizations IPC checklists. IPC performance scores were graded as inadequate = 0C25%, basic = 25.1C50%, intermediate = 50.1C75%, and advanced = 75.1C100%. Results: Overall performance improved from basic to intermediate at the national IPC unit (41% in 2019 to 58% in 2021) and at regional hospitals (37% in 2019 to 54% in 2021) but remained basic at district hospitals (37% in 2019 to 50% in 2021). Priority gaps at the national IPC unit included lack of: a dedicated IPC budget, monitoring the effectiveness of IPC trainings and health care-associated infection surveillance. Gaps at hospitals included no assessment of hospital staffing needs, inadequate infrastructure for IPC and lack of a well-defined monitoring plan with clear goals, targets and activities.

Nevertheless, questions regarding its use remain poorly understood, such as the ideal dose to confer immunity against the disease, the need for a booster dose, the optimal immunisation schedule for immunocompetent, immunosuppressed, and pediatric populations, among other issues. This work aims to demonstrate that computational tools can be used to simulate different scenarios regarding YF vaccination and the immune response of individuals to this vaccine, thus assisting the response of some of these open questions. RESULTS: This work presents the computational results obtained by a mathematical model of the human immune response to vaccination against YF. Five scenarios were simulated: primovaccination in adults and children, booster dose in adult individuals, vaccination of individuals with autoimmune diseases under immunomodulatory therapy, and the immune response to different vaccine doses. Where data were available, the model was able to quantitatively replicate the levels of antibodies obtained experimentally. In addition, for those scenarios where data were not available, it was possible to qualitatively reproduce the immune response behaviours described in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Our simulations show that the minimum dose to confer immunity against YF is half of the reference dose. The results also suggest that immunological immaturity in children limits the induction and persistence of long-lived plasma cells are related to the antibody decay observed experimentally. Finally, the decay observed in the antibody level after ten years suggests that a booster dose is necessary to keep immunity against YF.","output":"Validation of a yellow fever vaccine model using data from primary vaccination in children and adults, re-vaccination and dose-response in adults and studies with immunocompromised individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the reasons contributing to the physician shortage in the countrys medically underserved areas using the state of Delaware as a focus state.

METHODS: A fixed regimen of IVI was conceived to significantly reduce the number of visits while keeping a number of injections related to the best outcomes. We retrospectively collected data of surgeries performed in 2019 and in the first seven months of 2020 and from OCTs in the first semester of 2020. RESULTS: IVI per month, from January to July 2020, were 304, 291, 256, 204, 276, 297 and 322, respectively. Phacoemulsification surgeries in the same period were 397, 408, 171, 0, 304, 391 and 389.

METHODS: We use de-identified data from Danco Laboratories, the sole distributor of mifepristone during the study period, to examine trends in mifepristone distribution. We focus on customers who purchased < 100 doses a year and a subset of those who purchased < 10 doses for the periods of 2008C2011 and 2014C2017. We use data from the Guttmacher Institute Abortion Provider Census (APC) studies in 2008 and 2017 to examine the extent to which some facilities that purchased mifepristone may be missing from Guttmacher's APC. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2017, the number of medication abortions increased 73%, though the number of mifepristone purchasers only increased 15%. The number of low-volume mifepristone customers, or those who purchased < 100 tablets of mifepristone per year, decreased 8% over the study period, while the number purchasing < 10 tablets per year decreased 14%. However, in recent years low-volume customers were more likely to have purchased mifepristone in multiple years. In non-metropolitan areas, the number of sites purchasing mifepristone increased slightly but the amount of mifepristone that was purchased more than doubled between 2008 and 2017. CONCLUSIONS: While reliance on medication abortion increased substantially between 2008 and 2014, there is no evidence that this was due to an increase in the number of facilities that purchased low-volumes of mifepristone. IMPLICATIONS. While their numbers declined, abortion providers purchasing low volumes of mifepristone likely played an important role for the individuals they cared for. Access to abortion could increase if a wider network of healthcare practitioners, especially those in settings that do not currently provide abortions, were able to offer medication abortion.","output":"Trends in medication abortion and the role of low-volume and non-metropolitan mifepristone purchasers: 2008C2011 and 2014C2017()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reports on trends in organized violence, building on new data by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP).

Moreover, the call for a global ceasefire following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic failed to produce any results. In fact, the number of active state-based and non-state conflicts, as well as the number of actors carrying out one-sided violence against civilians, increased when compared to 2019. UCDP noted a record-high number of 56 state-based conflicts in 2020, including eight wars. Most of the conflicts occurred in Africa, as the region registered 30 state-based conflicts, including nine new or restarted ones.

This is likely to be adopted in some form going forward. This study prospectively evaluated the effectiveness&safety of VC undertaken at a UK tertiary paediatric surgical centre during the pandemic. Method: Data on paediatric surgery/urology outpatient video/telephone consultations between May-June 2020 was prospectively collected. VC episodes were given outcomes (1,2or3) depending how well surgeons were able to make definitive diagnoses/plans. 6months later, findings at later face-to-face visit were retrospectively compared with earlier VC to assess accuracy of decision-making using VC. Telephone survey of patient experience was done. Results: 186VC were evaluated. 95 (51%) were paediatric general surgical patients and 91 (49%) urology. 118 (63%) were follow-ups and 68 (37%) new. In 70% of cases, clinicians were able to make definitive diagnosis/ plan using VC (outcome1) while 26% could be delayed till face-toface consultation is safe (outcome2). 7 patients (4%) needed to be brought in urgently (outcome3). Clinicians were significantly more able to make definitive diagnosis/plan in urology and follow-up patients. Of those brought back for scheduled follow-up/surgery, there was 93% correlation between findings at physical consultation compared to the definitive plans made at VC. Patient survey showed 92% overall satisfaction rate. 75% felt VC is comparable to face-to-face/would use VC again. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that VC is an effective&safe way to structure paediatric surgical outpatient care and it highlights the patient categories in which VC is most suitable.","output":"Prospective evaluation of virtual consultations in paediatric surgery and urology: Lessons from the pandemic times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To appraise effective predictors for COVID-19 mortality in a retrospective cohort study. METHODS: A total of 1270 COVID-19 patients, including 984 admitted in Sino French New City Branch (training and internal validation sets randomly split at 7:3 ratio) and 286 admitted in Optical Valley Branch (external validation set) of Wuhan Tongji hospital, were included in this study. Forty-eight clinical and laboratory features were screened with LASSO method. Further multi-tree extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning-based model was used to rank importance of features selected from LASSO and subsequently constructed death risk prediction model with simple-tree XGBoost model. Performances of models were evaluated by AUC, prediction accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. RESULTS: Six features, including disease severity, age, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and interleukin-10 (IL-10), were selected as predictors for COVID-19 mortality. Simple-tree XGBoost model conducted by these features can predict death risk accurately with >90% precision and >85% sensitivity, as well as F1 scores >0.90 in training and validation sets. CONCLUSION: KEY MESSAGES: 1. A machine learning method is used to build death risk model for COVID-19 patients. 2. Disease severity, age, hs-CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-10 are death risk factors. 3.

Studies of national wellbeing and emotional responses to infection rates during a pandemic have been rare thus far. While several disciplines offer theoretical priors in the case of individuals, far less attention has been paid to the wellbeing and emotional response at a national level. Our paper contributes to the literature by applying a time-series approach to the relationship between wellbeing, emotions and the passage of a pandemic. As such we contribute to a wider literature on macro responses to exogenous shocks. Our analysis involves the use of a wellbeing index and emotional time-series derived from Big Data in the form of tweets originating within New Zealand. The index captures the daily evaluative mood of the country several weeks before the first domestic case of COVID-19 was recorded until several weeks of no new COVID-19 cases. We find distinct reactions to the pandemic: a initial fall in national wellbeing generated by a decrease in the emotions joy, anticipation and trust. Following a rapid and severe lockdown designed to limit domestic transmission of the virus national wellbeing recovered relatively quickly. Gaining insight into the wellbeing (happiness) reponse to pandemics at the national level is important because the average level of happiness within countries is known to be associated with a range of economic, social, health and political outcomes.","output":"The impact of exogenous shocks on national wellbeing.

The curved [6]PP exhibits fluorescence in powder and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film as well as solution. A significant increase in quantum yield was observed for a non-fluid PMMA film owing the suppression of the molecular motion. The g CPL values of the dye in solution and as PMMA film were almost the same (4.3-4.4 x 10 -3 ) and lager than that in powder.

Furthermore, gender biases may result in differing expectations and perceptions of female and male physicians and may be associated with patient rapport and trust building. OBJECTIVE: To characterize public perceptions of casual physician attire and implicit gender biases in public assessment of physicians professional attire. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used a population-based survey administered via Amazon Mechanical Turk from May to June 2020 among individuals aged 18 years or older who were US residents and for whom English was the primary language. INTERVENTION: Survey featuring photographs of a male or female model wearing various types of physician attire (white coat, business attire, and scrubs). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Respondents ratings of professionalism, experience, and friendliness of the male and female models in various attire and perceptions of the models most likely health care profession. Preference scores for various outfits were calculated as the difference between the preference score for an outfit and the mean preference score for the outfit-role pairing. RESULTS: Of 522 surveys completed, 487 were included for analysis; the mean (SD) age of respondents was 36.2 (12.4) years, 260 (53.4%) were female, and 372 (76.4%) were White individuals. Respondents perceived models of health care professionals wearing white coats vs those wearing fleece or softshell jackets as significantly more experienced (mean [SD] experience score: white coat, 4.9 [1.5]; fleece, 3.1 [1.5]; softshell, 3.1 [1.5]; P < .001) and professional (mean [SD] professionalism score: white coat, 4.9 [1.6]; fleece, 3.2 [1.5]; softshell, 3.3 [1.5]; P < .001). A white coat with scrubs attire was most preferred for surgeons (mean [SD] preference index: 1.3 [2.3]), whereas a white coat with business attire was preferred for family physicians and dermatologists (mean [SD] preference indexes, 1.6 [2.3] and 1.2 [2.3], respectively; P < .001). Regardless of outerwear, female models in business attire as inner wear were rated as less professional than male counterparts (mean [SD] professionalism score: male, 65.8 [25.4]; female, 56.2 [20.2]; P < .001). Both the male and the female model were identified by the greater number of respondents as a physician or surgeon; however, the female model vs the male model was mistaken by more respondents as a medical technician (39 [8.0] vs 16 [3.3%]; P < .005), physician assistant (56 [11.5%] vs 11 [2.3%]; P < .001), or nurse (161 [33.1%] vs 133 [27.3%]; P = .050). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study, survey respondents rated physicians wearing casual attire as less professional and experienced than those wearing a white coat. Gender biases were found in impressions of professionalism, with female physicians roles being more frequently misidentified. Understanding disparate public perceptions of physician apparel may inform interventions to address professional role confusion and cumulative career disadvantages for women in medicine.","output":"Public Perceptions of Physician Attire and Professionalism in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the initial COVID-19 breakout and related lockdown Lithuanian schools created new pathways of organizing distance education under unprecedented circumstances. The qualitative research focuses on the experiences of Lithuanian schools in organizing distance education during COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 C October 2020, searching for ways to ensure the quality of teaching and learning. The 8 school activity areas need changes during transition to distance teaching and learning: strategy, management and administration;infrastructure of information technologies;digital learning content;digital competencies and continuous professional development;teaching, learning and assessment in the digital environment;a support system for pupils and teachers;partnership, cooperation and networking;and quality assurance. Changes in all the indicated areas lead to the quality of distance teaching and learning. The qualitative research data (expert interviews and focus groups) revealed the importance of school community agreements regarding the choice of technologies and environments, and the need for a national digital curriculum to be created. Quality assurance of the learning process, improvement of digital competences and school community collaboration were among the most successfully changing areas. IT infrastructure, support system, and teaching and learning process were based on very different school or teacher decisions and led to different experiences. ? 2021, Vilnius Pedagogical University.

Maternity services, including antenatal care, labour and delivery as well as postnatal care have been affected directly and indirectly by the pandemic and resultant control interventions, with delays introduced at several points across the continuum of care. Unfortunately, maternity conditions are time-sensitive, and delays can negatively impact feto-maternal outcomes, with increased maternal, fetal or neonatal morbidity and mortality. An audit at central hospitals revealed reduced utilisation of maternity services and a trend towards an increase in maternal mortality. A formal evaluation is required; however, mitigating public health interventions are required, especially as the burden of COVID-19 in the country has considerably come down. The World Health Organisation offers useful technical guidance for maintaining essential health services in pandemic times in low-resources settings, and rationalising the use of personal protective equipment, which can be contextualised and adopted to restore and maintain essential health services. Restoration of essential maternity services is urgently required in an environment that protects healthcare workers and their clients, minimising their risk of contracting COVID-19 whilst optimising fetomaternal outcomes. Thus, the various stakeholders involved in maternity care must urgently come together and find ways of achieving this goal.","output":"Restoring and maintaining robust maternity services in the COVID-19 era: a public health dilemma in Zimbabwe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has meant a rapid transfer of everyday activities to the online world. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become more embedded than ever in people's lives. This investigation addresses how this change has affected the lives of people with intellectual disabilities (ID). A two-step design was used. A rapid review was conducted on empirical studies published between January 2019 and June 2021. Search terms related to ID, ICT use and COVID-19. A qualitative international bricolage was also conducted corresponding to author nationalities. Data gathered from the review and bricolage were analysed separately using thematic analysis and relationally synthesised. Digital solutions to provide access to COVID-19 information and guidance seemed inadequate but were seldom empirically studied. Digital poverty, literacy and exclusion remain significant issues for people with ID internationally. People and their carers experienced reduced and removed service provision, loneliness and impoverished daily lives during the pandemic;amelioration of which was facilitated by digital solutions. One solution often used was videoconferencing. Prior experience of digital participation, adequate finances, connection, support and digital literacy mentoring for both people with ID and those providing services and support facilitated digital inclusion. Digital exclusion during COVID-19 was exacerbated by sociopolitical, structural, individual and support-related barriers. Although awareness of digital exclusion appears to have been raised, the extent to which this has led to action and change remains unclear. Despite digital exclusion and digital participation benefitting continuation of life, social and emotional well-being and autonomy, COVID-19 has not provided the impetus to eradicate digital poverty for people with ID. Governmental support, digital education, creativity and problem solving are required to enable people with ID the human right to be included in the digital world at this essential time and into the future.","output":"Digital inclusion and participation of people with intellectual disabilities during COVID-19: A rapid review and international bricolage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Endophytes are highly beneficial species of microbes that live in symbiosis with plant tissues in the setting. Endophytes are difficult to isolate in their natural environment, and they are understudied despite being a rich source of bioactive molecules. There are varieties of new infectious diseases emerging across the world, necessitating a constant and expanded search for newer and more efficient bioactive molecules. Nigeria is known for its biodiversity in ethnomedicinal plants, yet these plants are understudied for endophytic microbes harbouring novel bioactive molecules. MAIN BODY: Endophytes are a source of novel organic natural molecules and are thought to be drug discovery frontiers. Endophyte research has contributed to the discovery of possible anticancer agents following the discovery of taxol. Endophyte research has contributed to the discovery of possible drug compounds with antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiviral, antidiabetic, anti-Alzheimers disease and immunosuppressive properties among others. These breakthroughs provide hope for combating incurable diseases, drug resistance, the emergence of new infectious diseases, and other human health issues. Finding new medicines that may be effective candidates for treating newly emerging diseases in humans has a lot of promise. Most studies have been on fungi endophytes, with just a few reports on bacterial endophytes. The biology of endophytic bacteria and fungi, as well as endophytic microbes isolated from Nigerian medicinal plants, their isolation methods, identification by morphological and molecular methods, fermentation, purification, identification of bioactive compounds and biosynthetic gene clusters are all covered in this study. CONCLUSION: In Nigeria, the sourcing and isolation of endophytes harboring biosynthetic gene clusters are still understudied, necessitating a rigorous quest for bioactive molecules in endophytes inhabiting various ethnomedicinal plants.","output":"Endophytic microbes from Nigerian ethnomedicinal plants: a potential source for bioactive secondary metabolitesa review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a stochastic COVID-19 model with jump-diffusion, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution of the model.

This threshold is denoted by $\\\\xi$ that depends on the white and jump noises. When the noise is large or small, our numerical findings show that the COVID-19 vanishes from the people if $\\\\xi<1;$ whereas control the epidemic diseases if $\\\\xi>1.$ From this, we observe that white noise and jump noise have a significant effect on the spread of COVID-19 infection.

What is interesting from the perspective of Taiwanese education is that the teaching of life education also incorporates a number of Eastern-derived and conceptualized tenets, for example, Buddhist teaching and the importance of spiritual wisdom. This premise contends then that life education in Taiwan, in general, is concerned with the promotion, fulfillment, and cherishing of quality life experiences (e.g., personal contentment, happiness). One example of life education, which resonates with other spiritual beliefs and religious faiths (e.g., Hinduism), is related to spiritual cultivation and the enlightenment of life wisdom. Our own teaching of the subject, likewise, places emphasis on the goal of teaching students to seek meaningful understanding of and appreciation for three major, interrelated components of life education: life wisdom, life practice, and life care. It has been acknowledged, to a certain degree, that life education has made meaningful contributions, such as the creation and facilitation of a civil, vibrant society, and that many Taiwanese individuals show dignity, respect for elders, and reverence for spiritual and religious faiths. For example, aside from high-quality hospice care, many Taiwanese engage in different types of benevolent acts (e.g., providing spiritual advice to someone who is dying), where possible. Life education is a beneficial subject for teaching and learning as its theoretical understanding may help individuals cope with pathologies and negative conditions and life experiences. One negative life experience, in this case, is the ultimate fate of humankind: death. Approaching death and/or the onset of grief is something that we all have to experience. How does one approach death? It is not easy feat, and of course, grief for a loved one is personal, and some of us struggle with this. We contend that spiritual cultivation and enlightenment, arising from life education, may assist us with the topic of death (e.g., the possibility of transcendence beyond the realm of life). More importantly however, from our own teaching experiences and research development, we strongly believe and rationalize that the subject of life education could, indeed, coincide with and support the paradigm of positive psychology (Seligman, 1999, 2010; Seligman and Cskszentmihlyi, 2000). Forming the premise of the present conceptual analysis article, we propose that a persons spiritual and enlightened self, reflecting the convergence of three major aspects of life education (i.e., philosophical reflection, enrichment of personal well-being, and spiritual cultivation), would result in the initiation and creation of a number of virtues and positive characteristics, for example, having a positive outlook in life, having a perceived sense of spirituality, showing compassion, forgiveness, etc. These virtues and quality characteristics, from our philosophical reasoning, are equivalent to those qualities that the paradigm of positive psychology advocates for. In summary, we conceptualize that the subject of life education, from the perspective of Taiwanese education, may intertwine with the paradigm of positive psychology. A persons spiritual and enlightened self, or his/her holistic self, from our rationalization, is the ultimate optimal life experience that he/she may have, enabling him/her to address the gamut of life conditions and experiences. The distinctive nature of life education in this case, as a point of summary, is that it incorporates spiritual beliefs and religious faiths (e.g., Buddhist faith), encouraging a person to seek nature and divineChuman relationships, as well as to contemplate and to explore the complex nature of his/her inner self. The notion of Buddhist samsara, for example, as evidence of spirituality, entailing the endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath, may provide a person with hope into the afterlife. Such esoteric discourse, we contend, is positive and optimistic, allowing individuals to discard the dividing line between life and death.","output":"Introducing the Study of Life and Death Education to Support the Importance of Positive Psychology: An Integrated Model of Philosophical Beliefs, Religious Faith, and Spirituality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & objectives: The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has challenged public health system worldwide due to the unavailability of approved preventive and therapeutic options. Identification of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) and understanding their role is important. However, the data on kinetics of NAb response among COVID-19 patients are unclear. To understand the NAb response in COVID-19 patients, we compared the findings of microneutralization test (MNT) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for the SARS-CoV-2. Further, the kinetics of NAb response among COVID-19 patients was assessed. Methods: A total of 343 blood samples (89 positive, 58 negative for SARS-CoV-2 and 17 cross-reactive and 179 serum from healthy individuals) were collected and tested by MNT and PRNT. SARS-CoV-2 virus was prepared by propagating the virus in Vero CCL-81 cells. The intra-class correlation was calculated to assess the correlation between MNT and PRNT. The neutralizing endpoint as the reduction in the number of plaque count by 90 per cent (PRNT90) was also calculated. Results: The analysis of MNT and PRNT quantitative results indicated that the intra-class correlation was 0.520. Of the 89 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 64 (71.9%) showed NAb response. Interpretation & conclusions: The results of MNT and PRNT were specific with no cross-reactivity. In the early stages of infection, the NAb response was observed with variable antibody kinetics.

To do so, we needed to identify these patients and develop a protocol to keep them out of the hospital (to limit risk of infection and conserve medical resources), and do so without in-person visits. So we used our peer-reviewed software, Diabetes Reporting, to identify 87 patients whose glucose management indicator (GMI) scores were over 9%. The GMI is a method for estimating the laboratory A1C using the patient's actual blood glucose measurements over the past 90 days. A GMI (or A1C) over 9% indicates a heightened risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and, possibly, a slightly higher risk of severe hypoglycemia (SH), the two most common acute complications leading patients with T1D to be hospitalized. We contacted these 87 at-risk patients and enrolled them in a quality improvement project. This project consisted of additional online meetings with their doctors as well as weekly reports generated by Diabetes Reporting for three months, between March 28, 2020 and June 28, 2020. We hypothesized that this heightened communication would reduce the incidence of DKA and SH among the participants by reducing their GMI. As a comparison group, we used data from the T1D Exchange, which showed that, among patients with an A1C over 9%, 6.7% were hospitalized for DKA and 7% experienced SH leading to loss of consciousness in a three-month period. This led us to predict 6 incidences of DKA and 6 incidences of SH among our 87 participants during the three-month period. Instead, we saw 2 incidences of DKA and 1 incidence of SH. Moreover, the mean GMI of our participants dropped from 9.91% to 9.25%, a clinically-significant .66% improvement, which supports the conclusion that our protocol helped avoid acute complications among a cohort of at-risk patients with T1D by improving glycemic control during a time when we were limited to largely online care. This telemedicine protocol merits further research for its potential to improve and lower costs of care for patients with T1D, particularly for those at higher risk for acute complications.","output":"A novel telemedicine protocol improved outcomes for high-risk patients with type 1 diabetes: A 3-month quality improvement project during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a new viral emergent human disease caused by a novel strain of Coronavirus.

Objectives This interview with Professor Stphane Velut, neurosurgeon and writer, is an occasion to reflect on the current challenges of transforming the functioning of public hospitals today. In recent years, he has made his voice heard in public debate by publishing several essays and tracts. This interview allows him to expand upon some of his theses, by giving voice to his experience. Professor Velut's lively and passionate speech is in constant dialogue with the human sciences and literature. His taste for words led him in particular to develop a sensitivity to and a critique of the rhetoric employed by contemporary hospital administrators. Methods This dialogue is based on open questioning. Professor Velut is asked about his own experience as head of department and surgeon. The interview makes it possible to explore the many influences, from Victor Klemperer to Rgis Debray, which help him think about the era and the issues specific to it. The analysis of the social and political context of French medicine over the last forty years is widely discussed: from the emergence of health democracy with the AIDS epidemic to the most recent upheavals caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Results The new logics of care, evolving towards an ever greater requirement of technicality, systematicity, and evaluability, lead to a standardization of medical practice, which tends to eliminate any singularity, both that of the patient and the clinician. Discussion Today, it is administrators, economists, and communicators who seem to hold the power to decide what is desirable for the hospital. The analysis of their metalanguage reveals a singular enterprise of watering down, which de-realizes the reality of the concrete objects of the caregiver: illness, care, death. This metalanguage contrasts with the language of clinicians, grappling with a reality other than that of evaluation and quantification, in their proximity to the suffering of each patient. Conclusion The neoliberal management of the hospital, controlled by economic imperatives;modern forms of management, indexed against the principle of subsidiarity;finally, the new systematized and protocolized conceptions of care lead to a loss of autonomy for clinicians and caregivers who are no longer expected to be actors capable of thinking for themselves. In contrast, the concrete, even artisanal exercise of surgeon, in which the work of the surgeon's hand (like that of the craftsman) is irreplaceable, is a form of clinical practice that preserves the singularity of the encounter and the possibility of inventiveness. The practice of surgery allows the practitioner to take the singularity of each participant into account;in this, it can be compared to the practice of psychiatry.","output":"Que devient lh?pital en rgime nolibral ?

Development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here, we evaluated the antiviral activity of a remdesivir parent nucleotide analog, GS441524, which targets the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme, and a feline coronavirus prodrug, GC376, which targets its main protease, using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse model. Our results showed that GS441524 effectively blocked the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse upper and lower respiratory tracts via combined intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) treatment. However, the ability of high-dose GC376 (i.m. or i.n. and i.m.) was weaker than GS441524. Notably, low-dose combined application of GS441524 with GC376 could effectively protect mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection via i.n. or i.n. and i.m. treatment. Moreover, we found that the pharmacokinetic properties of GS441524 is better than GC376, and combined application of GC376 and GS441524 had a synergistic effect. Our findings support the further evaluation of the combined application of GC376 and GS441524 in future clinical studies.","output":"The preclinical inhibitor GS441524 in combination with GC376 efficaciously inhibited the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse respiratory tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Renewable energy (RE) is one of the most popular public policy orientations worldwide. Compared to some other countries and continents, Europe has gained an early awareness of energy and environmental problems in general. At the theoretical level, free-market environmentalism indicates that based on the principle of private property rights, with fewer state interventionist and regulation policies, entrepreneurs, as the driving force of the market economy, can provide better services to meet the necessity of offering RE to protect the environment more effectively. Previous studies have revealed that Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom have made some progress in using the market to develop RE. However, this research did not analyze the three countries RE conditions from the perspective of free-market environmentalism. Based on our review of the principles of free-market environmentalism, this paper originally provides an empirical study of how Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom have partly conducted free-market-oriented policies to successfully achieve their policy goal of RE since the 1990s on a practical level. In particular, compared with Germany and Denmark, the UK has maintained a relatively low energy tax rate and opted for more pro-market measures since the Hayekian-Thatcherism free-market reform of 1979. The paper also discovers that Fredrich A. Hayeks theories have strongly impacted its energy liberalization reform agenda since then. Low taxes on the energy industry and electricity have alleviated the burden on the electricity enterprises and consumers in the UK. Moreover, the empirical results above show that the energy enterprises play essential roles in providing better and more affordable RE for household and industrial users in the three sampled countries. Based on the above results, the paper also warns that state intervention policies such as taxation, state subsidies, and industrial access restrictions can impede these three countries RE targets. Additionally, our research provides reform agendas and policy suggestions to policymakers on the importance of implementing free-market environmentalism to provide more efficient RE in the post-COVID-19 era.","output":"A Free-Market Environmentalist Transition toward Renewable Energy: The Cases of Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the TIPEC framework, this study undertook a critical literature analysis, and student survey to explore challenges experienced by higher education institutions during emergency online pedagogies because of disruptions from the COVID-19 outbreak. The study revealed that most higher education institutions are still grappling with getting technicalities in place such as reliable network connectivity, IT capacity, clear navigation to learning content, timetabling, and session scheduling, and reliable hardware and software required to access online learning platforms to keep teaching and learning afloat. However, little attention is placed on the provision of quality online learning. Therefore, there is a need to move towards enabling epistemological access through the use of online tools in a pedagogically sound and inclusive manner to enable students to develop critical thinking skills. The current quality assurance practices also need to transform to effectively respond to the learning needs of the new normal. Students also need to be equipped with skills that will empower them to effectively use the online system. ? 2021, Commonwealth of Learning.

Neighborhood social cohesion may diminish dementia-related stigma, particularly in terms of perceived public attitudes. The COVID-19 pandemic can further negatively impact perceived public stigma. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between neighborhood social cohesion and dementia-related stigma during the pre- and current COVID-19 period. METHODS: We employed a cross-sectional design using data from a large population-based cohort, the Tokyo Teen Cohort, in Japan. Overall, 2,469 mothers of 16-year-old adolescents self-completed a questionnaire comprising nine dementia-related stigma questions evaluating perceived public and personal attitudes. Neighborhood social cohesion was assessed using a five-item instrument. The participants were divided into two groups according to the time of assessment: prior to the pandemic's onset (February 2019-March 2020) and during the pandemic (April 2020-July 2021). A multiple regression analysis of stigma was performed using neighborhood social cohesion as an independent variable, and caring experience, age, educational level, and working status as covariates. RESULTS: Personal and perceived public stigma were significantly lower in participants who perceived greater neighborhood social cohesion. However, level of personal and perceived public stigma did not differ between pre- and during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: Neighborhood social cohesion may be a modifiable factor for dementia-related stigma. A localized intervention to enhance social cohesion in the neighborhood community would promote the utilization of services among those who may become family caregivers.","output":"Neighborhood Social Cohesion and Dementia-Related Stigma Among Mothers of Adolescents in the Pre- and Current COVID-19 Period: An Observational Study Using Population-Based Cohort Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International travel goes hand-in-hand with medical delivery to underserved communities.

High-quality data on management of these patients are scarce, and further investigation will provide valuable information in the context of the pandemic. A group of experts identify a set of pragmatic recommendations for the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and shock in resource-limited environments. We define shock as life-threatening circulatory failure that results in inadequate tissue perfusion and cellular dysoxia/hypoxia, and suggest that it can be operationalized via clinical observations. We suggest a thorough evaluation for other potential causes of shock and suggest against indiscriminate testing for coinfections. We suggest the use of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) as a simple bedside prognostic score for COVID-19 patients and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to evaluate the etiology of shock. Regarding fluid therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-middle-income countries, we favor balanced crystalloids and recommend using a conservative fluid strategy for resuscitation. Where available and not prohibited by cost, we recommend using norepinephrine, given its safety profile. We favor avoiding the routine use of central venous or arterial catheters, where availability and costs are strong considerations. We also recommend using low-dose corticosteroids in patients with refractory shock. In addressing targets of resuscitation, we recommend the use of simple bedside parameters such as capillary refill time and suggest that POCUS be used to assess the need for further fluid resuscitation, if available.","output":"Pragmatic Recommendations for the Management of COVID-19 Patients with Shock in Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in opioid treatment programs (OTPs), SAMHSA notified State Opioid Treatment Authorities that stable patients could receive up to 27a??days of take-homes, less stable patients could receive up to 13a??days with fewer take-homes for other patients. An analysis assessed how the relaxed standards affected the number of patient dosing visits and the amount of take-home medications dispensed in Oregon's 20 public, nonprofit, and for-profit OTPs. OTPs reported the number of patients receiving take homes pre and post federal policy change at 3 time points: pre SARS-CoV-2 (February or first half of March), post 1 SARS-CoV-2 (March, April, or May), and post 2 SARS-CoV-2 (April, May, or June). The patients receiving each quantity of take-homes were counted and means calculated for visits and take-homes per patient per month. A negative binomial mixed-effects regression model assessed change in mean dosing visits per patient. During the pre SARS-CoV-2 period, OTPs served 7792 patients monthly with 120,513 medication visits and dispensed 44,883 take-home doses. Mean patient visits per month were 15.5 with 5.8 take-homes per patient per month. Following the policy change, medication visits declined 33% and take-home medication increased 97% with 10.4 mean visits per patient and 11.3 mean take-homes per patient.

The number of infections decreased during the end of the twentieth century due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which was associated with a very high risk of death after becoming infected by HIV-positive sexual contact. However, with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the number of infections rapidly increased. Classical venereal infections continue to represent a global health threat. Because of the diagnostic improvement by the introduction of molecularbiological methods and epidemiological studies, it is known that the number of sexually transmitted infections has increased. Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and viral infections such as herpes simplex, hepatitis B and human papilloma viruses are listed as sexually transmitted infections (STI). For some microbes, such as Zika virus, Ebola virus, bacteria of the gastrointestinal area and meningococcal infections, sexual contact is only one possible transmission route of the infection to the partner. They are summarized as sexually transmissible infections. The knowledge of infections transmitted to the partner, including contact tracing and diagnostic management plays an important role for the prophylaxis in order to avoid the transmission to the sexual partner.","output":"Neue und wiederkehrende sexuell bertragbare Erreger: Nachwuchs- und berlebensknstler"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic has various radiological imaging findings.

METHODS Retrospective cohort of all patients admitted during March 13, 2020 through May 13, 2020 with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 to 3 tertiary-care hospitals. Patient-level data (demographic, clinical manifestations, comorbid illnesses, inpatient treatment) were analyzed. The main outcome variable was atypical presentation, defined as any hospitalized patient with COVID-19 infection who did not experience both fever and cough. We identified risk factors for atypical presentation on univariate and multivariate analyses and assessed 30-day mortality differences via survival analysis. RESULTS Of 163 patients in the study, 39 (24%) were atypical. On univariate analysis, atypical cases were significantly more likely to be older, reside in a long-term-care facility (LTCF), and have underlying diabetes mellitus, stroke, or cardiac disease; present without dyspnea or myalgia, have lower C-reactive proteins (CRP) and higher beta-natriuretic peptides. They were less likely to receive intensive care unit care or specific COVID-19 treatments (P < .05). The incidence of acute respiratory failure was not significantly different between the groups. On logistic regression, atypical cases were significantly more likely to be LTCF residents (P = 0.003) and have a lower average CRP (P = 0.01). Atypical cases had significantly higher 30-day mortality (hazard ratio 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6 - 7.2], P = 0.002).

However, the current 1-2 m physical distancing rule is based on the physics of droplet transport and could not directly translate into infection risk. We therefore revisit the 2-m physical distancing rule by developing an infection-risk-based model for human speaking. The key modeling framework components include viral load, droplets dispersion and evaporation, deposition efficiency, viral dose-response rate and infection risk. The results suggest that the one-size-fits-all 2-m physical distancing rule derived from the pure droplet-physics-based model is not applicable under some realistic indoor settings, and may rather increase transmission probability of diseases. Especially, in thermally stratified environments, the infection risk could exhibit multiple peaks for a long distance beyond 2 m. With Sobol's sensitivity analysis, most variance of the risk is found to be significantly attributable to the variability in temperature gradient, exposure time and breathing height difference. Our study suggests there is no such magic 2 m physical distancing rule for all environments, but it needs to be used alongside other strategies, such as using face cover, reducing exposure time, and controlling the thermal stratification of indoor environment.","output":"Revisiting physical distancing threshold in indoor environment using infection-risk-based modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of this paper was to provide a narrative review of human factors considerations for telemedicine.

Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. We observed that age-associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4+ Tcm cells increase in abundance with age. Several age-associated genes have functional effects on SARS-CoV replication, and directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, age-associated genes are heavily enriched among those induced or suppressed by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease.","output":"The aging transcriptome and cellular landscape of the human lung in relation to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While public health communication has been suggested to be a key for improving acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination, this study tested mediation pathways through which three types of vaccine information acquisition, i.e. seeking, scanning, and discussing, affect COVID-19 vaccination intention.

This project investigated the impact of COVID-19 on operations in all PACE programs in one U.S. state. Design Qualitative study. Setting and Participants Structured interviews with administrators of all 12 PACE programs in North Carolina. Methods Interviews were conducted December 2020-January 2021 by trained interviewers over Zoom;they were transcribed, coded, and qualitatively analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Reported COVID-19 infection rates among PACE participants for 2020 averaged 12.3 cases, 4.6 hospitalizations, and 1.9 deaths per 100 enrollees. Six themes emerged from analyses: new, unprecedented administrative challenges;insufficient access to and integration with other health care providers;reevaluation of the core PACE model, resulting in a transition to home-based care;re-orientation to be more family-focused in care provision;implementation of new, creative strategies to address participant and family psychological and social well-being in the home;and major reconfiguration of staffing, including transitions to new and different roles and a concomitant effort to provide support and relief to staff. Conclusions and Implications While facing many challenges that required major changes in care provision, PACE was successful in mounting a COVID-19 response that upheld safety, promoted the physical and mental well-being of participants, and responded to the needs of family caregivers. Administrators felt that, after the pandemic, PACEs service model is likely to remain more home-based and less reliant on the day center than in the past.

Alongside the increased use of such applications to facilitate the process of conducting interviews, the quality interview has taken a hit overall. This is largely because prospective candidates resort to fraud by switching tabs and using their phones during the course of an interview, and so come through with flying colors despite a clear lack of skills. Consequently, deserving candidates with the requisite skill set lose out to impostors who manage to clear the interviews. In this paper, we propose an approach to make interviews straightforward and fair to all candidates. Our Online Interview Platform, a web application built using Node.js and Express.js, offers indispensable features that are prerequisites for an interview. These include a real-time collaborative code editor that uses an operational transformation algorithm which allows users to collaborate in real time, test and run code;a video/audio conferencing feature using Peer JS;a chat box for communication, and a real-time collaborative whiteboard that lets users design or draw diagrams. The features are included in the same tab, thus ensuring that the candidate does not switch tabs. Using this application, candidates will be screened based on their technical knowledge, appropriately assessed, and performance-based hiring decisions made.

We showed that while our proposed model is trained on a relatively small dataset acquired from only one imaging center using a specific scanning protocol, the model performs well on heterogeneous test sets obtained by multiple scanners using different technical parameters. We also showed that the model can be updated via an unsupervised approach to cope with the data shift between the train and test sets and enhance the robustness of the model upon receiving a new external dataset from a different center. We adopted an ensemble architecture to aggregate the predictions from multiple versions of the model. For initial training and development purposes, an in-house dataset of 171 COVID-19, 60 CAP, and 76 Normal cases was used, which contained volumetric CT scans acquired from one imaging center using a constant standard radiation dose scanning protocol. To evaluate the model, we collected four different test sets retrospectively to investigate the effects of the shifts in the data characteristics on the model's performance. Among the test cases, there were CT scans with similar characteristics as the train set as well as noisy low-dose and ultra-low dose CT scans. In addition, some test CT scans were obtained from patients with a history of cardiovascular diseases or surgeries. The entire test dataset used in this study contained 51 COVID-19, 28 CAP, and 51 Normal cases. Experimental results indicate that our proposed framework performs well on all test sets achieving total accuracy of 96.15% (95%CI: [91.25-98.74]), COVID-19 sensitivity of 96.08% (95%CI: [86.54-99.5]), CAP sensitivity of 92.86% (95%CI: [76.50-99.19]).","output":"Robust Automated Framework for COVID-19 Disease Identification from a Multicenter Dataset of Chest CT Scans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic disease caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. It starts as a pulmonary infection that can spread to other organs, such as the brain, leading to the most serious occurrence of the disease, meningoencephalitis. The humoral response has already been described in limiting the progression of cryptococcosis where the B-1 cell seems to be responsible for producing natural IgM antibodies, crucial for combating fungal infections. The role of the B-1 cell in C. neoformans infection has been initially described, however the role of the humoral response of B-1 cells has not yet been evaluated during C. gattii infections. In the present study we tried to unravel this issue using XID mice, a murine model deficient in the Btk protein which compromises the development of B-1 lymphocytes. We use the XID mice compared to BALB/c mice that are sufficient for the B-1 population during C. gattii infection. Our model of chronic lung infection revealed that XID mice, unlike the sufficient group of B-1, had early mortality with significant weight loss, in addition to reduced levels of IgM and IgG specific to GXM isolated from the capsule of C. neoformans. In addition to this, we observed an increased fungal load in the blood and in the brain. We described an increase in the capsular size of C. gattii and the predominant presence of cytokines with a Th2 profile was also observed in these animals. Thus, the present study strongly points to a higher susceptibility of the XID mouse to C. gattii, which suggests that the presence of B-1 cells and anti-GXM antibodies is fundamental during the control of infection by C. gattii.","output":"X-linked immunodeficient (XID) mice exhibit high susceptibility to Cryptococcus gattii infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between changes in long term residential exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and premature mortality in Canada. DESIGN Population based quasi-experimental study. SETTING Canada. PARTICIPANTS 663 100 respondents to the 1996, 2001, and 2006 Canadian censuses aged 25-89 years who had consistently lived in areas with either high or low PM2.5 levels over five years preceding census day and moved during the ensuing five years. INTERVENTIONS Changes in long term exposure to PM2.5 arising from residential mobility. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was deaths from natural causes. Secondary outcomes were deaths from any cardiometabolic cause, any respiratory cause, and any cancer cause. All outcomes were obtained from the national vital statistics database. RESULTS Using a propensity score matching technique with numerous personal, socioeconomic, health, and environment related covariates, each participant who moved to a different PM2.5 area was matched with up to three participants who moved within the same PM2.5 area. In the matched groups that moved from high to intermediate or low PM2.5 areas, residential mobility was associated with a decline in annual PM2.5 exposure from 10.6 g/m3 to 7.4 and 5.0 g/m3, respectively. Conversely, in the matched groups that moved from low to intermediate or high PM2.5 areas, annual PM2.5 increased from 4.6 g/m3 to 6.7 and 9.2 g/m3. Five years after moving, individuals who experienced a reduction in exposure to PM2.5 from high to intermediate levels showed a 6.8% (95% confidence interval 1.7% to 11.7%) reduction in mortality (2510 deaths in 56 025 v 4925 deaths in 101 960). A greater decline in mortality occurred among those exposed to a larger reduction in PM2.5. Increased mortality was found with exposure to PM2.5 from low to high levels, and to a lesser degree from low to intermediate levels. Furthermore, the decreases in PM2.5 exposure were most strongly associated with reductions in cardiometabolic deaths, whereas the increases in PM2.5 exposure were mostly related to respiratory deaths. No strong evidence was found for the changes in PM2.5 exposure with cancer related deaths. CONCLUSIONS In Canada, decreases in PM2.5 were associated with lower mortality, whereas increases in PM2.5 were associated with higher mortality. These results were observed at PM2.5 levels considerably lower than many other countries, providing support for continuously improving air quality.","output":"Changes in exposure to ambient fine particulate matter after relocating and long term survival in Canada: quasi-experimental study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus has become a global public health challenge.

Several studies suggest that PAE modifies DNA methylation in offspring cells and tissues, providing evidence for a potential mechanistic link to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We systematically reviewed existing evidence on the extent to which maternal alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with offspring DNA methylation. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted across five online databases according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Google Scholar and CINAHL Databases were searched for articles relating to PAE in placental mammals. Data were extracted from each study and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) was used to assess the potential for bias in human studies. RESULTS Forty-three articles were identified for inclusion. Twenty-six animal studies and 16 human studies measured offspring DNA methylation in various tissues using candidate gene analysis, methylome-wide association studies (MWAS), or total nuclear DNA methylation content. PAE dose and timing varied between studies. Risk of bias was deemed high in nearly all human studies. There was insufficient evidence in human and animal studies to support global disruption of DNA methylation from PAE. Inconclusive evidence was found for hypomethylation at IGF2/H19 regions within somatic tissues. MWAS assessing PAE effects on offspring DNA methylation showed inconsistent evidence. There was some consistency in the relatively small number of MWAS conducted in populations with FASD. Meta-analyses could not be conducted due to significant heterogeneity between studies. CONCLUSION Considering heterogeneity in study design and potential for bias, evidence for an association between PAE and offspring DNA methylation was inconclusive. Some reproducible associations were observed in populations with FASD although the limited number of these studies warrants further research.

A centralized contact tracing system was developed in Belgium in 2020. We aim to evaluate the performance and describe the results, between January 01, 2021, and September 30, 2021. The characteristics of COVID-19 cases and the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on testing and tracing are also described. Methods: : We combined laboratory diagnostic test data (molecular and antigen test), vaccination data, and contact tracing data. A descriptive analysis was done to evaluate the performance of contact tracing and describe insights into the epidemiology of COVID-19 by contact tracing. Results: : Between January and September 2021, 555.181 COVID-19 cases were reported to the central contact center and 91% were contacted. The average delay between symptom onset and contact tracing initiation was around 5 days, of which 4 days corresponded to pre-testing delay. High-Risk Contacts (HRC) were reported by 49% of the contacted index cases. The mean number of reported HRC was 2.7. In total, 666.869 HRC were reported of which 91% were successfully contacted and 89% of these were tested at least once following the interview. The estimated average secondary attack rate (SAR) among the contacts of the COVID-19 cases who reported at least one contact, was 27% and was significantly higher among household HRC. The proportion of COVID-19 cases who were previously identified as HRC within the central system was 24%. Conclusions: : The contact-tracing system contacted more than 90% of the reported COVID-19 cases and their HRC. This proportion remained stable between January 1 2021 and September 30 2021 despite an increase in cases in March-April 2021. We report high SAR, indicating that through contact tracing a large number of infections were prospectively detected. The system can be further improved by (1) reducing the delay between onset of illness and medical consultation (2) having more exhaustive reporting of HRC by the COVID-19 case.","output":"COVID-19 Contact Tracing in Belgium: Main Indicators and Performance, January - September 2021 (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed sustained demand on health systems globally, and the capacity to provide critical care has been overwhelmed in some jurisdictions. It is unknown which triage criteria for allocation of resources perform best to inform health system decision-making. We sought to summarize and describe existing triage tools and ethical frameworks to aid healthcare decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of triage criteria and ethical frameworks for the allocation of critical care resources during epidemics and pandemics. We searched Medline, EMBASE, and SCOPUS from inception to November 3, 2020. Full-text screening and data abstraction were conducted independently and in duplicate by three reviewers. Articles were included if they were primary research, an adult critical care setting, and the framework described was related to an infectious disease outbreak. We summarized each triage tool and ethical guidelines or framework including their elements and operating characteristics using descriptive statistics. We assessed the quality of each article with applicable checklists tailored to each study design. RESULTS: From 11,539 unique citations, 697 full-text articles were reviewed and 83 articles were included. Fifty-nine described critical care triage protocols and 25 described ethical frameworks. Of these, four articles described both a protocol and ethical framework. Sixty articles described 52 unique triage criteria (29 algorithm-based, 23 point-based). Few algorithmic- or point-based triage protocols were good predictors of mortality with AUCs ranging from 0.51 (PMEWS) to 0.85 (admitting SOFA > 11). Most published triage protocols included the substantive values of duty to provide care, equity, stewardship and trust, and the procedural value of reason. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes available triage protocols and ethical guidelines to provide decision-makers with data to help select and tailor triage tools. Given the uncertainty about how the COVID-19 pandemic will progress and any future pandemics, jurisdictions should prepare by selecting and adapting a triage tool that works best for their circumstances.

We investigated whether olfactory loss is a reliable predictor of COVID-19. Methods: This preregistered, cross-sectional study used a crowdsourced questionnaire in 23 languages to assess symptoms in individuals self-reporting recent respiratory illness. We quantified changes in chemosensory abilities during the course of the respiratory illness using 0-100 visual analog scales (VAS) for participants reporting a positive (C19+; n=4148) or negative (C19-; n=546) COVID-19 laboratory test outcome. Logistic regression models identified singular and cumulative predictors of COVID-19 status and post-COVID-19 olfactory recovery. Results: Both C19+ and C19- groups exhibited smell loss, but it was significantly larger in C19+ participants (mean{+/-}SD, C19+: -82.5{+/-}27.2 points; C19-: -59.8{+/-}37.7). Smell loss during illness was the best predictor of COVID-19 in both single and cumulative feature models (ROC AUC=0.72), with additional features providing no significant model improvement. VAS ratings of smell loss were more predictive than binary chemosensory yes/no-questions or other cardinal symptoms, such as fever or cough. Olfactory recovery within 40 days was reported for ~50% of participants and was best predicted by time since illness onset.

Our micro-level model keeps track of the infection state for each individual at every point in time, ranging from susceptible, exposed, infectious to recovered. We develop a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer contact-channel specific infection transmission probabilities. Our algorithm uses Gibbs sampling to draw samples of the latent infection status of each individual over the entire time period of analysis, given the latent infection status of all contacts and test outcome data. Experimental results with simulated data demonstrate our CRISP model can be parametrized by the reproduction factor $R_0$ and exhibits population-level infectiousness and recovery time series similar to those of the classical SEIR model. However, due to the individual contact data, this model allows fine grained control and inference for a wide range of COVID-19 mitigation and suppression policy measures. Moreover, the algorithm is able to support efficient testing in a test-trace-isolate approach to contain COVID-19 infection spread. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model with efficient inference for COVID-19 infection spread based on individual-level contact data; most epidemic models are macro-level models that reason over entire populations.

In Queensland, the highest number of H1N1 cases were admitted to the intensive care unit when compared with the other Australian states. While many recent studies examining the H1N1 pandemic have focussed on service delivery and disease epidemiology, few have explored the lived experiences of frontline health care workers caring for the patients in the intensive care unit. OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to: document and describe the lived experiences of the nursing and medical staff caring for patients in the intensive care unit during the H1N1 pandemic; to validate the staffs experiences; and to assist in informing future pandemic planning by highlighting the collective experiences of these frontline health care workers. DESIGN: A phenomenological study method was used. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 34 staff from a tertiary referral hospital in Brisbane, Australia participated in the study. METHODS: Data was collected using an open ended questionnaire and focus groups. The resulting responses were analysed using Colaizzi's framework to discover regular patterns of meaning that emerged. RESULTS: Eight common themes emerged: the wearing of personal protective equipment; infection control procedures; the fear of contracting and transmitting the disease; adequate staffing levels within the intensive care unit; new roles for staff; morale levels; education regarding extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; and the challenges of patient care. These eight themes articulate the lived experience of the staff during the height of the H1N1 Influenza pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS: Planning for a pandemic situation is invariably difficult due to the unpredictable nature of the event itself. Recommendations for future pandemic planning which can be drawn from this study include the appointment of a dedicated infection control representative to provide information and support regarding infection control matters; the maintenance of effective communication channels is crucial; and the increased staffing requirements across nursing, medical, allied health and ancillary staff to cope with the higher patient numbers and acuity must be anticipated and planned for.","output":"The experiences of health care workers employed in an Australian intensive care unit during the H1N1 Influenza pandemic of 2009: A phenomenological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In many societies we have seen juridical power weakening in favour of regulatory systems based on scientific knowledge, with the urgent goal of maintaining biological life and containing infection.

This study aims to evaluate the knowledge of anesthesiology specialists and residents in Turkey about COVID-19 and their attitudes toward the strategies and application methods to be used for a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case that needs to be operated on or followed up in an intensive care unit, as well as to raise awareness about this issue. Methods: This descriptive study comprised anesthesiology specialists and residents working in various health institutions in Turkey. The data used in this study were obtained online between March 13, 2020 and March 25, 2020 through the website SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) by using a survey form. We contacted members of the Turkish Anaesthesiology and Reanimation Society through the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, as well as through their e-mail addresses and invited them to participate in the study. Those who agreed to participate responded to the aforementioned survey. We used SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) to analyze the survey data statistically. Results: A total of 346 anesthesiology specialists and residents participated in the study. Although the majority of the participants exhibited the correct attitudes toward airway management, research assistants with little professional experience were observed to be undecided or had the tendency to make incorrect decisions. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide. The incidence of COVID-19 cases is increasing daily, and this disease can cause patient death. Anesthesiology specialists and residents who perform emergency operations on these patients in settings other than intensive care units should follow simple and easy-to-understand algorithms to ensure safety. The provision of theoretical and practical training to healthcare providers before they meet patients will help ensure patient-healthcare provider safety and prevent panic, which can cause distress among healthcare providers.","output":"Attitudes of Anesthesiology Specialists and Residents toward Patients Infected with the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): A National Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Obstetric work requires good communication, which can be trained through interventions targeting healthcare providers and pregnant women/patients.

For populations with infection rates lower than 10%, additional testing efficiency may be realized by performing a second round of pooling to test all the samples in the positive first-round pools. The present predictions are validated by recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pooled testing and detection sensitivity measurements performed using non-optimal pool sizes, and quantify the additional improvement in testing efficiency that could have been obtained using optimal pooling.

The folds in the single layer graphene (SLG) are not continuous but break up into \\"alternating\\" patterns. A \\"joint\\" (an AB-stacked bilayer graphene) region connects two neighboring alternating regions, and the breaks are always along zigzag or armchair directions. Folds formed in bilayer or few-layer graphene are continuous with no breaks. Molecular dynamics simulations show that SLG suffers a significantly higher compressive stress compared to bilayer graphene when both are under the same compression, thus leading to the rupture of SLG in these fold regions. The fracture strength of a CVD-grown single crystal SLG film was simulated to be about 70 GPa. This study greatly deepens the understanding of the mechanics of CVD-grown single crystal graphene and such folds, and sheds light on the fabrication of various graphene origami/kirigami structures by substrate engineering.

Such framing assumes school leaders are indeed part of a profession. And yet, while research abounds regarding teaching as a profession (Ingersoll and Collins, 2018;Sachs, 2016;Torres and Weiner, 2018), no parallel literature exists about school leaders. Such information is critical to ensure educators receive the appropriate professional development and support (Sachs, 2016) and move the field forward and thus motivated the authors to ask how principals view their work and whether it can be seen as part of a discrete profession. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilized an interpretative phenomenological approach (IPA) drawing on qualitative interviews with sixteen elementary school principals in two US states. Findings: The authors find administration, and specifically the principalship, exists adjacent to, but distinct from, teaching. Additionally, the authors find school leadership is an emergent profession, with aspects of the work that indicate leadership is a profession but others that do not. Originality/value: This study extends early work (Stone-Johnson and Weiner, 2020) on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on principals' professionalism to shed light on the larger and more long-standing features of principals' work that support and hinder its development as a profession and the implications of such designation on attracting and retaining school leaders, as well as underscoring that because school leadership and teaching can be considered discrete professions, teachers need not leave their classroom to be true professionals. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Theorizing school leadership as a profession: a qualitative exploration of the work of school leaders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The plethora of manifestations of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) can occur with or without concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for which regular screening is mandatory.

Diagnosis is primarily based upon the clinical picture and its histopathology. Results of autoimmune serology and direct immunofluorescence can be helpful. For mild forms of CLE local therapy is often sufficient. If not, hydroxychloroquine is the first choice of systemic therapy in addition to transient systemic steroids. For recalcitrant cases additional therapy with methotrexate, retinoids, dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, thalidomide, belimumab and rituximab may be used.

Simple and sensitive diagnosis of COVID-19 at the early stage is important to prevent the spread of pandemics. Herein, we have proposed a target-triggered cascade signal amplification in this work for sensitive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Specifically, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can trigger the catalytic hairpin assembly to generate plenty of DNA duplexes with free 3-OH termini, which can be recognized and catalyzed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) to generate long strand DNA. The prolonged DNA can absorb substantial Ru(NH(3))(6)(3+) molecules via electrostatic interaction and produce an enhanced current response. The incorporation of catalytic hairpin assembly and TdT-mediated polymerization effectively lowers the detection limit to 45 fM, with a wide linear range from 0.1 pM to 3000 pM. Moreover, the proposed strategy possesses excellent selectivity to distinguish target RNA with single-base mismatched, three-base mismatched, and random sequences. Notably, the proposed electrochemical biosensor can be applied to analyze targets in complex circumstances containing 10% saliva, which implies its high stability and anti-interference.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of dysphonia, and its severity and extent, of voice fatigue and of dysphagia in non hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19 in Lombardy, the Italian region most hit by the first explosive outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 160 consecutive patients, with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by nasal swabs processed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, were gathered by means of telephone interviews performed by physicians in charge of daily follow-up. General and specific symptoms concerning voice and swallowing impairment were investigated. Dysphonia grade and duration were graded on 4-point scales, while voice fatigue was graded on a 5-point scale. RESULTS: Dysphonia was reported by 70 (43.7%) patients and was positively associated with voice fatigue (P < 0.001), cough (P = 0.005), rhinitis (P = 0.01), and dyspnea (P = 0.06); it was mild and/or moderate in 69 patients, but its duration was > 2 weeks in 33/70 (47.1%) patients and >1 month in 11/70 (15.7%). Grade and duration of dysphonia were positively associated with cough and rhinitis (all P values < 0.01).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of psychological interventions for treating co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders in older adults. METHOD The study was registered (PROSPERO CRD4201603834), databases systematically searched (MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Reviews) and articles screened according to PRISMA guidelines. INCLUSION Participants aged 60 years with clinically significant anxiety and depression, psychological intervention evaluated against control in randomised controlled trial, changes in both anxiety and depression reported at post-treatment. RESULTS Four studies were included (total n = 255, mean age range 67-71 years). Overall, psychological interventions (CBT, mindfulness) resulted in significant benefits over control conditions (active, waitlist) for treating depression in the presence of co-occurring anxiety (Hedges' g = -0.44), and treating anxiety in the presence of depression (Hedges' g = -0.55). However, conclusions are limited; the meta-analysis was non-significant, few studies were included, several were low quality and there was high heterogeneity between studies. Benefits at follow-up were not established. CONCLUSION Co-occurring anxiety and mood disorders can probably be treated simultaneously with psychological interventions in older adults with moderate effect sizes, however, more research is needed. Given comorbidity is common and associated with worse clinical outcomes, more high-quality clinical trials are needed that target the treatment of co-occurring anxiety and mood disorders, and report changes in diagnostic remission for both anxiety and mood disorders independently.

The limitations of the developed system, however, also reminds us that many challenges need to be addressed to improve the feasibility and quality of such systems, in particular in the understanding of semantic knowledge. ? 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","output":"Towards the Automatic Generation of Pedagogical Conversational Agents from Lecture Slides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is known to transmit in hospital settings, but the contribution of infections acquired in hospitals to the epidemic at a national scale is unknown. METHODS: We used comprehensive national English datasets to determine the number of COVID-19 patients with identified hospital-acquired infections (with symptom onset >7 days after admission and before discharge) in acute English hospitals up to August 2020. As patients may leave the hospital prior to detection of infection or have rapid symptom onset, we combined measures of the length of stay and the incubation period distribution to estimate how many hospital-acquired infections may have been missed. We used simulations to estimate the total number (identified and unidentified) of symptomatic hospital-acquired infections, as well as infections due to onward community transmission from missed hospital-acquired infections, to 31(st) July 2020. RESULTS: In our dataset of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in acute English hospitals with a recorded symptom onset date (n = 65,028), 7% were classified as hospital-acquired. We estimated that only 30% (range across weeks and 200 simulations: 20-41%) of symptomatic hospital-acquired infections would be identified, with up to 15% (mean, 95% range over 200 simulations: 14.1%-15.8%) of cases currently classified as community-acquired COVID-19 potentially linked to hospital transmission. We estimated that 26,600 (25,900 to 27,700) individuals acquired a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in an acute Trust in England before 31st July 2020, resulting in 15,900 (15,200-16,400) or 20.1% (19.2%-20.7%) of all identified hospitalised COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to hospitalised patients likely caused approximately a fifth of identified cases of hospitalised COVID-19 in the first wave in England, but less than 1% of all infections in England. Using time to symptom onset from admission for inpatients as a detection method likely misses a substantial proportion (>60%) of hospital-acquired infections.","output":"The contribution of hospital-acquired infections to the COVID-19 epidemic in England in the first half of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ultrafine particles (UFP; particulate matter <0.1 m diameter) emitted from motorized traffic may be highly detrimental to health. Active mobility (walking, bicycling) is increasingly encouraged as a way to reduce traffic congestion and increase physical activity levels. However, it has raised concerns of increased exposure to UFP, due to increased breathing rates in traffic microenvironments, immediately close to their source. The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) societal closures reduced commuting needs, allowing a natural experiment to estimate contributions from motorized traffic to UFP exposure while walking or bicycling. From late-March to mid-July 2020, UFP was repeatedly measured while walking or bicycling, capturing local COVID-19 closure (Phase 0) and subsequent phased re-opening (Phase 1, 2, 2.1 & 3). A DiSCmini continuously measured particle number concentration (PNC) in the walker/bicyclists breathing zone. PNC while walking or bicycling was compared across phased re-openings and the effect of ambient temperature, wind speed and direction, was determined using regression models. Approximately 40 repeated 20-minute walking and bicycling laps were made over 4 months during societal re-opening phases related to the COVID-19 pandemic, from late March to mid July 2020 in Copenhagen. Highest median PNC exposure of both walking (13,170 pt/cm3, standard deviation (SD): 3560 pt/cm3) and bicycling (21,477 pt/cm3, SD: 8964) was seen during societal closures (Phase 0) and decreased to 5,367 pt/cm3 (SD: 2949) and 8,714 pt/cm3 (SD: 4309) in Phase 3 of re-opening. These reductions in PNC were mainly explained by meteorological conditions, with most of the deviation explained by wind speed (14C22%) and temperature (13C10%). Highest PNC was observed along major roads and intersections. In conclusion, we observed decreases in UFP exposure while walking and bicycling during societal re-opening phases related to the COVID-19 pandemic, due largely to meteorological factors (e.g., wind speed and temperature) and seasonal variations in UFP levels.","output":"Exposure to ultrafine particles while walking or bicycling during COVID-19 closures: a repeated measures study in Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the whole world has been suffering under the Coronavirus Disease 2019 epidemic, the World Journal of Clinical Oncology (WJCO) was able to productively direct our efforts in the field through 2020.

In this retrospective study, we aimed to analyze the association of different coagulation parameters including that of D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) with severity in COVID-19 patients. Methodology A total of 90 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) were included in the study. The patients were categorized as severe and non-severe, and their D-dimer, fibrinogen, PT, and aPTT values on admission were evaluated. The association of the coagulation parameters with disease severity was analyzed by independent t-test and Chi-square test. The cut-off values of these parameters were calculated to predict the disease severity by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. Results Out of 90 patients admitted, 42 patients were categorized as severe and the rest 48 patients were categorized as non-severe. D-dimer, fibrinogen, and PT in the severe group were significantly higher than the non-severe group with p-values of <0.001, 0.005, and <0.001, respectively. Cut-off values of 0.99 mg/L for D-dimer,349.5 mg/dL for fibrinogen, and 13.05 seconds for PT were predictive of disease severity among COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Severe COVID-19 patients showed significantly higher levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen and prolongation of PT as compared to non-severe COVID-19 patients.

These conditions are also known as chronic diseases of long duration and generally slow progression. Physical activity (PA) is a main factor to delay symptoms and consequences of NCDs. In last decades, reduced physical exercise has been observed across all ages. Despite educational campaigns aimed at modifying unhealthy habits, it is difficult to promote healthy lifestyles in general population. Poor interest, lack of motivation, as well as career and family commitments hinder peoples participation in regular PA programs. In this study we propose a theoretical person-centred approach to actively involve general population in enhancing their opportunity to perform PA based on personalized needs and targets. METHODS: We defined four profiles of baseline PA levels (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, and active people) by referring to Metabolic equivalents (METs) based on individual answers to General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ). RESULTS: Based on the answers to the GPPAQ and by computing the related METs for each profile of baseline exercise levels, we developed an innovative person-centered web-based algorithm/function for enhancing and measuring PA participation in community settings. This function can compute evidence-based standardized profiles of participants, personalized goals of PA being functional to the purpose of maintaining or gaining health benefits, as well as the type and duration of PA needed to reach these goals. CONCLUSION: It might be speculated that this approach would be a reliable method for increasing peoples self-efficacy and population adherence to recommended levels of PA.

The asymptomatic case patient and the second index case patient with SARS in the 2003C2004 outbreak both worked in the same restaurant, where they served palm civets, which were found to carry SARS-associated coronaviruses. Epidemiological information and laboratory findings suggested that the findings for the patient with asymptomatic infection, together with the findings from previously reported serological analyses of handlers of wild animals and the 4 index case patients from the 2004 community outbreak, reflected a likely intermediate phase of animal-to-human transmission of infection, rather than a case of human-to-human transmission.

Several factors may contribute to this observation, including the effect of lockdown, social distancing, lower humidity, lower air pollution, and potential changes in the intrinsic pathogenicity of the virus. In this regard, the clinical severity of COVID-19 could be attenuated by mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome that decrease its virulence, as well as by lower virus inocula. Methods: In this pilot study, we compared the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification profile of 100 nasopharyngeal swabs consecutively collected in April, during the peak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, to that of 100 swabs collected using the same procedure in May. Results: The mean Ct value of positive samples collected in May was significantly higher than that of samples collected in the previous period (ORF 1a/b gene: 31.85  0.32 vs. 28.37  0.5, p<0.001; E gene: 33.76  0.38 vs. 29.79  0.63, p<0.001), suggesting a lower viral load at the time of sampling. No significant differences were observed between male and females in the two periods, whilst higher viral loads were found in (i) patients over 60-years old, and (ii) patients that experienced severe COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic.

We herein hypothesized that disruption of gut homeostasis during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may associate with early disease outcomes. To address this question, we took advantage of the Syrian hamster model. Our data confirmed that this model recapitulates some hallmark features of the human disease in the lungs. We further showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with mild intestinal inflammation, relative alteration in intestinal barrier property and liver inflammation and altered lipid metabolism. These changes occurred concomitantly with an alteration of the gut microbiota composition over the course of infection, notably characterized by a higher relative abundance of deleterious bacterial taxa such as Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae. Conversely, several members of the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families, including bacteria known to produce the fermentative products short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), had a reduced relative proportion compared to non-infected controls. Accordingly, infection led to a transient decrease in systemic SCFA amounts. SCFA supplementation during infection had no effect on clinical and inflammatory parameters. Lastly, a strong correlation between some gut microbiota taxa and clinical and inflammation indices of SARS-CoV-2 infection severity was evidenced. Collectively, alteration of the gut microbiota correlates with disease severity in hamsters making this experimental model valuable for the design of interventional, gut microbiota-targeted, approaches for the control of COVID-19.

Understanding the Ab memory responses to infection is one tool needed to effectively control the pandemic. Among 173 outpatients who had virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we evaluated serum Ab concentrations, microneutralization activity, and enumerated SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells in convalescent human blood specimens. Serum Ab concentrations were variable, allowing for stratification of the cohort into high and low responders. Neither participant sex, the timing of blood sampling following the onset of illness, nor the number of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific B cells correlated with serum Ab concentration. Serum Ab concentration was positively associated with microneutralization activity and participant age, with participants under the age of 30 showing the lowest Ab level. These data suggest that young adult outpatients did not generate as robust Ab memory, compared with older adults. Body mass index was also positively correlated with serum Ab levels. Multivariate analyses showed that participant age and body mass index were independently associated with Ab levels. These findings have direct implications for public health policy and current vaccine efforts.

Twelve patients each with brain metastases were immobilized using a thermoplastic mask and a surgical mask and only a thermoplastic mask. Two x-ray images were acquired to correct (XC) and verify (XV) the patient's position at a couch angle of 0. Subsequently, the XC and XV images were acquired at each planned couch angle for non-coplanar beams. When the position errors were detected after couch rotation for non-coplanar beams, the errors were corrected at each planned couch angle until a clinically acceptable tolerance was attained. The position errors in the translational and rotational directions (vertical, lateral, longitudinal, pitch, roll, and yaw) were retrospectively investigated using data from the ExacTrac system database. A standard deviation of XC translational and rotational position errors with and without a surgical mask in the lateral (1.52 vs 2.07 mm), longitudinal (1.59 vs 1.87 mm), vertical (1.00 vs 1.73 mm), pitch (0.99 vs 0.79), roll (1.24 vs 0.68), and yaw (1.58 vs 0.90) directions were observed at a couch angle of 0.

The affinity and selectivity of compounds to adenosine receptors have been assessed by radioligand binding studies. The synthesized compounds also showed good bronchospasmolytic properties (increased onset of bronchospasm; decreased duration of jerks) with 100% survival of animals in comparison to the standard drug. Besides, compound 8f & 9f showed good binding affinity in comparison to other synthesized compounds in the micromolar range. RESULTS: The maximum binding affinity of these compounds was observed for A2B receptors, which is ~ 7 or 10 times higher as compared to A1, A2A and A3 receptors.

Jointly, they fulfill a wide range of functions including the protection of the epithelial layer. In this study, we simultaneously analyzed the epithelial tissue and the secreted mucus response using a holistic interactome-based multi-omics approach. The effect of the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) skin mucosa to a dietary inclusion of spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) was evaluated. The epithelial skin microarrays-based transcriptome data showed 194 differentially expressed genes, meanwhile the exuded mucus proteome analysis 35 differentially synthesized proteins. Separately, the skin transcripteractome revealed an expression profile that favored biological mechanisms associated to gene expression, biogenesis, vesicle function, protein transport and localization to the membrane. Mucus proteome showed an enhanced protective role with putatively higher antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The integrated skin mucosa multi-interactome analysis evidenced the interrelationship and synergy between the metabolism and the exuded mucus functions improving specifically the tissue development, innate defenses, and environment recognition. Histologically, the skin increased in thickness and in number of mucous cells. A positive impact on animal performance, growth and feed efficiency was also registered. Collectively, the results suggest an intimate crosstalk between skin tissue and its exuded mucus in response to the nutritional stimulus (SDPP supplementation) that favors the stimulation of cell protein turnover and the activation of the exudation machinery in the skin mucosa. Thus, the multi-omics-based interactome analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the biological context of response that takes place in a mucosal tissue. In perspective, this strategy is applicable for evaluating the effect of any experimental variable on any mucosal tissue functionality, including the benefits this assessment may provide on the study of the mammalian mucosa.","output":"Skin Multi-Omics-Based Interactome Analysis: Integrating the Tissue and Mucus Exuded Layer for a Comprehensive Understanding of the Teleost Mucosa Functionality as Model of Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 56-year-old woman with high-grade neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma had known contact history of COVID-19 about 16 days prior to the restaging PET/CT.

We investigated policies for supporting the development of pediatric medical devices and approved cases in Japan and the United States by searching contents of websites of regulatory bodies and other related administrations, and scientific papers. We found the main six policies in Japan and nine main policies in the United States for the development of pediatric medical devices.

Our study revealed that there are similarities in initiatives by both countries. To promote further development of pediatric medical devices in the future, improvements to expediting the review process to approval by the regulatory body, global development, and implementation of alternative measures to ensure the efficacy and safety of the device instead of large-scale clinical trials should be anticipated through cooperation among industry, government, and academia.","output":"Comparison of supportive regulatory measures for pediatric medical device development in Japan and the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experiences are represented in the brain by patterns of neuronal activity. Ensembles of neurons representing experience undergo activity-dependent plasticity and are important for learning and recall. They are thus considered cellular engrams of memory. Yet, the cellular events that bias neurons to become part of a neuronal representation are largely unknown. In rodents, turnover of structural connectivity has been proposed to underlie the turnover of neuronal representations and also to be a cellular mechanism defining the time duration for which memories are stored in the hippocampus. If these hypotheses are true, structural dynamics of connectivity should be involved in the formation of neuronal representations and concurrently important for learning and recall. To tackle these questions, we used deep-brain 2-photon (2P) time-lapse imaging in transgenic mice in which neurons expressing the Immediate Early Gene (IEG) Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) could be permanently labeled during a specific time window. This enabled us to investigate the dynamics of excitatory synaptic connectivity-using dendritic spines as proxies-of hippocampal CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) pyramidal neurons (PNs) becoming part of neuronal representations exploiting Arc as an indicator of being part of neuronal representations. We discovered that neurons that will prospectively express Arc have slower turnover of synaptic connectivity, thus suggesting that synaptic stability prior to experience can bias neurons to become part of representations or possibly engrams. We also found a negative correlation between stability of structural synaptic connectivity and the ability to recall features of a hippocampal-dependent memory, which suggests that faster structural turnover in hippocampal CA1 might be functional for memory.","output":"Hippocampal neurons with stable excitatory connectivity become part of neuronal representations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, the number of corona patients is increasing significantly.

Recent work suggests that hospitalized patients with allergies/asthma are less likely to die of pulmonary infections and that there is a correlation between survival from acute respiratory distress syndrome and higher eosinophil counts; thus, we hypothesized that eosinophils associated with a type 2 immune response may protect against pneumonia-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, mice were treated with the type 2Cinitiating cytokine IL-33 intratracheally 3 days before induction of pneumonia with airway administration of a lethal dose of Staphylococcus aureus. Interestingly, IL-33 pretreatment promoted survival by inhibiting acute lung injury: amount of BAL fluid proinflammatory cytokines and pulmonary edema were both reduced, with an associated increase in oxygen saturation. Pulmonary neutrophilia was also reduced, whereas eosinophilia was strongly increased. This eosinophilia was key to protection; eosinophil reduction eliminated both IL-33Cmediated protection against mortality and inhibition of neutrophilia and pulmonary edema. Together, these data reveal a novel role for eosinophils in protection against lung injury and suggest that modulation of pulmonary type 2 immunity may represent a novel therapeutic strategy.","output":"IL-33Cmediated Eosinophilia Protects against Acute Lung Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spike glycoprotein attached to the envelope of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to and exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry receptor to infect pulmonary epithelial cells.

The application of strict lockdown measures disproportionately affected both cancer patient care as well as basic and translational cancer research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Italian Cancer Society (SIC) conducted a survey on the effect of lockdown on laboratories involved in cancer research in Italy. The survey was completed by 570 researchers at different stages of their career, working in cancer centers, research institutes and universities from 19 Italian regions. RESULTS: During the lockdown period, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency on face-to-face research activities was high, with a complete (47.7%) or partial (36.1%) shutdown of the laboratories. In the post-lockdown period, research activities were resumed in most of the respondents' institutions (80.4%), though with some restrictions (77.2%). COVID-19 testing was offered to research personnel only in ~50% of research institutions. Overall, the response to the pandemic was fragmented as in many cases institutions adopted different strategies often aimed at limiting possible infections without a clearly defined contingency plan. Nevertheless, research was able to provide the first answers and possible ways out of the pandemic, also with the contribution of many cancer researchers that sacrificed their research programs to help overcome the pandemic by offering their knowledge and technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Given the current persistence of an emergency situation in many European countries, a more adequate organization of research centers will be urgent and necessary to ensure the continuity of laboratory activities in a safe environment.","output":"COVID-19 epidemic strongly affected cancer research in Italy: a survey of the Italian Cancer Society (SIC)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The utility and risks to providers of performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation after in-hospital cardiac arrest in COVID-19 patients have been questioned. Additionally, there are discrepancies in reported COVID-19 in-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates. We describe outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation for in-hospital cardiac arrest in two COVID-19 patient cohorts. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, NY. PATIENTS: Those admitted with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, as well as between March 1, 2021, and May 31, 2021, who received resuscitation after in-hospital cardiac arrest. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 103 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who were resuscitated after in-hospital cardiac arrest in spring 2020, most self-identified as Hispanic/Latino or African American, 35 (34.0%) had return of spontaneous circulation for at least 20 minutes, and 15 (14.6%) survived to 30 days post-arrest. Compared with nonsurvivors, 30-day survivors experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest later (day 22 vs day 7; p = 0.008) and were more likely to have had an acute respiratory event preceding in-hospital cardiac arrest (93.3% vs 27.3%; p < 0.001). Among 30-day survivors, 11 (73.3%) survived to hospital discharge, at which point 8 (72.7%) had Cerebral Performance Category scores of 1 or 2. Among 26 COVID-19 patients resuscitated after in-hospital cardiac arrest in spring 2021, 15 (57.7%) had return of spontaneous circulation for at least 20 minutes, 3 (11.5%) survived to 30 days post in-hospital cardiac arrest, and 2 (7.7%) survived to hospital discharge, both with Cerebral Performance Category scores of 2 or less. Those who survived to 30 days post in-hospital cardiac arrest were younger (46.3 vs 67.8; p = 0.03), but otherwise there were no significant differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation after in-hospital cardiac arrest had low survival rates. Our findings additionally show return of spontaneous circulation rates in these patients may be impacted by hospital strain and that patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest preceded by acute respiratory events might be more likely to survive to 30 days, suggesting Advanced Cardiac Life Support efforts may be more successful in this subpopulation.","output":"In COVID-19 Patients Who Suffer In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Outcomes May Be Impacted by Arrest Etiology and Local Pandemic Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There were more than 800,000 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in the United States (U.S) by the end of 2021.

Clinical findings were recorded by one observer and MRI characteristics were recorded by two other observers who were unaware of clinical findings. A total of 31 patients were sampled, with 15 in the inflammatory lymphadenitis group and 16 in the neoplasia group. Patients with inflammatory lymphadenitis were more likely to be younger and present with lethargy (P = 0.001), pyrexia (P = 0.000), and neck pain (P = 0.006). Patients with inflammatory lymphadenitis were also more likely to have a leukocystosis (P = 0.02) and segmental neutrophilia (P = 0.001). Inflammatory masses were more likely to have moderate or marked MRI perinodal contrast enhancement (P = 0.021) and local muscle contrast enhancement (P = 0.03) whereas the neoplastic masses were more likely to have greater MRI width (P = 0.002) and height (P = 0.009). In conclusion, findings indicated that some clinical and MRI characteristics differed for dogs and cats with inflammatory vs. neoplastic medial retropharyngeal lymph node masses. Although histopathological or cytological diagnosis remains necessary for confirmation, these findings may help with the ranking of differential diagnoses of future cases.","output":"CLINICAL AND MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING FEATURES OF INFLAMMATORY VERSUS NEOPLASTIC MEDIAL RETROPHARYNGEAL LYMPH NODE MASS LESIONS IN DOGS AND CATS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir (RDV, Veklury(?)) is a once-daily, nucleoside ribonucleic acid polymerase inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 replication. Remdesivir has been granted approvals in several countries for use in adults and children hospitalized with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Inside the cell, remdesivir undergoes metabolic activation to form the intracellular active triphosphate metabolite, GS-443902 (detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells), and ultimately, the renally eliminated plasma metabolite GS-441524. This review discusses the pre-clinical pharmacology of RDV, clinical pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics/concentration-QT analysis, rationale for dose selection for treatment of patients with COVID-19, and drugCdrug interaction potential based on available in vitro and clinical data in healthy volunteers. Following single-dose intravenous administration over 2 h of an RDV solution formulation across the dose range of 3C225 mg in healthy participants, RDV and its metabolites (GS-704277and GS-441524) exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. Following multiple doses of RDV 150 mg once daily for 7 or 14 days, major metabolite GS-441524 accumulates approximately 1.9-fold in plasma. Based on pharmacokinetic bridging from animal data and available human data in healthy volunteers, the RDV clinical dose regimen of a 200-mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 100-mg maintenance doses for 4 or 9 days was selected for further evaluation of pharmacokinetics and safety. Results showed high intracellular concentrations of GS-443902 suggestive of efficient conversion from RDV into the triphosphate form, and further supporting this clinical dosing regimen for the treatment of COVID-19. Mathematical drugCdrug interaction liability predictions, based on in vitro and phase I data, suggest RDV has low potential for drugCdrug interactions, as the impact of inducers or inhibitors on RDV disposition is minimized by the parenteral route of administration and extensive extraction. Using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, RDV is not predicted to be a clinically significant inhibitor of drug-metabolizing enzymes or transporters in patients infected with COVID-19 at therapeutic RDV doses.

We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number R0 in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic scenarios. From the expression of R0 and the simulations we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented, the more effective they are in flattening the curve of infections. Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.","output":"A model for COVID-19 with isolation, quarantine and testing as control measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Today, endoscopic adrenalectomy has become a gold standard in endocrine surgery.

Various material specifications of DC are available in herbal markets, and DC is ingested by different edible methods. However, whether these specifications and edible methods are suitable or not remains unknown. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the suitability of four material specifications (fresh stem, dried stem, fengdou and powder) and three edible methods (making tea, soup and medicinal liquor) based on holistic polysaccharide marker (HPM), the major polysaccharide components in DC. First, the HPMs were extracted from the four specifications of DC by the three edible methods in different conditions. Second, qualitative and quantitative characterization of the extracted HPMs was performed using high performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC). Third, immunomodulatory activities of the extracted HPMs were evaluated in vivo. Results: The results showed that the HPMs were found to be quantitatively different from various specification of DC and edible methods. In vivo analysis indicated that the HPMs exerted positive effects on innate immune responses by increment in proliferation of splenocytes, secretion of IL-2 and cytotoxicity activity of NK cells. Moreover, the dosage amount of HPM should be defined as a certain range, but not the larger the better, for exerting strong immunological activities.

During health, oxygen is available in abundance; however, COVID-19 and many other forms of critical illness can damage the lungs and compromise systemic oxygen delivery. Cells that are very active cannot tolerate deficiencies in energy production that result from oxygen deprivation. Hypoxemia that lasts even a few minutes can turn a healthy person into a neurologically devastated patient for life, and when refractory it is often lethal. In this paper, we develop a way to administer oxygen gas to a patient through an intravenous line, replacing or supplementing the function of injured lungs. Here, we show that by coinfusing oxygen gas and a liquid solution through a series of sequential nozzles of decreasing size we are able to create bubbles of oxygen that are smaller than a single red blood cell on demand and in real time. These bubbles are coated with a membrane similar to that in every other cell in the body, which 1) prevents them from merging with other bubbles to create larger ones, 2) provides a path for oxygen to diffuse out and into the blood, and 3) minimizes the likelihood of material-related toxicities.

This benefit is probably mediated by a decrease in alveolar collapse and hyperinflation and a more homogeneous distribution of lung aeration, with fewer harms of mechanical ventilation. Herein we aimed to verify whether prone positioning causes analogue changes in lung aeration in COVID-2019. A positive result would support prone positioning even in this other population. MethodsFifteen mechanically-ventilated patients with COVID-19 underwent a lung computed tomography in the supine and prone position within three days of endotracheal intubation and with a constant positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Using quantitative analysis, we measured the volume of the non-aerated, poorly-aerated, well-aerated, and over-aerated compartments and the gas-to-tissue ratio of the ten vertical levels of the lung. In addition, we expressed the heterogeneity of lung aeration with the standardized median absolute deviation of the ten vertical gas-to-tissue ratios, with lower values indicating less heterogeneity. ResultsBy the time of the study, PEEP was 12 (10-14) cmH 2 O and the PaO 2 :FiO 2 107 (84-173) mmHg in the supine position. With prone positioning, the volume of the non-aerated compartment decreased by 82 (26-147) ml, of the poorly-aerated compartment increased by 82 (53-174) ml, of the normally-aerated compartment did not significantly change, and of the over-aerated compartment decreased by 28 (11-186) ml. In eight (53%) patients, the volume of the over-aerated compartment decreased more than the volume of the non-aerated compartment. The gas-to-tissue ratio of the ten vertical levels of the lung decreased by 0.34 (0.25-0.49) ml/g per level in the supine position and by 0.03 (-0.11-0.14) ml/g in the prone position (p<0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A previously reported engineered replication-competent PR8 strain carrying luciferase reporter gene (IAV-luc) and multiple pseudotyped IAV and SARS-CoV-2 virus was used. To specifically evaluate the pH change of vesicles containing IAV, we constructed an A549 cell line with endosomal and lysosomal expression of pHluorin2. RESULTS: Here, we identified azithromycin (AZ) as an effective inhibitor against multiple IAV and SARS-CoV-2 strains. We found that AZ treatment could potently inhibit IAV infection in vitro. Moreover, using pseudotyped virus model, AZ could also markedly block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in HEK293T-ACE2 and Caco2 cells. Mechanistic studies further revealed that such effect was independent of interferon signalling. AZ treatment neither impaired the binding and internalization of IAV virions, nor the viral replication, but rather inhibited the fusion between viral and vacuolar membranes. Using a NPC1-pHluorin2 reporter cell line, we confirmed that AZ treatment could alkalize the vesicles containing IAV virions, thereby preventing pH-dependent membrane fusion. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings demonstrate that AZ can exert broad-spectrum antiviral effects against IAV and SARS-CoV-2, and could be served as a potential clinical anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in emergency as well as a promising lead compound for the development of next-generation anti-IAV drugs.","output":"Direct inhibitory effect on viral entry of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 viruses by azithromycin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We demonstrate use of iteratively pruned deep learning model ensembles for detecting pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 with chest X-rays.

Electrification of smart cities is a very important step towards the above objective;therefore, accelerating the adoption and widening the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) are required. However, to achieve the full potential of EVs, ground-breaking detour computation and charging station selection schemes are needed. To this end, this paper developed a new scheme that finds the most suitable detour/route for an EV whenever an unexpected event occurs on the road. This scheme is based on A* and uses an original, Simple-Additive-Weighting (SAW)-based, charging station selection method. The performance evaluation carried out using the open-source traffic simulation platform SUMO under a grid map, as well as a real road network map highlighted that our scheme ensured more than 99% of EVs will reach their destination within a reasonable time even if a battery recharge is needed. This is a significant improvement compared to the baseline scheme that uses the A* only.","output":"An Efficient Detour Computation Scheme for Electric Vehicles to Support Smart Cities Electrification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveCoagulopathy in severe COVID-19 is common but poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts histone levels, fibrin structure, and endogenous thrombin potential in the presence and absence of endothelial cells. ApproachWe studied individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome at the time of initiation of mechanical ventilation compared to healthy controls. Blood samples were assayed for levels of histone-DNA complexes. Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate fibrin structure in clots formed from recalcified plasma samples using fluorescently-labeled fibrinogen. Endogenous thrombin potential was measured by calibrated automated thrombin assays in the presence of tissue factor and phospholipid (PCPS) or cultured human endothelial cells. ResultsCirculating nucleosomes were elevated in the plasma of COVID-19 patients relative to healthy controls (n=6, each group). COVID-19 patient plasma thrombin generation was also altered. Despite having an increased endogenous thrombin potential, patient plasma samples exhibited prolonged lag times and times to peak thrombin in the presence of added tissue factor and PCPS. Strikingly different results were observed when endothelial cells were used in place of tissue factor and PCPS. Control plasma samples did not generate measurable thrombin (lag time >60 min); in contrast, plasma samples from COVID-19+ patients generated thrombin (mean lag time [~]20 min). Consistent with the observed alterations in thrombin generation, clots from COVID-19 subjects exhibited a denser fibrin network, thinner fibers and lower fibrin resolvability. ConclusionsElevated histones, aberrant fibrin formation, and increased endothelial-dependent thrombin generation in COVID-19 may contribute to coagulopathy.

We hypothesised that directional stimulation of the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract would result in greater tremor improvement compared to sham programming, as well as comparable improvement as more tedious standard-of-care programming. METHODS: A prospective, blinded crossover trial was performed to assess the feasibility, safety and outcomes of programming based solely on dentato-rubro-thalamic tract anatomy. Using magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-tractography, the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract was identified and a connectivity-based treatment setting was derived by modelling a volume of tissue activated using directional current steering oriented towards the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract centre. A sham setting was created at approximately 180 opposite the connectivity-based treatment. Standard-of-care programming at 3 months was compared to connectivity-based treatment and sham settings that were blinded to the programmer. The primary outcome measure was percentage improvement in the Fahn-Tolosa-Marn tremor rating score compared to the preoperative baseline. RESULTS: Among the six patients, tremor rating scores differed significantly among the three experimental conditions (P=0.030). The mean tremor rating score improvement was greater with the connectivity-based treatment settings (64.6%  14.3%) than with sham (44.8%  18.6%; P=0.031) and standard-of-care programming (50.7%  19.2%; P=0.062). The distance between the centre of the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract and the volume of tissue activated inversely correlated with the percentage improvement in the tremor rating score (R2=0.24; P=0.04).

PARTICIPANTS Patients enrolled were 22 years of age or older with a diagnosis of bilateral cataract with planned removal by phacoemulsification with a clear corneal incision. METHODS Consented participants selected their preferred IOL, which was implanted sequentially into each eye of patients meeting eligibility criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The coprimary effectiveness outcomes were mean photopic monocular best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; 4 m) and distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA; 40 cm) at 6 months after surgery. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included mean monocular distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA; 66 cm) and proportion of participants responding \\"never\\" to question 1 of the Intraocular Lens Satisfaction questionnaire (regarding frequency of spectacle use in the past 7 days). Safety outcomes included frequency of \\"severe\\" and \\"most bothersome\\" visual disturbances. RESULTS Two hundred forty-three patients underwent cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of the TFNT00 (n = 129) or SN60AT (n = 114) and were followed up for 6 months. Noninferiority of TFNT00 to SN60AT in mean photopic monocular BCDVA (95% upper confidence limit of the difference was <0.1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] margin), and superiority in mean photopic monocular DCNVA (difference of 0.42 logMAR; P < 0.001) and DCIVA (difference of 0.26 logMAR; P < 0.001) were demonstrated.

Multiple predisposing factors (for example, pre-existing cognitive impairment) and precipitating factors (for example, urinary tract infection) for delirium have been described, with most patients having both types. Because multiple factors are implicated in the aetiology of delirium, there are likely several neurobiological processes that contribute to delirium pathogenesis, including neuroinflammation, brain vascular dysfunction, altered brain metabolism, neurotransmitter imbalance and impaired neuronal network connectivity. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) is the most commonly used diagnostic system upon which a reference standard diagnosis is made, although many other delirium screening tools have been developed given the impracticality of using the DSM-5 in many settings. Pharmacological treatments for delirium (such as antipsychotic drugs) are not effective, reflecting substantial gaps in our understanding of its pathophysiology. Currently, the best management strategies are multidomain interventions that focus on treating precipitating conditions, medication review, managing distress, mitigating complications and maintaining engagement to environmental issues. The effective implementation of delirium detection, treatment and prevention strategies remains a major challenge for health-care organizations globally.","output":"Delirium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption of routine gastroenterology practice which has resulted in the suspension of elective endoscopic procedures and outpatient consults. For the past months, the strategy was to mitigate infection risk for the healthcare team while still providing essential service to patients. A prolonged suspension of the outpatient clinics and endoscopy practice, however, is deemed unsustainable and could even be detrimental. It can compromise patient care and result in poor outcomes, hence a well-crafted plan is needed for the gradual resumption of clinic operations and endoscopic procedures. SUMMARY: As the world begins to transition to the \\"new normal\\", there are new health and safety issues to consider. Adaptive measures like telemedicine and electronic health records should be utilized to facilitate patient care while minimizing exposure. Careful patient screening, adequate supply of personal protective equipment, effective infection control policies, as well as appropriate administrative modifications, are needed for a safe return of gastroenterology practice. Key Messages: Ensuring the safety of patients, caregivers and healthcare workers should remain as the top priority. To help ease the transition as we move forward from this pandemic, we present a review of recommendations to guide gastroenterologists and endoscopy unit administrators in the gradual return to gastroenterology practice.","output":"Moving Forward: Gradual Return of Gastroenterology Practice during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elemental sulfur is intensively used to control weeds and rubber leaf diseases. However, the mechanisms contributing to elemental sulfur dissipation and decay (hereafter decay) in rubber agroforestry remains unclear. This study relates hydrological processes such as runoff and soil loss to the changes in soil total sulfur (Stot) and sulfate (S-SO4) in typical hillslope rubber agroforestry intercropped with cocoa in Xishuangbanna. The elemental sulfur decay kinetics were studied at two slopes (top and bottom) and three agrosystems (weed, no-weed and mixed). The results show that soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity was uniformly distributed in the experimental rubber agroforestry settings. Higher soil loss and runoff occurred in the bottom slope than the top slope, and in no-weed agrosystem than the herbaceous agrosystems (weed and mixed). The soil loss was mainly driven by runoff. Moreover, Stot and S-SO4 in runoff water were higher in weed agrosystem than no-weed agrosystems. Soil Stot best fit a two-compartments kinetics model, with lower kinetic rates in elemental sulfur applied treatments than in the no-added elemental sulfur treatments, particularly for the weed agrosystem. The soil Stot dissipation time 50% (DT50) was 10-14 times higher in top slope than bottom slope; but 4 and 20 times higher in mixed and no-weed agrosystems, respectively, compared to the weed agrosystem. The soil Stot and S-SO4 contents negatively correlated with soil microbial respiration (CO2 efflux), indicating an adverse influence of elemental sulfur on soil microbial activity. In short, elemental sulfur decay and its S-SO4 transformation depended on soil moisture, runoff, soil erosion and soil CO2, which are in turn affected by slope and agrosystem. This study not only clarifies the mechanisms of elemental sulfur dissipation and decay for its use as an environmental friendly agrochemical; but it also provides information to understand the contribution of runoff and soil loss on these mechanisms in rubber agroforestry.","output":"Decay and erosion-related transport of sulfur compounds in soils of rubber based agroforestry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Although both physical inactivity and poor sleep are deleteriously associated with mortality, the joint effects of these two behaviours remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the joint association of physical activity (PA) and sleep with all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks. METHODS 380 055 participants aged 55.9 (8.1) years (55% women) from the UK Biobank were included. Baseline PA levels were categorised as high, medium, low and no moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) based on current public health guidelines. We categorised sleep into healthy, intermediate and poor with an established composited sleep score of chronotype, sleep duration, insomnia, snoring and daytime sleepiness. We derived 12 PA-sleep combinations, accordingly. Mortality risks were ascertained to May 2020 for all-cause, total cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD subtypes (coronary heart disease, haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke), as well as total cancer and lung cancer. RESULTS After an average follow-up of 11.1 years, sleep scores showed dose-response associations with all-cause, total CVD and ischaemic stroke mortality. Compared with high PA-healthy sleep group (reference), the no MVPA-poor sleep group had the highest mortality risks for all-cause (HR (95% CIs), (1.57 (1.35 to 1.82)), total CVD (1.67 (1.27 to 2.19)), total cancer (1.45 (1.18 to 1.77)) and lung cancer (1.91 (1.30 to 2.81))). The deleterious associations of poor sleep with all outcomes, except for stroke, was amplified with lower PA. CONCLUSION The detrimental associations of poor sleep with all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks are exacerbated by low PA, suggesting likely synergistic effects. Our study supports the need to target both behaviours in research and clinical practice.","output":"Sleep and physical activity in relation to all-cause, cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality risk."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With indiscriminate geographic and socio-economic reach, COVID-19 has visited destruction of life and livelihoods on a largely unprepared world and can arguably be declared the new millenniums most trying test of state capacity. Governments are facing an urgent mandate to mobilize quickly and comprehensively in response, drawing not only on public resources and coordination capabilities but also on the cooperation and buy-in of civil society. Political and institutional legitimacy are crucial determinants of effective crisis management, and low-trust states lacking such legitimacy suffer a profound disadvantage. Social and economic crises attending the COVID-19 pandemic thus invite scholarly reflection about public attitudes, social leadership, and the role of social and institutional memory in the context of systemic disruption. This article examines Hong Kong as a case where failure to respond effectively could have been expected due to low levels of public trust and political legitimacy, but where, in fact, crisis response was unexpectedly successful. The case exposes underdevelopment in scholarly assumptions about the connections among political legitimacy, societal capacity, and crisis response capabilities. As such, this calls for a more nuanced understanding of how social behaviours and norms are structured and reproduced amidst existential uncertainties and policy ambiguities caused by sudden and convergent crises, and how these can themselves generate resources that bolster societal capacity in the fight against pandemics.","output":"Policymaking in a low-trust state: legitimacy, state capacity, and responses to COVID-19 in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study compares surgery volumes for fractures of the neck of the femur (FNF) and hip replacements during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with previous years.

Creating awareness and understanding patient concerns will play an important role in protecting this vulnerable group in developing timely and appropriate healthcare interventions. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 23(rd) March 2020 & 1(st) April 2020 among 154 liver transplant recipients, transplanted between October 2018 and February 2020. An 18-point questionnaire explored their knowledge of COVID-19, awareness of recipients high-risk status, interventions to minimize cross-infections and concerns of this patient group regarding the pandemic. RESULTS: There were 112 (73%) respondents, with median age of 53 years (81% males). There was no difference in demographics between those who responded (n=112), to those who did not respond to the survey (n=42). Most of the recipients were aware of the main symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever (92%), breathlessness (86%), dry cough (87%), but less than half were aware of diarrhea (39%) as a symptom. Awareness about spread from asymptomatic individuals was limited (26%). Majority (95%) understood their high-risk status, but worryingly 23% of the respondents felt that there was no risk in visiting the hospital for routine clinic visit and blood tests. Concerns were raised by the recipients mostly regarding the uncertainties of COVID-19 infection and its treatment options, the quality of information on social messaging platforms and lack of access to routine tests/immunosuppression levels due to lockdown/social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Our liver transplant recipients have a reasonable awareness regarding COVID-19. Problems in accessing the healthcare system during prolonged periods of lockdown was a major concern.

METHODS: A cross-sectional was study performed at 4 emergency departments of Puerto Rico's metropolitan area, between June 2014 and May 2015. We included children younger than 24 months, with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis, who were born and living in Puerto Rico at the time of recruitment. A physician-administered questionnaire inquiring about the patient's medical, family, and social history and a bronchiolitis severity assessment were performed. Daily weather conditions were monitored, and aeroallergens were collected with an air sample and precision weather station within the metropolitan area to evaluate environmental factors. RESULTS: We included 600 patients for 12 months. More than 50% of the recruited patients had a previous episode of bronchiolitis, of which 40% had been hospitalized. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 18.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2-36.5), male sex (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), history of asthma (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 3.6-22), allergic rhinitis (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.8-7.4), and smoke exposure by a caretaker (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4) were predictors of bronchiolitis episodes.

We provide ranges of reported and calculated effect estimates and pooled relative risks derived from a meta-analysis and meta-regression. RESULTS: Seventy-five studies were included in qualitative and 74 in quantitative synthesis, with study populations ranging from 19 to 44,672 COVID-19 cases. The risk of dying from COVID-19 was significantly associated with cerebrovascular [pooled relative risk (RR) 2.7 (95% CI 1.7C4.1)] and cardiovascular [RR 3.2 (CI 2.3C4.5)] diseases, hypertension [RR 2.6 (CI 2.0C3.4)], and renal disease [RR 2.5 (CI 1.8C3.4)], with high heterogeneity in pooled estimates, partly but not solely explained by age of study participants. For some comorbidities, our meta-regression showed a decrease in effect on the severity of disease with a higher median age of the study population. Compared to death, associations between several comorbidities and hospitalisation and ICU admission were less pronounced. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained robust estimates on the magnitude of risk for COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death associated with comorbidities, demographic, and behavioural risk factors and show that these estimates are modified by age of study participants.

In-hospital treatment addresses the multifaceted nature of the illness including initial viral replication, cytokine storm, and endothelial injury with thrombosis. We identified nine reports of early treatment outcomes in COVID-19 nursing home patients. Multi-drug therapy including hydroxychloroquine with one or more anti-infectives, corticosteroids, and antithrombotic anti-blood clotting agents can be extended to seniors in the nursing home setting without hospitalization. Data from nine studies found hydroxychloroquine-based multidrug regimens were associated with a statistically significant > 60% reduction in mortality. Going forward, we conclude that early empiric treatment for the elderly with COVID-19 in the nursing home setting (or similar congregated settings with elderly residents/patients e.g. LTF or ALF) has a reasonable probability of success and acceptable safety. This group remains our highest at-risk group and warrants acute treatment focus prior to symptoms worsening. Given the rapidity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes, in-center treatment of acute COVID-19 patients is a reasonable strategy to reduce the risks of hospitalization and death. If elderly high-risk patients in such congregated nursing home type settings are allowed to worsen with no early treatment, they may be too sick and fragile to benefit from in-hospital therapeutics and are at risk for pulmonary failure, life-ending micro-thrombi of the lungs, kidneys etc. The issue is timing of therapeutics, and we argue that early treatment before hospitalization, is the right time and can potentially save lives, especially among our higher-risk elderly populations hit hardest by severe illness and death from COVID-19. We must reiterate, we are talking about 'early' treatment before the disease is far along in the disease sequelae where the patient then needs hospitalization and aggressive interventions. We are referring to the initial days e.g. day one, post infection when symptoms emerge or there is strong clinical suspicion. This early therapeutic option deserves serious and urgent consideration by the medical establishment and respective decision-makers. Doctors must be allowed their clinical discretion in how they optimally treat their patients. Doctors must be brave and trust their skilled judgements and do all to save the lives of their patients. We therefore hypothesize that early outpatient ambulatory treatment, once initiated as soon as symptoms begin in high-risk positive persons, would significantly reduce hospitalizations and prevent deaths. Specifically, the provision of early multi-drug sequenced therapy with repurposed drugs will reduce hospitalization and death in elderly patients being cared for in long-term-care facilities. The most important implications of our hypothesis are: 1) hospitalizations and deaths would be reduced 2) transmission would be reduced due to the mitigation of symptoms and 3) recovery following infection and treatment provides for natural exposure immunity that is broad based, durable, and robust (helping towards natural immunity within the population). The end result is reduced strain on hospitals and systems that would allow for other non-COVID illnesses to receive care.","output":"Early multidrug treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and reduced mortality among nursing home (or outpatient/ambulatory) residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about the association between novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and type-1 diabetes in children.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Five hundred and ninety-three respondents attending the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP) participated in the survey from 9 to 13 June 2003. Associations between awareness of SARS symptoms and (i) first action to be taken and (ii) mode of transportation used, if the respondent was suspected of having SARS, were analysed using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Logistic regression was performed to adjust for relevant covariates. RESULTS The majority (92.7%) of the respondents were aware of SARS symptoms. Television (91.6%), newspaper (65.2%) and radio (30.4%) formed the top 3 sources of information on SARS. Slightly more than half (51.6%) of those who suspect themselves of having SARS would choose to visit their primary health care doctors, while 22.7% of the respondents would go to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). If they suspected themselves to have SARS, most (84.9%) of the 578 respondents would react appropriately by taking the SARS ambulance or driving themselves to TTSH. However, 60 respondents would nonetheless take public transport to TTSH [by taxi 8.5%, mass rapid transit (MRT) or bus 1.9%]. In particular, the retired with lower educational levels were likely to be oblivious both to the symptoms of SARS and the possible consequences of travelling by inappropriate transport.

The symptoms of COVID-19 are well known, and a range of treatments have been used to save lives. However, those who have recovered from COVID-19 may be struggling to mentally cope with what they have experienced physically. They may even develop signs and symptoms of an acute stress response, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A question we face in the coming months is how to help survivors of severe COVID-19 recover. Although patients with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, health care workers, and other people are showing signs of psychological problems related to the disease, survivors of previous diseases, health care workers, and front-line employees face a higher risk of infection and are more likely to be depressed, anxious, or even diagnosed with PTSD. Exposure, fear, isolation, loss of income, reduced autonomy, and the inability of health care professionals to cure coronavirus infections contribute to this increased stress. As everyone is vulnerable to COVID-19, providing mental health support will help people maintain their mental health and return to a heathy life more quickly.

Selecting only fit patients for these trials means less patients need to be recruited. Fit patients have a life expectancy of >three months. Performance status (PS) is used to measure life expectancy and is decided by doctors asking questions about patients activity levels. We created a Wellness Score using proteins in 55 patients blood samples. This score groups patients into those who were likely to die and those who were likely to be alive within six months of their blood sample. This score was more accurately able to predict a patients survival at six months than PS. We then reached the same conclusion in a further 77 patients. We hope this score can now be tested in an even larger group of patients. ABSTRACT: TARGET (tumour characterisation to guide experimental targeted therapy) is a cancer precision medicine programme focused on molecular characterisation of patients entering early phase clinical trials. Performance status (PS) measures a patients ability to perform a variety of activities. However, the quality of present algorithms to assess PS is limited and based on qualitative clinician assessment. Plasma samples from patients enrolled into TARGET were analysed using the mass spectrometry (MS) technique: sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH)-MS. SWATH-MS was used on a discovery cohort of 55 patients to differentiate patients into either a good or poor prognosis by creation of a Wellness Score (WS) that showed stronger prediction of overall survival (p = 0.000551) compared to PS (p = 0.001). WS was then tested against a validation cohort of 77 patients showing significant (p = 0.000451) prediction of overall survival. WS in both sets had receiver operating characteristic curve area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.76 (p = 0.002) and 0.67 (p = 0.011): AUC of PS was 0.70 (p = 0.117) and 0.55 (p = 0.548).

Recent detections of circulating serotype 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus in northern Nigeria (Borno and Sokoto states) and Pakistan (Balochistan Province) and serotype 1 wild poliovirus in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (Borno) represent public health emergencies that require aggressive response. METHODS. We demonstrate the importance of undervaccinated subpopulations, using an existing dynamic poliovirus transmission and oral poliovirus vaccine evolution model. We review the lessons learned during the polio endgame about the role of subpopulations in sustaining transmission, and we explore the implications of subpopulations for other vaccine-preventable disease eradication efforts. RESULTS. Relatively isolated subpopulations benefit little from high surrounding population immunity to transmission and will sustain transmission as long as they do not attain high vaccination coverage. Failing to reach such subpopulations with high coverage represents the root cause of polio eradication delays. Achieving and maintaining eradication requires addressing the weakest links, which includes immunizing populations in insecure areas and/or with disrupted or poor-performing health systems and managing the risks of individuals with primary immunodeficiencies who can excrete vaccine-derived poliovirus long-term. CONCLUSIONS. Eradication efforts for vaccine-preventable diseases need to create performance expectations for countries to immunize all people living within their borders and maintain high coverage with appropriate interventions.Keywords.

The survey evaluated the effect of COVID\\\\19 on the decisions, prescription patterns, appointments rescheduling, and healthcare delivery for psoriasis patients by dermatologists. The questionnaire was developed and validated with a reliability score >0.7. RESULTS: During the pandemic, most dermatologists delayed initiating biological/immunosuppressive therapy for psoriasis unless urgently needed by the patient. For patients already receiving biologics or immunosuppressive treatment, most dermatologists favored continuation of therapy. Almost half (44.2%) of participants do not perform SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 PCR screening before initiating biologics/immunosuppressive therapy. Dermatologists also reported an increased prescription of topical medications (79.2%), natural sunlight (28.4%), acitretin (26.9%), and home UVB (21.3%).

METHODS: a cross-sectional study utilizing a web-based survey was conducted in the period between 15 November 2020 and 22 December 2020. Depression, anxiety, and stress were determined using the 9-items patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scale, and the 22- item impact of event scale revised (IES-R), respectively. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine the predictors of mental health outcomes among HCWs. RESULTS: the proportions of the participants reporting symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were 12.4 (95%CI: 9.3C16.1), 14.2 (95%CI: 10.9C18.1), and 18.5% (95%CI: 14.8C22.7) respectively. Arabs had significantly more severe anxiety levels than non-Arabs (p = 0.031), HCWs with high COVID-19 risk perception experienced more severe mental health outcomes (p < 0.001). The multivariable logistic regression showed that high risk perception was independently associated with depression (adjusted OR 4.62, 95%CI: 2.00C10.68), anxiety (adjusted OR 4.90, 95%CI: 2.24C10.68), and stress (adjusted OR 3.067, 95%CI: 1.62C5.79) with p < 0.001.

Academic health centers rapidly deployed and leveraged telemedicine to permit uninterrupted care of patients. Telemedicine enjoys high patient satisfaction, yet little is known about the level of satisfaction during a crisis and to what extent patient- or visit-related factors and trust play when in-person visits are eliminated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine correlates of patients' satisfaction with a telemedicine visit. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study conducted in our single-institution, urban, academic medical center in Los Angeles, internal medicine patients aged &#8805;18 years who completed a telemedicine visit between March 10th and April 17th, 2020, were invited for a survey (n=1624). Measures included patient demographics, degree of interpersonal trust in patient-physician relationships (using the Trust in Physician Scale), and visit-related concerns. Statistical analysis used descriptive statistics, Spearman rank-order correlation, and linear and ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1624 telemedicine visits conducted during this period, 368 (22.7%) patients participated in the survey. Across the study, respondents were very satisfied (173/365, 47.4%) or satisfied (n=129, 35.3%) with their telemedicine visit. Higher physician trust was associated with higher patient satisfaction (Spearman correlation r=0.51, P<.001). Visit-related factors with statistically significant correlation with Trust in Physician score were technical issues with the telemedicine visit (r=-0.16), concerns about privacy (r=-0.19), concerns about cost (r=-0.23), satisfaction with telemedicine convenience (r=0.41), and amount of time spent (r=0.47; all P<.01). Visit-related factors associated with patients' satisfaction included fewer technical issues (P<.001), less concern about privacy (P<.001) or cost (P=.02), and successful face-to-face video (P<.001). The only patient variable with a significant positive association was income and level of trust in physician (r=0.18, P<.001). Younger age was associated with higher satisfaction with the telemedicine visit (P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: There have been calls for redesigning primary care after the COVID-19 pandemic and for the widespread adoption of telemedicine. Patients' satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic is high. Their satisfaction is shaped by the degree of trust in physician and visit-related factors more so than patient factors. This has widespread implications for outpatient practices and further research into visit-related factors and the patient-provider connection over telemedicine is needed.","output":"Patient Satisfaction and Trust in Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has impacted the psychological well-being of many people.

Among the 95 patients asked to return and receive medical attention, 20 were admitted and of those discharged, 3 reattended the ED within 15 days. At 15 days, no patient was deceased or received invasive ventilation; one admitted patient received non-invasive ventilation.

Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Ghana. This study aims to analyze routine surveillance data to assess possible effects on the malaria burden in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Northern Region of Ghana. MethodsMonthly routine data from the District Health Information Management System II (DHIMS2) of the Northern Region of Ghana were analyzed. Overall outpatient department visits and malaria incidence rates from the years 2015 to 2019 were compared to the corresponding data of the year 2020. ResultsCompared to the corresponding periods of the years 2015 to 2019, overall visits and malaria incidence in pediatric and adult outpatient departments in northern Ghana decreased in March and April 2020, when major movement and social restrictions were implemented in response to the pandemic. Incidence slightly rebounded afterwards in 2020 but stayed below the average of the previous years. Data from inpatient departments showed a similar but more pronounced trend when compared to outpatient departments. In pregnant women, however, malaria incidence in outpatient departments increased after the first COVID-19 wave. DiscussionThe findings from this study show that the COVID-19 pandemic affects the malaria burden in health facilities of Ghana, with declines in in- and outpatient rates. Pregnant women may experience reduced access to intermittent preventive malaria treatment and insecticide treated nets, resulting in subsequent higher malaria morbidity. Further data from other African countries, particularly on community-based studies, are needed to fully determine the impact of the pandemic on the malaria situation.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria burden in northern Ghana: Analysis of routine surveillance data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This is the first study on prognostication in an entire cohort of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the city of Hong Kong. Prognostic tool is essential in the contingency response for the next wave of outbreak. This study aims to develop prognostic models to predict COVID-19 patients clinical outcome on day 1 and day 5 of hospital admission. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of a complete cohort of 1037 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients in Hong Kong as of 30 April 2020, who were admitted to 16 public hospitals with their data sourced from an integrated electronic health records system. It covered demographic information, chronic disease(s) history, presenting symptoms as well as the worst clinical condition status, biomarkers readings and Ct value of PCR tests on Day-1 and Day-5 of admission. The study subjects were randomly split into training and testing datasets in a 8:2 ratio. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was used to classify the training data into three disease severity groups on Day-1 and Day-5. RESULTS: The 1037 patients had a mean age of 37.8 (SD  17.8), 53.8% of them were male. They were grouped under three disease outcome: 4.8% critical/serious, 46.8% stable and 48.4% satisfactory. Under the full models, 30 indicators on Day-1 and Day-5 were used to predict the patients disease outcome and achieved an accuracy rate of 92.3% and 99.5%. With a trade-off between practical application and predictive accuracy, the full models were reduced into simpler models with seven common specific predictors, including the worst clinical condition status (4-level), age group, and five biomarkers, namely, CRP, LDH, platelet, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and albumin/globulin ratio. Day-1 models accuracy rate, macro-/micro-averaged sensitivity and specificity were 91.3%, 84.9%/91.3% and 96.0%/95.7% respectively, as compared to 94.2%, 95.9%/94.2% and 97.8%/97.1% under Day-5 model. CONCLUSIONS: Both Day-1 and Day-5 models can accurately predict the disease severity. Relevant clinical management could be planned according to the predicted patients outcome.

This situation causes various problems, mainly while receiving health-care services. In planning the migrant health-care services, for the policy makers of host countries, health literacy level of migrants is an important measure. Determination of health literacy level of Syrian refugees in Turkey would be supportive for planning some interventions to increase health-care service utilization, as well as health education and health communication programs. An original health literacy scale for 18C60 years of age Turkish literate adults (Hacettepe University Health Literacy Scale-HLS) was developed to be used as a reference scale in 2018. Since it would be useful to compare the health literacy levels of Turkish adults with Syrian adult refugees living in Turkey with an originally developed scale, in this study, it was aimed to adapt the HLS-Short Form for Syrian refugees. METHODS: This methodological study was carried out between the years 2019C2020 in three provinces of Turkey where the majority of Syrians reside. The data was collected by pre-trained, Arabic speaking 12 interviewers and three supervisors via a questionnaire on household basis. At first, the original Scale and questionnaire were translated into Arabic and back translated into the original language. The questionnaire and the Scale were pre-tested among 30 Syrian refugees in Ankara province. A total of 1254 refugees were participated into the main part of the study; 47 health-worker participants were excluded from the validity-reliability analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed. Cronbachs alpha and SpearmanCBrown coefficients were calculated. RESULTS: Of the participants, 52.9% was male; 26.1% had secondary education level or less; almost half of them had moderate economic level; 27.5% could not speak Turkish. The Cronbachs Alpha was 0.75, SpearmanCBrown Coefficient was 0.76; RMSEA = 0.073, CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.92 and GFI = 0.95 for the Scale.

A According to the most recent advice from the Department of Education, the general rule is that an institution may disclose that a student has tested positive for COVID\\\\19 as long as it doesn't directly or indirectly identify the specific student The context for this limitation is that the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prohibits schools from disclosing personally identifiable information contained in a student's educational record, such as their health status, unless the situation involves an exception to the general restriction against public disclosure or when the parent or eligible student has provided written consent Institutions need to ensure that the information they provide cannot be combined with other available information that would reveal the identity of the student For instance, it is best to disclose only that a student in a particular residence hall tested positive, rather than state that a female student on the second floor of the residence hall tested positive Depending on the size of the residence hall, any additional details the institution provides could be used by other individuals to identify that student Therefore, higher ed administrators should manage each situation on a case\\\\by\\\\case basis Nonidentifying information may be provided to other students or parents, or to local health agencies that are tracking the disease Q What can an institution disclose if the student who tested positive for COVID\\\\19 was in very close contact with other students who may benefit from being notified? A Under the FERPA exception for health or safety emergency situations, educational institutions may disclose PII, such as health status contained in student education records, without prior written consent if sharing that information is necessary to protect the health or safety of a student or another individual (20 U S C  1232g(b)(1)(I);34 C F R  99 31(a)(10) and 99 36) Whether to release such PII is determined on a case\\\\by\\\\case basis after considering the totality of the circumstances The institution must be able to determine that an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or another individual exists and that specific parties need the PII to ensure the health or safety of a student or another individual (34 C F R  99 36(c)) Based on the information available at that time, an institution must be able to explain the threat and the significance of that threat For example, if a student\\\\wrestler tests positive, then other wrestlers who were in close physical contact with that student likely need to know so they can seek testing and/or medical care for themselves Institutions making such disclosures should reveal the minimum amount of information necessary In most cases, institutions should keep this information limited to the identity of the student testing positive and the window of time when others could have been exposed And such information should only be disclosed to parties who need to know for health and safety reasons, such as public health officials, law enforcement, trained medical personnel, and parents of at\\\\risk students (See 34 C F R  99 36 and the Department of Education's guidance at bit ly/3nktdF9 ) The institution must also make notations in the affected student's educational record regarding the basis for the disclosure and the parties who received the information (See 34 C F R  99 32(a)(5) ) Q When do institutions have a duty to disclose information for mandatory health\\\\reporting purposes? A States have different requirements for educational institutions regarding their obligations to report information about communicable diseases to public health agencies For example, in Washington state, schools are legally required to notify local public health authorities of suspected or confirmed cases of selected diseases or conditions, including COVID\\\\19 It's worth noting that FERPA, not the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, applies to student health records In fact, HIPAA's Privacy Rule expressly excludes information that is considered an education record under FERPA","output":"Understand how to protect student privacy, public health during pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND A failure to fully recover following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may have a profound impact on high functioning populations ranging from front-line emergency services to professional or amateur/recreational athletes.

METHODS 113 participants underwent cardiopulmonary functional tests at a mean 1597 days (~5 months) following acute illness; 27 hospitalized with persistent symptoms (hospitalized-symptomatic), 8 hospitalized and now recovered (hospitalized-recovered); 34 community managed with persistent symptoms (community-symptomatic); 18 community managed and now recovered (community-recovered), and 26 controls. RESULTS Hospitalized groups had the least favorable body composition (body mass, body mass index and waist circumference) compared to controls. Hospitalized-symptomatic and community-symptomatic individuals had a lower oxygen uptake (V?O2) at peak exercise (hospitalized-symptomatic, 29.95.0ml/kg/min; community-symptomatic, 34.47.2ml/kg/min; vs. control 43.93.1ml/kg/min, both p<0.001).

This study aimed to assess lifestyle changes affecting weight, sleep, mental health, physical activity, and dietary habits prospectively from before COVID-19 to during lockdown. METHODS: A total of 297 Saudi women, aged 19-30 years (mean age, 20.7  1.4 years), were interviewed at two time points, before and during the quarantine. The data collected included anthropometrics, sociodemographic data, clinical history, food frequency questionnaire responses, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores, Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) responses, and Perceived Stress Scale measures. In addition, during quarantine, COVID-19 and nutrition-related information and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores were collected. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the indicators of weight gain and loss from before COVID-19 (baseline) until during lockdown. RESULTS: Although approximately half of the participants did not report a weight change, 30% revealed weight loss and 18%, weight gain. The variables associated with increased weight gain were self-quarantine since COVID-19 started (OR: 5.17, 95% CI: 1.57-17.01, p = 0.007), age (OR: 1.53, 1.03-2.28, p = 0.04), and stress at baseline and during lockdown (OR: 1.15, 1.03-1.29, p = 0.01; OR: 1.10, 1.01-1.19, p = 0.03, respectively).

CONCLUSION: While most young Saudi women experienced no weight change during the COVID-19 lockdown, one-third lost weight and a significant proportion gained weight. Factors associated with weight, such as stress, sleep hours, physical activity, and coffee consumption, highlight the need to carefully consider those at risk during future circumstances that may require lockdowns. These factors could also aid in implementing policies for future lockdowns and support those most at risk of gaining weight.","output":"Lifestyle changes associated with COVID-19 quarantine among young Saudi women: A prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genus Zingiberaceae has been widely used for phytotherapeutic purposes in traditional medicine throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory activity.

Methods: 1092 participants (80.35.6y;66.5%women) from two Spanish cohorts were included. Telephone-based questionaries were used to evaluate health risk behaviours and lifestyle during lockdown and 7-months later. Self-reported physician-based diagnosis of chronic diseases was also reported. Cox-proportional models adjusted for main confounders were applied. Results: Improvements concerning lifestyle were found in older people with chronic diseases, although they worsened the physical component (except cancer). When they were compared to those without these diseases, hypertension was associated with a lower frequency of increased alcohol consumption (Hazard ratio:0.73[95% confidence interval:0.55;0.99]). Pulmonary diseases were associated with a lower risk of both decreased sedentary time (0.58[0.39;0.86]) and worsening sleep quality (0.56[0.36;0.87]), while CVD was only associated with a lower frequency of decreased sedentary time (0.58[0.38;0.88]). Depression was linked to a higher risk of increasing diet quality (1.53[1.00;2.36]). Cancer was less likely to worsen sleep quality (0.44[0.22;0.89]), but more likely to worsen their social contact frequency (2.05[1.05;3.99]). No significant association related to musculoskeletal diseases.

Participants with children <6 years were less likely to meet the WHO recommendation (OR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.33-0.78), while those with a higher level of education, good coping behaviour, regular alcohol consumption, and being satisfied with life were more likely to meet the WHO recommendation. In conclusion, PA intervention strategies tailored to specific vulnerable subgroups such as individuals with low educational background and parents with young children are needed in future pandemic response.","output":"Physical Activity during COVID-19 in German Adults: Analyses in the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring Study (COSMO)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Translational frameshifting is a ubiquitous, if rare, form of alternative decoding in which ribosomes spontaneously shift reading frames during translation elongation. In studying +1 frameshifting in Ty retrotransposons of the yeast S. cerevisiae, we previously showed that unusual P site tRNAs induce frameshifting. The frameshift-inducing tRNAs we show here are near-cognates for the P site codon. Their abnormal decoding induces frameshifting in either of two ways: weak codon-anticodon pairing allows the tRNA to disengage from the mRNA and slip +1, or an unusual codon-anticodon structure interferes with cognate in-frame decoding allowing out-of-frame decoding in the A site. We draw parallels between this mechanism and a proposed mechanism of frameshift suppression by mutant tRNAs.","output":"Near-cognate peptidyl-tRNAs promote +1 programmed translational frameshifting in yeast."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many popular disease transmission models have helped nations respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by informing decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of social distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. We compare five epidemiological models for forecasting and assessing the course of the pandemic. We compare how the models analyze case-recovery-death count data in India, the country with second highest reported case-counts in a world where a large proportion of infections remain undetected. A baseline curve-fitting model is introduced, in addition to three compartmental models: an extended SIR (eSIR) model, an expanded SEIR model developed to account for infectiousness of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases (SAPHIRE), another SEIR model to handle high false negative rate and symptom-based administration of tests (SEIR-fansy). A semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model developed at the Imperial College London (ICM) is also examined. Using COVID-19 data for India from March 15 to June 18 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from June 19 to July 18. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) and mean squared relative prediction error (MSRPE) for each of the five models. For active case counts, SEIR-fansy yields an SMAPE value of 0.72, and the eSIR model yields a value of 33.83. For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 1.76 for baseline model, 23.10 for eSIR, 2.07 for SAPHIRE and 3.20 for SEIR-fansy. For cumulative death counts, the SEIR-fansy model performs the best, with an SMAPE of 7.13, as compared to 26.30 for the eSIR model. Using Pearson correlation coefficient and Lin concordance correlation coefficient, for cumulative case counts, the baseline model exhibits highest correlation (both Pearson as well as Lin coefficients), while for cumulative death counts, projections from SEIR-fansy exhibit the best performance: For cumulative cases, correlation coefficients computed for the baseline model are 1 (Pearson) and 0.991 (Lin). For eSIR, those values are 0.985 (Pearson) and 0.316 (Lin). For SAPHIRE, we compute 1 (Pearson) and 0.975 (Lin). Finally, for SEIR-fansy we have those values at 1 (Pearson) and 0.965 (Lin). Similarly, for cumulative deaths, correlation coefficients computed for eSIR is 0.978 (Pearson) and 0.206 (Lin), and for SEIR-fansy we have those values at 0.999 (Pearson) and 0.742 (Lin). Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) counts as well. We compute underreporting factors on two specific dates (June 30 and July 10) and note that on both dates, the SEIR-fansy model reports the highest underreporting factor for active cases (June 30: 6.10 and July 10: 6.24) and cumulative deaths (June 30: 3.62 and July 10: 3.99) for both dates, while the SAPHIRE model reports the highest underreporting factor for cumulative cases (June 30: 27.79 and July 10: 26.74).","output":"A comparison of five epidemiological models for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accumulation of experience and advances in techniques and instruments have enabled surgeons to perform video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) safely for sublobar resection, including segmentectomy and wedge resection.

Pa-COVID-19 aims to provide comprehensive data on clinical course, pathophysiology, immunology and outcome of COVID-19, to identify prognostic biomarkers, clinical scores, and therapeutic targets for improved clinical management and preventive interventions. METHODS: Pa-COVID-19 is a prospective observational cohort study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated at Charit - Universit?tsmedizin Berlin. We collect data on epidemiology, demography, medical history, symptoms, clinical course, and pathogen testing and treatment. Systematic, serial blood sampling will allow deep molecular and immunological phenotyping, transcriptomic profiling, and comprehensive biobanking. Longitudinal data and sample collection during hospitalization will be supplemented by long-term follow-up. RESULTS: Outcome measures include the WHO clinical ordinal scale on day 15 and clinical, functional, and health-related quality-of-life assessments at discharge and during follow-up. We developed a scalable dataset to (i) suit national standards of care, (ii) facilitate comprehensive data collection in medical care facilities with varying resources, and (iii) allow for rapid implementation of interventional trials based on the standardized study design and data collection. We propose this scalable protocol as blueprint for harmonized data collection and deep phenotyping in COVID-19 in Germany. CONCLUSION: We established a basic platform for harmonized, scalable data collection, pathophysiological analysis, and deep phenotyping of COVID-19, which enables rapid generation of evidence for improved medical care and identification of candidate therapeutic and preventive strategies.

However, vaccine hesitancy is usually more prevalent in these patients. Investigation around modifiable contributors of vaccine hesitancy plays a pivotal role in the formulation of coping strategies. We aimed to evaluate the impact of vaccine misconception in patients with lung cancer or pulmonary ground-glass opacity (GGO). A web-based questionnaire was constructed based on a qualitative interview with 15 patients and reviewed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Six Likert five-scale questions were used to generate a score of vaccine misconception (SoVM), which ranged from 0 to 24 points, with a higher score indicating a higher level of misconception. A total of 61.6% (324/526) patients responded to our questionnaire. A higher proportion of low willingness patients (n = 173), compared to high willingness patients (n = 151), disagreed that cancer patients should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination (82.1% vs. 50.3%, p < .001) and perceived themselves to have contraindications (45.7% vs. 15.9%, p < .001). The mean SoVM was significantly lower in the high willingness group than the low willingness group (9.9 vs. 13.0, p < .001). Among the unvaccinated patients, the SoVM increased as the willingness to be vaccinated decreased (p < .0001). In multivariable logistic regression, patients with higher SoVM (OR 0.783, 95% CI 0.722C0.848), being female (OR 0.531, 95% CI 0.307C0.918) or diagnosed with lung cancer (OR 0.481, 95% CI 0.284C0.814) were independently associated with a lower willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

No proper vaccine for this infection has been introduced in the market in order to treat the infected people. Various approaches have been implemented recently to study the dynamics of this novel infection. Mathematical models are one of the effective tools in this regard to understand the transmission patterns of COVID-19. In the present paper, we formulate a fractional epidemic model in the Caputo sense with the consideration of quarantine, isolation, and environmental impacts to examine the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak. The fractional models are quite useful for understanding better the disease epidemics as well as capture the memory and nonlocality effects. First, we construct the model in ordinary differential equations and further consider the Caputo operator to formulate its fractional derivative. We present some of the necessary mathematical analysis for the fractional model. Furthermore, the model is fitted to the reported cases in Pakistan, one of the epicenters of COVID-19 in Asia. The estimated value of the important threshold parameter of the model, known as the basic reproduction number, is evaluated theoretically and numerically. Based on the real fitted parameters, we obtained [Formula: see text] . Finally, an efficient numerical scheme of AdamsCMoulton type is used in order to simulate the fractional model. The impact of some of the key model parameters on the disease dynamics and its elimination are shown graphically for various values of noninteger order of the Caputo derivative.

The women were randomly divided into two groups as tele-yoga training (n: 16) and the control group (n: 16). The tele-yoga training was performed on the Zoom software for 6 weeks, 2 times a week and 45 min a day. No intervention was made in the control group. Menstrual pain and symptoms by Menstrual Symptom Scale (MSS), quality of life by Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), depression levels by Beck Depression Scale (BDS), anxiety levels by State and Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI), body awareness by Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ), and self-esteem by Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) were determined. RESULTS: In the tele-yoga training group, statistically significant improvements were observed in the MSS total (p = 0.001), negative effects (p = 0.003), menstrual pain symptoms (p = 0.003), coping methods (p = 0.001) sub-parameters, BDS score (p = 0.000), NHP sleep (p = 0.021), energy (p = 0.002), emotional (p = 0.000), and isolation (p = 0.039) sub-parameters.

Therefore, rapid detection of mcr-1 gene presence in clinical samples is crucial. In this study, a Recombinase-aided amplification(RAA) method for mcr-1 was successfully constructed, with sensitivity of 20 copies/reaction. In addition, amplification signal could only be detected in the strain containing mcr-1 gene among 14 different bacterial species. The method was then used to test a total of 672 clinical samples from a pediatric hospital in Beijing. Five strains harbored mcr-1 genes were isolated from mcr-1-positive clinical samples and identified as Escherichia coli. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis showed that the five E. coli belonged to different ST types. Notably, the mcr-1 gene from the isolates could be transferred conjugately to the recipient strain E. coli J53, with highest transfer efficiency up to 57C58%, suggesting that the mcr-1 gene was located on the plasmid. These findings showed that the RAA assay has potential to be a rapid and sensitive mcr-1 gene screening test for clinical samples, and mcr-1 could be transmitted vertically and horizontally between and within bacterial species in a plasmid-mediated manner.","output":"Rapid Detection of Multi-Resistance Strains Carrying mcr-1 Gene Using Recombinase-Aided Amplification Directly on Clinical Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is the most common symptom of MS and has no effective pharmacotherapy.

In this paper, we use a modified epidemiological model which incorporates relationships between different populations to incorporate the impact of vaccine distribution and present results for different vaccine distribution strategies. We have presented how a sharing-based vaccine distribution strategy could be implemented in the face of the spread of the virus. The main finding of our work is that an effective vaccine distribution may differ depending upon the level of interactions among different population groups and a sharing-based vaccine distribution strategy is the most effective strategy. ? 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","output":"Distribution of Vaccines During a Pandemic (Covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global crisis profoundly affecting oncology care delivery. PURPOSE: This study will describe the occupational and personal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncologist well-being and patient care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four virtual focus groups were conducted with US ASCO member oncologists (September-November 2020). Inquiry and subsequent discussions centered on self-reported accounts of professional and personal COVID-19 experiences affecting well-being, and oncologist recommendations for well-being interventions that the cancer organization and professional societies (ASCO) might implement were explored. Qualitative interviews were analyzed using Framework Analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-five oncologists were interviewed: median age 44 years (range: 35-69 years), 52% female, 52% racial or ethnic minority, 76% medical oncologists, 64% married, and an average of 51.5 patients seen per week (range: 20-120). Five thematic consequences emerged: (1) impact of pre-COVID-19 burnout, (2) occupational or professional limitations and adaptations, (3) personal implications, (4) concern for the future of cancer care and the workforce, and (5) recommendations for physician well-being interventions. Underlying oncologist burnout exacerbated stressors associated with disruptions in care, education, research, financial practice health, and telemedicine. Many feared delays in cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Oncologists noted personal and familial stressors related to COVID-19 exposure fears and loss of social support. Many participants strongly considered working part-time or taking early retirement. Yet, opportunities arose to facilitate personal growth and rise above pandemic adversity, fostering greater resilience. Recommendations for organizational well-being interventions included psychologic or peer support resources, flexible time-off, and ASCO and state oncology societies involvement to develop care guidelines, well-being resources, and mental health advocacy. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected oncologist burnout, fulfillment, practice health, cancer care, and workforce. It illuminates where professional organizations could play a significant role in oncologist well-being.","output":"Occupational and Personal Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on US Oncologist Burnout and Well-Being: A Study From the ASCO Clinician Well-Being Task Force"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is associated with high mortality and extensive resource utilization. The aim of this study was to investigate prognostic factors and outcomes associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive MV who were hospitalized between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021 in the intensive care units (ICUs) of three referral hospitals belonging to a single health system. Data were extracted from electronic health records. PMV was defined as > 17 days of MV. RESULTS: Of 355 patients studied, 86 (24%) required PMV. PMV patients had lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, higher PCO(2), and higher plateau and driving pressures during the first 2 weeks of MV than their short MV (SMV; ? 17 days) counterparts. PMV patients received more proning, neuromuscular blockade, and tracheostomy, had longer ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and required discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility more frequently (all p < 0.001). Overall 30-day mortality was 43.9%, with no statistically significant difference between PMV and SMV groups. In PMV patients, smoking, Charlson comorbidity index > 6, and week 2 PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 150 and plateau pressure ? 30 were positively associated with 30-day mortality. In a multivariate model, results were directionally consistent with the univariate analysis but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: PMV is commonly required in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure. Despite the higher need for critical care interventions and LOS, more than half of the PMV cohort survived to hospital discharge. Higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, lower plateau pressure, and fewer comorbidities appear to be associated with survival in this group.","output":"Prognostic factors and outcomes in COVID-19 patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced a re-design of care in radiation oncology.

However, these are even more important for them to adhere to due to their increased levels of vulnerability, particularly to COVID-19. With a lack of previous evidence, we explored the understanding and changes in adherence to COVID-19 public health restrictions over time in people living with dementia (PLWD). METHODS: Unpaid carers and PLWD were interviewed over the phone in April 2020, shortly after the nationwide UK lockdown, with a proportion followed up from 24th June to 10th July. Participants were recruited via social care and third sector organisations across the UK, and via social media. FINDINGS: A total of 70 interviews (50 baseline, 20 follow-up) were completed with unpaid carers and PLWD. Five themes emerged: Confusion and limited comprehension; Frustration and burden; Putting oneself in danger; Adherence to restrictions in wider society; (Un) changed perceptions. Most carers reported limited to no understanding of the public health measures in PLWD, causing distress and frustration for both the carer and the PLWD. Due to the lack of understanding, some PLWD put themselves in dangerous situations without adhering to the restrictions. PLWD with cognitive capacity who participated understood the measures and adhered to these. DISCUSSION: In light of the new second wave of the pandemic, public health measures need to be simpler for PLWD to avoid unwilful non-adherence. Society also needs to be more adaptive to the needs of people with cognitive disabilities more widely, as blanket rules cause distress to the lives of those affected by dementia.","output":"The potential dangers of not understanding COVID-19 public health restrictions in dementia: \\"It's a groundhog day - every single day she does not understand why she can't go out for a walk\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to investigate the direct and indirect - mediated through insomnia - effect of coronavirus anxiety on exhaustion, from the perspective of Hobfoll's theory of conservation of resources (COR). According to the COR theory, critical events (e.g., the coronavirus epidemic) make people fearful of losing their valuable resources. A prolonged state of anxiety may lead to sleeping troubles, which over time results in an increase in exhaustion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected from 440 Polish healthcare providers, including nurses and midwives, doctors, paramedics, medical assistance workers, and wardens. Three measures were used: the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (the sleeping trouble subscale) and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (the exhaustion subscale). Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The obtained results fully support the hypotheses. Both the direct and indirect relationships between coronavirus anxiety and exhaustion were observed. Specifically, high coronavirus anxiety increased insomnia, which in turn contributed to the development of exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the COR theory. Prolonged coronavirus anxiety and sleeping problems depleted healthcare providers' resources and made them feel exhausted. Exhaustion among these workers can have serious consequences not only for themselves but also for the health of their patients. Therefore, research into effective ways to deal with coronavirus anxiety is needed.","output":"Coronavirus anxiety and exhaustion among Polish front-line healthcare workers - the mediation effect of insomnia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Positive strand RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells and induce intracellular membranous compartments harboring the sites of viral RNA synthesis.

Recent advances in conventional and electron microscopy have contributed greatly to our understanding of their biogenesis, but still many questions remain how viral proteins capture membranes and subvert host factors for their need. In this review, we will discuss different representatives of positive strand RNA viruses and their ways of hijacking cellular membranes to establish replication complexes.

METHODS: The performance of a viral metagenomic protocol in a clinical setting for the identification of novel coronaviruses was tested using clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, in combination with databases generated to contain only viruses of before the discovery dates of these coronaviruses, to mimic virus discovery. RESULTS: Classification of NGS reads using Centrifuge and Genome Detective resulted in assignment of the reads to the closest relatives of the emerging coronaviruses. Low nucleotide and amino acid identity (81% and 84%, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2) in combination with up to 98% genome coverage were indicative for a related, novel coronavirus.

METHODS: Subjects were recruited from several nursing homes and communities in Changchun, China. They were divided into a healthy control group (n=64) and an MCI group (n=62). All subjects were administered the VSP and a series of neuropsychological examinations. The study determined the optimal cutoff, discriminating validity, concurrent validity, and retest reliability of the VSP. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to evaluate the discriminating validity and obtain the optimal cutoff values. Pearson correlation analysis and the intraclass correlation coefficient were used to evaluate the concurrent validity and retest reliability, respectively. RESULTS: A cutoff score of 46.4 was optimal for the entire sample, yielding a sensitivity of 85.9% and specificity of 79.0% for differentiating individuals with MCI and healthy controls, and the AUC was 0.870 (95% CI 0.799-0.924). The median index of VSP score was 51.1 (range 42.6-60.0). There was a moderate positive correlation between the VSP total score and Mini-Mental State Examination score (r=0.429, P<.001). There was a strong positive correlation between VSP total score and Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (r=0.645, P<.001). The retest reliability of the VSP was feasible (r=0.588, P=.048). CONCLUSIONS: The VSP is interesting and feasible for subjects. It shows high sensitivity and specificity for the identification of MCI in older adults, which makes it a promising screening method. The VSP may be generalized to older adults in other countries, although some cultural adaptation may be necessary.

Dentists were facing significant levels of psychological distress prior to the pandemic, so it was important to monitor dentists' mental health during this unprecedented challenge. Aims To gain both an understanding of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has been having on the mental health of dentists working in Wales, as well as understanding the levels of stress the pandemic has caused. We also aimed to understand the specific causes of stress. Results High levels of stress were found, with 82% of respondents saying stress levels in the dental team have increased noticeably. Three-quarters of respondents have gone to work despite not feeling mentally well enough. Working conditions and financial pressures caused by the pandemic have directly impacted the mental health of many dentists. As a result, they have been using both adaptive and maladaptive coping methods to cope with the stress of the pandemic, with over one-third of respondents drinking alcohol more frequently than before the pandemic. Conclusions The pandemic has had a profound impact on the professional lives of dentists working in Wales. Their interactions with patients and colleagues have been greatly affected, as well as their work and working conditions. These have all substantially contributed to increased stress levels. Without significant improvements to the working conditions of dentists, as well as continued psychological support, large-scale burnout in the future is not only possible, but likely.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of dentists in Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The e-learning platform gains significant attraction in the current scenario due to the outbreak of the epidemic COVID-19 as e-learning ensures the students continue their studies in the safest environment while maintaining the educational standard.

It is of interest in the cancer context because of the impact of treatments on quality of life and cancer survivorship. This work aims to document current practice, barriers and challenges to implementing prehabilitation to inform the development of a national framework. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was applied: an on-line survey was sent to stakeholders in cancer care across Scotland, supplemented by in-depth interviews. Key domains explored were the perceived importance of prehabilitation, availability, delivery and content of services, outcome measures, referral processes and funding. FINDINGS: A total of 295 survey responses were obtained and 11 interviews completed. Perceived importance of prehabilitation was rated highly. There was uncertainty over the definition of prehabilitation and most respondents did not know if local services were available. Where services were described, a range of health professionals were involved, different outcome measures were utilised and frequency of referrals varied. Respondents highlighted short time frames between referral and treatment, concerns about patient engagement, the evidence base for action and funding priorities. Respondents also commented on which context a referral should be made and to whom, and the need for equity of service across the country. CONCLUSIONS: The current work found clear evidence of the perceived importance of prehabilitation in cancer patients. However, issues and key gaps were identified within current services (including issues arising from COVID-19) which must be addressed to enable wide-spread development and implementation of equitable programmes.","output":"Prehabilitation services for people diagnosed with cancer in Scotland - Current practice, barriers and challenges to implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":" Coronaviruses take the lead in gastrointestinal pathologies of animals and are spread all around the world. Causative agents of coronaviruses belong to Nidovirales order, Coronaviridae family which includes 2 subfamilies: Toroviridna (genera Torovirus and Bafinivirus) and Coronaviridna (genera Alphavirus, Betavirus, Gammavirus). Dividing of the latter by genera (groups I-III) was based on serological cross-reactions. Group I includes pathogens causing diseases in animals, such as swine coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus. Group II includes pathogens of veterinary importance, such as BCoV, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, horse coronavirus, viruses infecting mice and rats, as well as human coronaviruses that cause respiratory damage. Group III includes at the moment only avian coronaviruses. Coronavirus got its name in 1968 because of its special structure and appearance C it has spikes which resemble solar corona. In humans, coronavirus was first isolated by D. Tyrrell and M. Bynoe in 1965 from a patient with acute respiratory disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, and then Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 made specialists significantly increase the level of epidemic danger of coronaviruses. Due to its high virulence, virus multiplication rate in macrophages, pathogen replication, and antibody production increase significantly. At the end of 2019, coronavirus strain 2019-nCoV of Betacoronavirus genus was found in patients with pneumonia in China, and by early 2020 it spread all around the world. In animals, coronavirus leads to damage to mucous membranes. The amount of economic damage associated with disease caused by coronavirus is significant and includes death of animals, decreased meat and dairy productivity, decreased weight gain, culling, loss from abortion and infertility. In this regard, a demand arose for developing project of a device for express analysis for Coronaviridae antigen for the early diagnosis of coronaviruses. Based on the express analysis technique using solid-phase immunochromatographic medium, a project for express analysis for Coronaviridae antigen based on Omron industrial programmable logic controller was developed; it includes process chart for equipment, functional diagram and logical equations.","output":"Project design of a device for express analysis for Coronaviridae antigens based on Omron industrial programmable logic controller"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nafamostat, a serine proteinase inhibitor with various actions including antithrombin, antiplasmin, and antitrypsin effects, has been used in clinical practice to treat disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and pancreatitis.

Cross-sectional articles on dental practitioners perceptions towards teledentistry published between March 2020 and September 2021 were searched in ten online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, EMBASE, SIGLE, EBSCO, LILACS, and Open Grey). The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool was employed to analyse the risk of bias (RoB) of each article, whereas the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine recommendation tool was used to evaluate the level of evidence. Data were analysed using the DerSimonianCLaird random effect model based on a single-arm approach. Results: Six studies were included and demonstrated Level 3 evidence. A single-arm meta-analysis revealed that dental practitioners had a high level of awareness (70.4%) and attitude (72.5%) towards teledentistry during the COVID-19 pandemic, but their knowledge level (57.9%) was moderate with a poor practice level (35.8%). A substantial heterogeneity was observed with the overall I2 ranging from 90.78% to 98.21%. Furthermore, meta-regression indicated that the sample size of each study had a significant (p < 0.05) impact on the degree of data heterogeneity. Conclusions: Despite their high degree of awareness and attitude, dental practitioners demonstrated moderate knowledge and relatively poor practice of teledentistry during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is a rare phenomenon in prepubertal children and is most typically found in women of childbearing age. The classic presentation consists of headaches, nausea, vomiting, and visual changes; however, children present more atypically. We report a case of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in an otherwise healthy, 4-year-old child with atypical symptoms resembling those of cyclic vomiting syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-year-old Caucasian, otherwise healthy, male child presented to our emergency department with episodic intermittent early-morning vomiting occurring once every 1C3 weeks without interepisodic symptoms, starting 10 months prior. With outpatient metabolic, autoimmune, endocrine, allergy, and gastroenterology work-up all unremarkable, he was initially diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Discovery of mild optic nerve sheath distension on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain 10 months after symptom onset led to inpatient admission and a lumbar puncture notable for an opening pressure of 47 mmHg, with normal cell count and protein levels. He had no changes in visual acuity or optic disc edema on dilated fundoscopic examination. The patient was started on acetazolamide, with resolution of episodic emesis at his last follow-up visit 12 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension presents atypically in prepubescent children, with about one-fourth presenting asymptomatically, and only 13C52% presenting with classic symptoms. With a prevalence of only 0.6C0.7 per 100,000, much remains unknown regarding the underlying pathophysiology in this demographic. Cyclic vomiting syndrome, however, has a much higher prevalence in this age group, with a prevalence of 0.4C1.9 per 100. It is thought to be an idiopathic, periodic disorder of childhood, often linked to neurological conditions such as abdominal migraines, epilepsy, mitochondrial disorders, and structural lesions such as chiari malformation and posterior fossa tumors. While cyclic vomiting syndrome is thought to have a benign course, untreated idiopathic intracranial hypertension can have long-term detrimental effects, such as visual loss or even blindness. We present a case of idiopathic intracranial hypertension presenting with symptoms resembling cyclic vomiting syndrome in a 4-year-old child, diagnosed 10 months after initial onset of symptoms. We aim to demonstrate the need for a high level of clinical suspicion and the need for further investigation into underlying pathophysiology in this vulnerable population.","output":"Atypical idiopathic intracranial hypertension presenting as cyclic vomiting syndrome: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: It is not known whether nursing homes with private equity (PE) ownership have performed better or worse than other nursing homes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Objective: To evaluate the comparative performance of PE-owned nursing homes on COVID-19 outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study of 11a?470 US nursing homes used the Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File from May 17, 2020, to July 2, 2020, to compare outcomes of PE-owned nursing homes with for-profit, nonprofit, and government-owned homes, adjusting for facility characteristics. Exposure: Nursing home ownership status. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths and deaths by any cause per 1000 residents; possessing 1-week supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE); staffing shortages. Results: Of 11a?470 nursing homes, 7793 (67.9%) were for-profit; 2523 (22.0%), nonprofit; 511 (5.3%), government-owned; and 543 (4.7%), PE-owned; with mean (SD) COVID-19 cases per 1000 residents of 88.3 [2.1], 67.0 [3.8], 39.8 [7.6] and 110.8 [8.1], respectively. Mean (SD) COVID-19 deaths per 1000 residents were 61.9 [1.6], 66.4 [3.0], 56.2 [7.3], and 78.9 [5.9], respectively; mean deaths by any cause per 1000 residents were 78.1 [1.3], 91.5 [2.2], 67.6 [4.5], and 87.9 [4.8], respectively. In adjusted analyses, government-owned homes had 35.5 (95% CI, -69.2 to -1.8; P = .03) fewer COVID-19 cases per 1000 residents than PE-owned nursing homes. Cases in PE-owned nursing homes were not statistically different compared with for-profit and nonprofit facilities; nor were there statistically significant differences in COVID-19 deaths or deaths by any cause between PE-owned nursing homes and for-profit, nonprofit, and government-owned facilities. For-profit, nonprofit, and government-owned nursing homes were 10.5% (9.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.8 to 16.3 percentage points; P = .006), 15.0% (13.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.5 to 20.6 percentage points; P < .001), and 17.0% (14.8 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.5 to 23.0 percentage points; P < .001), respectively, more likely to have at least a 1-week supply of N95 masks than PE-owned nursing homes. They were 24.3% (21.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 11.8 to 30.8 percentage points; P < .001), 30.7% (27.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 17.7 to 36.2 percentage points; P < .001), and 29.2% (25.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 16.1 to 35.3 percentage points; P < .001) more likely to have a 1-week supply of medical gowns than PE-owned nursing homes.

However, reports of its use and subsequent fatal arrhythmias in patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have raised concern regarding its cardiovascular (CV) safety. Therefore, we examined the relationship between HCQ use and corrected QT (QTc) length in SLE and RA patients without clinical CV disease (CVD). METHODS: SLE patients from the Columbia University Lupus Cohort registry (n = 352) and two RA cohorts (n = 178; ESCAPE-RA and RHYTHM-RA) with electrocardiograms (ECGs) collected as part of study data were analyzed. RA cohort participants were recruited from tertiary referral centers with additional referrals from community rheumatologists, while SLE subjects originated from the Columbia University Lupus Cohort. All patients met American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for SLE or RA and lacked known CVD. The exposure of interest was HCQ use and main outcome measure was QTc length [continuous or categorical ( 440 ms and  500 ms)]. RESULTS: Of the combined SLE and RA cohorts (n = 530), 70% were HCQ users and 44% had a QTc  440 ms. The adjusted mean QTc length was comparable between HCQ users vs non-users (438 ms vs 437 ms). In multivariable logistic models, HCQ use was not a significant predictor of a QTc  440 ms for the entire cohort (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.48C1.23; p = 0.27). Importantly, a QTc  500 ms was inversely associated with HCQ use and not associated with arrhythmias or deaths. A significant interaction was found between HCQ use and use of anti-psychotics. Ultimately, the use of HCQ combined with any QTc prolonging medication as a group was associated with a QTc length (434 ms; 95% CI 430, 439) which was comparable to that of use of HCQ alone (433 ms; 95% CI 429-437). CONCLUSION: In a combined cohort of SLE and RA patients without clinical CVD, adjusted QTc length was comparable between HCQ and non-HCQ users, supporting its CV safety in patients with rheumatic diseases.

Clinical efficacy and adverse drug reactions were observed and compared between the two groups. Blood samples were collected for lymphocyte (NK cell and T cell subsets) levels by flow cytometry, and sputum samples were collected for cytokine (IL-2, IFN-, IL-4 and TNF-) levels by ELISA. RESULTS: Two groups showed no statistically significant difference in sputum culture-negative conversion rate, chest lesion absorption rate, and cavity closure rate (P>0.05) after 6 months of treatment. However, after 12 months, the sputum culture-negative conversion rate, chest lesion absorption rate, and cavity closure rate in the T1 group increased compared with the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). There was a significant increase in CD3+, CD4+, NK-cells lymphocytes after six months in the T1 group than in the control group, whereas the CD8+, Th17, Treg lymphocytes in the T1 group were substantially lower than in the control group, with the differences showing statistical significance (P<0.05, respectively).

Among patients with malignant diseases, those with hematologic neoplasms are at a higher risk for poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to register treatment modifications associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and their short-term consequences in Latin America. METHODS: Multicenter, prospective, observational, cohort study including patients older than 14 years from 14 centers in four countries (Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, and Panama) who had a confirmed diagnosis of acute leukemia, and who were undergoing active treatment since the first COVID-19 case in each country until the cutoff on July 15, 2020. RESULTS: We recruited 635 patients. Treatment modifications because of the COVID-19 pandemic were reported in 40.8% of cases. The main reason for such modifications was logistic issues (55.0%) and the most frequent modification was chemotherapy delay (42.0%). A total of 13.1% patients developed COVID-19 disease, with a mortality of 37.7%. Several factors were identified as independently associated with mortality, including a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (odds ratio 2.38 [95% CI, 1.47 to 3.84]; P < .001), while the use of telemedicine was identified as a protective factor (odds ratio 0.36 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.82]; P = .014).

This emerging health crisis calls for the urgent development of specific therapeutics against COVID-19 to potentially reduce the burden of this emerging pandemic. PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the anti-viral efficacy of natural bioactive entities against COVID-19 via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. METHODS: A library of 27 caffeic-acid derivatives was screened against 5 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 by using Molegro Virtual Docker 7 to obtain the binding energies and interactions between compounds and SARS-CoV-2 proteins. ADME properties and toxicity profiles were investigated via www.swissadme.ch web tools and Toxtree respectively. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to determine the stability of the lead-protein interactions. RESULTS: Our obtained results has uncovered khainaoside C, 6-O-Caffeoylarbutin, khainaoside B, khainaoside C and vitexfolin A as potent modulators of COVID-19 possessing more binding energies than nelfinavir against COVID-19 Mpro, Nsp15, SARS-CoV-2 spike S2 subunit, spike open state and closed state structure respectively. While Calceolarioside B was identified as pan inhibitor, showing strong molecular interactions with all proteins except SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein closed state. The results are supported by 20 ns molecular dynamics simulations of the best complexes.

To determine the best processing method of licorice postharvest, we investigated the interaction of increasing aridity between the endophytic microorganisms and the accumulation of metabolites. Samples from the roots of licorice growing along an aridity gradient during the natural drying process were collected, and the metabolic components, the content of the main active substances and the dynamic changes of the endophytic microbial community were assessed. The glycyrrhizic acid and liquiritin contents decreased slightly or remained flat during natural drying, whereas those of liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin increased slightly. Moreover, the Shannon index of endophytic microbial diversity of licorice was the highest in the fresh period and showed a downward trend during the drying process. When the licorice were fresh, Cladosporiaceae and Burkholderiaceae were the dominant family present, but after drying, Nectriaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were the dominant families. A similar trend was also found in which the differential metabolites of licorice were reduced during natural drying. Furthermore, correlation analysis between dominant families and differential metabolites showed that there was a correlation between the two. Therefore, fresh processing is an effective drying method to ensure the quality of licorice. This study revealed the relationship of endophytic microbiota and changes in the licorice metabolites during different stages of drying, which provided a scientific basis for the drying method of licorice.","output":"Dynamic Changes in Endophytic Microorganisms and Metabolites During Natural Drying of Licorice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More studies have shown the neurological manifestations of the novel corona virus (COVID-19) and have inferred the molecular mechanism by which it invades the nervous system.

Like SARS CoV-1, SARS CoV-2 enters host cells via its spike protein, which attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As SARS CoV-1 spike protein is reported to induce cytokine production, we hypothesized that this pathway could be a shared mechanism underlying pathogenic immune responses. We herein compared the capabilities of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 spike proteins to induce cytokine expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We observed that only specific commercial lots of SARS CoV-2 induce cytokine production. Surprisingly, recombinant SARS CoV-2 spike proteins from different vendors and batches exhibited different patterns of cytokine induction, and these activities were not inhibited by blockade of spike protein-ACE2 binding using either soluble ACE2 or neutralizing anti-S1 antibody. Moreover, commercial spike protein reagents contained varying levels of endotoxin, which correlated directly with their abilities to induce cytokine production. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibitor, polymyxin B, blocked this cytokine induction activity. In addition, SARS CoV-2 spike protein avidly bound soluble LPS in vitro, rendering it a cytokine inducer. These results not only suggest caution in monitoring the purity of SARS CoV-2 spike protein reagents, but they indicate the possibility that interactions of SARS CoV-2 spike protein with LPS from commensal bacteria in virally infected mucosal tissues could promote pathogenic inflammatory cytokine production.","output":"Variable Induction of Pro-inflammatory Cytokines by Commercial SARS CoV-2 Spike Protein Reagents: Potential Impacts of LPS on In Vitro Modeling and Pathogenic Mechanisms In Vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) efficacy of baicalin (BA) is mediated by HBV-related hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs).

Furthermore, the substantial inhibitory effects of BAA1 on HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV RNA, and HBV DNA were assessed in HB-infected cells and mice. Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation, and transcriptomics analysis further revealed that the enhanced anti-HBV efficacy of BAA1 was attributed to the interaction between hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs) and estrogen receptors (ERs).

With the adoption of the Marrakesh Agreement, the scope of the multilateral trade regime expanded. However, such expansion was pointedly selective. While business and corporate interests were protected through the incorporation of traditionally nontrade subjects, such as intellectual property and investment, labour and development issues were sidelined. In reality, the operative rules of the WTO are not only inconsistent with the standard justifications for trade liberalization but also with the organization's own stated goals. As a result, many came to view the WTO as an agent of neoliberalism spearheading the diversion of the wealth of nations into the wealth of corporations.

Along their evolutionary history, they adapted to tolerate hypoxia, high salinity, low temperature and, in particular, to tolerate conditions of high hydrostatic pressure. To understand the limits of the capacity of lice to survive during host deep dives, we conducted a series of controlled experiments in the laboratory. We collected lice from elephant seals and submitted the different life stages to high pressure conditions. Lice were first exposed to one of four hydrostatic pressures: (a) 30 Kg/cm2; (b) 80 Kg/cm2; (c) 150 Kg/cm2, or (d) 200 Kg/cm2 They were then exposed a second time to higher or lower hydrostatic pressure conditions to test for the impact of the first experience, which could either be deleterious or trigger physiological adaption, allowing them a better tolerance to high pressure. We found that lice from elephant seals can tolerate hydrostatic pressures higher than 200 Kg/cm2 (close to 200 atm), equivalent to 2000 m depth. Adults exhibited lower recovery times than nymphs after immersion at high hydrostatic pressure. Our findings show that lice developed unique adaptations to endure extreme marine conditions.

The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions standard measureany tobacco product use in the past 30 daysconsiders neither frequency of use nor product risk implications. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how nicotine product use, including frequency of use, and its associated risks have changed among middle school and high school students since 1999. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data from the 1999-2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey, an in-school survey of a nationally representative sample of students in grades 6 through 12; each survey recruited between 15 000 and 36 000 participants. EXPOSURES: Nicotine product use in the past 30 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Use of nicotine products assessed by nicotine product days (NPDs), the number of days that the average student consumed these products in the past 30 days. Risk-adjusted NPDs account for differential long-term health risks of various products. RESULTS: This study included 16 years of cross-sectional survey data. Each survey recruited between 15 000 and 36 000 participants in grades 6 through 12 (male students: mean, 50.4% [minimum, 48.5%; maximum, 58.4%]; mean age, 14.5 years [minimum, 14.0 years; maximum, 14.7 years]). Nationally representative cross-sectional data for high school students showed that NPDs decreased steadily from 5.6 days per month in 1999 (95% CI, 5.0-6.2 days per month) to 2.2 days per month in 2017 (95% CI, 1.9-2.6 days per month), increased to 4.6 days per month in 2019 (95% CI, 4.1-5.1 days per month), and then decreased to 3.6 days per month in 2020 (95% CI, 3.0-4.1 days per month). For a risk weight of 0.1 for e-cigarettes, compared with combustible products, risk-adjusted NPDs decreased from 2.5 days per month in 2013 (95% CI, 2.2-2.9 days per month) (prior to the popularity of e-cigarettes) to 2.0 days per month in 2019 (95% CI, 1.6-2.5 days per month) and 1.4 days per month in 2020 (95% CI, 1.0-1.8 days per month). However, with a risk weight of 1.0 for e-cigarettes (identical to that of combustible products), risk-adjusted NPDs increased to 5.3 days per month in 2019 (95% CI, 4.4-6.2 days per month) and 3.9 days per month in 2020 (95% CI, 3.1-4.7 days per month). Similar trends were found for middle school students. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that NPDs represent an improvement, albeit an imperfect one, compared with any 30-day tobacco product use by incorporating the frequency of use of various products. By distinguishing products, NPDs permit consideration of the health consequences associated with different mixes of products over time. Health risks of adolescent nicotine product use could have decreased during vapings popularity if assessment of the long-term risks associated with vaping compared with those of smoking is low. There is a need to closely monitor youth nicotine and tobacco product use patterns.","output":"Trends in Nicotine Product Use Among US Adolescents, 1999-2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Health care workers (HCWs) have high infection risk owing to treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, research on their infection risk and clinical characteristics is limited. Objectives: To explore infection risk and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 and to discuss possible prevention measures. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center case series included 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Data were collected from January 1 to February 9, 2020. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Exposure, epidemiological, and demographic information was collected by a structured questionnaire. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic information was collected from electronic medical records. A total of 335 medical staff were randomly sampled to estimate the prevalence of subclinical infection among a high-risk, asymptomatic population. Samples from surfaces in health care settings were also collected. Results: Overall, 110 of 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital tested positive for COVID-19, with an infection rate of 1.1%. Of them, 70 (71.8%) were women, and they had a median (interquartile range) age of 36.5 (30.0-47.0) years. Seventeen (15.5%) worked in fever clinics or wards, indicating an infection rate of 0.5% (17 of 3110) among first-line HCWs. A total of 93 of 6574 non-first-line HCWs (1.4%) were infected. Non-first-line nurses younger than 45 years were more likely to be infected compared with first-line physicians aged 45 years or older (incident rate ratio, 16.1; 95% CI, 7.1-36.3; P < .001). The prevalence of subclinical infection was 0.74% (1 of 135) among asymptomatic first-line HCWs and 1.0% (2 of 200) among non-first-line HCWs. No environmental surfaces tested positive. Overall, 93 of 110 HCWs (84.5%) with COVID-19 had nonsevere disease, while 1 (0.9%) died. The 5 most common symptoms were fever (67 [60.9%]), myalgia or fatigue (66 [60.0%]), cough (62 [56.4%]), sore throat (55 [50.0%]), and muscle ache (50 [45.5%]). Contact with indexed patients (65 [59.1%]) and colleagues with infection (12 [10.9%]) as well as community-acquired infection (14 [12.7%]) were the main routes of exposure for HCWs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series, most infections among HCWs occurred during the early stage of disease outbreak. That non-first-line HCWs had a higher infection rate than first-line HCWs differed from observation of previous viral disease epidemics. Rapid identification of staff with potential infection and routine screening among asymptomatic staff could help protect HCWs.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) Infection Among Health Care Workers and Implications for Prevention Measures in a Tertiary Hospital in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many seismologists all over the world have noted a sharp (up to 30C50%) decrease in the daily background seismic noise during the period from March to May, 2020 (Lecocq et al., Science 369(6509):1338C1343, 2020).

Although increases in children's SD and snack intake were almost unanimously reported by both children and their parents, increased frequency of cooking at home and preparation of healthier meals were also described. Key reasons for children's higher SD and snack intake were having unlimited access to SDs and snacks and experiencing boredom while at home. Parents also explained that the pandemic impacted their oversight of the child's SD intake, as many parents described loosening prior restrictions on their child's SD intake and/or allowing their child more autonomy to make their own dietary choices during the pandemic.

For reconstruction of the gastrointestinal passage, two stomach preserving PD variants exist: pylorus preservation (ppPD), or pylorus resection (prPD) with preservation of the stomach. In pancreatic surgery, delayed gastric emptying (DGE) remains a serious complication after PD with an incidence varying between 4.5% and 45%, potentially delaying hospital discharge or further treatment, e.g. adjuvant chemotherapy. Evidence is lacking to assess which variant of PD entails fewer postoperative DGE. Methods and analysis The protocol of a large-scale, multicentre, pragmatic, two-arm parallel-group, registry-based randomised controlled trial (rRCT) using a two-stage group-sequential design is presented. This patient-blind rRCT aims to demonstrate the superiority of prPD over ppPD with respect to the overall incidence of DGE within 30 days after index surgery in a German real-world setting. A total of 984 adults undergoing elective PD for any indication will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be recruited at about 30 hospitals being members of the StuDoQ|Pancreas registry established by the German Society of General and Visceral Surgery (DGAV). The postoperative follow-up for each patient will be 30 days. The primary analysis will follow an intention-to-treat approach and applies a binary logistic random intercepts model. Secondary perioperative outcomes include overall severe morbidity (Clavien-Dindo classification), blood loss, 30-day all-cause mortality, postoperative hospital stay, and operation time.

We aimed to investigate whether M-ATRIA-RS was an independent predictor of mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and compare its discrimination capability with CHADS, CHA2DS2-VASc, and modified CHA2DS2-VASc (mCHA2DS2-VASc)-RS. A total of 1,001 patients were retrospectively analyzed and classified into three groups based on M-ATRIA-RS, designed by changing sex criteria of ATRIA-RS from female to male: Group 1 for points 0-1 (n=448), Group 2 for points 2-4 (n=268), and Group 3 for points 5 (n=285). Clinical outcomes were defined as in-hospital mortality, need for high-flow oxygen and/or intubation, and admission to intensive care unit. As the M-ATRIA-RS increased, adverse clinical outcomes significantly increased (Group 1, 6.5%; Group 2, 15.3%; Group 3, 34.4%; p <0.001 mortality for in-hospital). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that M-ATRIA-RS, malignancy, troponin increase, and lactate dehydrogenase were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality (p<0.001, per scale possibility rate for ATRIA-RS 1.2). In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the discriminative ability of M-ATRIA-RS was superior to mCHA2DS2-VASc-RS and ATRIA-RS, but similar to that Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score (AUC(M-ATRIA) vs AUC(ATRIA) Z-test=3.14 p=0.002, AUC(M-ATRIA)vs. AUC(mCHA2DS2-VASc) Z-test=2.14, p=0.03; AUC(M-ATRIA)vs. AUC(CCI) Z-test=1.46 p=0.14). M-ATRIA-RS is useful to predict in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In addition, it is superior to the mCHA2DS2-VASc-RS in predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19 and is more easily calculable than the CCI score.","output":"Evaluation of Modified ATRIA Risk Score in Predicting Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms including increased depressive, anxiety and chronic fatigue-syndrome (CFS)-like and physiosomatic symptoms. AIMS: To delineate the associations between affective and CFS-like symptoms in COVID-19 and chest computed tomography scan anomalies (CCTAs), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), albumin, calcium, magnesium, soluble angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and soluble advanced glycation products (sRAGEs). METHOD: The above biomarkers were assessed in 60 COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls who had measurements of the Hamilton Depression (HDRS) and Anxiety (HAM-A) and the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue (FF) Rating Scales. RESULTS: Partial Least Squares-SEM analysis showed that reliable latent vectors could be extracted from a) key depressive and anxiety and physiosomatic symptoms (the physio-affective or PA-core), b) IL-6, IL-10, CRP, albumin, calcium, and sRAGEs (the immune response core); and c) different CCTAs (including ground glass opacities, consolidation, and crazy paving) and lowered SpO(2)% (lung lesions). PLS showed that 70.0% of the variance in the PA-core was explained by the regression on the immune response and lung lesions latent vectors. One common infection-immune-inflammatory (III) core underpins pneumonia-associated CCTAs, lowered SpO(2) and immune activation, and this III core explains 70% of the variance in the PA core, and a relevant part of the variance in melancholia, insomnia, and neurocognitive symptoms. DISCUSSION: Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is accompanied by lung lesions and lowered SpO(2) which may cause activated immune-inflammatory pathways, which mediate the effects of the former on the PA-core and other neuropsychiatric symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Intersections between pneumonia, lowered oxygen saturation percentage and immune activation mediate depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue syndrome-like symptoms due to COVID-19: A nomothetic network approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article explores child well\\\\being in Danish early childhood education and care (ECEC) during the time of COVID\\\\19.

Methods: For the preparation of this review article, all the relevant information was gathered from accessible and inaccessible resources (Web, Books, Thesis, etc.). Results: It has been accepted worldwide that the uses of herbal products provide stronger immunity which helps to fight against these microbial species. SARSCoV2 virus is now a pandemic, affecting many countries around the globe. This long series of herbal species may interfere with the target-specific proteins named S Protein, S protein- ACE-2 interaction, Helicase protein, N Protein, 3CLpr, PL pro to prevent the viral replication in the host. Traditional herbal medicine not only inhibits the virus attachment to the host body but also prevents replication and boosts up the host immune system. Natural remedies reduce the viral load and, in such conditions, the immunity becomes stronger, and so the patient can recover soon.

This study aimed to investigate the stress and burnout levels of psychiatrists working in MH services in Turkey and determine the relationship between stress, workload, and support during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS An online questionnaire was sent to child and adult psychiatrists registered with Turkish professional mail groups. 217 psychiatrists replied, with equal numbers from child (n=108) and adult (n=109) MH services. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and study-specific questionnaire were used. RESULTS 60.8% of psychiatrists (n=132) experienced medium-or high-intensity work-related burnout, 49.8% (n=108) experienced patient-related burnout, and 31.8% (n=69) experienced medium-or high-intensity personal burnout. Patient-related burnout scores were significantly higher in the child psychiatry group than in the adult psychiatry group. The majority (n=126, 58.1%) reported either moderate or higher stress levels linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Turnover intention, reluctance to retrain in psychiatry and sense of lack of value in the job are all associated with higher levels of burnout. CONCLUSIONS The current COVID-19 pandemic is likely to bring additional stressors to psychiatrists. This study shows that psychiatrists in Turkey already exhibit high levels of work-related stress.

The study was based on a sample of individuals aged 50+ from wave 7, wave 8 and Covid-19 add-on of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) between 2017-2020. The sample size consisted of 4429 respondents from Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. In order to assess the effects of factors associated with the first wave of Covid-19 predicting an increase in the intensity of loneliness symptoms, a multivariate binary logistic regression was used, including several health determinants in the model. The results indicated that in Latvia, the main predictive factors for the increase in the intensity of loneliness, by the adjustment for other factors, were increased nervousness (OR 44.39; 95%CI 41.06-48.00) and interrupted or reduced contact with children (OR 1.82; 95%CI 1.76-1.88). In Lithuania, the main predictors for the increase in the intensity of loneliness were high levels of nervousness (OR 6.80; 95%CI 6.56-7.04), deterioration of health (OR 2.51; 95%CI 2.44-2.59) and limited daily activity due to health conditions (OR 2.11; 95%CI 2.05-2.18). In Estonia, the most relevant predictive factors for the increase in the intensity of loneliness were financial difficulties (OR 5.65; 95%CI 4.76-6.71), interrupted or reduced contact with parents (OR 5.42; 95%CI 4.38-6.71), increased nervousness (OR 4.15; 95%CI 3.50-4.92) and limited daily activity due to health (adjusted OR 7.75; 95%CI 6.60-9.11). A relationship between an increase in the intensity of loneliness was mainly related to increased nervousness during the first wave of Covid-19 in all Baltic states.

Methods In a collaboration between the Vienna Social Fund (FSW) and the AI-biotech company Symptoma we report symptom frequencies based on the COVID-19 chatbot of the city government of Vienna and corresponding PCR-test results. Chatbot users answered 13 yes/no questions about symptoms and provided information about age and sex. Subsequently a medically trained professional came to their address to take a sample and PCR results were obtained. Findings Between November 2 and January 5, a total of 3011 persons experiencing flu-like symptoms had a PCR-test by a medical professional at home and completed the chatbot session prior to the test, 816 (27.1%) of them were COVID-19 positive. We compared the symptom frequencies between COVID-19 positive and negative users, and between male and female users. The symptoms (sorted by frequency) of users with positive PCR-test are malaise (81.1%), fatigue (72.9%), headache (64.1%), cough (57.7%), fever (50.7%), sore throat (40.7%), close contact with COVID-19 cases (34.9%), rhinorrhea (31.0%), sneezing (28.4%), dysgeusia (27.1%), hyposmia (26.5%), dyspnea (11.4%) and diarrhea (10.9%).

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated comprehensive but incomplete data monitoring provide a strong reason to estimate the number of unreported cases. AIM: The aim of this paper is to present a simple mathematical model that allows early estimation of the number of unregistered cases (underreporting). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prevalences of reported infections in different age groups are combined with additional assumptions on relative contact rates. From this, a corrected prevalence is derived for each age group, which can then be used to estimate the number of unreported cases. RESULTS: Our model derives for Germany in mid-April 2020 about 2.8 times more total infections than registered cases. For Italy, the model results in a factor of 8.3. The case mortalities derived from this are 0.98% for Germany and 1.51% for Italy, which are much closer together than the case mortalities of 2.7% and 12.6% derived purely from the number of reports available at that time. CONCLUSION: The number of unreported SARS-CoV-2-infected cases derived from the model can largely explain the difference in observations in case mortalities and of conditions in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and Italy. The model is simple, fast, and robust to implement, and can respond well when the reporting numbers are not representative of the population in terms of age structure. We suggest considering this model for efficient and early estimations of unreported case numbers in future epidemics and pandemics.","output":"Ein mathematisches Modell zur Sch?tzung der Dunkelziffer von SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen in der Frhphase der Pandemie am Beispiel Deutschland und Italien"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To measure anti-HAV antibodies 15 years after a single dose of live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine in Indian children.

In our hospital we decided to maintain adjuvant and early line treatments for metastatic disease in patients under 65 and without specific comorbidities and to apply a shared decision approach in other patients while following closely the safety of these treatments. Method(s): Real time safety monitoring was proposed to all patients treated for solid tumours in our day-care unit starting March 1st, 2020. After signing informed consent patients were asked questions concerning protective measures at home, signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation. Patients' charts were reviewed for outcome, including death, after suspected or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Minimum follow-up was 5 weeks after day care unit attendance. Result(s): 387 patients were included in our registry between March 1st and March 31st, 2020. Median age was 64 years-old (range 27-90). Most patients suffered from lung (n=96), breast (n=93), gastrointestinal (n=87), gynaecological (n=38) or urological (n=33) cancers. 131 patients received (neo)adjuvant treatments, 256 patients were treated for metastatic disease. Patients received chemotherapy (n=170), immunotherapy (n=103), targeted therapy (n=68) or other combinations (n=46). Although Belgium had one of the highest infection rates in the world, safety data concerning risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes were rather reassuring. A total of 11 patients had either suspected (n=5, 1.3%) or proven (n=6, 1.6%) SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only one 74 years old patient died of COVID-19, another 51 years old patient died of progressive disease but presented also suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of death. Conclusion(s): Analysis of our data for patients treated in March 2020 in the day-care unit are reassuring and suggest higher risk related to under-treatment compared to risk related to continuation of systemic therapy at time of COVID-19 outbreak. Patients' follow-up will be updated and additional analyses and data in particular for April 2020, when the infection rate was still extremely high in Belgium, will be presented.

Samples of 86 lateral head cephalograms from Dundee Dental School (mean age, 11.8 years) and 335 lateral head cephalograms from the Universitas Padjadjaran Dental Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia (mean age 24.2 years), were measured. The method of nose profile estimation based on skull morphology previously proposed by Rynn and colleagues in 2010 (FSMP 6:20C34) was tested in this study. Following this method, three nasal aperture-related craniometrics and six nose profile dimensions were measured from the cephalograms. To assess the accuracy of the method, six nose profile dimensions were estimated from the three craniometric parameters using the published method and then compared to the actual nose profile dimensions. In the Scottish subadult population, no sexual dimorphism was evident in the measured dimensions. In contrast, sexual dimorphism of the Indonesian adult population was evident in all craniometric and nose profile dimensions; notably, males exhibited statistically significant larger values than females. The published method by Rynn and colleagues (FSMP 6:20C34, 2010) performed better in the Scottish subadult population (mean difference of maximum, 2.35 mm) compared to the Indonesian adult population (mean difference of maximum, 5.42 mm in males and 4.89 mm in females). In addition, regression formulae were derived to estimate nose profile dimensions based on the craniometric measurements for the Indonesian adult population. The published method is not sufficiently accurate for use on the Indonesian population, so the derived method should be used.

Muc5ac is a secretory mucin that has been associated with reduced pulmonary function and asthma exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the immunological pathway that controls Muc5ac expression and allergic airway inflammation in asthma. METHODS: Cockroach allergen-induced Muc5ac expression and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling activation was examined in the human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and mouse model of asthma. AhR regulation of Muc5ac expression, mitochondrial ROS (Mito-ROS) generation, and NLRP3 inflammasome was determined by AhR knockdown, the antagonist CH223191, and AhR(-/-) mice. The role of NLRP3 inflammasome in Muc5ac expression and airway inflammation was also investigated. RESULTS: Cockroach allergen induced Muc5ac overexpression in HBECs and airways of asthma mouse model. Increased expression of AhR and its downstream genes CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 was also observed. Mice with AhR deletion showed increased allergic airway inflammation and MUC5AC expression. Moreover, cockroach allergen induced epithelial NLRP3 inflammasome activation (e.g., NLRP3, Caspase-1, and IL-1), which was enhanced by AhR knockdown or the antagonist CH223191. Furthermore, AhR deletion in HBECs led to enhanced ROS generation, particularly Mito-ROS, and inhibition of ROS or Mito-ROS subsequently suppressed the inflammasome activation. Importantly, inhibition of the inflammasome with MCC950, a NLRP3-specifc inhibitor, attenuated allergic airway inflammation and Muc5ac expression. IL-1 generated by the activated inflammasomes mediated cockroach allergen-induced Muc5ac expression in HBECs.

This is a result of poorly managed fleets, caused by varying demands and rigid schedules. In this paper, we present an intelligent real-time transport information system to keep commuters informed about the status of buses currently in transit, and also provide an insight to bus managers based on ridership data and commuter behavior. The system is composed of three subsystems designed to cater for commuters, bus-drivers and bus managers respectively. This system is developed on the Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform Firebase. Furthermore, a neural network is trained to provide predictions to bus managers on the expected ridership numbers per route. The trained model is integrated with a web application for bus managers.

Public prevention and control measures, along with efforts from all sectors of society, were undertaken to control and eliminate disease transmission. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes Chinese citizens response to the epidemic, the preventive measures they implemented to avoid being infected, and the public strategies that were carried out by the government, health workers, etc. We also discuss the efficacy of these measures in controlling the epidemic in China. METHODS: Information on the responses and behaviors of Chinese citizens were collected through a cross-sectional, internet-based survey using Dingxiang Doctors public account on WeChat. Information on public strategies implemented by all sectors of society to control the epidemic and data on new COVID-19 cases were collected from the internet, mainly from government websites. Standard descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 10,304 participants responded to the survey, with 10,198 valid responses; 74.1% (n=7557) were female and 25.9% (n=2641) were male. Overall, 98.2% (n=10,013) of participants paid high or very high attention to the epidemic, with WeChat being their main information source (n=9400, 92.2%). Over half the participants (n=5878, 57.7%) were confident that the epidemic could be curbed in China; 92.4% (n=9427) opened windows for ventilation more frequently than usual; 97.9% (n=9986) used masks in public; 95.7% (n=9759) avoided large crowds and stayed at home as much as possible; and 97.9% (n=9988) washed their hands more often than usual. Women were more likely to practice these behaviors than men (P<.001). With a series of strict public control measures, like nationwide health education campaigns, holiday extensions, the Examine and Approve Policy on the resumption of work, close management of working and living quarters, a health QR (Quick Response) code system, community screening, and social distancing policies, the number of new cases have decreased dramatically since February 12, 2020.

Considering the amplitude of migration flows in Europe and recent challenges brought by the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, the Brexit decision and humanitarian dimension of the migration phenomena (asylum seekers and ref-ugees), the need for better immigration and integration policies within the host countries labor markets stands out as a major research direction, especially in case of immigrants looking for better working and living conditions. Aim: This chapter aims to design specific immigration clusters within the main EU-10 destination countries (including Spain, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, UK, Germany, Austria, and Sweden) (cluster analysis pro-cedure);and to identify feasible ways and specific policies for immigrants labor market success (spatial analysis and macroeconometric models). Method: The methodological framework consists of two parts: (i) immigration clusters analysis, based on the interlinkages between several fundamental migration coordinates, namely, economic welfare at destination, employment opportunities for the foreign population, migrant integration policies and associated governmental efforts, educational background;and (ii) spatial analysis models, namely spatial lagCautoregressive and spatial error, and other three econometric procedures, respectively, the robust regression, Panel Corrected Standard Errors, and Arellano-Bond Dynamic Generalized Method of Moments. National data compiled for the 10 main EU receiving economies during 2000C2015, with a particular focus on Spain were used. Findings: The impact of the proposed research is reflected through a set of new specific tailored ways, policies and strategies that can be adopted and implemented by the policy-makers across Europe. Our empirical results show that, overall, EU-10 countries still fail to identify immigrants with high levels of education and skills acquired to enhance their potential for labor market integration. Policy-makers should always monitor the specific ways in which migration policies lead to concrete positive labor market outcomes for immigrants and that the tools used for implementing these policies are suitable in achieving predefined migration goals. Therefore, a particular focus should be on developing a new immigration system to select migrants for their skills and high level of human capital, by following the best practices examples of other receiving countries. ? 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited, All rights reserved.","output":"How are immigrants advancing on the european labor market?

Infectious diseases were less often diagnosed, while it was not clear if this was due to a decrease in prevalence or a decrease in emergency healthcare visits due to fear of COVID-19. METHODS: This study comprises a follow-up from a recently finished randomised controlled trial, to gain insight into the prevalence of asthma exacerbation and fear of COVID-19 in patients with moderate-severe asthma and controls in the Netherlands. Participants, patients with asthma and controls, were invited to fill out a short survey by email or post. Exacerbation frequencies until 1 July 2020 were verified with the hospitals and general practitioners medical records, pharmacies and patient interviews. RESULTS: In quarter 2 of 2020, mean exacerbation frequency per patient was significantly lower ((2)(3)=9.91, p=0.019) compared with quarter 2 in previous years. Patients with asthma were more likely to avoid (38.8%; controls, 0.0%, p<0.01) or delay (24.5%; controls, 0.0%, p=0.02) essential medical visits due to fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection at medical facilities.

Key determinants for household food insecurity are income and food costs. Whereas short-term household incomes are likely to remain static, increased food prices would be a significant driver of food insecurity. OBJECTIVES To investigate food price drivers for household food security and its health consequences in the UK under scenarios of Deal and No-deal for Britain's exit from the European Union. To estimate the 5% and 95% quantiles of the projected price distributions. DESIGN Structured expert judgement elicitation, a well-established method for quantifying uncertainty, using experts. In July 2018, each expert estimated the median, 5% and 95% quantiles of changes in price for 10 food categories under Brexit Deal and No-deal to June 2020 assuming Brexit had taken place on 29 March 2019. These were aggregated based on the accuracy and informativeness of the experts on calibration questions. PARTICIPANTS Ten specialists with expertise in food procurement, retail, agriculture, economics, statistics and household food security. RESULTS When combined in proportions used to calculate Consumer Price Index food basket costs, median food price change for Brexit with a Deal is expected to be +6.1% (90% credible interval -3% to +17%) and with No-deal +22.5% (90% credible interval +1% to +52%). CONCLUSIONS The number of households experiencing food insecurity and its severity is likely to increase because of expected sizeable increases in median food prices after Brexit. Higher increases are more likely than lower rises and towards the upper limits, these would entail severe impacts. Research showing a low food budget leads to increasingly poor diet suggests that demand for health services in both the short and longer terms is likely to increase due to the effects of food insecurity on the incidence and management of diet-sensitive conditions.","output":"Anticipated impacts of Brexit scenarios on UK food prices and implications for policies on poverty and health: a structured expert judgement approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Reflection on one's own actions is undoubtedly one of the most important lessons required throughout a career in medicine or pharmacology, due to the series of dilemmas and decisions that health professionals must face when providing care to patients or communities, teaching other professionals, or conducting biomedical research. Given the complexity of the challenge, there is surprisingly little literature on effective pedagogical strategies that enhance ongoing reflection in medical students. This self-reflection is particularly important in the current moment where in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing it has brought, young students have seen reduced opportunities to interact with and learn from others. The practice of journaling is an effective strategy for prioritizing tasks, managing stress, reducing anxiety, and increasing productivity. The objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of journaling as an element that promotes better study habits and mental health in students of a medical pharmacology course. METHODS Since the second semester of 2020, the pharmacology course (second year of the medical career) has included weekly journaling as part of the course activities. Each week students must choose and reflexively answer 4-5 questions from a list of 35 items in different domains (emotional and health perception, goals and commitments, study method and habits, learning perception and teamwork). The exercise was graded according to the level of fulfillment of the task (number of items answered in a reflective and timely manner), without criticizing the content of the students' answers. At the end of the semester the students answered a short survey that evaluated their perception of the usefulness of the tool, through Likert-type questions. RESULTS Most of the students reported that keeping a journal was useful to improve their physical and mental health (57%), organize their homework and assignments (69%), achieve their goals (85%), reflect on their role as a person (77%) or student (88%). In addition, students also agreed that the journal was helpful in increasing their confidence (51%), developing creativity (54%), and strengthening their communication skills (54%). The students' favorite domain for personal reflections was \\"physical and mental health care\\", with 66% of responses. More than 80% of students considered that writing about their goals and commitments, and about their study method and assignments, helped them to better organize their time. Moreover, 83% of students stated that they would like to continue with the habit of keeping a journal to organize their academic activities. CONCLUSIONS Students positively valued the journals as a planning tool in their academic tasks. Importantly, students also positively evaluated the value of journaling as a useful tool for maintaining better physical and mental health. This is an important achievement given the emotional stress, anxiety and burn out that many medical students deal with, especially in times of the pandemic. Journaling is a cost-effective and easily implementable method in different STEM areas to promote metacognition and mental health in students.","output":"Journaling as an effective tool to promote metacognition and enhance study methods in a pharmacology course, during and after the pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health providers for women have experienced challenges during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic but there are ways to address these challenges.","output":"Providing womens health care during COVID\\\\19: Personal and professional challenges faced by health workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests symptoms as common etiologies of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). During the pandemic of COVID-19, identifying the etiologies correctly from patients with RTI symptoms was crucial not only in disease control but preventing healthcare system from collapsing. By applying sensitive PCR-based molecular assays, we detected the etiologic agents and delineated the epidemiologic picture of RTIs in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods From December 2019 to February 2020, we screened patients presented with RTIs using multiplex PCR-based diagnostic assays. Data from pediatric and adult populations were compared with different months and units in the hospital. Results Of all 1631 patients including 1445 adult and 186 pediatric patients screened, 8 viruses and 4 bacteria were identified. Positive rates were 25% in December, 37% in January, and 20% in February, with pediatric patients having higher positive rates than adults (Ps<0.001). In pediatric patients, RhV/EnV was the most commonly detected, followed by parainfluenza viruses. Most Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection occurred in pediatric patients. RhV/EnV was the most commonly detected agent in pediatric patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), while influenza accounted for the majority of adult cases with critical illness. Noticeably, seasonal coronavirus ranked second in both adult and pediatric patients with ICU admission. Conclusion While we focused on the pandemic of COVID-19, common etiologies still accounted for the majority of RTIs and lead to severe diseases, including other seasonal coronaviruses.","output":"The Epidemiology and Etiologies of Respiratory Tract Infection in Northern Taiwan During The Early Phase of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Universities have halted non-essential services, with many restricting campus-based teaching, and continuing courses through online resources, including (controversially) lab-work. Such technologically enhanced approaches have been proven to have high levels of engagement among university students. OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on the perception of quality of online learning by first-year university students, between two semesters, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 24-item questionnaire was designed with Likert response scale. It consisted of general perception questions of academic life and questions specific to the quality of delivery of a specific class. Eighty one eligible students were asked to fill the same questionnaire for each semester. Students responses and their grades from the final exams in each semester were compared. RESULTS: Out of 81 eligible students, 75.31% of students responded to the survey. They were less interested in their studies in the second online semester (p=0.05). Students expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of online classes (p=0.03). Academic life fulfillment was also affected (p=0.02). Students perception of the amount of free time they had between semesters did not change significantly (p=0.16). Students appeared dissatisfied with their active participation during the online class (p=0.007), even though they felt less stressed attending lectures from home (p=0.041). However, they found that workload was bearable and similar between semesters (p=0.83). Students also had significantly more trouble concentrating during online lectures (p<0.001). Students grades significantly improved by an average of 1.07 (out of 10) in the final exams at the end of the second semester (p<0.001).

However, little is known about the e-learning approaches that international students apply, or about how they experience the process of e-learning. This article is a critical reflection on the misalignment between an international student's (Author 1) e-learning behaviours and the expectation of online education. It outlines the autoethnographic method and employs self-study to explore why Author 1 behaves in a certain way with particular reference made to the Biggs' 3P model. In so doing, the study attempts to shed light on the values and interests of international students that have been silenced in the discourse of e-learning design in Australian universities. With the aim of obtaining a profound insight into the effectiveness of e-learning, the present study challenges the notion that the virtual university is a means of achieving educational equality;it suggests the potential of online education in undermining the social inclusion agenda of internationalised universities. The findings show that while the participant could engage with the curriculum to some extent, there are signs of disconnection, isolation and emotional instability associated with the establishment and development of the e-learning environment. Illustrations of these emerging issues could help educators better understand the downside of e-learning and e-practice by identifying various influential elements, including individuals' socioeconomic status, cultural heritage and environmental learning settings. The study points out that international students' education outcomes could be compromised, and expectations could be unfulfilled via e-learning.

COVID-19 spread swiftly around the world over with an alert of an emergency for an adequate drug. Therefore, in this research, we repurposed the FDA-approved medicines to find the prominent drug used to cure the COVID infected patients. We performed homology modeling of the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), responsible for the viral entry. The prediction of the transmembrane region and the Conserved Domain in TMPRSS2 protein was made for docking. 4182 FDA-approved compounds from the ZINC database were downloaded and used for the calculation of physicochemical properties. Two thousand eight hundred fifteen screened compounds were used for molecular docking against the modelled protein structure. From which top hit compounds based on binding energy were extracted. At 1st site pose, ZINC3830554 showed the highest binding energy -12.91kcal/mol by forming Salt Bridge at LYS143, Hydrogen bond at ALA8, VAL45, HIS47, SER142, ASN277, ASN359, and TRP363. The hydrophobic Interactions at PHE3, LEU4, ALA7, ALA8, ALA139, PRO197, and PHE266.

Many factors have been identified as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, with much early attention being paid to body mass index (BMI), which is a well-known cardiometabolic risk factor. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to examine the impact of additional baseline cardiometabolic risk factors including high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes on the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in UK Biobank (UKB) study participants. METHODS: We examined the effect of BMI, lipid profiles, diabetes and alcohol intake on the odds of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 among 9,005 UKB participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16 through July 14, 2020. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and ancestry. RESULTS: Higher BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 odds (p < 0.05) while HDL-C and ApoA-I were associated with decreased odds (p < 0.001). Though the effect of BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were eliminated when HDL-C was controlled, the effect of HDL-C remained significant when BMI was controlled for. LDL-C, ApoB and triglyceride levels were not found to be significantly associated with increased odds. CONCLUSION: Elevated HDL-C and ApoA-I levels were associated with reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, while higher BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased odds. The effects of BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c levels were no longer significant after controlling for HDL-C, suggesting that these effects may be mediated in part through regulation of HDL-C levels. In summary, our study suggests that baseline HDL-C level may be useful for stratifying SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and corroborates the emerging picture that HDL-C may confer protection against sepsis in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular.","output":"Baseline cardiometabolic profiles and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly swept the world. It is particularly important to understand the dynamic changes of the whole disease course of non-severe patients from the onset to the follow-up after discharge. Methods: : On February 1, 2020, 18 cases of non-severe COVID-19 appeared in a hospital in Beijing. All patients were SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive by RT-PCR for pharyngeal swabs. We recorded the clinical information and viral dynamics of these patients from the onset of the disease to 2 months after discharge. According to the severity of lung consolidation, 18 patients were divided into two groups (mild pulmonary consolidation group [imaging score 10];severe pulmonary consolidation group [imaging score >10]). Results: : Eighteen patients (median age 43) were included, including 14 females. Fever (11/18) and cough (8/18) were the most common symptoms. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive in mild pulmonary consolidation group was significantly longer than severe pulmonary consolidation group (the median time was 30 days and 13 days, respectively, P= 0.0031). Two months after discharge, almost all patients were followed up for IgM antibody disappearance and IgG antibody production.

In the absence of animal models to test drugs, we need to find molecular explanations for any unforeseen peculiarities in clinical data, especially the recent reports describing an unexpected asthma paradox. Asthma is considered a high medical risk factor for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection, yet asthma is not on the list of top 10 chronic health problems suffered by people who died from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Resolving this paradox requires looking beyond the binary model of a viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) attaching to the ACE-2 receptor. A NCBI pBlast analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein contains key two calcium-dependent fusion domains that are almost identical to those that were recently discovered SARS-CoV-1. These viral calcium-dependent binding domains can facilitate membrane fusion only after cleavage by the host surface protease TMPRSS2. Importantly, TMPRSS2 also requires calcium for its SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich) domain and itsLDLRA(LDL receptor class A) domain. Thus, the presence of EDTA excipients in nebulized ?2-agonist medicines can disrupt SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection and can explain the asthma paradox. This model validates repurposing EDTA in nebulizer solutions from a passive excipient to an active drug for treating COVID-19 infections. Repurposed EDTA delivery to respiratory tissues at an initial target dose of 2.4 mg per aerosol treatment is readily achievable with standard nebulizer and mechanical ventilator equipment. EDTA warrants further investigation as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in consideration of the new calcium requirements for virus infection and the regular presence of EDTA excipients in common asthma medications such as Metaproterenol. Finally, the natural history of Coronavirus diseases and further analysis of the fusion loop homologies between the Betacorona SARS-CoV-2 virus and the less pathogenic Alphacorona HC0V-229E virus suggest how to engineer a hybrid virus suitable for an attenuated alpha-beta SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, replacing SARS-CoV-2 fusion loops (amino acids 816-855) with the less pathogenic HCoV-229E fusion loop (amino acids 923-982) may provide antigenicity of COVID-19, but limit the pathogenicity to the level of HCoV-229E.","output":"Why the lower reported prevalence of asthma in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 validates repurposing EDTA solutions to prevent and manage treat COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bladder cancer is a frequent malignancy and has a clinical need for new therapeutic approaches.

Accumulating evidence suggests that couples ability to communicate effectively plays a major role in the psychological adjustment of both individuals and the quality of their relationship. Two key conceptual models have been proposed to account for how couple communication impacts psychological and relationship adjustment: the social-cognitive processing (SCP) model and the relationship intimacy (RI) model. These models posit different mechanisms and outcomes, and thus have different implications for intervention. The purpose of this project is to test and compare the utility of these models using comprehensive and methodologically rigorous methods. Aims are: (1) to examine the overall fit of the SCP and RI models in explaining patient and partner psychological and relationship adjustment as they occur on a day-to-day basis and over the course of 1 year; (2) to examine the fit of the models for different subgroups (males vs. females, and patients vs. partners); and (3) to examine the utility of various methods of assessing communication by examining the degree to which baseline indices from different measurement strategies predict self-reported adjustment at 1-year follow up. The study employs a longitudinal, multi-method approach to examining communication processes including: standard self-report questionnaires assessing process and outcome variables collected quarterly over the course of 1 year; smartphone-based ecological momentary assessments to sample participant reports in real time; and laboratory-based couple conversations from which we derive observational measures of communicative behavior and affective expression, as well as vocal indices of emotional arousal.

However, their biosafety has not been evaluated, which could have been the first gateway to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. During 9-11 March 2020, the first comprehensive evaluation of the biosafety in all 89 labs qualified for conducting SARS-CoV-2 tests in Sichuan Province of China was conducted. The degree of compliance with 39 criteria in five categories was evaluated: biosafety requirements for lab activities (14 criteria), sample transfer, acceptance and management (6 criteria), waste management (9 criteria), personnel training and protection (4 criteria), and lab environmental disinfection, emergency plans and accident handling (6 criteria). Our results revealed that, although an overall median compliance rate of 94.6% for 39 criteria, only four of 89 labs met all of them. Criteria in personnel training and protection have been most satisfactorily met, followed by lab environmental disinfection, emergency plans and accident handling. The most severe risk was the lack of automatic doors at the main entrance or in core operation areas, especially among labs in CDC and hospitals. This risk, together with failure for keeping pressure in the core operation areas 25  5 Pa (mainly among labs in the third-party testing agencies), may cause accidental exposure to biological agents from lab activities.

Demographic data, habits, additional diseases, clinical and laboratory findings, operational data, the morphology of the tumor in computerized tomography or magnetic-resonance imaging and follow-up data were scanned and acquired via our hospital's system and archive. RESULTS Average age was 54.4, male-female ratio was 1.55 and average tumor size was 3.31 cm. One hundred and four patients had malignant pathology and 21 were benign. Positive surgical margin rate was 5.6% and recurrence rate was 3.2%. Average follow-up was 47.4 months.

The present standard therapy of pegylated IFN with ribavirin achieves a sustained virologic response in about 50% of patients. However, about half of the CHCC patients are still at risk of fatal liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The other significant event in hepatitis C virus (HCV) research has been the development of a cell culture system. The subgenomic replicon system enables robust HCV RNA replication in hepatoma cells. And recently, the complete life cycle of HCV has been achieved using a genotype 2a strain, JFH1. These hallmarks have provided much information about the mechanisms of HCV replication, including information on the host molecules required for the replication. Anti-HCV reagents targeting HCV proteins have been developed, and some of them are now in clinical trials. However, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase frequently causes mutations in the HCV genome, which lead to the emergence of drug-resistant HCV mutants. Some of the cellular proteins essential for HCV RNA replication have already been discovered using the HCV cell culture system. These host molecules are also candidate targets for antivirals.

Denitrification is a critical process for transferring soil N to the atmosphere. Denitrifying bacterial communities in soil are indicative of the soil quality of a functional ecosystem. We investigated the effects of physicochemical properties of soil on the diversity and activity of denitrifiers in the top-soil and sub-soil of two typical montane riparian meadows: a multi-colored and a flood-plain meadow. Illumina MiSeq 2500 sequencing of nirS showed that the multi-colored meadow had greater diversity and abundance of nirS-type denitrifiers than the flood-plain meadow and that the total N content, ammonium content, and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in soil differed significantly between the two types of meadows. The abundances of dominant denitrifiers at phylum and genus levels showed different responses to the two soil layers of the two meadow types. In top-soils, the highest abundance of Firmicutes was recorded in the multi-colored meadow, while in the flood-plain meadow, there was the highest abundance of Proteobacteria. The Actinobacteria abundance was the highest in top-soil and sub-soil of the flood-plain meadow. The abundance of Chloroflexi was the highest in top-soil of the flood-plain meadow and in sub-soil of the multi-colored meadow. The diversity of denitrifying bacteria was strongly influenced by variations of soil properties down the soil profile. Spearman's rank correlation analyses showed that the diversity and community composition of denitrifying bacteria were strongly associated with most of the soil properties. Therefore, physicochemical soil properties, and particularly the organic carbon, nitrate, and ammonium contents, influence the diversity and abundance of denitrifiers in soil.","output":"nirS-type denitrifying bacterial communities in relation to soil physicochemical conditions and soil depths of two montane riparian meadows in North China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a global pandemic with uncertain death rates. We examined county-level population morality rates (per 100,000) and case fatality rates by US region and rural-urban classification, while controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and hospital variables. We found that population mortality rates and case fatality rates were significantly different across region, rural-urban classification, and their interaction. All significant comparisons had p < 0.001. Northeast counties had the highest population mortality rates (27.4) but had similar case fatality rates (5.9%) compared to other regions except the Southeast, which had significantly lower rates (4.1%). Population mortality rates were highest in urban counties but conversely, case fatality rates were highest in rural counties. Death rates in the Northeast were driven by urban areas (e.g., small, East Coast states), while case fatality rates tended to be highest in the most rural counties for all regions, especially the Southwest. However, on further inspection, high case fatality rate percentages in the Southwest, as well as in overall US counties, were driven by a low case number. This makes it hard to distinguish genuinely higher mortality or an artifact of a small sample size. In summary, coronavirus deaths are not homogenous across the United States but instead vary by region and population and highlight the importance of fine-scale analysis.","output":"United States County-level COVID-19 Death Rates and Case Fatality Rates Vary by Region and Urban Status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) has been reported in critically ill patients without pre-existing immunocompromising conditions. However, there are scant data on pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of pharmacy records of antifungal use during 3/21-4/22, 2020, and collect longitudinal clinical data. Cases were then classified by the clinical algorithm for IPA in the ICU (AspICU). RESULTS: 7 out of 18 (39%) patients who received antifungal therapy had Aspergillus fumigatus in tracheal aspirate specimens while mechanically ventilated in the ICU. None of the patients had EORTC/MSG host factors. Median time from admission to the date of positive respiratory culture was 9 days (range: 2-15). High-dose glucocorticoids were started a mean of 5.6 days (range 3-8) before the positive respiratory culture in 5 and on the day of the culture in 2. Six received 583-1000 mg equivalent of prednisone. Two received Tocilizumab. By AspICU criteria, 4 had putative IPA. Radiographic abnormalities included cavitary pneumonia, opacities with dense consolidation, worsening infiltrates, and diffuse interstitial and patchy hazy opacities. Compatible signs included worsening respiratory failure in 3 and fever after 3 days of antibacterial agents in 1. Associated findings were leukocytosis in 4, > 1 positive cultures in 3, high procalcitonin in 2, and positive serum galactomannan in 1. The remaining three were classified as colonization as they lacked compatible signs. One had concomitant Klebsiella aerogenes pneumonia with bacteremia, and two later developed Candidemia and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia pneumonia, respectively. All 3 had fever with leukocytosis. One had elevated procalcitonin. Six received antifungal therapy; one did not due to goals of care. All 7 patients expired despite ICU care. CONCLUSION: The critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 in whom respiratory culture grew Aspergillus fumigatus showed very high mortality despite antifungal treatment.

We hypothesized that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration could restore this redox homeostasis and suppress unfavorable evolution in Covid-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether NAC in high doses can avoid respiratory failure in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: It was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, unicentric trial, conducted at the Emergency Department of Hospital das Clnicas, S?o Paulo, Brazil. We enrolled 135 patients with severe Covid-19 (confirmed or suspected), with an oxyhemoglobin saturation of less than 94% or respiratory rate higher than 24 breaths/min. Patients were randomized to receive NAC 21 g (approximately 300 mg/kg) for 20 hours, or dextrose 5%. Primary endpoint was the need for mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints were time of mechanical ventilation, admission to ICU, time in ICU, and mortality. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were very similar in the two groups, with no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, medicines taken, and disease severity. Also, groups were similar in laboratory tests and chest CT scan findings. Sixteen patients (23.9%) in the Placebo group were submitted to endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, compared to 14 patients (20.6%) in the NAC group (p=0.675).

Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants was performed on a total of 4,851 samples from the capital city and 10 provinces of Argentina, during 51 epidemiological weeks (EWs) that covered the end of the first wave and the ongoing second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country (EW 44/2020 to EW 41/2021). The surveillance strategy was mainly based on Sanger sequencing of a Spike coding region that allows the identification of signature mutations associated with variants. In addition, whole-genome sequences were obtained from 637 samples. The main variants found were Gamma and Lambda, and to a lesser extent, Alpha, Zeta, and Epsilon, and more recently, Delta. Whereas, Gamma dominated in different regions of the country, both Gamma and Lambda prevailed in the most populated area, the metropolitan region of Buenos Aires. The lineages that circulated on the first wave were replaced by emergent variants in a term of a few weeks. At the end of the ongoing second wave, Delta began to be detected, replacing Gamma and Lambda. This scenario is consistent with the Latin American variant landscape, so far characterized by a concurrent increase in Delta circulation and a stabilization in the number of cases. The cost-effective surveillance protocol presented here allowed for a rapid response in a resource-limited setting, added information on the expansion of Lambda in South America, and contributed to the implementation of public health measures to control the disease spread in Argentina.","output":"Cost-Effective Method to Perform SARS-CoV-2 Variant Surveillance: Detection of Alpha, Gamma, Lambda, Delta, Epsilon, and Zeta in Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection has been implicated as a cause of atherosclerosis since the first half of the 19th century.

Studies have reported an increase in D-dimer and fibrinogen concentrations in the early stages of COVID-19 disease a 3 to 4-fold rise in D-dimer levels is linked to poor prognosis. In addition, underlying diseases such as diabetes, cancer, stroke, and pregnancy may trigger an increase in D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: 2,123 Italians (mean age  standard deviation, 33.1  11.6) were tested longitudinally during the third and the seventh week of lockdown. The web-based survey evaluated sleep quality and insomnia symptoms through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index. The second assessment survey inquired about intervening changes in backlit screen exposure in the two hours before falling asleep. RESULTS: Participants who increased electronic device usage showed decreased sleep quality, exacerbated insomnia symptoms, reduced sleep duration, prolonged sleep onset latency, and delayed bedtime and rising time. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and individuals reporting moderate/severe insomnia symptoms increased. Conversely, respondents reporting decreased screen exposure exhibited improved sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and moderate/severe insomniacs decreased. Respondents preserving screen time habits did not show variations of the sleep parameters.

To the best of our knowledge, no existing contribution to the literature has attempted to gauge the effectiveness of lockdown measures over time in a longitudinal cross-country perspective. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by assessing, at an international level, the effect of lockdown measures (or the lack of such measures) on the numbers of new infections. Given this policys expected change in effectiveness over time, we also measure the effect of having a lockdown implemented over a given number of days (from 7 to 20 days). METHODS: We pursue our objectives by means of a quantitative panel analysis, building a longitudinal dataset with observations from countries all over the world, and estimating the impact of lockdown via feasible generalized least squares fixed effect, random effects, generalized estimating equation, and hierarchical linear models. RESULTS: Our results show that lockdown is effective in reducing the number of new cases in the countries that implement it, compared with those countries that do not. This is especially true around 10 days after the implementation of the policy. Its efficacy continues to grow up to 20 days after implementation. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that lockdown is effective in reducing the R0, i.e. the number of people infected by each infected person, and that, unlike what has been suggested in previous analyses, its efficacy continues to hold 20 days after the introduction of the policy.

Aim: To determine association of the demographic data of COVID-19 patients with clinical profile and disease outcomes. Materials and Methods: The cross-sectional single-center study considered adults patients of both the gender from March to June 2020 with an estimated sample size of 2000 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) technique. Necessary demographic and clinical data were collected and selected subjects were followed-up until discharge or death. Subjects were classified as those who survived (1839 patients) and succumbed (138 patients) to death. T-Test was used for comparing continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical data between the groups. Results: The study included 1977 patients with a male-To-female ratio of 1:0.62. Fever, dyspnea and cough were noted as the major symptoms prevalent among patients who succumbed to death when compared to those who survived (p-value &lt;0.001). Statistically significant variables noted between the groups were age (survived mean age-42.7415.15 years vs mean age 59.1212.95 in those who succumbed to death, p-value &lt;0.001), age groups (p-value &lt;0.001), gender (p-value 0.042), haemoglobin, Total Leucocyte Count (TLC), neutrophil, lymphocytes, Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, all the comorbidity variables and the asymptomatic status. Variables identified as significant predictors of disease outcomes were Haemoglobin (Hb), TLC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, NLR, LDH and ferritin (p-value &lt;0.001). Most of the subjects belonging to the mortality group required oxygen and other Intensive Care Unit (ICU) facilities when compared to the survival group (p-value &lt;0.001).

Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that this pro-hormone has other several activities, such as affecting drug concentrations, since it regulates the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes. Efavirenz (EFV) pharmacokinetics is influenced by CYPs, but no data are available in the literature concerning the association among vitamin D levels, seasonality (which affects vitamin D concentrations) and EFV plasma levels. For this reason, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D3) levels on EFV plasma concentrations in different seasons. We quantified 25(OH)D3 by using chemiluminescence immunoassay, whereas EFV plasma concentrations were quantified with the HPLCCPDA method. A total of 316 patients were enrolled in Turin and Rome. Overall, 25(OH)D3levels resulted in being inversely correlated with EFV concentrations. Some patients with EFV levels higher than 4000 ng/mL showed a deficient 25(OH)D3 concentration in Turin and Rome cohorts and together. EFV concentrations were different in patients without vitamin D supplementation, whereas, for vitamin D-administered individuals, no difference in EFV exposure was present. Concerning seasonality, EFV concentrations were associated with 25(OH)D3 deficiency only in winter and in spring, whereas a significant influence was highlighted for 25(OH)D3 stratification for deficient, insufficient and sufficient values in winter, spring and summer. A strong and inverse association between 25(OH)D3and EFV plasma concentrations was suggested. These data suggest that vitamin D is able to affect drug exposure in different seasons; thus, the achievement of the clinical outcome could be improved by also considering this pro-hormone.","output":"Vitamin D as Modulator of Drug Concentrations: A Study on Two Italian Cohorts of People Living with HIV Administered with Efavirenz"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the flows or spatial mobility of people, goods, and services globally.

The study found that the restrictive measures imposed during the pandemic severely disrupted the global flows of people and goods. As a result, global movements of people declined by over 40% in 2020 from the 2019 levels. Similarly, the global flows of goods shrunk by at least 10% within the same period. These lockdown-related disruptions have significant implications on how socioeconomic activities are organized and conducted within and between cities, with civil aviation and hospitality sectors the hardest hit.

Our study is a prospective study aiming at assessment of CT severity scoring in the acute phase of COVID-19 pneumonia as a predictor for development of post-COVID syndrome in recovering patients. RESULTS: A total of 192 symptomatic COVID-19 patients between April 2020 and October 2020 were enrolled in this single-center study, and high-resolution chest CT examinations were evaluated for CT severity scoring. Data were matched with the long-term clinical outcome. CT severity score was significantly higher in patients who developed post-COVID symptoms (p < 0.001). A CT score of > 7 was associated with an increased risk and was found to be predictive of condition development with sensitivity (95.9%), specificity (96%), positive predictive value (95.92%), negative predictive value (96%), and accuracy (95.96%).

We aim to identify differences in CT imaging and clinical manifestations between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19, and to develop and validate a diagnostic model for COVID-19 based on radiological semantic and clinical features alone. METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 70 COVID-19 and 66 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five institutions. Patients were divided into primary (n = 98) and validation (n = 38) cohorts. The chi-square test, Student's t test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed, comparing 1745 lesions and 67 features in the two groups. Three models were constructed using radiological semantic and clinical features through multivariate logistic regression. Diagnostic efficacies of developed models were quantified by receiver operating characteristic curve. Clinical usage was evaluated by decision curve analysis and nomogram. RESULTS: Eighteen radiological semantic features and seventeen clinical features were identified to be significantly different. Besides ground-glass opacities (p = 0.032) and consolidation (p = 0.001) in the lung periphery, the lesion size (1-3 cm) is also significant for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (p = 0.027). Lung score presents no significant difference (p = 0.417). Three diagnostic models achieved an area under the curve value as high as 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000). The clinical and radiological semantic models provided a better diagnostic performance and more considerable net benefits.

PURPOSE To investigate the possibility of airborne transmission of COVID-19 during Humphrey Visual field testing in a real-world scenario. METHODS A particle counter was placed within the bowl of Humphrey Visual Field Analyser before and after turning on the machine to ascertain the effect of the air current produced by the ventilation system on aerosols. A second experiment was run where the particle counter was placed in the bowl and recorded particulates, in the air, as a 24-2 SITA standard was performed by a mock patient and then again immediately after the patient had moved away. We measured aerosol particle counts sized 0.3?m, >0.3 0.5?m, >0.5 1?m, >1 2.5?m, >2.55?m and >510?m. RESULTS Particulates of all sizes were shown to be significantly reduced within the bowl after turning the machine on, demonstrating that the air current produced by the Humphrey visual field analyser pushes air out of the bowl and it cannot stagnate. There was no significant difference in measurement of aerosol while there was a patient performing the test and immediately after they had moved away, suggesting that aerosols breathed out by the patient are not able to remain in suspension in the bowl due to the ventilation current. CONCLUSION There is no significant difference between aerosol count in the bowl of a Humphrey visual field analyser before, during and after testing.

RESULTS: There was a 64% reduction in emergency department (ED) attendances (25,264 vs 9042). There was an 18% reduction in oLLFs (22 vs 18). Approximately three-quarters of injuries were in males across both cohorts (77% vs 78%) and tended to occur in younger patients (median age, 37 vs 35). Road-traffic-accidents (RTAs) were the most common injury mechanism in both 2019 and lockdown, but a rise in jumpers from height was seen in the latter.

Postintervention data were used to calculate effect size by study. The findings were summarized using the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool. RESULTS: Of the 4099 identified studies, 21 (0.51%) RCTs representing 20 interventions met the inclusion criteria. These studies examined mental health outcomes among 2438 participants (sample size range: 47-361 participants per study) across 7 countries. When effect sizes were pooled, live health professionalCled group eHealth interventions had a medium effect on reducing anxiety compared with inactive (Cohen d=0.57) or active control (Cohen d=0.48), a medium to small effect on reducing depression compared with inactive (Cohen d=0.61) or active control (Cohen d=0.21), and mixed effects on mental distress and coping. Interventions led by videoconference, and those that provided 8-12 hours of live health professionalCled group contact had more robust effects on adult mental health. Risk of bias was high in 91% (19/21) of the studies. Heterogeneity across interventions was significant, resulting in low to very low quality of evidence. No eligible RCT was found that examined substance use, bereavement, or physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Live eHealth group interventions led by health professionals can foster moderate improvements in anxiety and moderate to small improvements in depression among community-based adults, particularly those delivered by videoconference and those providing 8-12 hours of synchronous engagement.

There is an urgent need for more efficient and faster methods of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2. Compared to experimental protocols, the opportunities to innovate are very high in immunoinformatics/in silico approaches especially with the recent adoption of structural bioinformatics in peptide vaccine design. In recent times, multi-epitope-based peptide vaccine candidates (MEBPVCs) have shown extraordinarily high humoral and cellular responses to immunization. Most of the publications claim that respective reported MEBPVC(s) assembled using a set of in silico predicted epitopes, to be the computationally validated potent vaccine candidate(s) ready for experimental validation. However, in this article, for a given set of predicted epitopes, it is shown that the published MEBPVC is one among the many possible variants and there is high likelihood of finding more potent MEBPVCs than the published candidate. To test the same, a methodology is developed where novel MEBP variants are derived by changing the epitope order of the published MEBPVC. Further, to overcome the limitations of current qualitative methods of assessment of MEBPVC, to enable quantitative comparison, ranking, and the discovery of more potent MEBPVCs, novel predictors, Percent Epitope Accessibility (PEA), Receptor specific MEBP vaccine potency(RMVP), MEBP vaccine potency(MVP) are introduced. The MEBP variants indeed showed varied MVP scores indicating varied immunogenicity. When the MEBP variants were ranked in descending order of their MVP scores, the published MEBPVC had the least MVP score. Further, the MEBP variants with IDs, SPVC_387 and SPVC_206, had the highest MVP scores indicating these variants to be more potent MEBPVCs than the published MEBPVC and hence should be prioritized for experimental testing and validation. Through this method, more vaccine candidates will be available for experimental validation and testing. This study also opens the opportunity to develop new software tools for designing more potent MEBPVCs in less time. The computationally validated top-ranked MEBPVCs must be experimentally tested, validated, and verified. The differences and deviations between experimental results and computational predictions provide an opportunity for improving and developing more efficient algorithms and reliable scoring schemes and software.","output":"Epitope order Matters in multi-epitope-based peptide (MEBP) vaccine design: An in silico study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chicken colibacillosis is caused by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), and results in huge economic losses to the poultry industry. With the investigation of the gut-lung axis, more studies have demonstrated the important role of gut microbiota in lung inflammation. The precise role of the gut microbiota in chickens-associated colibacillosis, however, is unknown. Thus, this study assessed the function of the gut microbiota in the chicken defense against APEC infection. Chicken gut microbiota was depleted by drinking water with a mixture of antibiotics (Abx), and subsequently, a model of colibacillosis was established by the intranasal perfusion of APEC. The results showed that gut microbiota protects the chicken challenge by APEC from aggravated lung histopathologic injury, up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and increased bacterial load in lung tissues compared with controls. In addition, the air-blood barrier permeability was significantly increased in gut microbiota-depleted chickens compared to the control chickens after challenge with APEC. Furthermore, feeding acetate significantly inhibited the lung inflammatory response and the reduced air-blood permeability induced by APEC infection. The expression of free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), a receptor for acetate, was also increased in the lung after treatment with acetate. In conclusion, depletion of the gut microbiota resulted in increased susceptibility of chickens to APEC challenge, and gut microbiota derived acetate acted as a protective mediator during the APEC challenge. Novel therapeutic targets that focus on the gut microbiota may be effective in controlling colibacillosis in poultry.","output":"Protective effects of gut microbiota and gut microbiota-derived acetate on chicken colibacillosis induced by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic affected over 130 million individuals during more than one year Due to the overload of health-care services, a great number of people were treated as outpatients, many of them subsequently developing post-acute COVID-19 syndrome Our study was conducted on 150 subjects without a history of cardiovascular diseases, treated as outpatients for a mild/moderate form of COVID-19 4 to 12 weeks prior to study inclusion, and who were diagnosed with post-acute COVID-19 and attended a cardiology evaluation with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for persisting symptoms We detected various cardiac abnormalities in 38 subjects (25 33%), including pulmonary hypertension (9 33%), impaired left ventricular performance (8 66%), diastolic dysfunction (14%) and/or evidence of pericarditis (10%) We highlighted statistically significant correlations between the intensity of symptoms and quality of life scores with the severity of initial pulmonary injury, the number of weeks since COVID-19 and with TTE parameters characterizing the systolic and diastolic performance and pulmonary hypertension (p &lt;0 001) (Post-acute COVID-19 is a complex syndrome characterized by various symptoms, the intensity of which seem to be related to the severity and the time elapsed since the acute infection, and with persisting cardiac abnormalities","output":"Associations between the Severity of the Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome and Echocardiographic Abnormalities in Previously Healthy Outpatients Following Infection with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aims of this study were to provide data on the safety of head and neck cancer surgery currently being undertaken during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS This international, observational cohort study comprised 1137 consecutive patients with head and neck cancer undergoing primary surgery with curative intent in 26 countries. Factors associated with severe pulmonary complications in COVID-19-positive patients and infections in the surgical team were determined by univariate analysis. RESULTS Among the 1137 patients, the commonest sites were the oral cavity (38%) and the thyroid (21%). For oropharynx and larynx tumors, nonsurgical therapy was favored in most cases. There was evidence of surgical de-escalation of neck management and reconstruction. Overall 30-day mortality was 1.2%. Twenty-nine patients (3%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within 30 days of surgery; 13 of these patients (44.8%) developed severe respiratory complications, and 3.51 (10.3%) died. There were significant correlations with an advanced tumor stage and admission to critical care. Members of the surgical team tested positive within 30 days of surgery in 40 cases (3%). There were significant associations with operations in which the patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 30 days, with a high community incidence of SARS-CoV-2, with screened patients, with oral tumor sites, and with tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS Head and neck cancer surgery in the COVID-19 era appears safe even when surgery is prolonged and complex. The overlap in COVID-19 between patients and members of the surgical team raises the suspicion of failures in cross-infection measures or the use of personal protective equipment. LAY SUMMARY Head and neck surgery is safe for patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic even when it is lengthy and complex. This is significant because concerns over patient safety raised in many guidelines appear not to be reflected by outcomes, even for those who have other serious illnesses or require complex reconstructions. Patients subjected to suboptimal or nonstandard treatments should be carefully followed up to optimize their cancer outcomes. The overlap between patients and surgeons testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is notable and emphasizes the need for fastidious cross-infection controls and effective personal protective equipment.","output":"Head and neck cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: An international, multicenter, observational cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores the challenging factors of practising work from home (WFH) towards productivity that affected Malaysia's higher education during the COVID 19 outbreak.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients < 18 years old with acute appendicitis at four tertiary pediatric hospitals in California between March 19, 2020 to September 19, 2020 (COVID-era) were compared to a pre-COVID cohort (March 19, 2019 to September 19, 2019). The primary outcome was the rate of perforated appendicitis. Secondary outcomes were symptom duration prior to presentation, and rates of non-operative management. RESULTS: Rates of perforated appendicitis were unchanged (40.4% of 592 patients pre-COVID versus 42.1% of 606 patients COVID-era, P = 0.17). The median symptom duration was 2 days in both cohorts (P = 0.90). Computed tomography (CT) use rose from 39.8% pre-COVID to 49.4% during COVID (P = 0.002).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the perceptions concerning barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of eHealth among policy makers and service users and explore the ways in which their perceptions converge and differ. METHODS: This study used interview data from policy makers at different levels of health care (n=7) and service users enrolled in eHealth interventions (n=25). The analysis included separate qualitative content analyses for the 2 groups and then a second qualitative content analysis to explore differences and commonalities. RESULTS: Implementation barriers perceived by policy makers were that not all service users benefit from eHealth and that there is uncertainty about the impact of eHealth on the work of health care professionals. Policy makers also perceived political decision-making as complex; this included problems related to provision of technical infrastructure and lack of extra resources for health care digitalization. Facilitators were policy makers conviction that eHealth is what citizens want, their belief in eHealth solutions as beneficial for health care practice, and their belief in the importance of health care digitalization. Barriers for service users comprised capability limitations and varied preferences of service users and a mismatch of technology with user needs, lack of data protection, and their perception of eHealth as being more time consuming. Facilitators for service users were eHealth technology design and match with their skill set, personal feedback and staff support, a sense of privacy, a credible sender, and flexible use of time.There were several commonalities between the 2 stakeholder groups. Facilitators for both groups were the strong impetus toward technology adoption in society and expectations of time flexibility. Both groups perceived barriers in the difficulties of tailoring eHealth, and both groups expressed uncertainty about the care burden distribution. There were also differences: policy makers perceived that their decision-making was very complex and that resources for implementation were limited. Service users highlighted their need to feel that their digital data were protected and that they needed to trust the eHealth sender. CONCLUSIONS: Perceptions about barriers to and facilitators of eHealth implementation varied among stakeholders in different parts of the health care system. The study points to the need to reach an enhanced mutual understanding of priorities and overcome challenges at both the micro and macro levels of the health care system.

CASE PRESENTATION: 65-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease not on home oxygen, former tobacco smoker and alcohol user presents to the emergency department for worsening dyspnea for three weeks. He recently completed 6 cycles of 5 Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin for Stage IIIA Sigmoid Adenocarcinoma. Patient denies use of recreational drugs. Earlier that day he was at the pulmonary clinic and ambulatory oxygen measurement showed saturation of 60% on room air. High dose steriods were initiated, the patient continued to require high flow nasal cannula and then was on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. He was subsequently intubated and his course was complicated by a left pneumothorax requiring a chest tube. He was not a candidate for a lung transplant and was placed on comfort care and expired shortly thereafter. Review of system: positive for cough, white phlegm, chills for three days. Physical Exam: afebrile, heart rate 108, respiration 30-34, blood pressure 142/91, oxygen saturation 89% on high flow nasal cannula of 40 liters per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 100%. He appeared acutely ill, unable to complete full sentences, alert and oriented x4. Lungs had bilateral crackles and expiratory wheezes. Diagnostic: Leukocytosis 14.7, Hgb/Hct:11.0/ 34.6. platelet 143. ALT 59, AST 78, AlkPhos 164, LDH 1,333. CRP 4.79, negative troponin, TSH 0.2446, Procalcitonin 0.2. Negative Mycoplasma, and Covid PCR times two. ABG shows respiratory alkalosis. Sputum and blood cultures are negative. CT chest with contrast at another hospital showed subpleural fibrotic changes within lungs bilaterally. CT Angiogram 8 days later showed extensive bullous disease throughout both lungs with areas of emphysematous changes, moderate to severe interstitial changes along the periphery of both lungs suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. Chest x-ray reveals diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar airspace disease. Bronchoscopy washout pathology is unremarkable for malignant cells. DISCUSSION: Fluorouracil, Leucovorin with Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and Capecitabine with Oxaliplatin (CAPOX) are the two common therapies for stage III colon cancer [2]. Porcine model in vivo lung perfusion studies concluded dose dependent lung toxicity of fibrin deposits and white blood cell infiltrated at 72 hours with 80mg/L dose of Oxaliplatin, and evidence was proven by severe impaired P/F ratio [3].

Materials and Methods This is a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing CTPA between 23rd March 2020 and 19th April 2020 in a tertiary centre. The presence of PTD, location and involved pulmonary lobes were documented. The pattern and extent of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities including the presence of fibrosis, lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion were evaluated by two experienced observers independently and consensus was achieved for the most disparate results. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using Kappa statistics. Student t-test, Chi square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare imaging features between PTD and non-PTD sub-groups. Results During the study period, 2157 patients were confirmed with COVID-19, 297/2157 (13.8%) had CT imaging, 100/2157 (4.6%) were CTPA studies, 93 studies were analysed, excluding sub-optimal studies. Overall incidence of PTD was 41/93 (44%) with a third of patients showing segmental and subsegmental PTD (n=28/93, 30%,). D-dimer was elevated in 90/93 (96.8%) of cases. High Wells score did not differentiate between PE and non-PE groups (p=0.801). The inter-observer agreement was fair (Kappa=0.659) for parenchymal pattern and excellent (Kappa = 0.816) for severity. Lymph node enlargement was found in 34/93 of cases (36.6%) with 29/34 (85.3%) showing no additional source of infection. Fibrosis was seen in 16/93 (17.2%) of cases, mainly demonstrating fibrotic organising pneumonia. Conclusion There is a high incidence of PTD in COVID -19 patients undergoing CTPA, complicated by lack of a valid risk stratification tool. Our data indicates a much higher suspicion of PTD is needed in severe COVID-19 patients. The concomitant presence of fibrotic features on CT indicates the need for follow-up for evaluation of chronic pulmonary complications.","output":"Pulmonary Thromboembolic Disease in Patients with COVID-19 Undergoing Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA): Incidence and Relationship with Pulmonary Parenchymal Abnormalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To deal with pandemics, evaluating the temporal status of an outbreak is important.

The virus enters the human cells after binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor in target tissues. ACE2 expression is induced in response to inflammation. The colon expression of ACE2 is upregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), highlighting a potential risk of intestinal inflammation in promoting viral entry in the human body. Because mechanisms that regulate ACE2 expression in the intestine are poorly understood and there is a need of anti-SARS-CoV2 therapies, we have settled to investigate whether natural flavonoids might regulate the expression of ACE2 in intestinal models of inflammation. The results of these studies demonstrated that pelargonidin, a natural flavonoid bind and activates the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) in vitro and reverses intestinal inflammation caused by chronic exposure to high fat diet or to the intestinal braking-barrier agent DSS in a AhR-dependent manner. In these two models, development of colon inflammation associated with upregulation of ACE2 mRNA expression. Colon levels of ACE2 mRNA were directly correlated with TNF mRNA levels. In contrast to ACE2 the angiotensin 1-7 receptor MAS was downregulated in the inflamed tissues. Molecular docking studies suggested that pelargonidin binds a fatty acid binding pocket on the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV2 Spike protein. In vitro studies demonstrated that pelargonidin significantly reduces the binding of SARS-CoV2 Spike protein to ACE2 and reduces the SARS-CoV2 replication in a concentration-dependent manner. In summary, we have provided evidence that a natural flavonoid might hold potential in reducing intestinal inflammation and ACE2 induction in the inflamed colon in a AhR-dependent manner.","output":"Discovery of a AhR flavonoid agonist that counter-regulates ACE2 expression in rodent models of inflammation and attenuates ACE2-SARS-CoV2 interaction in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, there have been 81,238 confirmed cases and 3,250 deaths by March 19 in China We aimed to analyze t","output":"Analysis of Risk Factors for the Thromboembolic Events from 88 Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia in Wuhan, China: A Retrospective Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A vortex assisted spraying based fine droplet formation liquid phase microextraction (VA-SFDF-LPME) method was developed to determine chloroquine phosphate at trace levels in human serum, urine and saliva samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with single quadrupole mass analyzer.

The procedure requires a small amount of S-protein/RBD and angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). A high-throughput, simple ELISA technique is employed. Plate-coated-RBDs are allowed to interact with the serum, then soluble ACE2 is added, followed by secondary antibodies and substrate. The key steps in this procedure include (1) serum heat treatment to prevent non-specific interactions, (2) proper use of blank controls to detect side reactions and eliminate secondary antibody cross-reactivity, (3) the addition of an optimal amount of saturating ACE2 to maximize sensitivity and prevent non-competitive co-occurrence of RBD-ACE2 binding and neutralization, and (4) mechanistically derived neutralization calculation using a calibration curve. Even manually, the protocol can be completed in 16 h for >30 serum samples; this includes the 7.5 h of incubation time. This automatable, high-throughput, competitive ELISA assay can screen a large number of sera, and does not require sterile conditions or special containment measures, as live viruses are not employed. In comparison to the gold standard assays (virus neutralization titers (VNT) or plaque reduction neutralization titers (PRNT)), which are laborious and time consuming and require special containment measures due to their use of live viruses. This simple, alternative neutralization efficacy assay can be a great asset for initial vaccine development stages. The assay successfully passed conventional validation parameters (sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy) and results with moderately neutralizing murine sera correlated with VNT assay results (R(2) = 0.975, n = 25), demonstrating high sensitivity.","output":"Detection and Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain Neutralization by a Sensitive Competitive ELISA Assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: We aimed to describe shear wave elastography parameters of non-mass lesions of the breast and to assess the measures of diagnostic accuracy of shear wave elastography in the differentiation of non-mass lesions compared with conventional ultrasound, using histopathologic results as the reference standard. Methods: This retrospective study included breast ultrasound-detected non-mass lesions with a confirmed pathologic diagnosis during a two-year study period. B-mode ultrasound and shear wave elastography were performed for all lesions before biopsy. Ultrasound features, shear wave elastography parameters (mean elasticity and maximum stiffness color), as well as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System categories were recorded for each lesion. Measures of diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and ultrasound + shear wave elastography were also assessed. Results: From a total of 567 breast lesions requiring core-needle biopsy, 49 (8.6%) were considered as non-mass lesions. Based on histopathologic reports, 32 patients (65.3%) had non-high-risk benign lesions, five (10.2%) had high-risk benign lesions, five (10.2%) had ductal carcinoma in situ, and seven (14.3%) had invasive carcinoma. There was no significant difference in patients' age and palpability between benign and malignant lesions (p = 0.16 and p = 0.12, respectively). Mean elasticity values and Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System categories were significantly higher among malignant lesions compared with benign non-mass lesions (both p < 0.001). Furthermore, the addition of shear wave elastography to grayscale ultrasound increased the specificity, positive predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion: The complementary use of shear wave elastography with conventional ultrasound might help in the differentiation of non-mass breast lesions and has the potential to decrease the frequency of unnecessary biopsies performed for benign non-mass lesions.","output":"Can shear wave elastography be utilized as an additional tool for the assessment of non-mass breast lesions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic, the role of judges is first and foremost to adjudicate urgent requests for temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.

Most traditional plasmid delivery vectors use antibiotic genes as a selective marker, easily leading to antibiotic accumulation and gene contamination. In this study, to explore whether the alanine racemase gene (Alr) could be used as a screening marker and develop an efficient oral vaccine against PEDV infection, a recombinant strain was constructed using Lactobacillus casei with Alr deletion (L. casei Alr W56) to deliver the Alr gene and a core-neutralizing epitope (COE) antigen. This recombinant bacterium efficiently induced secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based humoral immune responses via oral vaccination in mice. Compared to the other strains, the recombinant bacteria were able to grow without the addition of D-alanine, revealing that Alr in the plasmid could function normally in defective bacteria. This oral mucosal vaccine would provide a useful strategy to substitute the application of antibiotics in the future and induce efficient immune responses against PEDV infection.","output":"Immunogenicity of Recombinant-Deficient Lactobacillus casei with Complementary Plasmid Expressing Alanine Racemase Gene and Core Neutralizing Epitope Antigen against Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: While the impact on mental health of 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) has been extensively documented, little is known about its influence on subjective fears. Here, we investigate the COVID-19 impact and its related restrictions on fears of patients admitted to a psychiatric Emergency Department (ED) during and post-lockdown. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study on 1477 consultations at the psychiatric ED of the University Hospital of Geneva (HUG) was performed using a mixed-methods analysis. The first analysis section was qualitative, aiming to explore the type of fears, while the second section statistically compared fears (i) during lockdown (16 March 2020C10 May 2020) and (ii) post-lockdown (11 May 2020C5 July 2020). Fears were also explored among different patient-age sub-groups. Results: 334 patients expressed one/more fears. Both in lockdown and post-lockdown, fears mostly pertained to containment measures (isolation, loneliness). When compared lockdown vs. post-lockdown, fears about work status (deteriorating, losing work) prevailed in lockdown (p = 0.029) while hopelessness (powerless feeling, inability to find solutions) in post-lockdown (p = 0.001). Self around COVID-19 (dying, getting sick) fear was relatively more frequent in youth (p = 0.039), while hopelessness in the elderly (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Collectively, these findings highlight that lockdown/post-lockdown periods generated temporally and demographically distinct COVID-19 related fears patterns, with special regard to youth and elderly, two particularly vulnerable populations when faced with sudden and unexpected dramatic events. For this reason, the particular ED front-line service status makes it a privileged observatory that can provide novel insights. From a mental health perspective, these latter can be translated into pragmatic, more personalized prevention strategies to reinforce specific resilience resources and mitigate the current and long-term pandemics impact.","output":"COVID-19 Related Fears of Patients Admitted to a Psychiatric Emergency Department during and Post-Lockdown in Switzerland: Preliminary Findings to Look Ahead for Tailored Preventive Mental Health Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammation is commonly cited as a mechanism of delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE).

However, the extreme polymorphism of HLA loci C an outcome of millions of years of natural selection C reduces the chances that two individuals will carry identical combinations of multilocus HLA genotypes. Further, HLA variability is not homogeneously distributed throughout the world: African populations on average have greater variability than non-Africans, reducing the chances that two unrelated African individuals are HLA identical. Here, we explore how self-identification (often equated with ethnicity or race) and genetic ancestry are related to the chances of finding HLA compatible donors in a large sample from Brazil, a highly admixed country. We query REDOME, Brazils Bone Marrow Registry, and investigate how different criteria for identifying ancestry influence the chances of finding a match. We find that individuals who self-identify as Black and Mixed on average have lower chances of finding matches than those who self-identify as White (up to 57% reduction). We next show that an individuals African genetic ancestry, estimated using molecular markers and quantified as the proportion of an individuals genome that traces its ancestry to Africa, is strongly associated with reduced chances of finding a match (up to 60% reduction). Finally, we document that the strongest reduction in chances of finding a match is associated with having an MHC region of exclusively African ancestry (up to 75% reduction). We apply our findings to a specific condition, for which there is a clinical indication for transplantation: sickle-cell disease. We show that the increased African ancestry in patients with this disease leads to reduced chances of finding a match, when compared to the remainder of the sample, without the condition.

However, a growing body of research indicates that predators are not necessarily limited by such processes in the wild. Density-dependent changes in predator foraging behavior can also generate positive indirect effects but they are rarely included as explicit functions of prey densities in functional response models. With the aim of untangling proximate mechanisms of species interactions in natural communities and improving our ability to quantify interaction strength, we extended the multi-prey version of the Holling disk equation by including density-dependent changes in predator foraging behavior. Our model, based on species traits and behavior, was inspired by the vertebrate community of the arctic tundra, where the main predator (the arctic fox) is an active forager feeding primarily on cyclic small rodent (lemming) and eggs of various tundra-nesting bird species. Short-term positive indirect effects of lemmings on birds have been documented over the circumpolar Arctic but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We used a unique data set, containing high-frequency GPS tracking, accelerometer, behavioral, and experimental data to parameterize the multi-prey model, and a 15-year time series of prey densities and bird nesting success to evaluate interaction strength between species. We found that: (i) prey handling processes play a minor role in our system and (ii) changes in arctic fox daily activity budget and distance traveled can partly explain the predation release on birds observed during lemming peaks. These adjustments in predator foraging behavior with respect to the main prey density thus appear as the dominant mechanism leading to positive indirect effects commonly reported among arctic tundra prey. Density-dependent changes in functional response components have been little studied in natural vertebrate communities and deserve more attention to improve our ability to quantify the strength of species interactions.","output":"A mechanistic model of functional response provides new insights into indirect interactions among arctic tundra prey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim Rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests on nasopharyngeal specimens have been recently made available for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and early studies suggested their potential utilization as rapid screening and diagnostic testing. The present systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to assess available evidence and to explore the reliability of antigenic tests in the management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reported our meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. We searched Pubmed, Embase, and pre-print archive medRxiv.og for eligible studies published up to November 5th, 2020. Raw data included true/false positive and negative tests, and the total number of tests. Sensitivity and specificity data were calculated for every study, and then pooled in a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 measure. Reporting bias was assessed by means of funnel plots and regression analysis. RESULTS: Based on 25 studies, we computed a pooled sensitivity of 72.8% (95%CI 62.4-81.3), a specificity of 99.4% (95%CI 99.0-99.7), with high heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias. More precisely, RAD tests exhibited higher sensitivity on samples with high viral load (i.e. <25 Cycle Threshold; 97.6%; 95%CI 94.1-99.0), compared to those with low viral load (25 Cycle Threshold; 43.6%; 95% 27.6-61.1). DISCUSSION: As the majority of collected reports were either cohort or case-control studies, deprived of preventive power analysis and often oversampling positive tests, overall performances may have been overestimated. Therefore, the massive referral to antigenic tests in place of RT-qPCR is currently questionable, and also their deployment as mass screening test may lead to intolerable share of missing diagnoses.

In this context, biomaterial-based immunomodulatory strategies are being developed to boost antitumor immunity. For the local immunotherapy, macroscale biomaterial scaffolds with 3D network structures show great superiority in the following aspects: facilitating the encapsulation, localized delivery, and controlled release of immunotherapeutic agents and even immunocytes for more efficient immunomodulation. The concentrating immunomodulation in situ could minimize systemic toxicities, but still exert abscopal effects to harness the power of overall anticancer immune response for eradicating malignancy. To promote such promising immunotherapies, the design requirements of macroscale 3D scaffolds should comprehensively consider their physicochemical and biological properties, such as porosity, stiffness, surface modification, cargo release kinetics, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and delivery modes.

Complement is also part of the innate immune system, protecting the host by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. However, complement is multifunctional far beyond infectious defense. It contributes to organ development, such as sculpting neuron synapses, promoting tissue regeneration and repair, and rapidly engaging and synergizing with a number of processes, including hemostasis leading to thromboinflammation. Complement is a double-edged sword. Although it usually protects the host, it may cause tissue damage when dysregulated or overactivated, such as in the systemic inflammatory reaction seen in trauma and sepsis and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Damage-associated molecular patterns generated during ischemia-reperfusion injuries (myocardial infarction, stroke, and transplant dysfunction) and in chronic neurologic and rheumatic disease activate complement, thereby increasing damaging inflammation. Despite the long list of diseases with potential for ameliorating complement modulation, only a few rare diseases are approved for clinical treatment targeting complement. Those currently being efficiently treated include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Rare diseases, unfortunately, preclude robust clinical trials. The increasing evidence for complement as a pathogenetic driver in many more common diseases suggests an opportunity for future complement therapy, which, however, requires robust clinical trials; one ongoing example is COVID-19 disease. The current review aims to discuss complement in disease pathogenesis and discuss future pharmacological strategies to treat these diseases with complement-targeted therapies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The complement system is the hosts defense friend by protecting it from invading pathogens, promoting tissue repair, and maintaining homeostasis. Complement is a double-edged sword, since when dysregulated or overactivated it becomes the hosts enemy, leading to tissue damage, organ failure, and, in worst case, death. A number of acute and chronic diseases are candidates for pharmacological treatment to avoid complement-dependent damage, ranging from the well established treatment for rare diseases to possible future treatment of large patient groups like the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019.","output":"Therapeutic Targeting of the Complement System: From Rare Diseases to Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, limitations were placed on face-to-face encounters in dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) in order to promote physical distancing and reduce viral propagation.

This study evaluated patient characteristics, process measures and outcomes associated with the decline in stroke presentation during the early pandemic. METHODS: Volumes of stroke presentations, intravenous thrombolytic administrations, and mechanical thrombectomies from 52 hospitals from January 1-June 30, 2020 were analyzed with piecewise linear regression and linear spline models. Univariate analysis compared pandemic (case) and control groups defined in relation to the nadir of daily strokes during the study period. Significantly different patient characteristics were further evaluated with logistic regression, and significantly different process measures and outcomes were re-analyzed after propensity score matching. RESULTS: Analysis of 7,389 patients found daily stroke volumes decreased 0.91/day from March 12-26 (P < 0.0001), reaching a nadir 35.0% less than expected, and increased 0.15 strokes/day from March 27 C June 23, 2020 (P < 0.0001).

MT volumes decreased by 1.5/week from February 19-March 31, 2020 (P=0.0039), reaching a nadir 11.3% less than expected. The pandemic group had a higher rate of pre-stroke independent ambulation (P= 0.02, OR=1.60, 95% CI=1.08-2.42), and lower NIHSS on presentation (P=0.04, OR=1.01, 95% CI=1.00-1.02).

Methods: We did a real-world, prospective observational cohort study where recruited high-school students and staff from two high-schools in Montreal (Canada) were followed from January 25th to June 10th, 2021. Twenty-five percent of asymptomatic participants were tested weekly by RADT (nasal) and PCR (gargle). Class contacts of a case were tested. Symptomatic participants were tested by RADT (nasal) and PCR (nasal and gargle). The number of cases/outbreak and number of outbreaks were compared to other high schools in the same area. Results: Overall, 2,099 students and 286 school staff members consented to participate. The overall RADT specificity varied from 99.8 to 100%, with a lower sensitivity, varying from 28.6% in asymptomatic to 83.3% in symptomatic participants. The number of outbreaks was not different in the 2 participating schools compared to other high schools in the same area, but included a greater proportion of asymptomatic cases. Returning students to school after a 7-day quarantine, with a negative PCR on D6-7 after exposure, did not lead to subsequent outbreaks, as shown by serial testing. Of cases for whom the source was known, 37 of 57 (72.5%) were secondary to household transmission, 13 (25%) to intra-school transmission and one to community contacts between students in the same school. Conclusion: RADT did not perform well as a screening tool in asymptomatic individuals. Reinforcing policies for symptom screening when entering schools and testing symptomatic individuals with RADT on the spot may avoid subsequent significant exposures in class.","output":"Evaluation of real-life use of Point-Of-Care Rapid Antigen TEsting for SARS-CoV-2 in schools for outbreak control (EPOCRATES)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lean healthcare aims to manage and improve the processes in the healthcare sector by eliminating everything that adds no value by improving quality of services, ensuring patient safety and facilitating health professionals work to achieve a flexible and reliable organization. Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is considered the starting point of any lean implementation. Some papers report applications of VSM in healthcare services, but there has been less attention paid to their contribution on sustainability indicators. The purpose of this work is to analyze the role of VSM in this context. To do so, a scoping review of works from recent years (2015 to 2019) was done. The results show that most applications of VSM reported are in the tertiary level of care, and the United States of America (USA) is the country which leads most of the applications published. In relation with the development of VSM, a heterogeneity in the maps and the sustainability indicators is remarkable.

In most studies, online ties are treated as representing a single type of relationship. However, our online friendship networks are not homogeneous and could include close connections, e.g. a partner, as well as people we have never met in person. In this paper, we investigate the potentially differential effects of online friendship ties on mental health. Using data from a Russian panel study (N = 4,400), we find that - consistently with previous research - the number of online friends correlates with depression symptoms. However, this is true only for networks that do not exceed Dunbar's number in size (N<= 150) and only for core but not peripheral nodes of a friendship network. The findings suggest that online friendship could encode different types of social relationships that should be treated separately while investigating the association between online social integration and life outcomes, in particular well-being or mental health.","output":"Core but not peripheral online social ties is a protective factor against depression: evidence from a nationally representative sample of young adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neonatal COVID-19 is rare and mainly results from postnatal transmission.

A partial cDNA clone of the M segment which contains G1 and G2 glycoprotein coding sequences but lacks most of the NSM sequences was inserted into the genome of vaccinia virus under the control of an early vaccinia promoter. Cells infected with the recombinant virus were found to synthesize two polypeptides with molecular weights of 65,000 (G1) and 55,000 (G2) that reacted specifically with antibody against PTV. Studies using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that these proteins accumulated intracellularly in the perinuclear region. The results of endoglycosidase H digestion of these glycoproteins suggested that both G1 and G2 glycoproteins were transported from the RER to the Golgi complex. These proteins were not chased out from the Golgi region during a 6-hr incubation in the presence of cycloheximide. Surface immune precipitation and 125I-protein A binding assays also demonstrated that the majority of the G1 and G2 glycoproteins are retained intracellularly.

This leads to disruption of normal endothelial function, initiating a state of failing normal clotting physiology. Massively increased levels of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) lead to overwhelming platelet activation, as well as activation of the enzymatic (intrinsic) clotting pathway. In addition, there is an impaired fibrinolysis, caused by, amongst others, increased levels of alpha-(2) antiplasmin. The end result is hypercoagulation (proven by thromboelastography(?) (TEG(?))) and reduced fibrinolysis, inevitably leading to a difficult-to-overcome hypercoagulated physiological state. Platelets in circulation also plays a significant role in clot formation, but they themselves may also drive hypercoagulation when they are overactivated due to the interactions of their receptors with the endothelium, immune cells or circulating inflammatory molecules. From the literature it is clear that the role of platelets in severely ill COVID-19 patients has been markedly underestimated or even ignored. We here highlight the value of early management of severe COVID-19 coagulopathy as guided by TEG(?), microclot and platelet mapping. We also argue that the failure of clinical trials, where the efficacy of prophylactic versus therapeutic clexane (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)) were not always successful, which may be because the significant role of platelet activation was not taken into account during the planning of the trial. We conclude that, because of the overwhelming alteration of clotting, the outcome of any trial evaluating an any single anticoagulant, including thrombolytic, would be negative. Here we suggest the use of the degree of platelet dysfunction and presence of microclots in circulation, together with TEG(?), might be used as a guideline for disease severity. A multi-pronged approach, guided by TEG(?) and platelet mapping, would be required to maintain normal clotting physiology in severe COVID-19 disease.","output":"TEG(?), Microclot and Platelet Mapping for Guiding Early Management of Severe COVID-19 Coagulopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The objective of this study is to determine the clinical and surgical outcomes following lumbar laminectomy. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical records of neurosurgical patients who underwent first-time, bilateral, 1-3 level laminectomies for degenerative lumbar disease. Patients with discectomy, complete facetectomy, and fusion were excluded. RESULTS Five hundred patients were followed for an average of 46.79 months. Following lumbar laminectomy, patients experienced statistically significant improvement in back pain, neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, weakness, and sensory deficits. The rate of intraoperative durotomy was 10.00%; however, 1.60% experienced a postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak. The risk of experiencing at least one postoperative complication with a lumbar laminectomy was 5.60%. Seventy-two patients (14.40%) required reoperations for progression of degenerative disease over a mean of 3.40 years. The most common symptoms prior to reoperation included back pain (54.17%), radiculopathy (47.22%), weakness (18.06%), sensory deficit (15.28%), and neurogenic claudication (19.44%). The relative risk of reoperation for patients with postoperative back pain was 6.14 times higher than those without postoperative back pain (P < 0.001). Of the 72 patients undergoing reoperations, 55.56% underwent decompression alone, while 44.44% underwent decompression and posterolateral fusions. When considering all-time reoperations, the lifetime risk of requiring a fusion after a lumbar laminectomy based on this study (average follow-up of 46.79 months) was 8.0%. CONCLUSION Patients experienced statistically significant improvements in back pain, neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, motor weakness, and sensory deficit following lumbar laminectomy.

These viruses belong to two lineages: one from Guangdong (GD/P) and the other from Guangxi (GX/P). The GD/P viruses are particularly intriguing as the amino-acid sequence of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein is very similar to that of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (97.4%)2. This characteristic suggests that GD/P viruses are capable of binding human ACE2 receptor and may therefore be able to mediate infection of human cells. Whereas all six GX/P genomes were deposited as annotated sequences in GenBank, none of the two GD/P genomes assembled in previous studies2,3 are currently available. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD/P virus of poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the Illumina sequencing data were identified. The GD/P2S dataset2 contains reads that are identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. In the four other GD/P datasets1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD/P sequences. Such low levels of polymorphism may reasonably be accounted for by sequencing errors alone, thus raising the possibility that the five pangolins seized in Guangdong in March 2019 were infected by the same virus strain, most probably during their captivity.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2-like virus found in captive pangolins from Guangdong should be better sequenced"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Common cold is among the main reasons patients visit a medical facility.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between October 22, 2020, and January 16, 2021. Patients with cold symptoms who visited the two dispensing pharmacies and met the eligibility criteria were interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The pharmacists at each store and a physician classified the patients into two groups: the potentially inappropriate prescribing group and the appropriate prescribing group. RESULTS: Of the 150 selected patients, 14 were excluded and 136 were included in the analysis. Males accounted for 44.9% of the total study population, and the median patient age was 34 years (interquartile range [IQR], 27C42).

The authors conducted a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy versus ICI. METHODS MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to April 2020. Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy of first-line ICI or chemoimmunotherapy and reporting efficacy outcomes (OS, progression-free survival [PFS], and the overall response rate [ORR]) stratified by programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status were included. NMA with a Bayesian random effects model was performed. RESULTS A total of 12 eligible trials comprising 7845 patients were included. In patients who were negative for PD-L1 (tumor proportion score [TPS] <1%), NMA comparing chemoimmunotherapy with dual-agent ICI failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference with regard to OS, PFS, or the ORR. In patients with low PD-L1 (TPS 1%-49%), there was no statistically significant difference observed between chemoimmunotherapy compared with either single-agent ICI or dual-agent ICI with regard to OS or the ORR. In patients with high PD-L1 (TPS 50%), chemoimmunotherapy was found to be associated with an improved PFS and ORR compared with single-agent ICI, but not with dual-agent ICI. No differences in OS were observed with chemoimmunotherapy when compared with either single-agent or dual-agent ICIs. CONCLUSIONS Although chemoimmunotherapy appears to improve the ORR and PFS in patients with PD-L1-high tumors when compared with single-agent ICI, it does not appear to confer an OS benefit over single-agent or dual-agent ICI for patients with advanced NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 status. Prospective trials are needed to validate these findings.","output":"Comparative efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy versus immunotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A network meta-analysis of randomized trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unlike many mammalian vital organs, the lung exhibits a robust, multifaceted regenerative response to severe injuries such as influenza infection, which primarily targets epithelial cells in the airways and alveoli. Quiescent lung-resident epithelial progenitors proliferate, migrate, and differentiate following lung injury, participating in two distinct reparative pathways: functionally beneficial regeneration and dysplastic tissue remodeling. Intrapulmonary airway-resident basal-like p63+ progenitors are one such progenitor cell type that migrates from the airways to form ectopic bronchiolar tissue in the alveoli, generating honeycomb-like cysts that fail to resolve after injury. Though this phenomenon is now well described, the cell-autonomous signals that drive dysplastic alveolar remodeling remain uncertain, a question made especially salient by observations that p63+ progenitors also expand dramatically upon diffuse alveolar damage in humans resulting from a variety of insults including SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. Here we show that the master basal cell transcription factor Np63 is required for the immense migratory capacity of intrapulmonary p63+ progenitors and consequently for the dysplastic repair pathway manifest by these cells. We further demonstrate that Np63 restricts the fate plasticity of intrapulmonary p63+ progenitors by regulating their epigenetic landscape, and that loss of Np63 alters the deposition of active and repressive histone modifications at key differentiation gene loci, allowing Np63KO progenitors to proceed towards airway or alveolar differentiation depending on their surrounding environment. These insights into the regulatory mechanisms of dysplastic repair and intrapulmonary p63+ progenitor fate choice highlight potential therapeutic targets to promote more effective alveolar regeneration following severe lung injuries.","output":"Np63 drives dysplastic alveolar remodeling and restricts epithelial plasticity upon severe lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main challenges for the automatic detection of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from computed tomography (CT) scans of an individual are: a lack of large datasets, ambiguity in the characteristics of COVID-19 and the detection techniques having low sensitivity (or recall). Hence, developing diagnostic techniques with high recall and automatic feature extraction using the available data are crucial for controlling the spread of COVID-19. This paper proposes a novel stacked ensemble capable of detecting COVID-19 from a patients chest CT scans with high recall and accuracy. A systematic approach for designing a stacked ensemble from pre-trained computer vision models using transfer learning (TL) is presented. A novel diversity measure that results in the stacked ensemble with high recall and accuracy is proposed. The stacked ensemble proposed in this paper considers four pre-trained computer vision models: the visual geometry group (VGG)-19, residual network (ResNet)-101, densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet)-169 and wide residual network (WideResNet)-50-2. The proposed model was trained and evaluated with three different chest CT scans. As recall is more important than precision, the trade-offs between recall and precision were explored in relevance to COVID-19.

As this article will discuss, the trouble with this subject is that it has not been given the attention it requires, which has led to a hopelessly fragmented approach in regulating this aspect of air cargo. The High Level Conference on Aviation Security, convened by the International Civil Aviation Organization from 12 to 14 September 2012 in Montreal, focused on three overarching themes - cargo security, sustainability of security measures and innovation in addressing threats to aviation security. The Conference did not address the carriage by air of human remains from a security perspective. However, if one were to apply one of the key principles recognized by the Conference C that each State should ensure that appropriate security controls, including screening where applicable, are applied to cargo and mail, prior to their being loaded onto an aircraft engaged in passenger commercial air transport operations, the operative words would be security controls which bring to bear the reality that different States could have different security controls and that they should be harmonized.

BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV2 influenced the evolution of governmental and hospital policy worldwide, which might eventually impact many aspects. The incidence of many diseases in the Emergency Department (ED), especially traumatic brain injury (TBI), has been an area of interest. DESIGN/METHODS: Retrospective study comparing TBI incidence before and during COVID-19 pandemic era starting from the declaration of national pandemic date (March 16, 2020) until June 14, 2020 with the comparison of the same period in the previous year. RESULTS: There was an increase in admission rate due to TBI during COVID-19 pandemic compared with the previous year (157/752 (20.9%) vs 106/766 (13.8%), p < 0.001, respectively). While the range of age was similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 era (37.9  14.8 vs 38.6  15.4 years, p = 0.712), male was higher in percentage to experience the injury (131/157 (83.4%) vs 67/106 (63.2%), p < 0.001). During the pandemic era, road traffic injury (97/157 (61.8%) vs 56/106 (52.8%), p = 0.149) as well as moderate-to-severe brain injury tended to increase (30/157 (19.1%) vs 17/106 (16.0%) p = 0.524) albeit statistically insignificant. Although the mortality rate was similar (12/157 (7.6%) vs 9/106 (8.5%), p = 0.804), higher hospitalization rate was observed in the pandemic era (81/157 (51.2%) vs 37/106 (34.9%) p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: TBI incidence remained increasing despite entering the COVID-19 era. These phenomena required further investigation and analysis that may possibly be unrelated with the COVID-19, but due to the change of the government policy and its impact, such as the more quiet road after national social distancing.","output":"Increasing Traumatic Brain Injury Incidence during COVID-19 Pandemic in the Emergency Department of Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital-A National Referral Hospital in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the coronavirus has led to containment policies in many places, with concomitant shifts in routine activities.

Although most patients complain of moderate or severe pain, these symptoms are generally underestimated and appropriate treatment is not applied. This study aims to guide physicians in selecting and ranking various alternatives for the treatment of pain in COVID-19 patients. However, the choice of treatment for pain requires the consideration of many different conflicting criteria. Therefore, we have studied this problem as a multicriteria decision-making problem. Throughout the solution procedure, first, the criteria and subcriteria affecting the preferences are defined. Then, weight values are determined with respect to these criteria, as they have different degrees of importance for the problem. At this stage, hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) are used, and thus, experts can convey their ideas more accurately.

The mortality rate from Covid-19 among people of black African descent in English hospitals has been shown to be 3.5 times higher when compared to rates among white British people. A Public Health England report revealed that Covid-19 was more likely to be diagnosed among black ethnic groups compared to white ethnic groups with the highest mortality occurring among BAME persons and persons living in the more deprived areas. People of BAME background account for 4.5% of the English population and make up 21% of the National Health Service (NHS) workforce.

The differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and PCGs (DEPCGs) between PCa and normal prostate tissues were screened from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The DEPCGs were functionally annotated in terms of the enriched pathways. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of 104 PCa samples identified 15 co-expression modules, of which the Turquoise module was negatively correlated with cancer and included 5 key lncRNAs and 47 PCGs. KEGG pathway analyses of the core 47 PCGs showed significant enrichment in classic PCa-related pathways, and overlapped with the enriched pathways of the DEPCGs.

The modeling approach is to integrate analytical method and experimental method. The local gravity model is derived from allometric scaling and global gravity model, and then the parameters of the local gravity model are estimated by observational data and least squares calculation. The main results are as below. The local gravity model based on power law decay can effectively describe the diffusion patterns and process of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, and the goodness of fit of the gravity model based on negative exponential decay to the observational data is not satisfactory. Further, the goodness of fit of the model to data entirely became better and better over time, the size elasticity coefficient increases first and then decreases, and the distance attenuation exponent decreases first and then increases. Moreover, the significance of spatial autoregressive coefficient in the model is low, and the confidence level is less than 80%. The conclusions can be reached as follows. (1) The spatial diffusion of COVID-19 of Hubei bears long range effect, and the size of a city and the distance of the city to Wuhan affect the total number of confirmed cases. (2) Wuhan direct transmission is the main process in the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 in Hubei at the early stage, and the horizontal transmission between regions is not significant.

We compare the demographics and outcomes of patients treated during lockdown to a matched period from 2019. Findings have important implications for service development. METHODS: A split-site service was introduced, with a COVID-19 free site treating the majority of trauma patients. Polytrauma, spinal, and paediatric trauma patients, plus COVID-19 confirmed or suspicious cases, were managed at another site. Prospective data on all trauma patients undergoing surgery at either site between 16 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 was collated and compared with retrospective review of the same period in 2019. Patient demographics, injury, surgical details, length of stay (LOS), COVID-19 status, and outcome were compared. RESULTS: There were 1,004 urgent orthopaedic trauma patients (604 in 2019; 400 in 2020). Significant reductions in time to theatre and LOS stay were observed. COVID-19 positive status was confirmed in 4.5% (n = 18). The COVID-19 mortality rate was 1.8% (n = 7). Day-case surgery comprised 47.8% (n = 191), none testing positive for COVID-19 or developing clinically significant COVID-19 symptoms requiring readmission, at a minimum of 17 days follow-up.

This study's objective was to apply morphoproteomics to pulmonary lung sections from a forensic autopsy of an untreated COVID-19 victim, so that we may better define its biology from the perspective of its interaction with the host and provide options for therapeutic targets. DESIGN Morphoproteomic analysis from a case study of this COVID-19 pulmonary infection included immunohistochemical probes to detect phosphorylated p-STAT3 (Tyr 705), as part of the interleukin (IL)-6 pathway; cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes, Programmed Death (PD)-1 receptor+ lymphoid cells, CD56+ NK lymphoid cells, CD163+ (M2 polarized monocytes/macrophages), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression as part of the host response to interaction with the COVID-19 virus. RESULTS Representative sections of the COVID-19 victim's lung showed: nuclear expression of p-STAT3 (Tyr 705) in many of the alveolar pneumocytes and in occasional endothelial cells; COX-2 expression in the alveolar pneumocytes; a relative paucity of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes; absence of CD56+ NK lymphoid cells; abundance of intra-alveolar and alveolar interstitial CD163+ macrophages/monocytes; PD-L1 expression on occasional macrophages, focally on collections of alveolar pneumocytes, and on cells in the alveolar interstitium; and rare PD-1+ lymphocytes in similar regions as CD8+ lymphocytes. CONCLUSION Morphoproteomics and microanatomical features coincide with the etiopathogenic features of pulmonary coronavirus infection and the host response.

RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression levels of CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a in synovial fluid. Cell transfections were performed to investigate the interactions between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed to assess the effects of CTBP1-AS2 on the methylation of miR-130a. Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to evaluate the roles of CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a in regulating proliferation of chondrocytes. RESULTS The results showed that CTBP1-AS2 was upregulated in OA and inversely correlated with miR-130a. In chondrocytes of OA patients, overexpression of CTBP1-AS2 led to increased methylation of miR-130a gene and downregulated expression of miR-130a, while overexpression of miR-130a did not affect the expression of CTBP1-AS2. In contrast, no interaction between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a was observed in chondrocytes from healthy adults. Analysis of chondrocyte proliferation showed that overexpression of miR-130a led to increased proliferation rate of chondrocytes extracted from OA patients. Overexpression of CTBP1-AS2 led to decreased proliferation rate of chondrocytes and reversed the effects of overexpressing miR-130a. CONCLUSION Therefore, CTBP1-AS2 is upregulated in OA and may increase the methylation of miR-130a gene to inhibit chondrocyte proliferation.Key Points? CTBP1-AS2 is overexpressed in OA and may downregulate miR-130a through methylation to suppress the proliferation of chondrocytes.? The interaction between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a is indirect and mediated by certain pathological mediators.","output":"LncRNA CTBP1-AS2 is upregulated in osteoarthritis and increases the methylation of miR-130a gene to inhibit chondrocyte proliferation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pakistan is an agrarian nation that is among the most vulnerable countries to climatic variations. Around 20% of its GDP is produced by agriculture, and livestock-related production contributes more than half of this value. However, few empirical studies have been conducted to determine the vulnerability and knowledge of livestock herders, and particularly the smaller herders. Comprehending individual perceptions of and vulnerabilities to climate change (CC) will enable effective formulation of CC mitigation strategies. This study intended to explore individual perceptions of and vulnerabilities to CC based on a primary dataset of 405 small livestock herders from three agro-ecological zones of Punjab. The results showed that livestock herders perceptions about temperature and rainfall variations/patterns coincide with the meteorological information of the study locations. The vulnerability indicators show that Dera Ghazi Khan district is more vulnerable than the other two zones because of high exposure and sensitivity to CC, and lower adaptive capacity. However, all zones experience regular livelihood risks due to livestock diseases and deaths resulting from extreme climatic conditions, lower economic status, and constrained institutional and human resource capabilities, thus leading to increased vulnerability. The results indicate that low-cost local approaches are needed, such as provision of improved veterinary services, increased availability of basic equipment, small-scale infrastructure projects, and reinforcement of informal social safety nets. These measures would support cost-effective and sustainable decisions to enable subsistence livestock herders to adopt climate smart practices.","output":"Perceptions, Vulnerability and Adaptation Strategies for Mitigating Climate Change Effects among Small Livestock Herders in Punjab, Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus (nCoV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes the virus that causes SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. However, infection source, transmission route, and host of nCoV have not yet been thoroughly characterized. In some cases, nCoV presented a limited person-to-person transmission. Therefore, early diagnosis of nCoV may be of importance for reducing the spread of disease in public. Methods for nCoV diagnosis involve smear dyeing inspection, culture identification, and real-time PCR detection, all of which are proved highly effective. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time PCR for diagnosing nCoV infection. Fifteen articles conformed to the inclusion and exclusion criteria for further meta-analysis on the basis of a wide range of publications searched from databases involving PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Medline, ISI. We analyzed the stability and publication bias as well as examined the heterogeneity inspection of real-time PCR detection in contrast to smear staining and culture identification. The fixed-effect model was adopted in our meta-analysis. Our result demonstrated that the combination of real-time PCR and smear diagnostics yielded an odds ratio (OR) = 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.51-2.41, Z = 5.43, P < 0.05, while the combination of real-time PCR and culture identification yielded OR = 2.44, 95%CI = 1.77-3.37, Z = 5.41, P < 0.05.

Findings confirm that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major involvement of the lungs and heart. Acute COVID-19 pneumonia has features of a distinctive acute interstitial pneumonia with: a diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) component, coupled with microvascular involvement with intra- and extra-vascular fibrin deposition and intravascular trapping of neutrophils, and, frequently, with formation of microthombi in arterioles. Major pulmonary thromboemboli with pulmonary infarcts and/or hemorrhage occurred in 5 of the 23 patients. Two of the Houston cases had interstitial pneumonia with DAD pattern. One of the Houston cases had multiple bilateral segmental pulmonary thromboemboli with infarcts and hemorrhages coupled with, in non-hemorrhagic areas, a distinctive interstitial lymphocytic pneumonitis with intra-alveolar fibrin deposits and no hyaline membranes, possibly representing a transition form to acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP). Multifocal acute injury of cardiac myocytes was frequently observed. Lymphocytic myocarditis was reported in 1 case. In addition to major pulmonary pathology, the three Houston cases had evidence of lymphocytic pericarditis, multifocal acute injury of cardiomyocytes without inflammatory cellular infiltrates, depletion of splenic white pulp, focal hepatocellular degeneration and rare glomerular capillary thrombosis. Each had evidence of chronic cardiac disease: hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (420 gram heart), dilated cardiomyopathy (1070 gram heart), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (670 gram heart). All three subjects were obese (BMIs of 33.8, 51.65 and 35.2 Kg/m2). Overall, the autopsy findings support the concept that the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 disease involves direct viral-induced injury of multiple organs, including heart and lungs, coupled with the consequences of a procoagulant state with coagulopathy.","output":"EMERGING SPECTRUM OF CARDIOPULMONARY PATHOLOGY OF THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19): REPORT OF THREE AUTOPSIES FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS AND REVIEW OF AUTOPSY FINDINGS FROM OTHER UNITED STATES CITIES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Making decisions about how to fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic without completely disrupting our activity requires better tools that inform the extent of transmission Understanding risk factors of virus susceptibility could help us to establish intervention policies The objective of our work is to assess risk factors and seroprevalence in our patients in order to plan evidence-based strategies Design: Multicenter retrospective, anonymized cohort analysis performed in 11 private clinics belonging to the IVIRMA group in Spain Materials and Methods: Between April 27th and June 26th, 2020, 6140 individuals undergoing an assisted reproductive treatment were tested for SARS-CoV-2 Before tested, a symptomatic triage had been carried out and only patients classified with a negative triage attended the clinic for further testing SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies in serum were detected using EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA kit (Epitope Diagnostics, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions We divided our clinics into two different geographic areas: region A (seroprevalence 5%) based on the results obtained in our population Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 19 0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) Results: Of the 6140 persons tested for SARS-CoV-2, 4470 (72 8%) were women and 1670 (27 2%) men Over the course of the study, 42 (0 7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies Seropositivity does not vary significantly with age and we did not observe differences regarding gender or blood group However, we found that individuals with negative rhesus (Rh) factor had a slightly greater risk of being seropositive (RR 2 5 [129-2 13]) than those Rh positive There are no differences in the percentage of people in the active phase of the disease depending on the geographical area (RR 0 8 [0 43-1 52]) However, when we analysed the data according to time, the rate of positive individuals does not vary throughout the weeks in region A, while for the region B the incidence of IgM drops significantly (p=0 003) from the first week of the study (3 7%) to the last (0 0%), which would indicate decline of the virus transmission over time When we analysed the seropositivity rate according the partners serological status, the data showed that there is approximately 10 times more incidence of being positive IgG in couples than in random population Conclusions: We show that in areas with higher prevalence of the disease, the percentage of IgM positive individuals is also higher Also, there is a greater risk of being infected when the couple is already seropositive No differences were observed according the age and there is higher prevalence in Rh-negative individuals","output":"RISK FACTOR ANALYSIS FOR SARS-COV-2 SEROPOSITIVITY WITHIN ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To observe the application and the roles of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

Here we report that TRIM56 E3 ligase-induced monoubiquitination of cGAS is important for cytosolic DNA sensing and IFN production to induce anti-DNA viral immunity. TRIM56 induces the Lys335 monoubiquitination of cGAS, resulting in a marked increase of its dimerization, DNA-binding activity, and cGAMP production. Consequently, TRIM56-deficient cells are defective in cGAS-mediated IFN production upon herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection. Furthermore, TRIM56-deficient mice show impaired IFN production and high susceptibility to lethal HSV-1 infection but not to influenza A virus infection.

METHODS: ACE2 sequences of various species were aligned with human ACE2, accordingly, homology models for different species were constructed. Then, S-protein-ACE2 complexes were constructed using the generated homology models. The molecular dynamics simulations and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) were carried out to study the dynamical behavior of the generated S-ACE2 virtual complexes. Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) and Radius of Gyration (Rg) were calculated to evaluate protein stability and compactness. RESULTS: The binding free energies of S protein with ACE2 from Procyon lotor and Camelus dromedarius are about equal to that of humans. By comparing the free binding energies it were possible to identify potential viral hosts that could transmit the virus to human (risk of cross-species transmission).

The rapidly developing pandemic has posed great challenges to diagnosis of this novel infection. However, little is known about the metatranscriptomic characteristics of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We analyzed metatranscriptomics in 187 patients (62 cases with COVID-19 and 125 with non-COVID-19 pneumonia). Transcriptional aspects of three core elements - pathogens, the microbiome, and host responses - were interrogated. Based on the host transcriptional signature, we built a host gene classifier and examined its potential for diagnosing COVID-19 and indicating disease severity. RESULTS: The airway microbiome in COVID-19 patients had reduced alpha diversity, with 18 taxa of differential abundance. Potentially pathogenic microbes were also detected in 47% of the COVID-19 cases, 58% of which were respiratory viruses. Host gene analysis revealed a transcriptional signature of 36 differentially expressed genes significantly associated with immune pathways such as cytokine signaling. The host gene classifier built on such a signature exhibited potential for diagnosing COVID-19 (AUC of 0.75-0.89) and indicating disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to those with non-COVID-19 pneumonias, COVID-19 patients appeared to have a more disrupted airway microbiome with frequent potential concurrent infections, and a special trigger host immune response in certain pathways such as interferon gamma signaling.

When burn injuries occur at work, there is an additional unfamiliar stress of income loss and dependence on a third-party payer. Patients with claims through the Bureau of Workers Compensation (BWC) report frustration and overall dissatisfaction in working with the BWC to achieve claim coverage. Of workers who are off of work more than 5 days due to a work-related injury, 10% are diagnosed with depression in the 12 months following the injury (Carnide, 2016). In our clinic, screening for depression and anxiety is done through the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), a valid four-item assessment tool that utilizes a Likert style measurement to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety (Kroenke et al., 2009). This is a health questionnaire that determines a patients risk for depression and anxiety as mild, moderate, or severe. Objective To determine if there is a correlation between insurance type and PHQ-4 scores in burn patients. We hypothesized that risk of depression and anxiety could differ based on payer, which can affect a patients access to care, referral approval, and financial burden of treatment. Additional focus was placed on BWC patients due to their reported frustrations and dissatisfaction in working with BWC and the established correlation between depression and missed work. Methods A quality improvement project was initiated based on increased rates of referrals for psychological evaluation and treatment in BWC patients. A retrospective review was conducted of outpatient burn clinic visits where a PHQ-4 questionnaire was completed in the past 3 fiscal years: 7/1/2019-6/30/2021. Results Total of 1932 visits with PHQ-4 collection were reviewed within the above specified time frame. The rates of moderate and high-risk scores for anxiety and depression were highest with BWC and Medicaid patients. Patients with private insurance showed a lower risk of moderate and severe depression. However, there was no significant difference when comparing BWC verses all other insurance. Table 1 Conclusions Overall there was no significant difference in risk of anxiety and depression with BWC versus other insurance coverage based on PHQ-4 scores. Limitations of the study include no distinction of extent of burn injury/burn depth, burn care/treatments, length of hospital stay if any;no distinction was made amongst BWC patients and their length of time off of work.

METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study performed at a tertiary care centre in south-west Germany between 1997 and 2000. We included 3052 study participants who underwent coronary angiography. The primary outcome measures were cardiovascular risk factors, lymphocyte subtypes, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Serum cortisol was associated with an adverse cardiovascular risk profile, but there was no significant association with coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome. In a subsample of 2107 participants, serum cortisol was positively associated with certain lymphocyte subsets, including CD16+CD56+ (natural killer) cells (P < 0.001). Comparing the fourth versus the first serum cortisol quartile, the crude Cox proportional hazard ratios (with 95% CIs) were 1.22 (1.00-1.47) for all-cause and 1.32 (1.04-1.67) for cardiovascular mortality, respectively. After adjustments for various cardiovascular risk factors, these associations were attenuated to 0.93 (0.76-1.14) for all-cause, and 0.97 (0.76-1.25) for cardiovascular mortality, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant associations with classic cardiovascular risk factors and natural killer cells, serum cortisol was not a significant and independent predictor of mortality in patients referred to coronary angiography.

Lately, a trend of resurgence threatened the developed countries. A measles outbreak occurred in the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) between March and April 2019, which infected 29 airport staff. During the outbreak, multiple measures were taken including daily situation updates, setting up a public enquiry platform on March 23, and an emergent vaccination program targeting unprotected staff. The outbreak was put out promptly. The effectiveness of these measures was unclear. METHODS: We quantified the transmissibility of outbreak in HKIA by the effective reproduction number, R(eff)(t), and basic reproduction number, R(0)(t). The reproduction number was modelled as a function of its determinants that were statistically examined, including lags in hospitalization, situation update, and level of public awareness. Then, we considered a hypothetical no-measure scenario when improvements in reporting and public enquiry were absent and calculated the number of infected airport staff. RESULTS: Our estimated average R(0) is 10.09 (95% CI: 1.73?36.50). We found that R(0)(t) was positively associated with lags in hospitalization and situation update, while negatively associated with the level of public awareness. The average predicted basic reproduction number, r(0), was 14.67 (95% CI: 9.01?45.32) under the no-measure scenario, which increased the average R(0) by 77.57% (95% CI: 1.71?111.15). The total number of infected staff would be 179 (IQR: 90?339, 95% CI: 23?821), namely the measure induced 8.42-fold (95% CI: 0.21?42.21) reduction in the total number of infected staff.

Employing 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone administration, serum creatinine decreased from 365 mol/L to 125 mol/L at 11 days and the proteinuria-hematuria as well as the purpura, paresthesia resolved. Three months later at stabile eGFR of 56 ml/min/1.73 m2 methylprednisolone was withdrawn and a rituximab-venetoclax treatment was initiated without side effects.

We define the informations injuriousness as the people practicing the information being injured and leaving the system. Some informed people practice the information and are active, while others do not practice and are inactive.

The stability of the nonlinear system is thoroughly studied. Analyzing the reproduction number of the injurious information, we find that in general parameter space, when there are people in an informed compartment, it is not always necessary to consider their recovery resource allocation. Instead, only when their proportion reaches a critical point should it be allocated. Unless the people in an informed compartment form a certain proportion, we can take a laissez-faire attitude towards them. In a more realistic parameter space, once inactive informed people exist, they should be allocated recovery resources. On the one hand, when the recovering rate rises, the focus on both groups of informed people is necessary for more situations. On the other hand, when the rate of active informed people leaving the system rises, ignoring active informed people benefits removing the injurious information in more cases.

Herein we aimed to compare the technical feasibility and efficacy of EBL and endoclip use in intraluminal closure of colon perforation, in an ex vivo model. METHODS Standardized colonic perforations were created using fresh porcine colon and subsequently closed by full-thickness interrupted sutures, endoclip (QuickClip2(TM)), or EBL. Each closure site was tested with compressed air by using a digital pressure monitor for evaluating leak pressure. RESULTS No significant differences were noted between the endoclip and EBL in leak pressures. Mean ( SD) pressures for air leakage from the perforations closed using the different devices were as follows: normal colon samples, 52.0  13.2 mmHg; perforations closed with hand-sewn sutures, 32.3  8.3 mmHg; perforations closed with endoclipping, 53.5  22.7 mmHg; and perforations closed with EBL, 50.4  12.5 mmHg. Time taken for closure by EBL was significantly less than that for closure by endoclipping (3.2  1.7 min vs 6.8  1.3 min, P < 0.01). Further, the number of devices used to achieve complete closure in the EBL group was lower than that with endoclipping (1.6  0.5 vs 3.7  0.8, P < 0.01).

Significant events and measures for air and maritime transport between January and August 2020 were selected. Lessons learned are discussed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ?GD has been operating in a field of tension between the dynamics of scientific knowledge, political decision-making, social acceptance and consent. There are specific challenges at points of entry such as airports and seaports. These include staff shortages and the need to implement measures with a high organisational effort at very short notice such as health authority passenger checks carried out on aircraft, the establishment of test centres at points of entry and control of compliance with quarantine measures. Aggravating the situation, passenger lists, which are necessary for effective contact tracing, are often not available or incomplete. There is also a lack of digital tools for contact tracing but also, for example, the exchange of personal data within the ?GD. Further difficulties in outbreak management arise from the cramped conditions on board ships and from the potential psychological stress on crew members and passengers, which have not yet been sufficiently considered. In view of all these challenges, it is paramount to strengthen the German Public Health Service in general and at points of entry and to intensify the exchange between the national, federal state and local levels.","output":"Flug- und Schiffsverkehr w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie in Deutschland: Herausforderungen fr den ?ffentlichen Gesundheitsdienst"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main binding site for SARS-COV-2 spike protein in human body is human Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein receptor.

METHODS Nine men cycled at approximately 55% VO2peak for 75 min and ingested 3.2 mL  kg(-1) aliquots of 37 C fluid or ICE after 15, 30, and 45 min of exercise. Metabolic heat production (M-W), rectal temperature (Tre), mean skin temperature (Tsk), whole-body sweat loss (WBSL), local sweat rate (LSR), and skin blood flow (SkBF) were measured throughout. Net heat loss (HLnet) and heat storage (S) were estimated using partitional calorimetry. RESULTS Relative to the 37 C trial, M-W was similar (P = 0.81) with ICE ingestion; however, the 200  20 kJ greater Hfluid (P < 0.001) with ICE ingestion was overcompensated by a 381  199-kJ lower Esk (P < 0.001). Net heat loss (HLnet) was consequently 131  120 kJ lower (P = 0.01) and S was greater (P = 0.05) with ICE ingestion compared with 37 C fluid ingestion. Concurrently, LSR and WBSL were lower by 0.16  0.14 mg  min(-1)  cm(-2) (P < 0.01) and 191  122 g (P < 0.001), respectively, and SkBF tended to be lower (P = 0.06) by 5.4%maxAU  13.4%maxAU in the ICE trial. Changes in Tre and Tsk were similar throughout exercise with ICE compared to 37 C fluid ingestion. CONCLUSIONS Relative to 37 C, ICE ingestion caused disproportionately greater reductions in Esk relative to Hfluid, resulting in a lower HLnet and greater S. Mechanistically, LSR and possibly SkBF were suppressed independently of Tre or Tsk, reaffirming the concept of human abdominal thermoreception.

Because ICU healthcare workers are exposed to aerosol-generating procedures, ensuring optimal personal protective equipment (PPE) preparedness is important. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate PPE preparedness across ICUs in six Asia-Pacific countries during the initial phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organization as guideline adherence, training healthcare workers, procuring stocks, and responding appropriately to suspected cases. METHODS: A cross-sectional Web-based survey was circulated to 633 level II/III ICUs of Australia, New Zealand (NZ), Singapore, Hong Kong (HK), India, and the Philippines. FINDINGS: Two hundred sixty-three intensivists responded, representing 231 individual ICUs eligible for analysis. Response rates were 68-100% in all countries except India, where it was 24%. Ninety-seven percent of ICUs either conformed to or exceeded World Health Organization recommendations for PPE practice. Fifty-nine percent ICUs used airborne precautions irrespective of aerosol generation procedures. There were variations in negative-pressure room use (highest in HK/Singapore), training (best in NZ), and PPE stock awareness (best in HK/Singapore/NZ). High-flow nasal oxygenation and noninvasive ventilation were not options in most HK (66.7% and 83.3%, respectively) and Singapore ICUs (50% and 80%, respectively), but were considered in other countries to a greater extent. Thirty-eight percent ICUs reported not having specialised airway teams. Showering and \\"buddy systems\\" were underused. Clinical waste disposal training was suboptimal (38%). CONCLUSIONS: Many ICUs in the Asia-Pacific reported suboptimal PPE preparedness in several domains, particularly related to PPE training, practice, and stock awareness, which requires remediation. Adoption of low-cost approaches such as buddy systems should be encouraged. The complete avoidance of high-flow nasal oxygenation reported by several intensivists needs reconsideration. Consideration must be given to standardise PPE guidelines to minimise practice variations.

Around 1999, the Argentine propolis began to be chemically and functionally characterized to give it greater added value. Because Argentina has a wide plant biodiversity, it is expected that its propolis will have various botanical origins, and consequently, a different chemical composition. To date, five types have been defined. Based on their functionality, several products have been developed for use in human and veterinary medicine and in animal and human food. Because the Argentine propolis with the greatest potential is that of the Monte eco-region, this review will describe the findings of the last 20 years on this propolis, its botanical source (Zuccagnia punctata Cav.), its chemical composition, and a description of markers of chemical quality (chalcones) and functionality. Propolis can regulate the activity of various pro-inflammatory enzymes and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism enzymes, as well as remove reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Consequently, it can modulate metabolic syndrome and could be used as a functional ingredient in food. Furthermore, hydroalcoholic extracts can act against human and animal pathogenic bacteria and human yeast, and mycelial pathogenic fungi. The ability to stop the growth of post-harvest pathogenic bacteria and fungi was also demonstrated. For this reason, Argentine propolis are natural products capable of protecting crops and increasing the lifespan of harvested fruit and vegetables.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A solution of indocyanine green containing a suspension of porcine hepatocytes, marked with carboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl-ester (CFSE), was injected endoscopically in the gastric submucosa of 10 pigs. Fluorescence lymphography using a near-infrared laparoscope was used to identify sentinel and secondary drainage nodes. Additionally, a nonfluorescent gastric and a mesenteric node were identified. Every 5-10 min, those nodes were scanned using probe-based or needle-based CLE (pCLE or nCLE). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using anti-cytokeratin 18 antibodies was subsequently performed to confirm the presence of hepatocytes in the lymph nodes. RESULTS A total of 36 lymph nodes were analyzed with both CLE probes. Hepatocyte penetration in lymph nodes, as assessed by repeated CLE scanning, took 10-40 min after submucosal injection. Concordance between CLE and IHC was 84 and 72 % for pCLE and nCLE, respectively. False negatives were partly due to incomplete CFSE labeling of hepatocytes, which could not be recognized by CLE, but were detected with IHC.

Data on neurological and non-neurological diseases were extracted, as well as data on demographic characteristics and on severity degree of COVID-19. The prevalence of neurological comorbidities was calculated, and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between neurological diseases and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: We included 344 patients. Neurological comorbidities accounted for 22.4% of cases, with cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive impairment being the most frequent. Neurological comorbidity resulted independently associated with severe COVID-19 (OR 2.305; p = 0.012), as well as male gender (p = 0.001), older age (p = 0.001), neoplastic diseases (p = 0.039), and arterial hypertension (p = 0.045).

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020 in a single grocery retail store in Massachusetts, USA. We assessed workers' personal/occupational history and perception of COVID-19 by questionnaire. The health outcomes were measured by nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) results, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). RESULTS: Among 104 workers tested, 21 (20%) had positive viral assays. Seventy-six per cent positive cases were asymptomatic. Employees with direct customer exposure had an odds of 5.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 24.8) being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after adjustments. As to mental health, the prevalence of anxiety and depression (ie, GAD-7 score >4 or PHQ-9 score >4) was 24% and 8%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had odds of 0.3 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.9) and 0.2 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.99) screening positive for anxiety and depression, respectively.

METHODS: Rats were divided into 5 groups. Then sepsis was induced intraperitoneally in the first 4 groups. The 1(st) group was treated with cefepime, the 2(nd) and 3(rd) groups were treated with cefepime combined with ozone at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg and 1.1 mg/kg. Lung tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and assessed under light microscope and scored between 0-4 in terms of histopathological findings. RESULTS: In the comparisons between Group 1 and Group 4 in terms of cellular damage (p=0.030), inflammation (p=0.000) and overall score (p=0.007), statistically significant positive effects were observed in favor of Group 1. In the comparisons of Groups 2 and 3 with Group 4, only positive effects were observed in terms of inflammation (p=0.020, p=0.012, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although negative histopathological effects of ozone on tissue injury were detected, it was noteworthy that the increase in the ozone dose reduced the number of damaged parameters.","output":"Pulmonary effects of ozone therapy at different doses combined with antibioticotherapy in experimental sepsis model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic poses a challenge in coming up with quick and effective means to counter its cause, the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2.

From school-based programs focused on self-regulation and academic success to programs that support the well-being of disadvantaged populations or healthcare workers at risk of burnout, the concept of resilience is being used most commonly for programming that builds the capacity of individuals to adapt under conditions of adversity. Critiques have raised concerns that resilience-promoting programs demonstrate bias toward changing individual-level factors such as cognitions (e.g., mindfulness and grit), behavior (e.g., expressing gratitude and changing personal routines), or attachments (e.g., feeling secure in relationships) which help people adapt to socially toxic situations without changing access to the resources they require to overcome exposure to adverse psychosocial factors. This trend belies advances to the theory of resilience which support a more contextualized, multisystemic understanding of how external protective factors (resources) enhance individual qualities (ruggedness) and vice versa. Building on a multisystemic description of resilience, the R2 Resilience Program? was developed and piloted with six different populations ranging from clients of urban social services to workers in a long-term care facility, managers in the health care sector, staff of a Fortune 500 corporation, students in a primary to grade 12 school, and adult volunteers affiliated with an international NGO. Focused on building both individual ruggedness and enhancing peoples resources (the two Rs), the program provides contextualized content for each population by selecting from 52 resilience promoting factors with a strong evidence base to create training curricula that enhance the personal qualities and social, physical, and institutional resources most likely to support resilience. This paper reviews the justification for a multisystemic approach to designing resilience interventions and then explains the process of implementation of the R2 program.

Several previous pH-sensitive paraCEST agents were based upon with an exchanging Ln 3+ bound water molecule as the CEST antenna but this design often added additional line-broadening of the bulk water signal due to T 2 exchange. We report here a pH-sensitive paraCEST agent that lacks an inner-sphere water molecule but contains one Ln-bound -OH group for CEST activation. The Yb 3+ - complex, Yb( 1 ), displayed a single, highly-shifted CEST peak originating from the exchangeable Yb-OH proton, the frequency of which changed over the biologically relevant pH range.

The acute ethanol intoxication model was simulated by intraperitoneally administering mice with 32% ethanol solution, and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to construct the sepsis model. The lung tissue damage was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, and the wet-to-dry (W/D) ratio was used to evaluate the degree of pulmonary edema. Inflammatory cell counting and protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were, respectively, detected by hemocytometer and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method. The levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, and IL-18 in BALF were detected by their commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and expression of apoptosis-related proteins and SphK1/S1P/S1PR1 pathway-related proteins were, respectively, analyzed by MPO ELISA kit and Western blot analysis. The cell apoptosis in lung tissues was observed by TUNEL assay. Acute ethanol intoxication (EtOH) decreased the survival rate of mice and exacerbated the lung injury caused by sepsis through increasing pulmonary vascular permeability, neutrophil infiltration, release of inflammatory factors, and cell apoptosis. In addition, EtOH could activate the SphK1/S1P/S1PR1 pathway in CLP mice. However, PF-543, as a specific inhibitor of SphK1, could partially reverse the deleterious effects on lung injury of CLP mice. PF-543 alleviated lung injury caused by sepsis in acute ethanol intoxication rats by suppressing the SphK1/S1P/S1PR1 signaling pathway.","output":"Blocking SphK1/S1P/S1PR1 Signaling Pathway Alleviates Lung Injury Caused by Sepsis in Acute Ethanol Intoxication Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to study the perspectives of sustainable development amid the COVID-19 pandemic and crisis in 2021, backed by financial risk management and corporate social responsibility.

Therefore, an accurate prediction of disease progression with baseline imaging at the time of the initial presentation can help in patient management. In lieu of only size and volume information of pulmonary abnormalities and features through deep learning based image segmentation, here we combine radiomics of lung opacities and non-imaging features from demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory findings to predict need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses holistic information of a patient including both imaging and non-imaging data for outcome prediction.

We refer to the dietary requirements of selenium and the key physiological roles of selenoproteins. We explore the dysregulated fuel metabolism in T2DM and its co-morbidities, emphasizing the relevance of inflammation and oxidative stress. We describe the epidemiology of observational and experimental studies of selenium in diabetes and related conditions, explaining that the interaction between selenium status and glucose control is not limited to hyperglycemia but extends to hypoglycemia. We propose that the association between high plasma/serum selenium and T2DM/fasting plasma glucose observed in many cross-sectional studies may rely on the upregulation of hepatic selenoprotein-P biosynthesis in conditions of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. While animal studies have revealed potential molecular mechanisms underlying adverse effects of severe selenium/selenoprotein excess and deficiency in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and -cell dysfunction, their translational significance is rather limited. Importantly, dietary selenium supplementation does not appear to be a major causal factor for the development of T2DM in humans though we cannot currently exclude a small contribution of selenium on top of other risk factors, in particular if it is ingested at high (supranutritional) doses. Elevated selenium biomarkers that are often measured in T2DM patients are more likely to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of diabetes.","output":"The role of selenium in type-2 diabetes mellitus and its metabolic comorbidities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In this manuscript, we discuss the implementation and deployment of mobile integrated health and community paramedicine (MIH/CP) testing sites to provide screening, testing, and community outreach during the first months of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the metropolitan region of Charlotte, North Carolina. This program addresses the need for an agile testing strategy during the current pandemic. We disclose the number of patients evaluated as persons under investigation and the proportion with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) results from these sites. We describe how the programs were applied to patient care and include considerations on how additional staffing, scalability, and flexibility of these services may be applied to future patient and health care crises. METHODS: This is a descriptive report of the implementation of MIH/CP test sites in our health care systems early response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Retrospective data on the number of patients and their associated demographics are reported here as raw data. No statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between March 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020, our 6 MIH/CP test sites evaluated 4342 patients. Of these, 401 patients (9.2%) had positive test results, 62.8% of whom were women. The estimated duration of each patient encounter under investigation was 3 to 5 minutes. The paramedics were able to perform a brief history, specific physical examination, and screening for signs of hypoxemic respiratory failure. There were no cases of accidental exposure or failure of personal protective equipment for the MIH/CP paramedics. CONCLUSIONS: In our health care system, we pivoted the traditional MIH/CP model to rapidly initiate remote drive-through testing for COVID-19 in pre-screened individuals.

METHODS: Occupational and recreational divers who applied for fitness to dive (FTD) assessment after COVID-19 infection were included. Routine FTD assessments were performed. Details of COVID-19 history were evaluated. Lung computed tomography (CT) scans were advised if not previously performed or if there were COVID-19 related changes in previous scans. Divers with pathological findings were restrained from diving and followed prospectively. RESULTS: Forty-three divers were analysed. Thirteen divers were restrained from diving, all due to persistent COVID-19 related changes in lung CT. The prevalence of CT with at least one lung lesion was 68.2% at the time of diagnosis, 73.3% in the first three months after diagnosis and 19.2% later. The most common CT findings were glass ground opacities and fibrotic changes. Demographic characteristics and COVID-19 history of divers deemed 'unfit' were similar to those deemed 'fit'.

Methods: We collected documentary data on policy content, stakeholders and corporate political activity from seven countries in east and southern Africa augmented by qualitative interviews in Botswana, Namibia, Kenya and Zambia, and stakeholder consultations in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. Data were analysed using a political economy framework, focusing on ideas, institutions, interests and power, and a bricolage approach was employed to identify strategies for future action. Results: Non-communicable diseases were recognised as a priority in all countries. Kenya, Zambia, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda had taxes on non-alcoholic beverages, which varied in rate and tax base, but appeared to be motivated by revenue rather than health concerns. Botswana and Namibia indicated intention to adopt sugar-sweetened beverage taxes. Health-oriented sugar-sweetened beverage taxation faced challenges from entrenched economic policy paradigms for industry-led economic growth and was actively opposed by sugar-sweetened beverage-related industries. Strategies identified to support stronger sugar-sweetened beverage taxation included shifting the economic discourse to strengthen health considerations, developing positive public opinion, forging links with the agriculture sector for shared benefit, and leadership by a central government agency.

METHODS: The Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (NASS) was used to identify ophthalmic surgical procedures and associated charges, which were performed at HOPDs. The highest volume elective ophthalmic procedures were identified. The total hospital cost and payment amount was calculated for each procedure using the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Net facility income (estimated payments less OPPS rates) was determined for each elective surgical procedure category and stratified by hospital teaching status. RESULTS: In 2017, elective cataract, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgeries were performed 1 230 992 times at HOPDs. The total cost of these elective surgeries was 2350 million U.S. dollars (USD), with a total hospital payment of 3624 to 3786 million USD.

This study aimed to evaluate the mental health status of German university students during the third wave of the pandemic in 2021 and to compare the results to a sample of a congruent cross-sectional study from 2020. Methods: Two cross-sectional and anonymous online surveys among university students were conducted (first survey: July-August 2020, N = 3,382; second survey: March-April 2021, N = 5,642). Mental health status was assessed with standardized measures (depressive symptoms, alcohol and drug consumption, and eating disorder symptoms), and social and emotional aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. In addition to descriptive statistics and group comparisons of the two survey samples from 2020 and 2021, respectively, risk and protective factors related to mental health were analyzed. Results: There were significant differences in severities of depressive symptoms and alcohol and drug consumption between the two online surveys from 2020 and 2021. Findings suggest an increase in the severity of depressive symptoms as well as alcohol and drug consumption. Significantly more respondents reported suicidal ideation in the survey from 2021. Lower self-efficacy, less social support and lower resilience as well as higher perceived stress and more loneliness were reported by the participants of the survey from 2021 compared to 2020. Regarding factors predicting mental health symptoms, being female was a positive predictor for hazardous alcohol use and anorexia nervosa in comparison to men. Further, younger age, being diverse, higher perceived stress and loneliness were positive predictors for all mental health outcomes. Conclusion: This study reveals an increase in severities of depressive symptoms, including suicidal ideation, drug and alcohol consumption among students. Being diverse, younger age, higher perceived stress and loneliness were mutual risk factors for higher depressive and eating disorder symptoms as well as alcohol consumption. Universities and health care policy should recognize and address mental health issues of young adults during ongoing times of crisis and invest in easy-to-access interventions.","output":"More Depressive Symptoms, Alcohol and Drug Consumption: Increase in Mental Health Symptoms Among University Students After One Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective responses to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic require integrating behavioral factors such as risk\\\\driven contact reduction, improved treatment, and adherence fatigue with asymptomatic transmission, disease acuity, and hospital capacity.

Where global demand outweighs the supply of mental health services, established interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have been adapted from traditional face-to-face interaction to technology-assisted formats. One such notable development is the emergence of Artificially Intelligent (AI) conversational agents for psychotherapy. Pre-pandemic, these adaptations had demonstrated some positive results; but they also generated debate due to a number of ethical and societal challenges. This article commences with a critical overview of both positive and negative aspects concerning the role of AI-CBT in its present form. Thereafter, an ethical framework is applied with reference to the themes of (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. These themes are then discussed in terms of practical recommendations for future developments. Although automated versions of therapeutic support may be of appeal during times of global crises, ethical thinking should be at the core of AI-CBT design, in addition to guiding research, policy, and real-world implementation as the world considers post-COVID-19 society.","output":"Is the Automation of Digital Mental Health Ethical?

Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study using data from the EMR at a public hospital in the Bronx, New York. Included patients were aged 13 and over that had STI testing from Aug. 1, 2019 to Feb. 1, 2020 (Period 1) and Aug. 1, 2020 to Feb. 1, 2021 (Period 2) in the adult or pediatric ED. Periods 1 and 2 are 6 month periods before and after the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic in NYC, respectively. Counts and percents were used to quantify STI tests (HIV point of care, HIV 4th generation serum, Gonorrhea Amplification, Chlamydia Amplification, and Treponema Pallidum Ab screen) and positive results during Period 1 vs. Period 2. A chi-squared test of independence determined significance of positivity rates in Period 1 vs Period 2 with a p-value of.05. Results: In Period 1, there were 2386 distinct patients accounting for 5445 STI tests with 54% female, 30% male and 18% unknown or other self-identified sex. The average age of all patients was 37 years (S.D.  15). In Period 2, 2218 distinct ED patients accounting for 5816 STI tests with 52% female, 24% male, 24% unknown or other self-identified sex. The average age for Period 2 was 37 years (S.D.  15). Our data (Table 1) show that more STI diagnostic tests were performed in Period 2 than Period 1 for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis in our ED. There were fewer HIV tests performed in Period 2. There were no significant differences in positivity rates between Periods 1 and 2 for HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis, although there was a trend towards significance for gonorrhea and syphilis. Conclusion: A higher absolute number of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis tests were performed in our ED in the post-SARS-CoV-19 time period. This overall increase in testing may be due to an increased utilization of emergency services given oversubscribed outpatient resources. The decrease in HIV testing could be due to patients opting out of testing, or providers having a lower suspicion of HIV infection in the context of the pandemic. A stable positivity rate could imply that despite newly imposed SARS-CoV-19 guidelines on social behavior, patients in our population continued to engage in condomless sexual encounters.

Given the unknown incidence of adverse cardiac sequelae after COVID-19 infection in athletes, these leagues implemented a conservative return-to-play (RTP) cardiac testing program aligned with American College of Cardiology recommendations for all athletes testing positive for COVID-19. Objective: To assess the prevalence of detectable inflammatory heart disease in professional athletes with prior COVID-19 infection, using current RTP screening recommendations. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study reviewed RTP cardiac testing performed between May and October 2020 on professional athletes who had tested positive for COVID-19. The professional sports leagues (Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, National Football League, and the men's and women's National Basketball Association) implemented mandatory cardiac screening requirements for all players who had tested positive for COVID-19 prior to resumption of team-organized sports activities. Exposures: Troponin testing, electrocardiography (ECG), and resting echocardiography were performed after a positive COVID-19 test result. Interleague, deidentified cardiac data were pooled for collective analysis. Those with abnormal screening test results were referred for additional testing, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and/or stress echocardiography. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of abnormal RTP test results potentially representing COVID-19-associated cardiac injury, and results and outcomes of additional testing generated by the initial screening process. Results: The study included 789 professional athletes (mean [SD] age, 25 [3] years; 777 men [98.5%]). A total of 460 athletes (58.3%) had prior symptomatic COVID-19 illness, and 329 (41.7%) were asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic (minimally symptomatic). Testing was performed a mean (SD) of 19 (17) days (range, 3-156 days) after a positive test result. Abnormal screening results were identified in 30 athletes (3.8%; troponin, 6 athletes [0.8%]; ECG, 10 athletes [1.3%]; echocardiography, 20 athletes [2.5%]), necessitating additional testing; 5 athletes (0.6%) ultimately had cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings suggesting inflammatory heart disease (myocarditis, 3; pericarditis, 2) that resulted in restriction from play. No adverse cardiac events occurred in athletes who underwent cardiac screening and resumed professional sport participation. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides large-scale data assessing the prevalence of relevant COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology with implementation of current RTP screening recommendations. While long-term follow-up is ongoing, few cases of inflammatory heart disease have been detected, and a safe return to professional sports activity has thus far been achieved.","output":"Prevalence of Inflammatory Heart Disease Among Professional Athletes With Prior COVID-19 Infection Who Received Systematic Return-to-Play Cardiac Screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is not proven to be effective in treating respiratory failure in severe pneumonia.

She was successfully managed by NIV. DISCUSSION: However, NIV must be managed by providers who are trained in mechanical ventilation. This is of the utmost importance in avoiding any delay should the patient's condition worsen and require endotracheal intubation. Moreover, in pregnant women, the severity of illness may progress quickly due to the immunosuppression inherent in these patients.

METHODS Data from a two-part Phase I study with intravenous (5 mg/kg) and variable maintenance subcutaneous dosing of CT-P13 with frequent PK sampling in patients with CD or UC were used. Population PK analysis was conducted by non-linear mixed effects modelling. Covariates affecting PK parameters were chosen based on their clinical relevance (effect size of 20%) using a full fixed-effect modelling approach. RESULTS CT-P13 PK was described by a two-compartment model with linear elimination. The half-life in a typical 70 kg patient with serum albumin of 44 g/L was 10.8 days. The typical value for clearance was 0.355 L/d, absorption constant 0.273/d, bioavailability 79.1%, central volume of distribution 3.10 L and peripheral volume of distribution 1.93 L. Clinically relevant covariates affecting clearance were body weight (+43.2% from 70 to 120 kg), the presence of anti-drug antibodies (+39%) and serum albumin concentration (+30.1% from 44 to 32 g/L).

One explanation for this differential impact is the distribution of people into occupations that can be performed from home and may provide greater financial security. However, little is known about the nature and scale of shifting home-based work patterns and their geographic distribution, despite this being a likely determinant of the success of geographically defined COVID-19 lockdown strategies. We investigate the hypothesis that people engaged in financially secure employment are better able to adapt to mobility restrictions, due to common occupational factors. In the context of two Australian urban centres, we test this hypothesis by analysing changes to home-based internet usage and quantify the relationship between area-level measures of population income security, the ability to perform job requirements remotely, and the degree of transition to home-based work during COVID-19. Our analysis confirms that financial security in Australia is geographically clustered and concentrated. Income security is also correlated with increased internet traffic during work hours under lockdown, and home-based work patterns that persist post-lockdown. Our findings suggest that geographic diversity in preparedness for government-imposed restrictions should be factored into response planning and provision of social and economic support for residents within lockdown areas.","output":"Mapping internet activity in Australian cities during COVID-19 lockdown: how occupational factors drive inequality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To characterize activity, text sentiment, and online community characteristics regarding fertility on Twitter (TW) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using social network analysis (SNA) Design: Cross sectional study Materials and Methods: SNA uses graph theory to understand structure, flow, content, and relationships of networks among individuals SNA was performed using NodeXL, a software platform that performs social network and content analysis The search term fertility on TW was investigated during the weeks of February 20-27th, 2020 (Pre-COVID) and April 29th-May 6th, 2020 (during-COVID) User demographics, tweet content, and characteristics of the network were collected and analyzed during these time periods These included: # users (vertices);edges (connections, defined as unique and total);self-loops (tweet without connection to another user);connected components (groups of users communicating back and forth frequently);maximum vertices in a connected component (largest group size);maximum and average geodesic distance (number of tweets to connect two users in the network);graph density;positive and negative sentiment tweets;top 5 hashtags;and top 5 word pairs Statistical analyses included a z-ratio for comparison of proportions, with p&lt;0 05 considered significant Results: There were 1426 unique users and 401 groups in the pre-COVID data compared to 1492 unique users and 453 groups in the during CCOVID data There was no difference in the number of total connections [96 8% (1381/1426) vs 96 0% (1433/1492), p=0 25] or self-loops [20 0% (286/1426) vs 22 1% (329/1492), p=0 19]before and during the COVID-19 pandemic The percentage of unique connections per user decreased during COVID-19 [91 6% (1381/1508) pre-COVID vs 83 3% (1433/1720) during COVID, p&lt;0 0002] The average and maximum distance between users in the community increased during COVID (maximum: 5 pre-COVID, 8 during-COVID;average 1 95 pre-COVID, 2 43 during-COVID) The percentage of positive sentiments per total number of tweets increased during COVID [58 1% pre-COVID (773/1331) vs 64 3% (1198/1863) during-COVID, p&lt;0 0004] The overall character of the TW fertility social network remained constant at both time points with a broadcast spoke and out wheel shape The top 5 hashtags changed during COVID to include COVID19 The top word pairs changed from family, hereditary;parents, children to fertility, treatment;healthcare, decisions  Conclusions: Despite the challenge to the fertility community amidst COVID19, overall TW sentiment regarding fertility was more positive during than before the pandemic Top hashtags/word pairs changed to reflect the emergence of COVID and the unique healthcare decision making challenges faced While the character, # of users, and total connections remained constant, unique connections and distance between users changed to reflect more self-broadcasting and less tight connections Given no change in network structure where time at home could have led to increased social media (SM) use, further study is needed to leverage SM in these situations References: None","output":"Making It (net)work: a Social Network Analysis of fertility on Twitter before and during the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide has impo-sed the need to identify a test that quickly recognizes affected subjects, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. The most reliable option has been proven to be the RT-PCR, which allows to detect virus RNA on a specimen from a high viral load site, such as nasopharynx. Nasopha-ryngeal sample collection is possible by means of a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and is a practical and relatively non-invasive technique, but rather bothersome for the recipient. Aim: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the discomfort evoked during NPS. Materials and Methods: We surveyed 429 patients receiving NPS before hospitalization or other procedures non related to COVID-19. For each one we noted the discomfort level felt during the swab using a 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain and the total time needed for the procedure to be taken. Sex, age, smoking status and positive history of previous swab have been taken into account. Results: We found that, among the variables, sex had a statistically significant impact on the perceived discomfort of nasal swab, with females experiencing slightly more discomfort. Conclusions: NPS is largely a none-to-minimum discomfort in-ducing procedure. The differences in perceived discomfort could be explained based on anatomical features, and should remark the need for a tailored and anatomy-oriented approach in each patient.","output":"Evaluation of Discomfort in Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen Collection for SARS-CoV-2 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Residency programs have been impacted by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study we aim to investigate and evaluate the impact of the pandemic on residents as well as residency training programs. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study including a survey of 43 questions prepared on Google forms and electronically distributed among a convenience sample of residents training at a tertiary center in North Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected in the period between October 30th and November 8th of 2020. The survey included questions that addressed the impact of the pandemic on residents health as well as training programs. The study participants included residents in training at KAUH in 2020 and were stratified according to the type of residency program (surgical residents (SRs) and non-surgical residents (NSRs)). Statistical methods included descriptive analysis, Chi-square or Fishers exact test, Mann Whitney U test, and Cramers V and r statistics as measures of effect sizes. RESULTS: Of all 430 residents, 255 (59%) responded to the survey. A total of 17 (7%) of residents reported being infected with COVID-19 and a significant difference was reported between SRs and NSRs (10% vs 4%, V = .124 small effect (95% CI; .017C.229), p = 0.048). Approximately, 106 (42%) reported a decrease in the number of staff working at the clinic and 164 (64%) reported limited access to personal protective equipment during the pandemic. On a 4-point Likert scale for the feeling of anxiety, the median was 2 (2C3 IQR) in the NSRs group, vs 2 (1C2 IQR) in the SRs groups, with the NSRs being more likely to feel anxious (r = 0.13 small effect (95% CI; 0.007C0.249), p = .044). Similarly, the proportion of residents who reported feeling anxious about an inadequacy of protective equipment in the work area was significantly greater in the NSRs group (90.3% vs 75.2%; V = .201 small effect (95% CI; .078C.313), p = .001), as well as the proportion of residents who reported feeling increased stress and anxiety between colleagues being also significantly higher in the NSRs group (88.1% vs 76%; V = .158 small effect (95% CI; .032C.279), p = .012). CONCLUSION: The burden of the ongoing pandemic on the mental health status of residents is very alarming and so providing residents with psychological counseling and support is needed. Also, critical implications on the flow of residency training programs have been noticed. This necessitates adapting and adopting smart educational techniques to compensate for such limitations.

The literature search was conducted on Google Scholar, Scopus, and PubMed databases using related terms (such as, but not limited to, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, COPD management, N-acetylcysteine, and corticosteroids) on November 1C9, 2021. Recent studies suggest that COVID-19 and COPD are correlated through three pathways, namely, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression, dysregulation of biological parameters, and occurrence of pneumonia. Early detection of COVID-19 in patients with underlying COPD is difficult because they share similar symptoms, attributed to advanced progression of the infection and subsequently deteriorates lung function. During COPD management, clinicians are expected to take consideration on the effect of systemic corticosteroids if patients develop COVID-19. In conclusion, COVID-19 and COPD and its management are potentially correlated, contributing to the worsening of the disease.

After a cervical or thoracic lesion, impairment of the respiratory muscles decreases respiratory function, which increases the risk of respiratory complications. Pneumonia substantially reduces patient's quality of life, may prolong inpatient rehabilitation time, increase healthcare costs or at worse, lead to early death. Respiratory function and coughing can be improved through various interventions after SCI, but the available evidence as to which aspect of respiratory care should be optimised is inconclusive. Furthermore, ability of respiratory function parameters to predict pneumonia risk is insufficiently established. This paper details the protocol for a large-scale, multicentre research project that aims to evaluate the ability of parameters of respiratory function to predict and understand variation in inpatient risk of pneumonia in SCI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: RESCOM, a prospective cohort study, began recruitment in October 2016 across 10 SCI rehabilitation centres from Australia, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Inpatients with acute SCI, with complete or incomplete cervical or thoracic lesions, 18 years or older and not/no more dependent on 24-hour mechanical ventilation within the first 3 months after injury are eligible for inclusion. The target sample size is 500 participants. The primary outcome is an occurrence of pneumonia; secondary outcomes include pneumonia-related mortality and quality of life. We will use the longitudinal data for prognostic models on inpatient pneumonia risk factors. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been reviewed and approved by all local ethics committees of all participating centres. Study results will be disseminated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations, to the SCI community, other stakeholders and via social media, newsletters and engagement activities.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente integrated healthcare delivery systems serving populations in northern California, southern California, and Washington state. PARTICIPANTS: 1840 people with a first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19 by 22 April 2020, among 9 596 321 healthcare plan enrollees. Analyses of hospital length of stay and clinical outcomes included 1328 people admitted by 9 April 2020 (534 in northern California, 711 in southern California, and 83 in Washington). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19, and subsequent probabilities of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, as well as duration of hospital stay and ICU stay. The effective reproduction number (R(E)) describing transmission dynamics was estimated for each region. RESULTS: As of 22 April 2020, cumulative incidences of a first acute hospital admission for covid-19 were 15.6 per 100 000 cohort members in northern California, 23.3 per 100 000 in southern California, and 14.7 per 100 000 in Washington. Accounting for censoring of incomplete hospital stays among those admitted by 9 April 2020, the estimated median duration of stay among survivors was 9.3 days (with 95% staying 0.8 to 32.9 days) and among non-survivors was 12.7 days (1.6 to 37.7 days). The censoring adjusted probability of ICU admission for male patients was 48.5% (95% confidence interval 41.8% to 56.3%) and for female patients was 32.0% (26.6% to 38.4%). For patients requiring critical care, the median duration of ICU stay was 10.6 days (with 95% staying 1.3 to 30.8 days). The censoring adjusted case fatality ratio was 23.5% (95% confidence interval 19.6% to 28.2%) among male inpatients and 14.9% (11.8% to 18.6%) among female inpatients; mortality risk increased with age for both male and female patients. Reductions in R(E) were identified over the study period within each region. CONCLUSIONS: Among residents of California and Washington state enrolled in Kaiser Permanente healthcare plans who were admitted to hospital with covid-19, the probabilities of ICU admission, of long hospital stay, and of mortality were identified to be high.

The interaction between XIST and miR-16-5p was investigated by bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay, RIP assay and RNA pull-down assay. We found that XIST expression was down-regulated in lung tissues of septic rats and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells, while the expression of miR-16-5p was up-regulated. Down-regulation of XIST significantly promoted pulmonary edema, increased the levels of TNF-, IL-1 and malondialdehyde, inhibited the cell viability and decreased the level of superoxide dismutase. Mechanistically, it was confirmed that XIST could sponge miR-16-5p, and thus repress its expression, and the transfection of miR-16-5p mimics could reverse the effects of XIST over-expression in the cell model.

METHODS: We developed a continuous-time stochastic simulation of smallpox transmission, including network structure, post-exposure vaccination, vaccination of contacts of contacts, limited response capacity, heterogeneity in symptoms and infectiousness, vaccination prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination, more rapid diagnosis due to public awareness, surveillance of asymptomatic contacts, and isolation of cases. RESULTS: We found that even in cases of very rapidly spreading smallpox, ring vaccination (when coupled with surveillance) is sufficient in most cases to eliminate smallpox quickly, assuming that 95% of household contacts are traced, 80% of workplace or social contacts are traced, and no casual contacts are traced, and that in most cases the ability to trace 1C5 individuals per day per index case is sufficient. If smallpox is assumed to be transmitted very quickly to contacts, it may at times escape containment by ring vaccination, but could be controlled in these circumstances by mass vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Small introductions of smallpox are likely to be easily contained by ring vaccination, provided contact tracing is feasible. Uncertainties in the nature of bioterrorist smallpox (infectiousness, vaccine efficacy) support continued planning for ring vaccination as well as mass vaccination.

ABBU can control tidal volume (200C800 ml), respiratory rate (10C40 bpm), inspiratory time (0.5C1.5 s), assist pressure sensing (? 1 to ? 20 cm H(2)O), manual PEEP valve (0C20 cm H(2)O). All set values are displayed on an LCD screen. Bench testing with lung simulators (Michigan 1600, SmartLung 2000) yielded consistent tidal volume delivery at compliances of 20, 40 and 70 (mL/cm H(2)O). The delivered fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) decreased with increasing minute ventilation (V(E)), from 98 to 47% when V(E) was increased from 4 to 16 L/min using a fixed oxygen flow source of 5 L/min. ABBU was tested in Berkshire pigs (n = 6, weight of 50.8  2.6 kg) utilizing normal lung model and saline lavage induced lung injury. Arterial blood gases were measured following changes in tidal volume (200C800 ml), respiratory rate (10C40 bpm), and PEEP (5C20 cm H(2)O) at baseline and after lung lavage. Physiological levels of PaCO(2) ( 40 mm Hg [5.3 kPa]) were achieved in all animals at baseline and following lavage injury. PaO(2) increased in lavage injured lungs in response to incremental PEEP (5C20 cm H(2)O) (p < 0.01). At fixed low oxygen flow rates (5 L/min), delivered FiO(2) decreased with increased V(E). CONCLUSIONS: ABBU provides oxygenation and ventilation across a range of parameter settings that may potentially provide a low-cost solution to ventilator shortages. A clinical trial is necessary to establish safety and efficacy in adult patients with diverse etiologies of respiratory failure.","output":"Data automated bag breathing unit for COVID-19 ventilator shortages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters of antibody response and reproductive traits after exposure to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Blood samples were taken approximately 60 d after the outbreak. Antibody levels were quantified as the sample-to-positive ratio (S/P ratio) using a fluorescent microsphere assay. Reproductive traits included total number born (TNB), number born alive (NBA), number stillborn (NSB), number mummified (NBM), and number born dead (NBD). Mortality traits were log transformed for genetic analyses. Data were split into prior, during, and after the disease outbreak phases using visual appraisal of the estimates of farm-year-week effects for each reproductive trait. For NBA, data from all phases were combined into a reaction norm analysis with regression on estimates of farm-year-week effects for NBA. Heritability for S/P ratio was estimated at 0.17  0.05. Heritability estimates for reproduction traits were all low and were lower during the outbreak for NBA but greater for mortality traits. TNB was not greatly affected during the outbreak, as many sows that farrowed during the outbreak were mated prior to the outbreak. Heritability for TNB decreased from 0.13 (prior) to 0.08 (after). Genetic correlation estimates between prior to and during the outbreak were high for TNB (0.86  0.23) and NBA (0.98  0.38) but lower for mortality traits: 0.65  0.43, ?0.42  0.55, and 0.29  1.39 for LNSB, LNBM, and LNBD, respectively. TNB prior to and after the outbreak had a lower genetic correlation (0.32  0.33). In general, genetic correlation estimates of S/P ratio with reproductive performance during the outbreak were below 0.20 in absolute value, except for LNSB (?0.73  0.29). Based on the reaction norm model, estimates of genetic correlations between the intercept and slope terms ranged from 0.24  0.50 to 0.54  0.35 depending on the parameterization used, indicating that selection for the intercept may result in indirect selection for steeper slopes, and thus, less resilient animals. In general, estimates of genetic correlations between farm-year-week effect classes based on the reaction norm model resembled estimates of genetic correlations from the multivariate analysis. Overall, compared to previous studies, antibody S/P ratios showed a lower heritability (0.17  0.05) and low genetic correlations with reproductive performance during a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome outbreak, except for the LNSB.","output":"The effect of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome outbreak on genetic parameters and reaction norms for reproductive performance in pigs"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/47.md","filePath":"consultation/47.md"}'),R={name:"consultation/47.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
