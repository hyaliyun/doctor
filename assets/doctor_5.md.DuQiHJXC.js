In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are not undergoing dialysis, the efficacy and safety of daprodustat, as compared with the conventional erythropoiesis-stimulating agent darbepoetin alfa, are unknown. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial with blinded adjudication of cardiovascular outcomes, we compared daprodustat with darbepoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD who were not undergoing dialysis. The primary outcomes were the mean change in the hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52 and the first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; a composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke). RESULTS: Overall, 3872 patients were randomly assigned to receive daprodustat or darbepoetin alfa. The mean (SD) baseline hemoglobin levels were similar in the two groups. The mean (SE) change in the hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52 was 0.740.02 g per deciliter in the daprodustat group and 0.660.02 g per deciliter in the darbepoetin alfa group (difference, 0.08 g per deciliter; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.13), which met the prespecified noninferiority margin of -0.75 g per deciliter. During a median follow-up of 1.9 years, a first MACE occurred in 378 of 1937 patients (19.5%) in the daprodustat group and in 371 of 1935 patients (19.2%) in the darbepoetin alfa group (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.19), which met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.25. The percentages of patients with adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CKD and anemia who were not undergoing dialysis, daprodustat was noninferior to darbepoetin alfa with respect to the change in the hemoglobin level from baseline and with respect to cardiovascular outcomes.

At the 7-day retention test, off-line consolidation was enhanced in the cardiorespiratory exercise relative to the rest group, but only among individuals who performed interleaved motor skill practice (p = 0.02). Similarly, at the 7-day retention test, -band intermuscular coherence increased to a greater extent in the exercise group than in the rest group for those who performed interleaved practice (p = 0.02).

METHODS We undertook a case-control study among adults at Kaiser Permanente Southern California between 2015-2019. Cases were diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI; including pneumonia or non-pneumonia LRTI diagnoses) with viral infections detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing. Controls without LRTI diagnoses were matched to cases by demographic and clinical attributes. We measured vaccine effectiveness (VE) for PCV13 against virus-associated LRTI via the adjusted odds ratio of PCV13 receipt, comparing cases to controls. RESULTS Primary analyses included 13,856 virus-associated LRTI cases and 227,887 matched controls. Receipt of PCV13 was associated with 24.9% (95% confidence interval: 18.4-30.9%) VE against virus-associated pneumonia and 21.5% (10.9-30.9%) VE against other (non-pneumonia) virus-associated LRTI.

This represents the largest cohort of continuously followed LTR with COVID-19 to date. Methods We conducted an observational retrospective cohort study of LTRs infected with COVID 19 at a major transplant center between June 2020 and April 2021. Infection was defined by having a positive diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Patients characteristics, COVID severity and management were retrieved. Changes in individual patient's FEV1, imaging and trans-bronchial lung biopsies (TBLB) performed at 3, 6, and 12 month intervals after infection were compared to the baseline prior to infection. Results Fifty-three LTRs were identified as having COVID infection. Median age was 64 years, 31 (58.5%) were males, and 48 (90.5%) were double-LTR. Average BMI was 26.71 and 9 patients had diabetes. 38 (71.7%) patients were on three immunosuppression agents, and 4 (7.5%) patients had an augmented immunosuppression prior to COVID infection. 7 (13.2%) patients had at least one dose of mRNA COVID vaccine. 29 (54.7%) patients were treated as outpatient.

These differences might be explained by population susceptibility, environmental factors, transmission dynamics, containment strategies, and diagnostic approaches. We aimed to analyze if obesity and diabetes prevalence are associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rates in Mexico. METHODOLOGY We analyzed the mortality rate for each of the 2,457 municipalities in Mexico, one of the countries with highest COVID-19 mortality rate, during the first seven months of the pandemic to identify factors associated with higher mortality, including demographic, health-related characteristics (prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in adults older than 20 years old), and altitude. RESULTS During the first seven months of the COVID-19 pandemic there were 85,666 deaths reported in Mexico, with a cumulative mortality rate of 67 per 100,000 population. The mean mortality rate for the 2,457 municipalities in Mexico was 33.9 per 100,000 population. At a municipal level, the prevalence of diabetes and obesity, as well as high human development index, and location at < 500 or > 2000 above sea level were associated with higher mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS Elevated obesity and diabetes prevalence explain, in part, high COVID-19 mortality rates registered in certain municipalities in Mexico.

We examined whether disturbed sleep was associated with psychological distress in New York City (NYC) HCWs during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020). METHODS: HCWs completed a survey screening for acute stress (4-item Primary Care PTSD screen), depressive (Patient Health Questionaire-2), and anxiety (2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale) symptoms. Insomnia symptoms (modified item from the Insomnia Severity Index) and short sleep (SS, sleep duration <6 hours/day) were assessed. Poisson regression analyses predicting psychological distress from SS and insomnia symptoms, adjusting for demographics, clinical role/setting, redeployment status, shifts worked, and multiple comparisons were performed. RESULTS: Among 813 HCWs (80.6% female, 59.0% white) mean sleep duration was 5.81.2 hours/night. Prevalence of SS, insomnia, acute stress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were 38.8%, 72.8%, 57.9%, 33.8%, and 48.2%, respectively.

The majority of diarrhea cases are treated with antimicrobials, which may not be warranted. There is increasing concern related to the use of antimicrobials in food animals due to the emanant development of antimicrobial resistance. Bovine colostrum is densely packed with hundreds of nutrients and bioactives specifically tailored to improve calf health and development. As such, colostrum may have potential to be used an alternative to antimicrobials for the treatment of diarrhea. The objective of this review is to outline the causation and implication of diarrhea in young dairy calves and to explore the benefits of colostrum and its potential use as a therapy and preventative for diarrhea in pre-weaned calves. ABSTRACT: Diarrhea is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pre-weaned dairy calves and, as such, represents a significant animal health and welfare concern. Furthermore, digestive disease early in life is associated with several long-term consequences such as reduced growth rate and decreased milk yield during the first lactation, thus generating severe economic losses. The majority of diarrheic cases in young calves are treated with antimicrobials; however, it is necessary to develop alternative treatments, as excessive antimicrobial usage can lead to antimicrobial resistance and can negatively impact the gut microflora of a calf. Bovine colostrum is abundant in immune and bioactive factors that improve immune function and development. This rich and natural combination of immunoglobulins, natural antimicrobial factors, growth factors, anti-inflammatories and nutrients may be an attractive alternative to antimicrobials in the treatment of diarrhea in young dairy calves. There is evidence that supports the use of colostrum as an early treatment for diarrhea in young calves. Future research should investigate its therapeutic and economic effectiveness.","output":"A Narrative Review on the Unexplored Potential of Colostrum as a Preventative Treatment and Therapy for Diarrhea in Neonatal Dairy Calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is associated with elevated inflammatory markers, consistent with cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

METHODS: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 NAT positive rates of 4,275 specimens from 532 COVID-19 patients in Sichuan Province with different disease severities, statuses, and stages, as well as different types and numbers of specimens. RESULTS: The total positive rate of the 4,275 specimens was 37.5%. Among seven specimen types, BALF generated a 77.8% positive rate, followed by URT specimens (38.5%), sputum (39.8%), and feces/rectal swabs (34.1%). Specimens from critical cases generated a 43.4% positive rate, which was significantly higher than that of other severities. With specimens from patients at stable status, the SARS-CoV-2 positive rate was 40.6%, which was significantly higher than that of improved status (17.1%), but lower than that of aggravated status (61.5%). Notably, the positive rate of specimens from COVID-19 patients varied significantly from 85 to 95% during 3 days before and after symptom onset, to 20% at around 18 days after symptom onset.

However, exactly how flexible is our sense of body ownership? In this study, we address this issue by investigating the following question: is it possible that one may have the illusory experience of owning four hands? Under visual manipulation, the participant adopted the experimenter's first-person perspective (1PP) as if it was his/her own. Sitting face to face, the participant saw four hands-the experimenter's two hands from the adopted 1PP together with the subject's own two hands from the adopted third-person perspective (3PP). We found that: (1) the four-hand illusion did not occur in the passive four-hand condition. (2) In the active four-hand condition, the participants tapped their index fingers, imitated by the experimenter. When tactile stimulations were not provided, the key illusion was not induced, either. (3) Strikingly, once all four hands began to act with the same pattern and received synchronous tactile stimulations at the same time, many participants felt as if they had two more hands.

METHODS: The patients with nAMD having IVI appointments between March 16 and June 1, 2020 (RP in Turkey) were included in this retrospective study. For adherence analysis, the patients who attended (Group 1, n = 44) and who did not attend (Group 2, n = 60) their IVI appointment visits during the RP (VRP) were evaluated according to their last visit before the RP (V0). For outcome analysis, the patients who attend VRP and have follow-up (Group 1a, 46 eyes) and who did not attend VRP but later attended for follow-up (Group 2a, 33 eyes) were evaluated for functional (best-corrected visual acuity, BCVA [logMAR]) and anatomical (optical coherence tomography [OCT] disease activity) outcomes at the first visit after RP (V1) and last visit within six months after RP (V2). Patients received a complete ophthalmologic evaluation with anti-VEGF (Aflibercept) IVI administration at all visits. RESULTS: The adherence rate of the patients to VRP was 42.3% (44/104). The patients in Group 1 were significantly younger (mean  SD years, 71.0  8.1 vs. 74.7  8.0, p = 0.024), had better median [IQR] BCVA at their first presentation (0.30 [0.54] vs. 0.61 [1.08], p = 0.023) and V0 (0.40 [0.48] vs. 0.52 [0.70], p = 0.031), and had less hypertension (36.4% vs. 58.3%, p = 0.044) than Group 2. The mean  SD delay of planned IVI at VRP in Group 2a was 13.9  6.2 weeks. Disease activity in OCT was significantly higher in Group 2a than Group 1a at V1 (60.6% vs. 32.6%, p = 0.025).

In Japan, as of December 31, 2021, more than 1.73 million laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported. However, the actual number of infections is likely to be under-ascertained due to the epidemiological characteristics such as mild and subclinical infections and limited testing availability in the early days of the pandemic. In this study, we infer the true number of infections in Japan between January 16, 2020, and December 31, 2021 , using a statistical modelling framework that combines data on reported cases and fatalities. Methods. We used reported daily COVID-19 deaths stratified into 8 distinct age-groups and age-specific infection fatality ratios (IFR) to impute the true number of infections. Estimates of IFR were informed from published studies as well seroprevalence studies conducted in Japan. To account for the uncertainty in IFR estimates, we sampled values from relevant distributions. Results. We estimated that as of December 31, 2021, 2.90 million (CrI: 1.77 to 4.27 million) people had been infected in Japan, which is 1.68 times higher than the 1.73 million reported cases. Our meta-analysis confirmed that these findings were consistent with the intermittent seroprevalence studies conducted in Japan. Conclusions. We have estimated that a substantial number of COVID-19 infections in the country were unreported, particularly in adults. Our approach provides a more realistic assessment of the true underlying burden of COVID-19.

This has limited efforts for disease control and elimination restricting the development of risk-based resource allocation to the most relevant modes of PEDV dissemination. Here, we modeled nine modes of between-farm transmission pathways including farm-to-farm proximity (local transmission), contact network of pig farm movements between sites, four different contact networks of transportation vehicles (vehicles that transport pigs from farm-to-farm, pigs to markets, feed distribution and crew), the volume of animal by-products within feed diets (e.g. animal fat and meat and bone meal) to reproduce PEDV transmission dynamics. The model was calibrated in space and time with weekly PEDV outbreaks. We investigated the model performance to identify outbreak locations and the contribution of each route in the dissemination of PEDV. The model estimated that 42.7% of the infections in sow farms were related to vehicles transporting feed, 34.5% of infected nurseries were associated with vehicles transporting pigs to farms, and for both farm types, pig movements or local transmission were the next most relevant routes. On the other hand, finishers were most often (31.4%) infected via local transmission, followed by the vehicles transporting feed and pigs to farm networks. Feed ingredients did not significantly improve model calibration metrics. The proposed modeling framework provides an evaluation of PEDV transmission dynamics, ranking the most important routes of PEDV dissemination and granting the swine industry valuable information to focus efforts and resources on the most important transmission routes.","output":"Modeling between-farm transmission dynamics of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: characterizing the dominant transmission routes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teledermatology (TD) was previously described as an efficient substitute to in-person visits for COVID-19 associated lesions.1 During the first COVID-19 wave, chilblain-like lesions (CLL) were the most reported dermatological manifestation.2-4 Although COVID-19 polymerase reactive chain (PCR) or serology were negative for most cases, this unexpected outbreak of chilblains remained remarkable.5.","output":"Detection of a second outbreak of chilblain\\\\like lesions during COVID\\\\19 pandemic through teledermatology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global health crisis compelled behavior analysts to consider alternatives to face-to-face services to treat children with feeding disorders.

A comparison of various extant frameworks focusses on how CSR agency emerges in complex multi-agent and multi-sector stakeholder networks. The discussion considers the respective capabilities and relevance of these frameworks C culminating in an integrative CSR practice model. A short literature review of the evolution of CSR since the 1950s provides the backdrop for understanding multi-agent cross-sectoral stakeholder coalitions as a strategic determinant of todays organizational behavior. The paper turns to Werhanes coupling of moral imagination and systems thinking and forging stakeholder coalitions in problem contexts that were traditionally deemed intractable by for-profit organizations. However, it identifies the problem that the systems approach treats macro-agents (organizations, stakeholders) as given (black-boxed) and shies away from more radically re-imagining the possibilities of reassembling agency from the bottom up. Actor Network Theory (ANT) provides such a method, which strictly commits to treating organizational behavior as a product of technological, human and environmental micro-processes. ANT, however, is lacking a genuine moral deliberative stance in designing complex CSR coalitions. In an attempt to capitalize on the respective strengths of these frameworks (Systems thinking and ANT) the paper tends to a recent iterative series of situational transactive models that are rooted in the US pragmatist tradition and seek to capture intelligent planning processes in complex problematic contexts. The contribution proposes a new CSR practice model, which assigns specific roles to the theoretical contributions of ANT, system thinking and pragmatism in complex deliberation processes.

METHODS Participants who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery 1 year previously were randomly assigned to a structured dietary intervention incorporating portion-controlled foods (intervention, n = 20) or a comparison group (control, n = 20). Both groups received instruction in behavioral weight loss (one 60-min session) followed by four monthly coaching telephone calls. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 4 months (post-intervention), and 6 months. RESULTS Participants were 85% female and 80% White. Average age was 46.9 (11.1) years, and body mass index was 31.3 (5.4) kg/m(2) at enrollment. Percent weight change from enrollment was significantly greater for intervention compared with control participants at 4 months [-4.56% vs. -0.13%, t(30) = -3.29, P = 0.003] and 6 months [-4.07% vs. -0.14%, t(31) = -2.03, P = 0.05].

At first glance, there appears a linear relationship between ultra-processed food addiction and BMI class. Further investigation indicates a J-shaped curve with heightened prevalence among the underweight. These findings highlight the need to assess for additional factors that may increase objective or subjective food addiction symptoms including eating disorders, dietary restraint, and other mental health diagnoses. SUMMARY: While clinical considerations across different weight classes vary, overemphasis on weight status may detract from the clinical utility of the ultra-processed food addiction construct.

We conducted a questionnaire based study to assess the psychological impact in this situation affecting their quality of life(QOL) and their perspective in this current situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Breast cancer patients who had been diagnosed and registered in our department from 1st January to 1stApril 2020 before the covid out break were tracked from the medical records. The patients details, disease status dates of follow up and the treatment details were collected.Defaulted patients were contacted.Post one year, in April 2021, these patients were assessed clinically and questioned regarding the treatment perspective. Psychological status and health related quality of life were analysed with GAD-7 (Generalised anxiety disorder questionnaire), PHQ-9 (patient health questionnaire) and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Results:A total of 202 breast cancer patients were included. 83 patients(41%) were diagnosed with early breast cancer of which 67(33%) patients were started on Sadjuvant chemotherapy after surgery, 16 (8%)were registered for hormonal therapy. 54(27%) patients with locally advanced, were on neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 65(32%)had metastatic disease at presentation. 23 of 65 metastatic patients were in visceral crisis and were on supportive management for the same. 35 patients had been started on palliative chemotherapy. Out of the 156 patients who had been in initiated with various chemotherapy, only 62(31%) patients were able to review at correct interval for the scheduled chemotherapy. 45 patients(22%) reviewed in the day care irregularly. Among the 45, 28 patients had locally advanced breast cancer and 22 patients had clinical progression due to prolonged gap. 38 patients(19%) had defaulted completely.Of the 38, 16 had advanced disease and presented with clinical progression of disease and switched to second line chemotherapy. 15 patients progressed to have distant metastases and are started on palliative chemotherapy or supportive care. 7 patients who were on adjuvant chemotherapy are kept under close follow up. 11 patients with metastatic breast cancer had died during the past one year. 3 patients had committed suicide.112(55 %) patients were within the city. 71 patients(35%) were from suburban areas. 19 patients(10%) were from adjacent rural areas. 113(56%) were educated.176 (87 %) were desperate to continue treatment inspite of pandemic, while remaining patients main concern was to avoid infection than to get oncological management. While the most common reason for defaulting was travel restrictions, few also documented financial issues and ignorance about progression of cancer. 46 (22%)of patients who had been visiting the day care had turned covid positive. Except for 2 patients who succumbed to the infection, none had major complications. 51%, 42%, 7% had mild, moderate and severe anxiety. 69%, 25%, 6% had mild, moderate and severe depression.

Experiments conducted on a real data set show that our method outperforms a number of baseline methods.","output":"Event Relationship Analysis for Temporal Event Search"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Playing doctor with children Working with kids and clinically examining children is difficult, while a proper ophthalmic examination is even more difficult Besides the obvious difficulty in getting a reliable history, one needs special skills and a kid-friendly personality to do a complete pediatric eye examination Pediatric ophthalmology outpatient departments are often specially designed with pictures, toys, entertainment, treats and play areas to put the children at ease so that parents and doctors can cajole the kids to allow a good eye examination Photo slit lamps and fundus cameras are used to send clinical images to the ophthalmologist, while vision, refraction and intraocular pressures are measured by the skilled personnel with specialized equipment","output":"Commentary: Teleophthalmology is a different ball game for kids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been previously demonstrated that the generation of measles virus (MV)-specific cytotoxicity (CTL) is reduced in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). By contrast, CTL specific for influenza virus (FLU) and mumps virus is normal. It is uncertain if reduced CTL is limited to MV in MS patients, or if reduced CTL may be found to other viruses as well. Since MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules, while FLU-specific and mumps-specific CTL have large HLA class I-restricted components, reduced MV-specific CTL may reflect a broader reduction in HLA class II-restricted CTL in patients with MS. To examine this question we studied the generation of CTL specific for herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). HSV-specific CTL, like MV-specific CTL is predominantly restricted by HLA class II molecules. We found that patients with MS had reduced generation of CTL to both MV and HSV. Most, but not all patients who had reduced generation of CTL to one virus also had a similar impairment with respect to the second virus. Some patients, however, had a reduction in the generation of CTL only to MV or to HSV. These findings extend our earlier observations regarding reduced MV-specific CTL in patients with MS to a second HLA class II-restricted virus, HSV. Such a reduction may reflect discrete impairments in immune function to separate viruses, possibly those that are associated with viral persistence, or may reflect a more generalized defect in HLA class II-restricted CTL.","output":"Multiple sclerosis patients have reduced HLA class II-restricted cytotoxic responses specific for both measles and herpes virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The titled subject has attracted much interest.

Although well characterized in viruses, how these elements may regulate cellular gene expression is not understood. Here we describe a ?1 PRF signal in the human mRNA encoding CCR5, the HIV-1 co-receptor. CCR5 mRNA-mediated ?1 PRF is directed by an mRNA pseudoknot, and is stimulated by at least two microRNAs. Mapping the mRNACmiRNA interaction suggests that formation of a triplex RNA structure stimulates ?1 PRF. A ?1 PRF event on the CCR5 mRNA directs translating ribosomes to a premature termination codon, destabilizing it through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. At least one additional mRNA decay pathway is also involved. Functional ?1 PRF signals that seem to be regulated by miRNAs are also demonstrated in mRNAs encoding six other cytokine receptors, suggesting a novel mode through which immune responses may be fine-tuned in mammalian cells.

From starting in a busy seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the virus has spread across the globe in less than a year, infecting over 76 million people and causing death of close to 1.7 million individuals worldwide. As no specific antiviral treatment is currently available, the major strategy in containing the pandemic is focused on early diagnosis and prompt isolation of the infected individuals. Several diagnostic modalities have emerged within a relatively short period, which can be broadly classified into molecular and immunological assays. While the former category is centered around real-time PCR, which is currently considered the gold standard of diagnosis, the latter aims to detect viral antigens or antibodies specific to the viral antigens and is yet to be recommended as a stand-alone diagnostic tool. This review aims to provide an update on the different diagnostic modalities that are currently being used in diagnostic laboratories across the world as well as the upcoming methods and challenges associated with each of them.

This was investigated by a cross-sectional survey administrated in Sweden during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, at the time when universities were locked down to limit viral spread and contagion. RESULTS: Mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 in cohabitants and family members were associated with students self-reported symptoms of contagion, while no associations could be seen in relation to mental health and study capacity. Symptoms of COVID-19 contagion in acquaintances and others were not associated with students self-reported symptoms, nor with their mental health and study capacity. To conclude, during the initial lockdown of universities students self-reported symptoms of contagion were mainly associated with cohabitants and family members, while symptoms of contagion in different social contexts were not associated with mental health and study capacity.

Since personal nonpharmaceutical interventions can be effective for an individuals health and psychological resilience during a pandemic, understanding tourists biosecurity behavior is essential given the broader relationship with traveling during COVID-19. However, existing research has not explicitly examined this relationship during any pandemic, nor has it explored potential long-term implications. To fill this gap, this study built and tested a theoretically comprehensive framework including prosocial behavior, ethics, perception, intervention, resilience, biosecurity behavior, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) due to COVID-19. Results reveal that prosocial behavior and perception have significant impacts on intervention, which influences resilience and biosecurity behavior. Resilience has an effect on biosecurity behavior. Three SDG groups have different effects on the relationship between intervention and biosecurity behavior.

Here, we present a cryo-EM analysis of the trimeric SARS-CoV S interactions with ACE2 and of the trypsin-cleaved S. Surprisingly, neither binding to ACE2 nor cleavage by trypsin at the S1/S2 cleavage site impart large conformational changes within S or expose the secondary cleavage site, S2. These observations suggest that S2 cleavage does not occur in the S prefusion conformation and that additional triggers may be required.","output":"Receptor binding and proteolysis do not induce large conformational changes in the SARS-CoV spike"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sexual minority women (SMW; e.g., lesbian, bisexual, queer) are at increased risk for heavy/hazardous drinking and marijuana use, which may be exacerbated by stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate its spread (e.g., sheltering at home).

Aim of this study was to perform a world-wide investigation to analyze the role of all the main climatic factors (CF), trying to identify the causes that led to the discrepancy of the results. Methods & Materials 134,871 data (from 209 countries) were used for the analysis. These were extrapolated from an initial data-set of 1.200.000 data. To avoid biases present in most of the previously studies, a set of specific requirements was adopted: long observation period (16 weeks), ? the use of a relative time scale to synchronize the beginning of the outbreak among the countries, ? multiple data collection points (up to 4 cities/per country) to overcome the problem of climate variability within a country, ? the use of an appropriate technique to test the relationships among interdependent variables, ? the use of a lag-period to compensate the shift between the infection exposure and the diagnosis confirmation. Data's analysis was performed with SEM, a flexible statistical technique for modeling causal chain of effects simultaneously. Using hypothesis-testing, this technique examines the relationships between observed variables and latent variables, in turn linked to observed variables, their indicators. With this statistical model it was possible to consider the integrated effects of all the CF on COVID-19 and, at the same time, to investigate the effects of population density (PD) too. Results The results of the analysis showed that both climate and population density significantly influence the spread of COVID-19 (p<0.001; p<0.01, respectively). Overall, climate outweighs population density (path coefficients: climate vs incidence=0.18, climate vs prevalence=0.11, PD vs incidence=0.04, PD vs prevalence=0.05). Among the climatic factors, irradiation plays the most relevant role, with a factor-loading of -0.77, followed by temperature (-0.56), humidity (0.52), precipitation (0.44), and pressure (0.073); for all p<0.001. Fit indices demonstrated a good fit of the model (determination-coefficient=0.826, Root-Mean-Square-Error-of-Approximation=0.088, Standardized-Root-Mean-Square-Residual=0.078). Conclusion This study demonstrates that CF significantly influence the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Using five national samples from the UK (n = 1050 and n = 1150), Ireland (n = 700), the USA (n = 700), Spain (n = 700) and Mexico (n = 700), we examine predictors of belief in the most common statements about the virus that contain misinformation. We also investigate the prevalence of belief in COVID-19 misinformation across different countries and the role of belief in such misinformation in predicting relevant health behaviours. We find that while public belief in misinformation about COVID-19 is not particularly common, a substantial proportion views this type of misinformation as highly reliable in each country surveyed. In addition, a small group of participants find common factual information about the virus highly unreliable. We also find that increased susceptibility to misinformation negatively affects people's self-reported compliance with public health guidance about COVID-19, as well as people's willingness to get vaccinated against the virus and to recommend the vaccine to vulnerable friends and family. Across all countries surveyed, we find that higher trust in scientists and having higher numeracy skills were associated with lower susceptibility to coronavirus-related misinformation. Taken together, these results demonstrate a clear link between susceptibility to misinformation and both vaccine hesitancy and a reduced likelihood to comply with health guidance measures, and suggest that interventions which aim to improve critical thinking and trust in science may be a promising avenue for future research.","output":"Susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19 around the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growing population of older people worldwide represents a great challenge for health systems.

In pneumonia, microaspiration is recognized as the main pathogenic mechanism; while macroaspiration which refers to the aspiration of a large amount of oropharyngeal or upper gastrointestinal content passing through the vocal cords and trachea into the lungs is identified as aspiration pneumonia. Although there are strategies for the prevention and management of patients with pneumonia that have been shown to be effective in older people with pneumonia, more research is needed on aspiration pneumonia, its risk factors and outcomes, especially since there are no specific criteria for its diagnosis and consequently, the studies on aspiration pneumonia include heterogeneous populations.","output":"Aspiration pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the physiological control of salivary secretion has been well studied, the impact of disease on salivary gland function and how this changes the composition and function of saliva is less well understood and is considered in this review. Secretion of saliva is dependent upon nerve-mediated stimuli, which activate glandular fluid and protein secretory mechanisms. The volume of saliva secreted by salivary glands depends upon the frequency and intensity of nerve-mediated stimuli, which increase dramatically with food intake and are subject to facilitatory or inhibitory influences within the central nervous system. Longer-term changes in saliva secretion have been found to occur in response to dietary change and aging, and these physiological influences can alter the composition and function of saliva in the mouth. Salivary gland dysfunction is associated with different diseases, including Sj?gren syndrome, sialadenitis, and iatrogenic disease, due to radiotherapy and medications and is usually reported as a loss of secretory volume, which can range in severity. Defining salivary gland dysfunction by measuring salivary flow rates can be difficult since these vary widely in the healthy population. However, saliva can be sampled noninvasively and repeatedly, which facilitates longitudinal studies of subjects, providing a clearer picture of altered function. The application of omics technologies has revealed changes in saliva composition in many systemic diseases, offering disease biomarkers, but these compositional changes may not be related to salivary gland dysfunction. In Sj?gren syndrome, there appears to be a change in the rheology of saliva due to altered mucin glycosylation. Analysis of glandular saliva in diseases or therapeutic interventions causing salivary gland inflammation frequently shows increased electrolyte concentrations and increased presence of innate immune proteins, most notably lactoferrin. Altering nerve-mediated signaling of salivary gland secretion contributes to medication-induced dysfunction and may also contribute to altered saliva composition in neurodegenerative disease.","output":"Disease-Induced Changes in Salivary Gland Function and the Composition of Saliva"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection will play a critical role in the development of vaccines and antibody-based interventions.

Serum neutralization and effector functions correlated with systemic SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG response magnitude, while mucosal neutralization was associated with nasal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA. Antibody depletion experiments support the mechanistic relevance of these correlations. Associations between nasal IgA responses, virus neutralization at the mucosa, and less severe disease suggest the importance of assessing mucosal immunity in larger natural infection cohorts.

The reproductive number (R) is a metric to estimate the transmission of a pathogen during an outbreak. Preliminary published estimates were based on the initial outbreak in China. Whole genome sequences (WGS) analysis found mutational variations in the viral genome; however, previous comparisons failed to show a direct relationship between viral genome diversity, transmission, and the epidemic severity. COVID-19 incidences from different countries were modeled over the epidemic curve. Estimates of the instantaneous R (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval were done. WGS were used to determine the populations genomic variation and that underpinned creation of the pathogen genome identity (GENI) score, which was merged with the outbreak curve in four distinct phases. Inference of transmission time was based on a mutation rate of 2 mutations/month. R estimates revealed differences in the transmission and variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak progression for each country examined. Outside China, our R estimates observed propagating dynamics indicating that other countries were poised to move to the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had no clear relationship to the outbreak progression. Integration of incidence data with the GENI score directly predicted increases in cases as the genome variation increased that led to new variants. Integrating the outbreak curve, dynamic R, and SNP variation found a direct association between increasing cases and transmission genome evolution. By defining the epidemic curve into four stages and integrating the instantaneous country-specific R with the GENI score, we directly connected changes in individual outbreaks based on changes in the virus genome via SNPs. This resulted in the ability to forecast potential increases in cases as well as mutations that may defeat PCR screening and the infection process. By using instantaneous R estimations and WGS, outbreak dynamics were defined to be linked to viral mutations, indicating that WGS, as a surveillance tool, is required to predict shifts in each outbreak that will provide actionable decision making information.

Inadequate ES contribute to the labour market vulnerability of workers; however, they are not typically considered to be risk factors for workplace injury. In a sample of Canadian workers, we examine the risk of injury associated with inadequate ES, independent of, and combined with inadequate workplace protections from workplace hazards. METHODS: Data from 2,803 adults working 15 hours or more/week in workplaces with at least five employees were analysed. We explored associations between exposure to workplace hazards with inadequate protections [termed occupational health and safety (OHS) vulnerability] and inadequate ES on workplace injury (physical or mental injury; injury requiring time off). Additive interaction models were used to examine the independent and combined effects of these exposures. RESULTS: Occupational health and safety vulnerability and inadequate ES were independently associated with increased injury outcomes. Adjusted models showed an additive relationship for all injury outcomes between OHS vulnerability and inadequate ES. Statistically significant superadditive relationships were observed for physical injury risk with policy and procedure vulnerability plus inadequate ES [synergy index (S) 1.50, 95% CI: 1.13C2.00] and for overall OHS vulnerability plus inadequate ES (S 1.53, 95% CI: 1.16C2.02), suggesting a combined effect greater than independent effects.

Patients with rheumatic diseases and those receiving immunosuppressive treatment are felt to be at greater risk of complications from this illness, though registry and trial data should help refine our understanding of these risks. We hereby describe a case of COVID-19 complicating an unusual rheumatic illness, resulting in severe multi-system disease and premature death. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69 year-old male presented to rheumatology and haematology with symmetrical polyarthritis, thrombocytopenia (18 x 10(9)/L), eosinophilia (25.4 x 10(9)/L), raised C-reactive protein (CRP, 43 mg/L), positive rheumatoid factor (>200), antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-Ro. Bone marrow biopsy did not demonstrate evidence of haematological malignancy. Seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and connective tissue disease overlap were diagnosed, and treatment with Prednisolone 60mg daily was initiated. Despite rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulins, thrombocytopenia deteriorated on reducing corticosteroids, however the addition of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) allowed gradual prednisolone tapering to 3mg daily. Hydroxychloroquine was briefly added but discontinued due to headaches. MMF was discontinued after he developed fungal pneumonia followed by jaundice. Liver biopsy was consistent with drug-induced cholestasis, attributed to co-amoxiclav, and his liver function tests (LFTs) improved on ursodeoxycholic acid. Following a further deterioration in thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinaemia and new onset erythema nodosum, he had a repeat bone marrow examination. This demonstrated large areas of fibrosis and granulomatous inflammation with a dense, pleomorphic T-cell infiltrate, but no haemophagocytosis. Haematologists felt this was reactive and prednisolone dose was increased to 10mg daily. Six months later he developed cholangitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) demonstrated a tight 4cm stricture of the distal common bile duct (CBD) within the head of pancreas, which was diffusely swollen without any clear focal mass. Serum amylase was mildly elevated (316 units/L). Concurrent CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis demonstrated bilateral ground-glass changes within the lungs, and a SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR test was positive, though he had no respiratory symptoms or oxygen requirement at that stage. Sadly, four days after the CT scan and before a planned endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) could be performed, he became markedly hypoxic with plain chest x-ray features suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite medical management, including doubling of his prednisolone dose, he rapidly deteriorated and died. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: This case highlights an unusual presentation of COVID-19 in a patient with a complex background of inflammatory arthritis with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. At the time of his final illness, these conditions were managed with steroid monotherapy. Based on the COVID-19 risk matrix recommended by the British Society for Rheumatology, he was not identified as a patient requiring shielding. Cholangitis was the major problem precipitating his final admission to hospital, and at the time of admission he had no respiratory symptoms. One week prior to this admission, his father-in-law had died of COVID-19 pneumonia, though they had not been in recent direct contact. Interstitial lung changes were incidentally noted on a CT performed to identify the cause of cholangitis, which prompted the nasopharyngeal PCR that detected SARS-CoV-2. This occurred prior to widespread routine testing of hospital inpatients for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Unfortunately he then rapidly developed COVID-19 pneumonia and died before the underlying cause of cholangitis could be definitively identified, though an MRCP demonstrated an obstructed CBD within a diffusely swollen pancreas, where a differential diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy or autoimmune pancreatitis was suggested by the reporting radiologist. There are emerging case reports of COVID-19 resulting in significant pancreatic injuryand a further recent laboratory analysis has suggested that ACE2 receptors, which are utilised by SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry to host cells, are highly expressed on cholangiocytes at a comparable level to type II alveolar cells. Whilst the ultimate cause of cholangitis will remain unknown in this patient, this case highlights the potential for atypical presentations and extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. Case report - Key learning points: 1. COVID-19 is a multi-system illness which can cause significant extra-pulmonary as well as pulmonary pathology, with emerging reports that the biliary tract and pancreas are frequently affected. 2. Evidence to inform accurate prediction of which patients with rheumatic diseases are at highest risk of acquiring severe COVID-19 disease remains insufficient, with current shielding guidelines based on expert consensus. 3. This case highlights the importance of widespread testing for COVID-19 in hospital patients, as not all patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus will demonstrate classical respiratory features of the disease at the point of admission.","output":"EP05 COVID-19 and the biliary tree: atypical manifestations of disease during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of the current study was to assess the influence of anesthetic management on the effect of treatment in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN). METHODS MR CLEAN was a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial of intra-arterial therapy (IAT) vs no IAT. The intended anesthetic management at the start of the procedure was used for this post hoc analysis. The primary effect parameter was the adjusted common odds ratio (acOR) for a shift in direction of a better outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days, estimated with multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis, which included a term for general anesthesia (GA). RESULTS GA was associated with significant (p = 0.011) effect modification, resulting in estimated decrease of 51% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31%-86%) in treatment effect compared to non-GA. We found a shift in the distribution on the mRS in favor of non-GA compared to control group (acOR 2.18 [95% CI 1.49-3.20]). The shift in distribution between GA and control group was in a similar direction (acOR 1.12 [95% CI 0.71-1.78]) with loss of statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS In this post hoc analysis, we found that the type of anesthetic management influences outcome following IAT. Only treatment without general anesthesia was associated with a significant treatment benefit in MR CLEAN.

Among 1399 singleton males from the Raine Study, 410 had maternal serum and at least one height, BMI or DEXA outcome available after birth and up to 20 years of age. Maternal serum collected at 18 and 34 weeks' gestation was pooled, and analyzed for concentrations of 32 metabolites of 15 phthalate diesters. Their serum concentrations were categorized into undetectable/detectable levels or tertiles. Linear mixed models were used to determine associations between maternal serum phthalate levels and longitudinal height and body mass index (BMI) z-scores in boys from birth to 20 years of age (n=250 and n=295 respectively). Linear regression was used to determine associations between maternal phthalate levels and deviation from mid-parental height (n=177) and DEXA scan outcomes (n=191) at the 20 year follow-up. Weak positive associations of participants height z-score increase were detected with exposure to some phthalate metabolites in particular to the lower molecular weight phthalate metabolites. Less consistent findings, by mixed model analyses, were detected for BMI and body composition, by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), with some positive associations of phthalate metabolites with BMI and some negative associations with DEXA fat tissue measures, although no consistent findings were evident. In conclusion, we derived some associations of childhood growth with prenatal phthalate exposure, particularly with respect to the lower molecular weight phthalate metabolites.","output":"The influence of prenatal exposure to phthalates on subsequent male growth and body composition in adolescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks, failures of attentional selectivity are frequently observed when a single target is followed by a potentially reportable distractor (distractor intrusions). However, in tasks with two targets, accuracy for both targets is typically high when they are presented in immediate succession (lag-1 sparing). To account for this apparent contradiction, we tested whether expectations about the number of targets affects the number of items encoded in working memory (WM). Colored target digits were embedded among gray letters and digits. The first target was followed either by a gray digit, or a second target (another colored digit). To manipulate expectations, the ratio of one-target and two-targets trials (75% to 25% or vice versa) was varied between blocks. Participants were much more likely to report seeing two targets when two targets were expected. Analogous results were obtained in an additional experiment where two successive colored digits appeared on all trials, and participants were instructed to either report both or only the first digit. ERP markers of attentional allocation (N2pc) and WM storage processes (contralateral delayed activity, CDA) were larger when two targets were expected, regardless of the actual number of targets. These results show that the number of expected targets modulates the activation of sensory representations during attentional episodes, which affects the probability that they are subsequently encoded in WM. These findings suggest that a single mechanism can account both for lag-1 sparing and distractor intrusions in RSVP tasks. They also provide new evidence for strategic top-down control over WM encoding.

There are worldwide descriptions of neurological deficits in COVID-19 patients. Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms can be present early in the course of the disease. As many as 55% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been reported to have neurological disturbances three months after infection by SARS-CoV-2. The mutability of the SARS-COV-2 virus and its potential to directly affect the CNS highlight the urgency of developing technology to diagnose, manage, and treat brain injury in COVID-19 patients. The pathobiology of CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the associated neurological sequelae of this infection remain poorly understood. In this review, we outline the rationale for the use of blood biomarkers (BBs) for diagnosis of brain injury in COVID-19 patients, the research needed to incorporate their use into clinical practice, and the improvements in patient management and outcomes that can result. BBs of brain injury could potentially provide tools for detection of brain injury in COVID-19 patients. Elevations of BBs have been reported in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of COVID-19 patients. BB proteins have been analyzed in CSF to detect CNS involvement in patients with infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculous meningitis. BBs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for diagnosis of mild versus moderate traumatic brain injury and have identified brain injury after stroke, cardiac arrest, hypoxia, and epilepsy. BBs, integrated with other diagnostic tools, could enhance understanding of viral mechanisms of brain injury, predict severity of neurological deficits, guide triage of patients and assignment to appropriate medical pathways, and assess efficacy of therapeutic interventions in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Blood Biomarkers for Detection of Brain Injury in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE To study the impact of the size of internal limiting membrane inverted flap on the rate and timing of large idiopathic macular hole (MH) closure.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Swiss university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 1459 individuals with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 2 March and 23 April 2020. METHODS: We applied the rule of 10 events per variable to construct our multivariable model and included a maximum of eight covariates. We assessed the model performance in terms of discrimination and calibration and performed internal validation to estimate the statistical optimism of the final model. The final prediction model included age, fever, dyspnoea, hypertension and chronic respiratory disease. To develop the OUTCoV score, we assigned points for each predictor that were proportional to the coefficients of the regression equation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were estimated, including positive and negative predictive values in different thresholds. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalisation. RESULTS: The OUTCoV score ranged from 0 to 7.5 points. The two threshold parameters with optimal rule-out and rule-in characteristics for the risk of hospitalisation were 3 and 5.5, respectively. Outpatients with a score <3 (997/1459; 68.3%) had no follow-up as at low risk of hospitalisation (1.8%; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8). For a score 5.5 (20/1459; 1.4%), the hospitalisation risk was higher (30%; 95% CI 11.9 to 54.3). CONCLUSIONS: The OUTCoV score allows to rule out two-thirds of outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting a low hospitalisation risk and to identify those at high risk that require careful follow-up to assess the need for hospitalisation.

The specimen collection procedure is time and resource-consuming, but more importantly, it places nurses at risk for potential infection. The practice of allowing patients to self-collect their diagnostic specimens may provide an alternative testing model for the current COVID-19 outbreaks. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy and patient perception of self-collected specimens for respiratory tract infection diagnostics. Methods A concise clinical review of the recently published literature was conducted. Results A total of 11 articles were included the review synthesis. The concept of self-collected specimens has a high patient acceptance rate of 83-99%. Self-collected nasal-swab specimens demonstrated strong diagnostic fidelity for respiratory tract infections with a sensitivity between 80-100%, this is higher than the 76% sensitivity observed with self-collected throat specimens. In a comparative study evaluating a professionally collected to a self-collected specimen for COVID-19 testing, a high degree of agreement (k = 0.89) was observed between the two methods.

In Italy, available data highlight that general practitioners (GPs) are, apparently, the most heavily affected group. Indeed, they currently represent 44.1% of the total COVID-19 related death cases occurred among physicians, whereas they constitute about 15% of the total number of doctors. This high proportion is most likely the consequence of a work-related contagion happening especially during the first weeks of the epidemic, and persisting also in the following weeks, after the national lockdown. There are various reasons for these higher contagion rates: GPs perform a lot of medical examinations daily, usually in close contact with patients. Especially at the beginning of the epidemic, GPs might have had scant information on the specific safety procedures for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., there was limited knowledge on the possibility of contagions deriving from asymptomatic patients) and, moreover, the availability of personal protective equipment was insufficient. Furthermore, the risk of infection is highly increased by the virus' characteristics, like its survival for several hours/days on different surfaces and its persistence in the air after an aerosolization process, with possibilities to be transmitted over distances longer than two meters. Following these observations, and considering the high cost in term of GPs' lives, the COVID-19 pandemic will probably revolutionize the approach to patients in general practice.

Method We designed a structured anonymous online questionnaire and encourage students to fill it in on social platforms. The questionnaire is composed of seven parts, each one includes multiple choice questions aimed to measure the impact of the pandemic on different aspect of daily activities namely: academic performance, social and family relationship, eating and smoking habits, sleep pattern, physical activity and the Depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). The last part was an open question where participants can state their comments about the experiences during the quarantine and how they affected their mental health. Result A total of 1181 students from the six academic grades responded. Females and students in the third academic year showed the highest prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress. Overall, most respondents reported that the current pandemic had negative impacts on their academic performance (71%) and social relationship (67.5 %). The majority of the students stated that they became less physically active (74.6%) and 52.2% experienced a weight gain. Despite that 60% of the studied population rated their sleeping quality as very good and fairly good, 45.3% and 39.6% suffered from increased sleeping hours and disturbed sleep respectively. Based on students responses of the DASS-21, over half of the participants (62.2%) were experiencing moderate to extremely severe stress and over 33% were consistent with symptoms of extremely severe anxiety. In respect of depression, nearly half of the sample (46.4%) can be described as having extremely severe depression according to the cut-off points of the DASS-21. Conclusion The current pandemic has increased the challenges and burdens on undergraduate medical students. These impacts can be more profound in developing countries such as Egypt.

We discuss several possibilities but also limitations of surveys statistics to cope with the manifold challenges by a proper survey concept and design of a sample. A central issue is the difficult link of medical tests with representative populations surveys where confidentiality rules in the case of individual feedback of test results pose a special challenge.

We redistributed central stocks of medicines to peripheral health facilities to ensure local availability for several months. We equipped smaller, remote health facilities with medicine tackle boxes. We also made deliveries of medicines to patients with difficulty reaching facilities.

To mitigate transmission, most states ordered shelter-in-place orders in March and reopening strategies varied. OBJECTIVE: To estimate excess COVID-19 cases and deaths after reopening compared with trends prior to reopening for two groups of states: (1) states with an evidence-based reopening strategy, defined as reopening indoor dining after implementing a statewide mask mandate, and (2) states reopening indoor dining rooms before implementing a statewide mask mandate. DESIGN: Interrupted time series quasi-experimental study design applied to publicly available secondary data. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty United States and the District of Columbia. INTERVENTIONS: Reopening indoor dining rooms before or after implementing a statewide mask mandate. MAIN MEASURES: Outcomes included daily cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths for each state. KEY RESULTS: On average, the number of excess cases per 100,000 residents in states reopening without masks is ten times the number in states reopening with masks after 8 weeks (643.1 cases; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 406.9, 879.2 and 62.9 cases; CI = 12.6, 113.1, respectively). Excess cases after 6 weeks could have been reduced by 90% from 576,371 to 63,062 and excess deaths reduced by 80% from 22,851 to 4858 had states implemented mask mandates prior to reopening. Over 50,000 excess deaths were prevented within 6 weeks in 13 states that implemented mask mandates prior to reopening. CONCLUSIONS: Additional mitigation measures such as mask use counteract the potential growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths due to reopening businesses. This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19.

PURPOSE: To assess the impact of universal face medical masks in public places on motivation to using hearing aids of patients with ski-slope hearing loss. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All the 504 patients (18-65 years old), who applied for < hearing care assistance and for the first time bought hearing aid were included. 266 patients (group A) applied from June to November 2020, when wearing facial masks was mandatory; 238 patients (group B) applied from June to November 2019, when wearing facial masks wasn't required. In both groups patients, who fulfilled the following criteria, were selected: 1) binaural mild to severe sensorineural ski-slope hearing loss lasting more than 3 years; 2) no progression of hearing loss within the last 3 years; 3) pure tone audiometry <20 dB HL at 125-1000 Hz frequencies; 4) hearing care with mono- or binaural hearing aids with the receiver-in-the-canal open-type.

Prospective biomarkers may help to predict the severity of an individual's clinical course and mortality risk. We analyzed asymmetric (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in blood samples from 31 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. We calculated associations of ADMA and SDMA with mortality and organ failure, and we developed a predictive algorithm based upon these biomarkers to predict mortality risk. Nine patients (29%) experienced in-hospital death. SDMA and ADMA serum concentrations were significantly higher at admission in COVID-19 patients who died than in survivors. Cut-offs of 0.90 mol/L for SDMA (AUC, 0.904, p = 0.0005) and 0.66 mol/L for ADMA (AUC, 0.874, p = 0.0013) were found in ROC analyses to best discriminate both subgroups of patients. Hazard ratio for in-hospital mortality was 12.2 (95% CI: 2.2-31.2) for SDMA and 6.3 (1.1-14.7) for ADMA above cut-off. Sequential analysis of both biomarkers allowed discriminating a high-risk group (87.5% mortality) from an intermediate-risk group (25% mortality) and a low-risk group (0% mortality). Elevated circulating concentrations of SDMA and ADMA may help to better identify COVID-19 patients with a high risk of in-hospital mortality.","output":"Elevated serum SDMA and ADMA at hospital admission predict in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online transaction has recently benefited from coronavirus;however, the sales of e-commerce in some areas are substantially on the decline.

Methods: Clinical data of four cases of patients that suffered COVID-19 from February 2(nd) to February 9(th), 2020 at Department of Pancreatic Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology were reviewed induding 4 males and 1 female, aging of 50, 51, 46, 87 years old, respectively. After the first patients cuffed nosocomial infection of COVID-19, the general protective measures were updated.Only one patient was admitted to each room alone, with no more than one caregiver. The body temperature of care givers was measured twice a day.Primary protections were applied to all staff.The floor was sterilized using disinfectant with an effective chlorine concentration of 1 000 mg/L. The protective measures for interventional procedures were as follow. Primary protection was applied to the operators of central venipuncture catheter, percutaneous abdominal/pleural drainage, percutaneous retroperitoneal drainage, percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage and other surgical procedures with local anesthesia and epidural anesthesia. Secondary protection was applied to the operators of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and surgical procedures with general anesthesia. Results: There were four patients who were diagnosed as COVID-19, of which one died of COVID-19, two were cured, and one was still in hospital for COVID-19. After the update of protective measures, no more nosocomial infection of COVID-19 occurred. Two central venipuncture catheter, three percutaneous abdominal or pleural drainage, one percutaneous retroperitoneal drainage, one percuteneous transhepatic cholecyst drainage and one open surgery with general anesthesia were performed with no infection of operators.

This study aimed to evaluate and interpret Google search queries for terms related to the Ebola outbreak both at the global level and in all countries where primary cases of Ebola occurred. The study also endeavoured to look at the correlation between the number of overall and weekly web searches and the number of overall and weekly new cases of Ebola. METHODS: Google Trends (GT) was used to explore Internet activity related to Ebola. The study period was from 29 December 2013 to 14 June 2015. Pearsons correlation was performed to correlate Ebola-related relative search volumes (RSVs) with the number of weekly and overall Ebola cases. Multivariate regression was performed using Ebola-related RSV as a dependent variable, and the overall number of Ebola cases and the Human Development Index were used as predictor variables. RESULTS: The greatest RSV was registered in the three West African countries mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic. The queries varied in the different countries. Both quantitative and qualitative differences between the affected African countries and other Western countries with primary cases were noted, in relation to the different flux volumes and different time courses. In the affected African countries, web query search volumes were mostly concentrated in the capital areas. However, in Western countries, web queries were uniformly distributed over the national territory. In terms of the three countries mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic, the correlation between the number of new weekly cases of Ebola and the weekly GT index varied from weak to moderate. The correlation between the number of Ebola cases registered in all countries during the study period and the GT index was very high. CONCLUSION: Google Trends showed a coarse-grained nature, strongly correlating with global epidemiological data, but was weaker at country level, as it was prone to distortions induced by unbalanced media coverage and the digital divide. Global and local health agencies could usefully exploit GT data to identify disease-related information needs and plan proper communication strategies, particularly in the case of health-threatening events.

Wearing a mask is a straightforward action that can be taken, but shortage of stock and equity of allocation were important issues in Taiwan. Furthermore, increased anxiety leading to the stockpiling of masks has been common during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aim to summarize the name-based mask rationing plan implemented in Taiwan and explore the publics perceived anxiety about mask shortages. METHODS: The government of Taiwan took action to control the supply and allocation of face masks. We summarize the timeline and important components of the mask rationing plan. A survey that aimed to investigate the overall response to the mask rationing plan was answered by 44 participants. RESULTS: The mask rationing plan was implemented in late January 2020. Daily production capacity was increased from 2 million masks to 16 million masks in April 2020. People could buy 9 masks in 14 days by verification via their National Health Insurance card. Digital face mask availability maps were created. Moreover, the mask plan safeguarded the purchase of masks and resulted in decreased anxiety about a mask shortage (4.05 [SD 1.15] points; 72.7% [n=32] of participants answered agree or strongly agree). The majority of people felt that the mask plan was satisfactory (4.2 [SD 0.92] points; 79.5% [n=35] of participants answered agree or strongly agree). CONCLUSIONS: We found that the unique name-based mask rationing plan allowed for control of the production and supply of masks, and contributed to the appropriate allocation of masks.

Currently, commercial methods for SWE rely on directional filtering based on the prior knowledge of the wave propagation direction, to remove complicated wave patterns formed due to reflection and refraction. The result is a set of decomposed directional waves that are separately analyzed to construct shear modulus fields that are then combined through compounding. Instead, PWE relies on a rigorous representation of the wave propagation using the frequency-domain scalar wave equation to automatically select appropriate propagation directions and simultaneously reconstruct shear modulus fields. Specifically, assuming a homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible, linear-elastic medium, we represent the solution of the wave equation using a linear combination of plane waves propagating in arbitrary directions. Given this closed-form solution, we formulate the SWE problem as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem which can be solved very efficiently. Through numerous phantom studies, we show that PWE can handle complicated waveforms without prior filtering and is competitive with state-of-the-art that requires prior filtering based on the knowledge of propagation directions.","output":"Plane wave elastography: a frequency-domain ultrasound shear wave elastography approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a worldwide slowdown in activity as more people practice social distancing and shelter at home The attendant increase in time","output":"Sheltering in Place and Domestic Violence: Evidence from Calls for Service during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last year, mental health services offered virtually have increased significantly in response to COVID-19.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), also known as suicidal NETosis, are a powerful and ancient innate effector mechanism by which polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) battle parasitic organisms like protozoa and helminths. Here, C. parvum oocysts and live sporozoites were utilized to examine suicidal NETosis in exposed bovine PMN under both 5% O2 (physiological conditions within small intestinal tract) and 21% O2 (normal hyperoxic conditions in research facilities). Both sporozoites and oocysts induced suicidal NETosis in exposed PMN under physioxia (5% O2) and hyperoxia (21% O2). Besides, C. parvum-induced suicidal NETosis was affirmed by total break of PMN, co-localization of extracellular DNA decorated with pan-histones (H1A, H2A/H2B, H3, H4) and neutrophil elastase (NE) by means of confocal- and immunofluorescence microscopy investigations. C. parvum-triggered NETs entrapped sporozoites and impeded sporozoite egress from oocysts covered by released NETs, according to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination. Live cell 3D-holotomographic microscopy analysis visualized early parasite-induced PMN morphological changes, such as the formation of membrane protrusions towards C. parvum while undergoing NETosis. Significant reduction of C. parvum-induced suicidal NETosis was measured after PMN treatments with purinergic receptor P2X1 inhibitor NF449, under both oxygen circumstances, this receptor was found to play a critical role in the induction of NETs, indicating its importance. Similarly, inhibition of PMN glycolysis via 2-deoxy glucose treatments resulted in a reduction of C. parvum-triggered suicidal NETosis but not significantly.

While SDL is focused on an individual learner, collaboration is critically important in medicine. We developed an online course using the collaborative SDL (CSDL) framework. A goal for the course was for students to gain a better appreciation for the SDL process by exploring the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We utilized CSDL to implement a 2-week elective attended by fifteen M3 and M4 medical students. Students submitted short videos reflecting on their course experience and the relevance of the material to their future training. Qualitative analysis of reflections was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the CSDL framework, and an assessment of the course evaluations was performed to explore student perceptions of the course and its effectiveness at preparing them for practice. A survey regarding student perceptions of SDL was offered to M3 and M4 students in order to explore their experiences with SDL and perceptions of its importance in the context of the school curriculum. RESULTS: The CSDL framework was effective in making students aware of the importance of SDL in medical practice. Students gained basic and clinical knowledge about the subject, experienced increased confidence, and appreciated collaborating with their peers. The survey offered to the general student body reflected that all students perceived that they employed SDL in their time as medical students. However, many students indicated that they had not utilized components of SDL beyond synthesizing and assessing their learning needs.

The ciliate populations of two temporary ponds in southern Ontario were studied throughout their aquatic phases in 2001. Pond I (1 ha) held water for 98 days, whereas Pond II (0.25 ha) held water for 34 days. Populations were assessed both within the ponds themselves and within a series of enclosures in which invertebrate predator pressure was manipulated. 2. In the natural pond water, total ciliate abundance in Pond II rose rapidly from day 1 increasing two orders of magnitude by day 7. In contrast, total abundance in Pond I began at the same level as in Pond II but increased much more slowly, reached a plateau of around 500 individuals L(?1), and increased again late in the hydroperiod. 3. Despite being only 500 m apart, the two ponds were fairly dissimilar in terms of their species richness and species composition. Pond I contained 50 species compared with 70 species for Pond II, with only 24 species shared. Additional species occurred within the enclosures raising the total species richness to 145 species; 88 from Pond I, 104 from Pond II, with 47 species (30%) in common. Pond II contained more mid\\\\sized ciliates (50C200 m), whereas Pond I was dominated by smaller ciliates, especially in mid\\\\May and early June. In Pond I, cumulative species richness throughout the hydroperiod was highest in the predator addition enclosures (65  4 species), followed by the partial\\\\predator exclusion enclosures (50  4). Lowest species richness was found in the control enclosures (39  2) and in the pondwater controls (39  0). Differences between the ciliates in the natural pond water and the enclosures appeared to be related to a greater concentration of phytoplankton within the enclosures (perhaps resulting from extensive growth of duckweed, Lemna, outside), and higher densities of zooplankters in the pond. 4. The physicochemical environment influenced species richness, total abundance and the number of rare species (27 in Pond II versus 13 in Pond I). Variation in ciliate abundance in Pond I could be explained by the number of days after filling (39%) and enclosure treatment (23%). These two parameters also explained 72% of the variation in species richness in Pond I (46 and 26%, respectively). Sixty\\\\five per cent of the variation in abundance in Pond II could be explained by the measured parameters: number of days after filling 27%, pH 19%, and nitrate levels 12%. Fifty\\\\two per cent of the variation in species richness was explained by the environmental parameters, of which pH was the most influential. Species succession was a strong feature of both ponds and its relationship to environmental variables and the presence of other organisms is discussed. 5. Addition of invertebrate predators resulted in higher abundance and higher species richness for a limited time period in one of the ponds C suggesting that differences in foodweb dynamics may influence ciliate community composition.","output":"Ciliate populations in temporary freshwater ponds: seasonal dynamics and influential factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver cirrhosis represents a type of end-stage liver disease with few effective therapies, which was characterized by damaged functional liver tissue due to long-term inflammation.

In this study, we used a CCl(4)-induced cirrhosis model and found stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) infusion showed profound therapeutic effects for liver cirrhosis. Mechanistically, NLRP3 inflammasome-activated GSDMD and its pyroptosis were upregulated in liver cirrhosis, while SHED infusion could suppress the expression of GSDMD and Caspase-1, resulting in reduced hepatocyte pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine IL-1 release. Consistently, SHED could inhibit the elevated expression of NLRP3, GSDMD and Caspase-1 induced by CCl(4) treatment in vitro co-culture system, which was mediated by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Moreover, the pyroptosis inhibitor disulfiram showed similar therapeutic effects for liver cirrhosis as SHED.

The objective of this study was to find the prevalence of fungal infections among teledermatology consultations done in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: It was a descriptive cross-sectional study where the store and forward and real-time methods were used between February 2020 to July 2020. Ethical clearance was taken from the institutional review board (reference number: 245). Data of those patients who wanted consultations from this department were sent by medical officers deployed in military hospitals that are under the central army hospital located in Kathmandu. Convenient sampling was used. The collected data was entered and analyzed in the Statistical Package of Social Sciences version 20. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and percentage for binary data. RESULTS: A total of 451 (33.45%) (30.93-35.97 at 95% Confidence Interval) were diagnosed with fungal infections out of 1348 patients who were enrolled for the study.

However, the association between preoperative frailty and POD remains difficult to characterize owing to the large number of frailty and POD assessment tools used in the literature, only a few of which are validated. Furthermore, some validated frailty tools fail to provide clear score cutoffs for distinguishing frail and nonfrail patients. We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the relationship between preoperative frailty and POD. METHODS We searched several major databases for articles that investigated the relationship between preoperative frailty and POD in patients with mean age 65 years who were undergoing elective, nonemergent inpatient surgery. Inclusion criteria included articles published in English no earlier than 1999. Both preoperative frailty and POD must have been measured with validated tools using clear cutoff scores for frailty and delirium. Articles were selected and data extracted independently by 2 researchers. Risk of bias (ROBINS-I) and presence of confounders were summarized. Odds ratios (ORs) for POD associated with frailty relative to nonfrailty were computed with adjusted ORs when available. Original estimates were pooled by random effects analysis. Statistical significance was set at 2-sided P < .05. RESULTS Nine studies qualified for meta-analysis. The Fried score or a modified version of it was used in 5 studies. Frailty prevalence ranged from 18.6% to 56%. Delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) or Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) in 7 studies, Delirium Observation Scale in 1 study, and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist in 1 study. The incidence of POD ranged from 7% to 56%. ROBINS-I risk of bias was low in 1 study, moderate in 4 studies, serious in 3 studies, and critical in 1 study. Random effects analysis (n = 794) of the OR for POD in frail versus nonfrail patients based on adjusted OR estimates was significant with an OR of 2.14 and a 95% confidence interval of 1.43-3.19. The I2 value was in the low range at 5.5, suggesting small variability from random effects. Funnel-plot analysis did not definitively support either the presence or absence of publication bias.

A number of experimental methods show a comparable molecular packing in both media driven by a synergy of solvophobic, aromatic and weak hydrogen-bonding interactions. However, morphological analysis of the respective aggregates in aqueous and non-polar media reveals a restricted aggregate growth in aqueous media into spherical nanoparticles and a non-restricted 2D-nanosheet formation in non-polar media. These findings are attributed to a considerably more efficient solvation and, in turn, increased steric demand of the hydrophilic chains in aqueous media than in nonpolar media, which can be explained by the entrapment of water molecules in the hydrophilic aggregate shell via hydrogen bonds.

CONCLUSIONS: eXtreme Gradient Boosting had the highest discrimination overall, and our simple tool had higher discrimination than a modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, National Early Warning Score, and CURB-65 on external validation. These models could be used to improve triage decisions and clinical trial enrichment.","output":"Machine Learning Prediction of Death in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first step in infection of influenza A virus is contact with the host cell membrane, with which it later fuses. The composition of the target bilayer exerts a complex influence on both fusion efficiency and time. Here, an in vitro, single-particle approach is used to study this effect. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and a microfluidic flow cell, the hemifusion of single virions is visualized. Hemifusion efficiency and kinetics are studied while altering target bilayer cholesterol content and sialic-acid donor. Cholesterol ratios tested were 0%, 10%, 20%, and 40%. Sialic-acid donors GD1a and GYPA were used. Both cholesterol ratio and sialic-acid donors proved to have a significant effect on hemifusion efficiency. Furthermore, comparison between GD1a and GYPA conditions shows that the cholesterol dependence of the hemifusion time is severely affected by the sialic-acid donor. Only GD1a shows a clear increasing trend in hemifusion efficiency and time with increasing cholesterol concentration of the target bilayer with maximum rates for GD1A and 40% cholesterol. Overall our results show that sialic acid donor and target bilayer composition should be carefully chosen, depending on the desired hemifusion time and efficiency in the experiment.","output":"Single-particle fusion of influenza viruses reveals complex interactions with target membranes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) had resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 primarily posed a threat to the respiratory system and violated many different organs, including the heart, kidney, liver, and blood vessels with the development of the disease. Severe patients were often accompanied by cardiac injury, and once the heart gets damaged, the mortality of patients will significantly increase. The main clinical manifestations of cardiac injury range from myocarditis, heart failure (HF), arrhythmia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). A high abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) on the membrane of cardiomyocytes makes it possible that the virus can directly attack cardiomyocytes as subsequently evidenced by the detection of spike protein and virus RNA in autopsy cardiac tissues. The secondary myocardial injury through systemic inflammatory and immune response also caused obvious cardiac damage. The pathological manifestations of heart tissue were diverse, varied from mild cardiomyocyte edema, myocardial hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte degeneration, and necrosis to severe myocarditis caused by lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration. However, the mechanism of heart injury was still unclear.

Long-term treatment is associated with a small increase in the risk of herpes virus reactivation and respiratory tract infections. Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) under Fingolimod treatment have not been described. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a 57-year old female patient with a relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis under fingolimod treatment who experienced a severe COVID-19 infection in March 2020 (Extended Disability Status Scale: 2.0). Having peripheral lymphopenia typical for fingolimod treatment (total lymphocytes 0.39/nL [reference range 1.22-3.56]), the patient developed bilateral interstitial pneumonia with multiple ground-glass opacities on chest CT. Fingolimod medication was stopped. On the intensive care unit, non-invasive ventilation was used to provide oxygen and ventilation support regularly. Over the following two days, oxygenation improved, and the patient was transferred to a normal ward five days after admission. CONCLUSION: The implications fingolimod has on COVID-19 are complex. As an S1P analogue, fingolimod might enhance lung endothelial cell integrity. In addition, in case of a so-called cytokine storm, immunomodulation might be beneficial to reduce mortality.

The synergistic use of models and methods that rely on graph theory has enabled the visualization and analysis of the molecular context of virus/host PPIs. We review current knowledge on the SARS-COV-2/host interactome cascade involved in the viral pathogenicity through the graph theory concept and highlight the hub proteins in the intra-viral network that create a subnet with a small number of host central proteins, leading to cell disintegration and infectivity.

It was first reported on in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China and within three month spread as a pandemic around the whole globe. Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of the pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US, and show that both distributions follow a truncated power-law over five orders of magnitude. We are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual-scale process: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and the small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is determined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model, describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak. Assessing how well a simple dual-scale model predicts the early spread of epidemics, despite the huge contrasts between countries, could help identify critical temporal and spatial scales of response in which to mitigate future epidemic threats.","output":"Power-law distribution in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many governments in the world had imposed a national lockdown for restricting community mobility for slowing down the infection rate of the COVID-19 virus before the whole healthcare system becomes overwhelmed.

Through aqueous hydration of dry, uniform thin-films of amphiphilic polymer and PBF species deposited on Teflon, self-assembled polymersomes are readily generated incorporating the hydrophobic fluorophores in prescribed molar ratios within their membranes. The size-dependent spectral properties of the PBFs allow for ready optical verification ( steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopy) of the extent of vesicle membrane loading and enable delineation of intermembranous molecular interactions. The resultant effects of PBF membrane-loading on polymersome thermodynamic and mechanical stability are further assessed by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and micropipet aspiration, respectively. We demonstrate that polymersomes can be loaded at up to 10 mol/wt% concentrations, with hydrophobic molecules that possess sizes comparable to those of large pharmaceutical conjugates ( ranging 1.4-5.4 nm in length and = 0.7-5.4 kg mol), without significantly compromising the robust thermodynamic and mechanical stabilities of these synthetic vesicle assemblies. Due to membrane incorporation, hydrophobic encapsulants are effectively prevented from self-aggregation, able to be highly concentrated in aqueous solution, and successfully shielded from deleterious environmental interactions.

Mechanical stretches applied to regions of vastus medialis as close as 10 mm apart resulted in recruitment of motor units localized topographically with respect to the location of the mechanical stretch. Stretch reflexes are regionalized in the human vastus medialis. The human spinal cord has the neuromuscular circuitry to preferentially activate motoneurones innervating muscle fibres located in different regions of the vastus medialis. ABSTRACT The localization of motor unit territories provides an anatomical basis to suggest that the CNS may have more independence in motor unit recruitment and control strategies than what was previously thought. In this study, we investigated whether the human spinal cord has the neuromuscular circuitry to independently activate motor units located in different regions of the vastus medialis. Mechanical taps were applied to multiple locations in the vastus medialis (VM) in nine healthy individuals. Regional responses within the muscle were observed using a grid of 5  13 surface EMG electrodes. The EMG amplitude was quantified for each channel, and a cluster of channels showing the largest activation was identified. The spatial location of the EMG response was quantified as the position of the channels in the cluster. In a subset of three participants, intramuscular recordings were performed simultaneously with the surface EMG recordings. Mechanical taps resulted in localized, discrete responses for each participant. The spatial location of the elicited responses was dependent on the location of the tap (P < 0.001). Recordings with intramuscular electrodes confirmed the regional activation of the VM for different tap locations. Selective stimulation of 1a afferents localized in a region of the VM results in reflex recruitment of motor units in the same region. These findings suggest that the human spinal cord has the neuromuscular circuitry to modulate spatially the motoneuronal output to vastus medialis regions, which is a neuroanatomical prerequisite for regional activation.","output":"Regionalization of the stretch reflex in the human vastus medialis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

This includes being available at low temporal resolution (usually daily averages) and with a delay (usually 3C9 days from the measurement). Recent technological developments have made possible automatic pollen measurements, which are available at high temporal resolution and in real time, although currently only scattered in a few locations across Europe. MATERIALS & METHODS: To promote the development of an extensive network across Europe and to ensure that this network will respond to end user needs, a stakeholder workshop was organised under the auspices of the EUMETNET AutoPollen Programme. Participants discussed requirements for the groups they represented, ranging from the need for information at various spatial scales, at high temporal resolution, and for targeted services to be developed.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity of healing any divide between organized medicine and state and local health officials seems self-evident. Using the recommendations abstracted from a 2005 article by Dr. Ronald Davis, \\"Marriage Counseling for Medicine and Public Health,\\" this cross-sectional study explores the formal relationships that existed between state-level public health and medical practice across the U.S. at the end of 2019. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to every state's senior public health official and medical society executive (N=104) between August and December 2019 to examine the extent of these entities' partnerships. Analysis was completed in January 2020. RESULTS: Among the respondents, 40%-63.1% (n=65) currently engage in the recommended activities, with 1 exception: state health departments infrequently invite medical society executives to speak at major conferences or meetings (26.2%). The majority of respondents (71.1%-85.9%) judged that each recommended activity would improve the practices of medicine and public health. CONCLUSIONS: Survey results illustrate a desire for reconciliation, but poor implementation of recommended strategies aimed at building a healthy marriage between the 2 sectors.

Detection of negative-sense strand viral RNA and isolation of infectious virus derived from these convalescent mice by blinded passage in Vero cells confirmed long-term persistence of replicating ZIKV in CNS of convalescent mice. Although the infection appears to persist in defined reservoirs within CNS, the resulting inflammation could increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders.

An association with cerebrovascular diseases, especially cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), has been reported among these patients. The objective of the present study was to identify risk factors for CVT as well as its presentation and outcome in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a multicenter and multinational observational study. Ten centers in 4 countries (Pakistan, Egypt, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates) participated in this study. The study included patients (aged >18 years) with symptomatic CVT and recent COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Twenty patients (70% men) were included. Their mean age was 42.4 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. Headache (85%) and seizures (65%) were the common presenting symptoms, with a mean admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13. CVT was the presenting feature in 13 cases (65%), while 7 patients (35%) developed CVT while being treated for COVID-19 infection. Respiratory symptoms were absent in 45% of the patients. The most common imaging finding was infarction (65%), followed by hemorrhage (20%). The superior sagittal sinus (65%) was the most common site of thrombosis. Acute inflammatory markers were raised, including elevated serum D-dimer (87.5%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (69%), and C-reactive protein (47%) levels.

Social shaping of technology (SST) of household appliances provides a critical lens of understanding the involved socio-technical drivers behind these constraints. This study employs an SST lens to investigate appliance uptake drivers in 14,580 households in Rwanda, such that these drivers can aid in policy design for green growth at the grassroots level. The methodology includes an epistemological review of non-income drivers of appliance uptake. Empirical analysis using a binary logistic regression, based on which disruptive innovation pathways were derived for fostering green growth. Results showed that appliance uptake was highly gendered and skewed across the Ubudehe (social welfare) categories. ICT-devices like mobile phones and radios had a higher likelihood of ownership than welfare appliances like refrigerator and laundry machines. Fans and cookers also demonstrated a greater probability of ownership. Disruptive innovation pathways were derived from leveraging the ICT-driven wave of appliance ownership, creation of service sectors through off-grid renewable solutions and promoting cleaner fuel-switching of cooking energy at the household level. Further policy implications were drawn to support the creation of consumption identities for green growth.","output":"Disruptive innovation for inclusive renewable policy in sub-Saharan Africa: A social shaping of technology analysis of appliance uptake in Rwanda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Unrest in Myanmar in August 2017 resulted in the movement of over 700,000 Rohingya refugees to overcrowded camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. A large outbreak of diphtheria subsequently began in this population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were collected during mass vaccination campaigns (MVCs), contact tracing activities, and from 9 Diphtheria Treatment Centers (DTCs) operated by national and international organizations. These data were used to describe the epidemiological and clinical features and the control measures to prevent transmission, during the first 2 years of the outbreak. Between November 10, 2017 and November 9, 2019, 7,064 cases were reported: 285 (4.0%) laboratory-confirmed, 3,610 (51.1%) probable, and 3,169 (44.9%) suspected cases. The crude attack rate was 51.5 cases per 10,000 person-years, and epidemic doubling time was 4.4 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2-4.7) during the exponential growth phase. The median age was 10 years (range 0-85), and 3,126 (44.3%) were male. The typical symptoms were sore throat (93.5%), fever (86.0%), pseudomembrane (34.7%), and gross cervical lymphadenopathy (GCL; 30.6%). Diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) was administered to 1,062 (89.0%) out of 1,193 eligible patients, with adverse reactions following among 229 (21.6%). There were 45 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] 0.6%). Household contacts for 5,702 (80.7%) of 7,064 cases were successfully traced. A total of 41,452 contacts were identified, of whom 40,364 (97.4%) consented to begin chemoprophylaxis; adherence was 55.0% (N = 22,218) at 3-day follow-up. Unvaccinated household contacts were vaccinated with 3 doses (with 4-week interval), while a booster dose was administered if the primary vaccination schedule had been completed. The proportion of contacts vaccinated was 64.7% overall. Three MVC rounds were conducted, with administrative coverage varying between 88.5% and 110.4%. Pentavalent vaccine was administered to those aged 6 weeks to 6 years, while tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine was administered to those aged 7 years and older. Lack of adequate diagnostic capacity to confirm cases was the main limitation, with a majority of cases unconfirmed and the proportion of true diphtheria cases unknown. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest reported diphtheria outbreak in refugee settings. We observed that high population density, poor living conditions, and fast growth rate were associated with explosive expansion of the outbreak during the initial exponential growth phase. Three rounds of mass vaccinations targeting those aged 6 weeks to 14 years were associated with only modestly reduced transmission, and additional public health measures were necessary to end the outbreak. This outbreak has a long-lasting tail, with Rt oscillating at around 1 for an extended period. An adequate global DAT stockpile needs to be maintained. All populations must have access to health services and routine vaccination, and this access must be maintained during humanitarian crises.","output":"Epidemiological, clinical, and public health response characteristics of a large outbreak of diphtheria among the Rohingya population in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, 2017 to 2019: A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assessed the in vitro antiviral activity of remdesivir and its parent nucleoside GS-441524, molnupiravir and its parent nucleoside EIDD-1931 and the viral protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir against the ancestral SARS-CoV2 strain and the five variants of concern including Omicron.

However, when we analyse the microbial exposures of modern humans in the context of human evolution and history, it becomes evident that, whilst children need exposure to the microbiotas of mothers, other family members and the natural environment, exposure to the unnatural microbiota of the modern home is less relevant. In addition, any benefits of exposure to the infections of childhood within their household setting are at least partly replaced by the recently revealed non-specific effects of vaccines. This paper shows how targeting hygiene practices at key risk moments and sites can maximize protection against infection whilst minimizing any impact on essential microbial exposures. Moreover this targeting must aim to reduce direct exposure of children to cleaning agents since these probably exert Th2 adjuvant effects which trigger allergic responses to normally innocuous antigens. Finally, we need to halt the flow of publications in the scientific literature and the media that blame hygiene for the increases in immunoregulatory disorders.

Few individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) successfully meet adult normative expectations in education, employment, peer relations, and habitation, although there is within-syndrome variability in this regard. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether expressive language skills contribute to the capacity for independent functioning in adulthood even after controlling for nonverbal cognitive ability. Methods. Participants were 18- to 23-year-olds with FXS. Expressive language was assessed using the psychometrically validated Expressive Language Sampling (ELS) conversation and narration procedures. The language produced was transcribed and analyzed to yield measures of expressive vocabulary, syntax, and intelligibility. Parents concurrently completed questionnaires on the independent functioning of the participants with FXS. Results. All three ELS measures were significantly corelated with multiple measures of independence. The magnitudes of the correlations were reduced when nonverbal IQ was controlled through partial correlation. Nonetheless, many of the partial correlations were medium to large and several were statistically significant. Conclusions. Expressive language skills appear to contribute uniquely to the capacity for independence, although longitudinal data are needed to evaluate the possibility of a bidirectional relationship between these domains.

One method of ensuring standard patient care within these guidelines is through the implementation of telemedicine. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine for elective orthopaedic patients in the recovery and/or rehabilitation period. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of articles in Medline/PubMed and The Cochrane Library databases was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines for prospective randomised controlled trials to compare clinical and symptomatic measures for elective patients managed routinely with remote care compared to those managed with standard in-clinic management. To be included for meta-analysis, parameters must be evaluated in &#8805;3 studies. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the meta-analyses. Both telemedicine and control cohorts were comparable for patient satisfaction (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90-1.07; I2 = 0%; p = 0.52) and patient retention analysis (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.51-3.06; p = 0.54; I2 = 0%). Similarly, there was no statistical difference appreciated between cohorts for overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score (p = 0.30), Timed Up and Go Test (p = 0.40), and Stair Test (p = 0.18). Significant difference did exist for visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (p = 0.02) in favour of in-clinic management. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine will serve an integral aspect of healthcare delivery throughout the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond in an effort to deliver safe, efficient and time-sensitive care to the orthopaedic patient population. The results of our meta-analyses indicate that virtual consultations are as effective as traditional in-person consultations for the care of elective orthopaedic patients in the recovery and rehabilitation period.

METHODS A retrospective population-based cohort of 1702 obese T2DM patients who were free of CVD and ESKD were assembled based on the 2006-17 Hospital Authority database. One-to-five propensity-score matching was used to balance baseline covariates between patients in bariatric surgery and control groups. Incidence rates (IRs) of SH, CVD, Stage 4/5 chronic kidney diseases (CKD), ESKD and all-cause mortality events for two groups were calculated. Hazard ratios (HR) for SH, CVD and Stage 4/5 CKD events were assessed using Cox-proportional hazard models. Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured up to 60 months. RESULTS Over a mean follow-up period of 32 months with 5725 person-years, cumulative incidences of mortality, CVD, Stage 4/5 CKD, ESKD and SH were 0, 0.036, 0.050, 0.017 and 0.020, respectively. The surgery group had a significant reduction in risk of CVD events (HR = 0.464, P = 0.015) and no occurrence of mortality events.

Due to COVID-19, there are increased infection prevention (IP) measures in NICUs including universal masking for all healthcare workers and families, social distancing, visitation restrictions, and increased attention to hand hygiene. These measures may also affect late-onset infection rates and offer understanding of novel interventions for prevention. METHODS: We examined infection rates during the 24 months prior to implementation of COVID-19 IP measures (PRE-period) compared to the months after implementation from April 2020 (POST-period). Late-onset infections were defined as culture-confirmed infection of the blood, urine, or identification of respiratory viral pathogens. An interrupted time series analysis of infection per 1000 patient days was performed based on a change-point Poisson regression with a lagged dependent variable and the number of patient days used as offsets. Each month was treated as independent with additional analysis using an observation-driven model to account for serial dependence. RESULTS: Multicenter analysis to date included all infants cared for at three centers (Level 3 and 4) from 2018-2020. Monthly BSI rates decreased in the POST-period at the three centers (Figure 1). At all centers actual BSI rate was lower than the expected rate in the POST-period (Figure 2).

[Image: see text] At all centers actual BSI rate was lower than the expected rate for that center in the POST period. UVA and Duke showed a baseline decrease and Pennsylvania Hospital showed a downward trend in infection rates. There was an approximate decrease in expected bloodstream infection events at Pennsylvania Hospital by 7 events, at UVA by 22 events and at Duke by 23 events. Overall, all three centers saw a decrease in their expected infections after COVID-19 infection prevention measures were implemented. Table 1.

Additionally, there were fewer viral infections, though there were a limited number of episodes. Further analyses of multicenter data and a larger number of patients will elucidate the significance of these findings and the role some of these IP measures such as universal masking may have in infection prevention in the NICU.

Recent COVID-19 pandemic continues to impose significant health burden worldwide and individual pandemic waves often leads to a large surge in the ICU admissions for respiratory support. Comparisons of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with other seasonal and non-seasonal severe viral infections are rarely studied in an intensive care setting. Methods A retrospective cohort study comparing patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 between March-June 2020 and those with viral pneumonias between January-December 2019. We compared patient specific demographic variables, duration of illness, ICU organ supportive measures and outcomes between both groups. Results Analysis of 93 COVID-19 (group 1) and 52 other viral pneumonia patients (group 2) showed an increased proportion of obesity (42% vs 23%, p = 0.02), non-white ethnicities (41% vs 6%, p < 0.001) and diabetes mellitus (30% vs 13%, p = 0.03) in group 1, with lower prevalence of COPD/asthma (16% vs 34%, p = 0.02). In group 1, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was much lower (6.7 vs 10, p = 0.006) and invasive mechanical ventilation (58% vs 26%, p < 0.001) was more common. Length of ICU (8 vs 4, p < 0.001) and hospital stay (22 vs 11, p < 0.001) was prolonged in group 1, with no significant difference in mortality. Influenza A and rhinovirus were the most common pathogens in group 2 (26% each). Conclusions Key differences were identified within demographics (obesity, ethnicity, age, ICU scores, co-morbidities) and organ support. Despite these variations, there was no significant differences in mortality between both groups. Further studies with larger sample sizes would allow for further assessment of clinical parameters in these patients.","output":"Severe COVID-19 pneumonia in an intensive care setting and comparisons with historic severe viral pneumonia due to other viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type I interferons (IFN-I) protect us from viral infections. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) is a key component of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which drives gene expression in response to IFN-I. Using electron microscopy, we found that, in naive cells, U-STAT2, lacking the activating tyrosine phosphorylation, forms a heterodimer with U-STAT1 in an inactive, anti-parallel conformation. A novel phosphorylation of STAT2 on T404 promotes IFN-I signaling by disrupting the U-STAT1-U-STAT2 dimer, facilitating the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 2 and enhancing the DNA-binding ability of ISGF3. IKK-, activated by virus infection, phosphorylates T404 directly. Mice with a T-A mutation at the corresponding residue (T403) are highly susceptible to virus infections. We conclude that T404 phosphorylation drives a critical conformational switch that, by boosting the response to IFN-I in infected cells, enables a swift and efficient antiviral defense.","output":"A virus-induced conformational switch of STAT1-STAT2 dimers boosts antiviral defenses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]most of the focus has been on evaluating medical treatments for these patients in small series [2] CASE 1 The first patient was a 47-year man with a history of chronic kidney disease secondary to primary membranous nephropathy, recipient of a deceased-donor kidney transplant two months before the onset of symptoms, with serum creatinine of 1 71 mg/dL and an estimated filtration rate of 46 6 mL/min/1 73 m2 Blood work reported a white blood cell count of 7 1X103/pL with an absolute lymphocyte count of 0 8X10VpL, creatinine of 1 74 mg/dL, elevated C-reactive protein of 9 96 mg/dL (reference range: &lt;0 5 mg/dL), ferritin level of 588 ng/mL (&lt;274 ng/ mL), and LDH of 292 U/L (&lt;271 U/L) The diagnostic process of COVID-19 in transplant recipient patients can be confusing Because of the state of immunosuppression and the probability of unusual presentations, the clinician should guide the diagnosis in the detection of opportunistic, common or atypical infections as a differential diagnosis of COVID-19","output":"COVID-19 in Kidney Transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious and quickly spreading coronavirus infestation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which outbreak in 2002 and 2011, and the current COVID-19 pandemic are all from the same family of coronavirus. This work aims to classify COVID-19, SARS, and MERS chest X-ray (CXR) images using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To the best of our knowledge, this classification scheme has never been investigated in the literature. A unique database was created, so-called QU-COVID-family, consisting of 423 COVID-19, 144 MERS, and 134 SARS CXR images. Besides, a robust COVID-19 recognition system was proposed to identify lung regions using a CNN segmentation model (U-Net), and then classify the segmented lung images as COVID-19, MERS, or SARS using a pre-trained CNN classifier. Furthermore, the Score-CAM visualization method was utilized to visualize classification output and understand the reasoning behind the decision of deep CNNs. Several deep learning classifiers were trained and tested; four outperforming algorithms were reported: SqueezeNet, ResNet18, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201. Original and preprocessed images were used individually and all together as the input(s) to the networks. Two recognition schemes were considered: plain CXR classification and segmented CXR classification. For plain CXRs, it was observed that InceptionV3 outperforms other networks with a 3-channel scheme and achieves sensitivities of 99.5%, 93.1%, and 97% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. In contrast, for segmented CXRs, InceptionV3 outperformed using the original CXR dataset and achieved sensitivities of 96.94%, 79.68%, and 90.26% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. The classification performance degrades with segmented CXRs compared to plain CXRs. However, the results are more reliable as the network learns from the main region of interest, avoiding irrelevant non-lung areas (heart, bones, or text), which was confirmed by the Score-CAM visualization. All networks showed high COVID-19 detection sensitivity (> 96%) with the segmented lung images. This indicates the unique radiographic signature of COVID-19 cases in the eyes of AI, which is often a challenging task for medical doctors.","output":"Deep Learning for Reliable Classification of COVID-19, MERS, and SARS from Chest X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exaggerated oxidative stress and hyper-inflammation are essential features of oxidative/inflammatory diseases.

METHODS: Students at a K-8 school were tested weekly for SARS-CoV-2 from September 2020 - June 2021. Error rates were collected from September 2020 - January 2021. Clinical staff provided all students with instructions for anterior nares specimen self-collection and then observed them to ensure proper technique. Instructions included holding the sterile swab while making sure not to touch the tip, inserting the swab into their nostril until they start to feel resistance, and rubbing the swab in four circles before repeating the process in their other nostril. An independent observer timed random sample self-collections from April - June 2021. RESULTS: 2,590 samples were collected from 209 students during the study period when data on error rates were collected. Errors occurred in 3.3% of all student encounters (n=87). Error rates over time are shown in Figure 1, with the highest rate occurring on the first day of testing (n=20/197, 10.2%) and the lowest in January 2021 (n=1/202, 0.5%). 2,574 visits for sample self-collection occurred during the study period when independent timing data was collected (April - June 2021).

This study assessed dimensional EL in preschoolers and its link with ADHD symptoms (e.g. hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention) and behavioural and emotional problems (e.g. aggression and anxiety). METHOD: One hundred and fifty-four preschoolers aged 3-6 years old were rated on questionnaires by parents. EL was assessed with the index from the Conners Rating Scale-Revised and behavioural and emotional problems with an adapted version of the Social Behavior Questionnaire. Multiple linear regressions analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Higher EL was associated with higher hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention, anxiety and aggression problems. After controlling for other behavioural and emotional problems and sociodemographic variables, EL remained associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity and anxiety.

Albumin is able to bind to almost all known drugs, as well as many nutraceuticals and toxic substances, largely determining their pharmaco- and toxicokinetics. Albumin of humans and respective representatives in cattle and rodents have their own structural features that determine species differences in functional properties. However, albumin is not only passive, but also an active participant of pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic processes, possessing a number of enzymatic activities. Numerous experiments have shown esterase or pseudoesterase activity of albumin towards a number of endogeneous and exogeneous esters. Due to the free thiol group of Cys34, albumin can serve as a trap for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, thus participating in redox processes. Glycated albumin makes a significant contribution to the pathogenesis of diabetes and other diseases. The interaction of albumin with blood cells, blood vessels and tissue cells outside the vascular bed is of great importance.

Several COVID-19 guidelines included age as an explicit factor and practices of both triage and anticipatory triage likely limited access to hospital care for elderly patients, especially those in care homes. To ensure the legitimacy of triage guidelines, which affect the public, it is important to engage the publics moral intuitions. Our study aimed to explore general public views in the UK on the role of age, and related factors like frailty and quality of life, in triage during the COVID-19 pandemic. We held online deliberative workshops with members of the general public (n=22). Participants were guided through a deliberative process to maximise eliciting informed and considered preferences. Participants generally accepted the need for triage but strongly rejected fair innings and life projects principles as justifications for age-based allocation. They were also wary of the maximise life-years principle, preferring to maximise the number of lives rather than life years saved. Although they did not arrive at a unified recommendation of one principle, a concern for three core principles and values eventually emerged: equality, efficiency and vulnerability. While these remain difficult to fully respect at once, they captured a considered, multifaceted consensus: utilitarian considerations of efficiency should be tempered with a concern for equality and vulnerability.

We designed a continuous detection task for a target feature (e.g., a green color) among items of continuously and gradually changing features (e.g., other colors). In four experiments, we demonstrated target-rate effects in terms of slower hit response times (RTs) and higher miss rates when targets were rare. Similar to regular search, target-rate effects were also observed for relative frequencies across two target features.

Telehealth benefits include improving access, decreasing costs, and elevating patient's experience. A review of cost minimization (CM) analyses was performed in order to explore scientific studies associated with integrating tele-otolaryngology in clinical practice. Our primary objective was to evaluate published literature for cost related to the implementation of telemedicine across otolaryngology, and to determine CM when compared to in-person visits. STUDY DESIGN Systematic Literature Review. METHODS We performed a systematic review using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane in May 2020, to identify studies with a cost analysis of tele-otolaryngology care. Inclusion criteria focused on articles citing CM data from telehealth services. Literature quality was assessed using the MINORS scoring system. RESULTS From 380 original articles screened only nine evaluated cost in otolaryngology. CM in the US ranged from $68 to $900 per visit. Cost was evaluated in general otolaryngology, sleep medicine, otology, and head and neck cancer surgery, the latter had the most benefit. The most common types of telehealth visits were routine follow-up and screening. Data were insufficient for meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine has been trialed across various otolaryngology subspecialties; its incorporation is projected to have a meaningful impact on access to specialty care. This research suggests that the delivery of virtual care reduces cost with the potential of increasing net revenue across multiple otolaryngology subspecialties.

We previously generated human mAbs specific to the S1 region of SARS-CoV S protein. These mAbs bind epitopes within the receptor binding domain (RBD) or upstream of the RBD. We show that mAbs recognizing epitopes within the RBD inhibit infection by preventing viral attachment to the cellular receptor. One mAb binds upstream of the RBD and prevents viral entry by inhibiting a post-binding event. Evaluation of several mAbs demonstrated varying ability of the mAbs to select escape mutants when used individually. However, a mixture of antibodies could effectively neutralize a range of mutant viruses. These data strongly suggest that a mixture containing antibodies recognizing distinct regions and targeting more than one step in viral entry is likely to be more effective in neutralizing the virus and suppressing the generation of escape mutants, and thus potentially constitute a highly effective passive immunotherapy.","output":"Human monoclonal antibodies to SARS-coronavirus inhibit infection by different mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last few months, the spread of COVID-19 among humans has caused serious damages around the globe letting many countries economically unstable. Results obtained from conducted research by epidemiologists and virologists showed that, COVID-19 is mainly spread from symptomatic individuals to others who are in close contact via respiratory droplets, mouth and nose, which are the primary mode of transmission. World health organization regulations to help stop the spread of this deadly virus, indicated that, it is compulsory to utilize respiratory protective devices such as facemasks in the public. Indeed, the use of these facemasks around the globe has helped reduce the spread of COVID-19. The primary aim of facemasks, is to avoid inhaling air that could contain droplets with COVID-19. We should note that, respiration process is the movement of oxygen from external atmosphere to the cells within tissue and the transport of carbon dioxide outside. However, the rebreathing of carbon dioxide using a facemask has not been taken into consideration. The hypercapnia (excess inhaled content of CO(2)) has been recognized to be related to symptoms of fatigue, discomfort, muscular weakness, headaches as well as drowsiness. Rebreathing of CO(2) has been a key to concern regarding the use of a facemask. Rebreathing usually occur when an expired air that is rich in CO(2) stays long than normal in the breathing space of the respirator after a breath. The increase of the arterial CO(2) concentration leads to symptoms that are aforementioned. Studies have been conducted on facemask shortages and on the appropriate facemask required to reduce the spread of COVID-19; however no study has been conducted to assess the possible relationship between CO(2) inhalation due to facemask, to determine and recommend which mask is appropriate in the reduction of the spread of the coronavirus while simultaneously avoid CO(2) inhalation by the facemask users. In the current paper, we provided a literature review on the use of facemasks with the aim to determine which facemasks could be used to avoid re-inhaling rejected CO(2). Additionally, we presented mathematical models depicting the transport of COVID-19 spread through wind with high speed. We considered first mathematical models for which the effect air-heterogeneity is neglected, such that air flow follows Markovian process with a retardation factor, these models considered two different scenarios, the speed of wind is constant and time-space dependent. Secondly, we assumed that the wind movement could follow different processes, including the power law process, fading memory process and a two-stage processes, these lead us to use differential operators with power law, exponential decay and the generalized Mittag-Leffler function with the aim to capture these processes. A numerical technique based on the Lagrange polynomial interpolation was used to solve some of these models numerically. The numerical solutions were coded in MATLAB software for simulations. The results obtained from the mathematical simulation showed that a wind with speed of 100km/h could transport droplets as far as 300 meters. The results obtained from these simulations together with those presented by other researchers lead us to conclude that, the wind could have helped spread COVID-19 in some places around the world, especially in coastal areas. Therefore, appropriate facemasks that could help avoid re-inhaling enough CO(2) should be used every time one is in open air even when alone especially in windy environment.","output":"Facemasks simple but powerful weapons to protect against COVID-19 spread: Can they have sides effects?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently the whole world is affected by the COVID-19 disease. Italy was the first country to be seriously affected in Europe, where the first COVID-19 outbreak was localized in the Lombardy region. The further spreading of the cases led to the lockdown of the most affected regions in northern Italy and then the entire country. In this work we investigated an epidemic spread scenario in the Lombardy region by using the originCdestination matrix with information about the commuting flows among 1450 urban areas within the region. We performed a large-scale simulation-based modeling of the epidemic spread over the networks related to three main motivations, i.e., work, study and occasional transfers to quantify the potential contribution of each category of travellers to the spread of the epidemic process. Our findings outline that the three networks are characterised by different weight dynamic growth rates and that the network work has a critical role in the diffusion phenomenon showing the greatest contribution to the epidemic spread.","output":"Complex Network Modelling of OriginCDestination Commuting Flows for the COVID-19 Epidemic Spread Analysis in Italian Lombardy Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several neurologic complications have been reported in close temporal association with both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, several cases of Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) have been reported in temporal relationship with COVID-19 vaccination, with two small case series describing a specific phenotype with bifacial weakness and paresthesia in the limbs. METHODS: We retrospectively collected patients who developed a new-onset neuromuscular disorder in the first 6 weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine (either first or second dose). The patients were collected from one tertiary care centre and one secondary care centre from February to July 2021. RESULTS: We report eight patients who developed phenotypically diverse neuromuscular disorders in the weeks following COVID-19 vaccination, with a presumed immune-mediated etiology. In our case series, we report three patients with classical GBS, one patient with bifacial weakness with paresthesia variant of GBS, two patients with subacute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), one patient with brachial plexopathy and one patient with subacute axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: New-onset neuromuscular disorders with onset in the weeks after COVID-19 vaccination can include diverse phenotypes. A causal relationship between these disorders and the vaccine cannot be proven at present, and further epidemiological studies are needed to further investigate this association.","output":"Neuromuscular complications after COVID-19 vaccination: a series of eight patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, New York City quickly became the epicenter with hospitals at full capacity needing to care for patients. At New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, we needed to develop an innovative system of how to safely discharge the massive influx of patients. Inundation of patient care with limited manpower and resources forced us to align with a third-party vendor, around-the-clock alert, to make remote patient monitoring (RPM) possible. Each patient was prescribed a pulse oximeter and nurses were assigned to monitor vital signs, speak to patients, and escalate to physicians if required. Results: We enrolled 50 patients, of whom 13 were escalated resulting in 3 emergency room visits and 1 readmission. We had a high compliance rate with high patient satisfaction in postsurveys. Discussion: Our program was unique in that it utilized telemedicine for regular patient follow-up, along with RPM through a third-party vendor. Patients were able to be safely discharged home with close follow-up through regularly obtained vitals with access to a 24/7 hotline for any emergencies, possibly preventing readmissions. Limitations include a small sample size population. Conclusions: Our experience shows that in a short period despite lack of resources, telehealth and RPM's concurrent use with a third-party vendor could be successfully utilized for safe discharges with high patient satisfaction.","output":"Reengineering the Discharge Transition Process of COVID-19 Patients Using Telemedicine, Remote Patient Monitoring, and Around-the-Clock Remote Patient Monitoring from the Emergency Department and Inpatient Units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital and healthcare facilities have diverse indoor environment due to the different comfort and health needs of its occupants.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective observational study of consecutive patients who came to the emergency department in March and April 2020 and were discharged alive with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Baseline and acute episode data were collected and the patients were followed for 1 year. We analyzed variables associated with revisits for any reason, revisits related to COVID-19, and early COVID-19-related revisits (within 30 days). RESULTS A total of 1352 patients with a mean age of 62.1 years (52.9% male) were studied. A total of 553 revisits were made by 342 patients (25.3%) for any reason; 132 (9.8%) revisited in relation to COVID-19 at least once. Of those, 103 (7.6%) revisited within 30 days (early) and 29 (2.2%) came later. COVID-19-related revisits were associated with thrombotic events (odds ratio [OR], 7.58; 95% CI, 1.75-32.81) and pulmonary fibrosis (OR, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.27-19.24); early revisits were inversely associated with follow-up management by a contracted health care support service (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.03-0.92). Hospital admission during the initial visit was significantly associated with fewer revisits for any reason or related to COVID-19 at any time. CONCLUSION Fewer than half the total number of emergency department revisits after initial care for COVID-19 were related to the novel coronavirus infection. Revisits occurred more often in the first 30 days after discharge. Later COVID-19-related revisits were uncommon, but given the large number of patients with this infection, such visits can be expected.","output":"Predictors of revisits within 1 year by patients after acute COVID-19: the HUBCOVID365 cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic threatening global public health.

The latest scientific reports inform that this virus leaves a long-term trace in the nervous, circulatory, respiratory, urinary and reproductive systems. It manifests itself in disturbances in the functioning of the organs of these systems, causing serious health problems. The aim of the study was to review the latest research into the long-term effects of COVID-19 and determine how common these symptoms are and who is most at risk. Based on a literature review using the electronic scientific databases of PubMed and Web of Science on the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 88 studies were included in the analysis. The information contained in the analyzed literature shows that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause multi-organ damage, causing a number of long-term negative health complications. Conclusions: There is evidence that the virus can cause long-term complications lasting more than six months.

In routine circumstances, ICU triage is premised on the best interests of an individual patient; however, when increased demand exceeds capacity, as during an infectious disease outbreak, healthcare providers need to make difficult decisions to benefit the broader community while still respecting individual interests. We are currently living through an unprecedented period, with South Africa (SA) facing the challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa (CCSSA) expedited the development of a triage guidance document to inform the appropriate and fair use of scarce ICU resources during this pandemic. Triage decision-making is based on the clinical odds of a positive ICU outcome, balanced against the risk of mortality and longer-term morbidity affecting quality of life. Factors such as age and comorbid conditions are considered for their potential impact on clinical outcome, but are never the sole criteria for denying ICU-level care. Arbitrary, unfair discrimination is never condoned. The CCSSA COVID-19 triage guideline is aligned with SA law and international ethical standards, and upholds respect for all persons. The Bill of Rights, however, does not mandate the level of care enshrined in the constitutional right to healthcare. ICU admission is not always appropriate, available or feasible for every person suffering critical illness or injury; however, everyone has the right to receive appropriate healthcare at another level. If ICU resources are used for people who do not stand to benefit, this effectively denies others access to potentially life-saving healthcare.

Literature has increasingly highlighted PTSD as a major issue that involves both staff and healthcare organizations; the consequences of PTSD may include medication errors and lower standards of care. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses the need for preventing PTSD in HCWs working closely with COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the latest developments in assessing and managing the occupational risk of PTSD symptoms in hospital HCWs. METHODS: We searched for publications in MEDLINE/Pubmed using selected keywords. Each article was reviewed and categorized into one or more of the following four categories based on its subject matter: risk assessment, risk management and occurrence rates. RESULTS: Our search resulted in a total of 32 publications that matched our inclusion criteria. Increased years of service, older age, previous year exposure to violence, personality traits (i.e. neuroticism), history of mental disorders, being non-graduates, were found to be workers' pre-trauma factors predicting PTSD symptoms.

Online sales features, referred to as online product reviews (OPRs), allow customers to leave comments or evaluations. OPRs are one of the sources of product feature information, and are a means of increasing valued for online consumers that some companies are currently underutilizing. In order to develop Muslim fashion designs, this project performed OPRs. The purpose of this study is to show the benefits of OPRs in the development of new Muslim fashion products in Indonesia in order to assist businesses in surviving in the new normal era. The first phase of OPR data collection at Shopee was carried out in five steps. OPR data were collected in Shopee using NVivos N-Capture QSR. The data obtained from phase one were needed in order to equalize perceptions and make corrections using the member check obtained data OPR method using Focus Group Discussion (FGD). The second phase consisted of eight steps. This phase sharpened the results of phase one using expert judgement word frequency analysis in NIVO. The third and final phase analysed the fashion industrys new normal innovation approach. This research shows the usefulness of OPR data for the evolution of fashion design in Indonesia, among other findings. According to this study, companiesexpertise, experience, and design innovation are essential variables in a changing/disruptive marketplace. Ongoing research suggests utilizing OPRs to generate new design trends, high-quality products, and innovative tactics in order to sustain Muslim fashion business.","output":"Implementing Online Product Reviews and Muslim Fashion Innovation for Resilience during the New Normal in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of long COVID symptoms in a large cohort of people living with and affected by long COVID and identify any potential associated risk factors. METHODS: A prospective survey was undertaken of an inception cohort of confirmed people living with and affected by long COVID (aged 18C87 years). 14392 participants were recruited from 24 testing facilities across Bangladesh between June and November 2020. All participants had a previously confirmed positive COVID-19 diagnosis, and reported persistent symptoms and difficulties in performing daily activities. Participants who consented were contacted by face-to-face interview, and were interviewed regarding long COVID, and restriction of activities of daily living using post COVID-19 functional status scale. Cardiorespiratory parameters measured at rest (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation levels, maximal oxygen consumption, inspiratory and expiratory lung volume) were also measured. RESULTS: Among 2198 participants, the prevalence of long COVID symptoms at 12 weeks was 16.1%. Overall, eight long COVID symptoms were identified and in descending order of prominence are: fatigue, pain, dyspnoea, cough, anosmia, appetite loss, headache and chest pain. People living with and affected by long COVID experienced between 1 and 8 long COVID symptoms with an overall duration period of 21.85.2 weeks. Structural equation modelling predicted the length of long COVID to be related to younger age, female gender, rural residence, prior functional limitation and smoking. CONCLUSION: In this cohort, at 31 weeks post diagnosis, the prevalence of long COVID symptoms was 16.1%. The risk factors identified for presence and longer length of long COVID symptoms warrant further research and consideration to support public health initiatives.","output":"Prevalence of Long COVID symptoms in Bangladesh: a prospective Inception Cohort Study of COVID-19 survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We aimed to compare the effectiveness of Levetiracetam and Piracetam on the severity and frequency of spells in children with severe breath-holding spells (BHS), i.e. bening, paroxysmal, and nonepileptic events that are common in early childhood. Materials and Methods: This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial in 71 children from 6 months to 6 years of age with BHS. They were randomly assigned to the two study groups (Levetiracetam and Piracetam group). The frequency and severity of BHS and the response to treatment were recorded on monthly visits during our 3 months follow-up. Results: There was a significant decline in the average number of frequency of spells before and after 3 months of treatment in each group in this study. Levetiracetam had significant effects on the average incidence of the loss of consciousness and seizure-like movements in our study, while Piracetam had no significant effect on the loss of consciousness. Our result showed better response in the Levetiracetam group (88.9% partial or complete response after treatment) compared with the Piracetam group (77.1% partial or complete response after treatment); however, it was not significant. It seems that Levetiracetam had better effect than Piracetam in some aspects in the treatment of BHS.

Methods Datasets for the PD (GSE106090, GSE10334, GSE16134) and RA (GSE55235, GSE55457, GSE77298, and GSE1919) were downloaded from the GEO database. After batch correction and normalization of datasets, differential expression analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The cross-talk genes linking PD and RA were obtained by overlapping the DEGs dysregulated in PD and DEGs dysregulated in RA. Genes involved in pyroptosis were summarized by reviewing literatures, and the correlation between pyroptosis genes and cross-talk genes was investigated by Pearson correlation coefficient. Furthermore, the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was carried out to identify the significant modules which contained both cross-talk genes and pyroptosis genes in both PD data and RA data. Thus, the core cross-talk genes were identified from the significant modules. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to identify the predictive accuracy of these core cross-talk genes in diagnosing PD and RA. Based on the core cross-talk genes, the experimentally validated protein-protein interaction (PPI) and gene-pathway network were constructed. Results A total of 40 cross-talk genes were obtained. Most of the pyroptosis genes were not differentially expressed in disease and normal samples. By selecting the modules containing both cross-talk genes or pyroptosis genes, the blue module was identified to be significant module. Three genes, i.e., cross-talk genes (TIMP1, LGALS1) and pyroptosis gene-GPX4, existed in the blue module of PD network, while two genes (i.e., cross-talk gene-VOPP1 and pyroptosis gene-AIM2) existed in the blue module of RA network. ROC curve analysis showed that three genes (TIMP1, VOPP1, and AIM2) had better predictive accuracy in diagnosing disease compared with the other two genes (LGALS1 and GPX4). Conclusions This study revealed shared mechanisms between RA and PD based on cross-talk and pyroptosis genes, supporting the relationship between the two diseases. Thereby, five modular genes (TIMP1, LGALS1, GPX4, VOPP1, and AIM2) could be of relevance and might serve as potential biomarkers.

Especially the low Earth orbit (LEO) shows higher risks of collisions due to the highest density of orbital debris. Laser ranging stations can deliver highly accurate distance measurements of debris objects allowing precise orbit determination and more effective collision avoidance. However, a laser ranging station needs accurate a priori orbit information to track an orbital object. To detect and track unknown orbital objects in LEO, here, a passive optical staring system is developed for autonomous 24/7 operation. The system is weather-sealed and does not require any service to perform observations. To detect objects, a wide-angle imaging system with 10 field of view equipped with an astronomical CCD camera was designed and set up to continuously observe the sky for LEO objects. The system can monitor and process several passing objects simultaneously without limitations. It automatically starts an observation, processes the images and saves the 2D angular measurements of each object as equatorial coordinates in the TDM standard. This allows subsequent initial orbit determination and handover to a laser tracking system. During campaigns at twilight the system detected up to 36 objects per hour, with high detection efficiencies of LEO objects larger than 1 m(3). It is shown that objects as small as 0.1 m(3) can be detected and that the estimated precision of the measurements is about 0.05 or 7  the pixel scale.","output":"APPARILLO: a fully operational and autonomous staring system for LEO debris detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has caused a pandemic with more than 600,000 deaths to date.

However, available medicines can delay its progress. Therefore, the early detection of AD plays a crucial role in preventing and controlling its progression. The main objective is to design an end-to-end framework for early detection of Alzheimers disease and medical image classification for various AD stages. A deep learning approach, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), is used in this work. Four stages of the AD spectrum are multi-classified. Furthermore, separate binary medical image classifications are implemented between each two-pair class of AD stages. Two methods are used to classify the medical images and detect AD. The first method uses simple CNN architectures that deal with 2D and 3D structural brain scans from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset based on 2D and 3D convolution. The second method applies the transfer learning principle to take advantage of the pre-trained models for medical image classifications, such as the VGG19 model. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for people to go to hospitals periodically to avoid gatherings and infections. As a result, Alzheimers checking web application is proposed using the final qualified proposed architectures. It helps doctors and patients to check AD remotely. It also determines the AD stage of the patient based on the AD spectrum and advises the patient according to its AD stage. Nine performance metrics are used in the evaluation and the comparison between the two methods. The experimental results prove that the CNN architectures for the first method have the following characteristics: suitable simple structures that reduce computational complexity, memory requirements, overfitting, and provide manageable time. Besides, they achieve very promising accuracies, 93.61% and 95.17% for 2D and 3D multi-class AD stage classifications. The VGG19 pre-trained model is fine-tuned and achieved an accuracy of 97% for multi-class AD stage classifications.","output":"Deep Learning Approach for Early Detection of Alzheimers Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the current COVID-19 disease emergency, it is not only an ethical imperative but also a public health responsibility to keep the network of community psychiatry services operational, particularly for the most vulnerable subjects (those with mental illness, disability, and chronic conditions).

DESIGN: Modified Delphi using three rounds of survey questionnaires and one consensus workshop. SETTING: Uganda for face-to-face consensus activities, global for online survey questionnaires. PARTICIPANTS: A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened at a consensus-development conference in Uganda and included 21 researchers with experience leading challenge contests, five public health sector workers, and nine Ugandan end users. An online survey was sent to 140 corresponding authors of previously published articles that had used crowdsourcing methods. RESULTS: A subgroup of expert panel members developed the initial statement and survey. We received responses from 120 (85.7%) survey participants, which were presented at an in-person workshop of all 21 panel members. Panelists discussed each of the sections, revised the statement, and participated in a second round of the survey questionnaire. Based on this second survey round, we held detailed discussions of each subsection with workshop participants and further revised the consensus statement. We then conducted the third round of the questionnaire among the 21 expert panelists and used the results to finalize the statement.

METHODS An analysis of imaging and clinical data was performed on 2 cohorts of patients (one screened with CT, the other with MRI) who underwent successful treatment for large vessel, anterior circulation stroke. Subjects were divided 2:1 into derivation and validation cohorts. Pretreatment imaging parameters independently predicting final tissue infarct and final clinical outcome were identified. RESULTS The MRI and CT models were developed and validated from 34 and 32 patients, using 943 320 and 1 236 917 voxels, respectively.

Methods In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low. Interpretation COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly. The sizes of outbreak in provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low.

A standard profile of selected genes named ReprogVirus was proposed for in vitro-scanning of early virus-induced reprogramming in critical primary infected cells/tissues as target trait. For data collection, the ReprogVirus platform was initiated. This initiative aims to identify in a common effort across scientific boundaries critical virus footprints from diverse virus origins and variants as a basis for anti-viral strategy design. This approach is open for validation and extension. In the present study, we initiated validation by experimental transcriptome data available in public domain combined with advancing plant wet lab research. We compared plant-adapted transcriptomes according to RegroVirus complemented by alternative oxidase (AOX) genes during de novo programming under SE-inducing conditions with in vitro corona virus-induced transcriptome profiles. This approach enabled identifying a major complex trait for early de novo programming during SARS-CoV-2 infection, called CoV-MAC-TED. It consists of unbalanced ROS/RNS levels, which are connected to increased aerobic fermentation that links to alpha-tubulin-based cell restructuration and progression of cell cycle.

Ageing tends to be considered by institutions as a set of risks to be managed for older persons, illustrated in particular via the concepts of ageing well or successful ageing. In this context, this project aims to define the meaning and the conditions for a good life from the point of view of older persons themselves, thereby improving institutions recognition and support of older persons ways of living well, rather than imposing a general definition of successful ageing based on functional capacity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This qualitative study is designed as an action research underpinned by a Living-Lab approach to co-creation. The aims are to: define the conditions for a good life as accurately as possible with older persons (Step 1); share these findings with different healthcare and service providers to adjust existing services or create new ones (Step 2); and disseminate them more broadly within the regions under study and across the scientific community (Step 3). During Step 1, the features of a good life will be analysed in a socio-anthropological study based on semi-directed interviews and observations made in the homes of 70 elderly people living in a wide range of accommodation types and regions. In accordance with French legislation, and as confirmed by our formal Ethics Committee, this study does not require approval. The dissemination stage is integrated into the design of this action research, and notably will provide for the appropriation of research findings by the partners of this study, by setting up creativity sessions (Step 2) and by sharing the general findings through panel discussions bringing together regional and national stakeholders (Step 3).","output":"What is a Good Life: Protocol for a qualitative study to explore the viewpoint of older persons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals on immunosuppressive (IS) therapy have increased mortality from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and delayed viral clearance may lead to new viral variants.

METHODS: Ecological study conducted from 01/01 to 06/30 of 2019 and 2020. Population and mortality data were obtained from DATASUS. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) by age was calculated by comparing the standardized mortality rate in 2020 to that of 2019, for overall and specific mortality. The ratio between the standardized mortality rate due to COVID-19 in men as compared to women was calculated for 2020. Crude mortality rates were standardized using the direct method. RESULTS: COVID-19 was responsible for 94.4% of the excess deaths in S?o Paulo. In 2020 there was an increase in overall mortality observed among both men (SMR 1.3, 95% CI 1.17-1.42) and women (SMR 1.2, 95% CI 1.06-1.36) as well as a towards reduced mortality for all cancers. Mortality due to COVID-19 was twice as high for men as for women (SMR 2.1, 95% CI 1.67-2.59).

It also notes his/her body temperature using a non-contact infrared temperature sensor. The proposed solution is mitigating the problem where people casually avoid wearing a mask on their face by detecting face mask and measuring body temperature which should fall in the normal human body temperature range simultaneously. Various examples have been used to train the model to make it robust. The dataset consisted of 1509 images in which 755 images were with mask and 754 images were without mask.

We try to explore the evolution process of lung images in time dimension to improve the prediction of lung cancer survival by using longitudinal CT images and clinical data jointly. METHODS: In this paper, we propose an innovative multi-branch spatiotemporal residual network (MS-ResNet) for disease-specific survival (DSS) prediction by integrating the longitudinal computed tomography (CT) images at different times and clinical data. Specifically, we first extract the deep features from the multi-period CT images by an improved residual network. Then, the feature selection algorithm is used to select the most relevant feature subset from the clinical data. Finally, we integrate the deep features and feature subsets to take full advantage of the complementarity between the two types of data to generate the final prediction results. RESULTS: The experimental results demonstrate that our MS-ResNet model is superior to other methods, achieving a promising 86.78% accuracy in the classification of short-survivor, med-survivor, and long-survivor.

Phototherapy kills cancer cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and local hyperthermia under light. It has attracted extensive interest in the clinical treatment of tumors because of many advantages such as non-invasiveness, high patient compliance, and low toxicity and side effects. However, the short ROS diffusion distance and limited thermal diffusion rate make it difficult for phototherapy to damage DNA deep in the nucleus. Therefore, nucleus-targeting phototherapy that can destroy DNAs via in-situ generation of ROS and high temperature can be a very effective strategy to address this bottleneck. Recently, some emerging nucleus-targeting phototherapy nanodrugs have demonstrated extremely effective anticancer effects. However, reviews in the field are still rarely reported. Here, we comprehensively summarized recent advances in nucleus-targeting phototherapy in recent years. We classified nucleus-targeting phototherapy into three categories based on the characteristics of these nucleus-targeting strategies. The first category is the passive targeting strategy, which mainly targets the nucleus by adjusting the physicochemical characteristics of phototherapy nanomedicines. The second category is to mediate the phototherapy nanodrugs into the nucleus by modifying functional groups that actively target the nucleus. The third category is to assist nanodrugs enter into the nucleus in a light-controlled way. Finally, we provided our insights and prospects for nucleus-targeting phototherapy nanodrugs.

These mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal the patterns of transmission and have utility in contact tracing. METHODS: Leveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, detect quasispecies variants, and identify mutation signatures from patients. These results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints. RESULTS: We built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and a combination of mutations that appear in only a small number of patients. We developed a targeted sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of 100 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing analysis with the features of the pangenome. CONCLUSIONS: We conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies mutations occurring within individual patients and determined their general prevalence when compared to over 70,000 other strains.

However, postoperative complications include false aneurysms of the splenic artery, splenic vein stenosis and thrombosis, pancreatic fistulas, abscess, and perigastric varices. METHODS Eight patients (three men, five women, average age 66.1 years) with benign tumors underwent lap-SVPDP. Lap-SVPDP was performed in the lithotomy position with the head slightly elevated. The splenic vein was peeled longitudinally toward the pancreatic tail. A vessel-sealing system was used to detach the pancreatic body from the greater omentum, and the pancreas was transected using a surgical stapler. RESULTS Mean operation time was 254 min; mean blood loss was 163 ml; and mean post-surgical hospitalization time was 13 days. No postoperative bleeding from the preserved splenic vessels occurred, and there were no splenic infarcts or splenic abscesses. CONCLUSIONS For safe performance of lap-SVPDP, the posterior surface of the pancreas should be completely exposed. The splenic vein should be 'peeled away', starting from its central rear, enabling easy detection of its course to avoid inadvertent sealing.

Because older persons with multiple chronic conditions have a high risk of a severe medical outcome, it has been strongly recommended that social contacts be curtailed in order to minimize risks of infection. While this appears to be alarming from a psychosocial point of view, it has been shown that older persons exhibit a high degree of equanimity and a good ability to cope with the crisis. The aim of the study was to describe the attitudes of multimorbid older people to the pandemic, their social contacts and their experiences with medical care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional qualitative survey was based on 21 semi-structured short interviews of older patients with multiple chronic conditions during inpatient health care, at 4 different points in time: July 2020, September 2020, November 2020 and January 2021. The data were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The statements of 21 participants (aged 58C88 years) were assessed. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic it became apparent that participants experienced the pandemic differently, both from an individual perspective and over time. While high infection rates were accompanied by serious concerns about health, periods of moderate infection risk were dominated by worry about social changes. In older persons there was a great sense of acceptance of the preventive measures.

Contrary to the previous studies, this paper aims to propose a comprehensive decision-support system that includes identifying stressors, assessing organizational stress levels, and providing solutions to improve the performance of the organization. A questionnaire is designed and distributed among 170 senior managers of a major project-based organization in the field of the energy industry in Iran to determine organizational stressors.

Some main advantages of the proposed hybrid decision-support model include (i) achieving high-reliable results by not-so-time-consuming computational volume and (ii) maintaining flexibility in adding new criteria to assess the occupational stress levels in PBOs. Based on the obtained results, six organizational stressors, including job incongruity, poor organizational structure, poor project environment, work overload, poor job promotion, and type A behavior, are identified.

To meet the rising service demands, more trainees and established consultants need to learn the technique. We sought to establish whether it is feasible and safe to train on a large proportion of patients without adversely affecting clinical outcome or smooth running of clinical service. METHODS Between September 2006 and July 2008, four senior trainees of the Wessex Specialist Registrar training rotation were involved in training in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Major colorectal resections were separated into clearly defined modules for training purposes. Right and left hemicolectomies each comprised two modules, and low anterior resection comprised three modules. Prospective data on consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery were collected. Data included type of surgery, module of procedure performed by trainee or trainer, body mass index (BMI), conversion rates, median operative time, complications, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS During the study period 227 colorectal resections were attempted laparoscopically. Of these, 216 (96%) proved suitable for training and 97% were completed laparoscopically. Some 23% of patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists score (ASA)3; 35% had a BMI28; 38% had a history of previous laparotomy. Trainees performed 96% (142/148) of right hemicolectomy modules, 99% (154/156) of left hemicolectomy modules, and 67% (128/192) of rectal resection modules. Each trainee was competent to do right and left hemicolectomy at the end of the training period. Four patients (2%) required further surgery for postoperative complications. Of the procedures completed by the trainees, 155/171 (91%) cancer resections were potentially surgically curative, and R0 resections were achieved in 99%. The readmission rate was 10% (22/216) and median length of hospital stay was 4 days. Postoperative mortality was zero.

Immobilized antibodies are often incorporated as an essential biorecognition element in point-of-care biosensors but these proteins are costly. We present a strategy of combining convenient and low-cost surface functionalization approaches for increasing the overall binding activity of antibody functionalized natural and synthetic fibers. We demonstrate a simple one-step in situ silica NP growth protocol for increasing the surface area available for functionalization on cotton and polyester fabrics as well as on nanoporous cellulose substrates. Comparing this effect with the widely adopted and low cost plant-based polyphenol coating to enhance antibody immobilization, we find that both approaches can similarly increase overall surface activity, and we illustrate conditions under which the two approaches can produce an additive effect. Furthermore, we introduce co-immobilization of antibodies with a sacrificial steric helper protein for further enhancing surface activities. In combination, several hundred percent higher activities compared to physical adsorption can be achieved while maintaining a low amount of antibodies used, thus paving a practical path towards low cost biosensing.","output":"Binding enhancements of antibody functionalized natural and synthetic fibers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We aimed to evaluate the risk factors for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related severe outcome (in-hospital death) among the hospitalized patients in New York State (NYS) and proposed a method that could be used to inform future work to develop clinical algorithms and predict resource needs for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: We analyzed covid-19 related hospitalization in NYS from April 1st to November 17th, 2020, using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) discharge dataset. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the risk factors for COVID-19 related in-hospital death using demographic variables, symptom, rapid clinical examination, and medical history of chronic co-morbid conditions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated, and cut-off points for predictors were selected to stage the risk of COVID-19 related fatal outcome. Results: Logistic regression analysis showed age was the greatest risk factor for COVID-19 related fatal outcome among the hospitalized patients, which by itself achieved the diagnostic accuracy of 0.78 represented by the area under the ROC curve. By adding other demographic variables, dyspnea or hypoxemia and multiple chronic co-morbid conditions, the diagnostic accuracy was improved to 0.85. We selected cut-off points for predictors and provided a general recommendation to categorize the levels of risk for COVID-19 related fatal outcome. Conclusions: We assessed risk factors associated with in-hospital COVID-19 mortality and identified cut-off points that might be used to categorize the level of risk.

There is already wide knowledge about the relationship between stress, burnout and employee personal resources, which has practical application in preventing mental health. However, more research into the subtle relationships between variables is needed. The aim of the study was to check the moderation effect of differences in the intensity of latent variables on the relationship between perceived stress, self-efficacy and professional burnout. The participants were 546 call-takers and dispatchers from 14 public-safety answering point in Poland aged between 19 and 65 years. The Link Burnout Questionnaire, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, and an independent questionnaire were used to gather information. The method of path analysis was used. The study confirmed the existence of negative relationships between perceived stress (assessment of the current situation) and self-efficacy (a personal trait). Taking into account the moderating effect of latent variable: psychological comfort revealed a hidden relationship between stress and burnout. The stress-burnout relationship occurred only among participants with low level of psychological comfort, so it was not a proportional relationship. In the case of participants with a high level of second latent variable: power-to-affect, the hypothesis that a high level of this variable should weaken the relationship between stress and burnout was not confirmed. The level of latent variables did not affect the self-efficacy relationship with occupational burnout. Taking into account the differences in the intensity of latent variables showed their moderating effect, which often turned out to be different from the assumed one and obtained in the research of other authors. This allowed to discover the relationships that might otherwise have been overlooked and not included in burnout prevention. The results showed a high level of occupational burnout in the ECDs group during the COVID-19 pandemic: 32% of the responders reported emotional exhaustion, 53% loss of professional effectiveness.","output":"Polish Emergency Dispatchers During a COVID-19 Pandemic C Burnout Syndrome, Perceived Stress, and Self-Efficacy.

It is important to understand the role heterologous boost would have in patients who did not respond to the recommended two-dose mRNA vaccine series with a SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response. Objective: To characterize the immune response of two CLL patients who failed to seroconvert after initial mRNA vaccine series following a third, heterologous, COVID-19 vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Design: Two subjects with CLL were enrolled in an IRB-approved observational longitudinal cohort study of the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. After enrollment, they received a third vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Blood was drawn prior to original vaccination series, four weeks after mRNA vaccination, and again four weeks after third vaccination. Setting: Eligible subjects were approached by oncologist overseeing CLL treatment and informed about study, at time of enrollment subjects consented to join the cohort study. Participants: Sixteen subjects enrolled in the larger CLL cohort study, of whom two subjects received a third COVID-19 vaccination and were included in this analysis. Subject 1 is CLL treatment naive, while Subject 2 is currently on active treatment. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response, including plasma antibodies, memory B-cells, CD4 and CD8 T-cells were assessed prior to vaccination (baseline) as well as post vaccination series and post third dose. Results: Of the two subjects who received Ad26.COV2.S doses, Subject 1 seroconverted, had RBD-specific memory B-cells as well as spike-specific CD4 T-cells while Subject 2 did not. Both subjects had a spike-specific CD8 T-cell response after original mRNA vaccination series that was further boosted after third dose (Subject 1), or remained stable (Subject 2).

Detailed hospital-level information on patient characteristics, outcomes, and capacity strain is currently scarce but would guide clinical decision-making and inform prioritisation and planning. METHODS: We aimed to determine factors associated with hospital mortality and describe hospital and ICU strain by conducting a prospective cohort study at a tertiary academic centre in London, UK. We included adult patients admitted to the hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and followed them up until hospital discharge or 30 days. Baseline factors that are associated with hospital mortality were identified via semiparametric and parametric survival analyses. RESULTS: Our study included 429 patients: 18% of them were admitted to the ICU, 52% met criteria for ICU outreach team activation, and 61% had treatment limitations placed during their admission. Hospital mortality was 26% and ICU mortality was 34%. Hospital mortality was independently associated with increasing age, male sex, history of chronic kidney disease, increasing baseline C-reactive protein level, and dyspnoea at presentation. COVID-19 resulted in substantial ICU and hospital strain, with up to 9 daily ICU admissions and 41 daily hospital admissions, to a peak census of 80 infected patients admitted in the ICU and 250 in the hospital. Management of such a surge required extensive reorganisation of critical care services with expansion of ICU capacity from 69 to 129 beds, redeployment of staff from other hospital areas, and coordinated hospital-level effort. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with a high burden of mortality for patients treated on the ward and the ICU and required substantial reconfiguration of critical care services.

The objective of this study was to examine the in-depth experiences of junior nurses in providing care for COVID-19 patients within an acute care setting. This study employed a phenomenological method to understand the situation from a first-person perspective. Purposive sampling was used. Interviews were performed with 40 junior nurses (<4 years of clinical experience) who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients in isolation wards in acute care settings in Hong Kong. The interviews were conducted from 1 January 2021 to 24 May 2021 via virtual conferencing software (Zoom) to maintain social distancing, and the responses were analysed using Colaizzis seven-step method. Junior nurses psychological experiences of providing direct care to COVID-19 patients were categorised into four main themes. First, there were hurdles in the early stages, in which participants experienced negative emotions, such as fear, anxiety, helplessness, and fatigue. Somatic symptoms, such as headaches and sleep disturbance, were reported. Second, the adoption of self-care coping strategies enabled nurses to confront the hurdles, signifying the start of self-transformation. Third, junior nurses maintained positivity under pressure by appreciating their sources of support (including their families and other important relationships in their lives). Professionalism was also found to reinforce positivity. Fourth, self-transformation resulted in psychological growth, which prepared junior nurses to be resilient and confident in their clinical practice to take up future challenges in the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The hurdles experienced by junior nurses at the early stage of their work in isolation wards provided the foundation upon which self-transformation took place. Being able to employ self-care coping strategies and further sustain positivity characterised the self-transformation process. Eventually, junior nurses became resilient and more capable of understanding both the negativity and positivity of their experiences. The self-transformation process also enabled junior nurses to recognise and appreciate the wider support system from various parties in society.","output":"The Transformational Experience of Junior Nurses Resulting from Providing Care to COVID-19 Patients: From Facing Hurdles to Achieving Psychological Growth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) is a novel virus that has caused over 28 million cases worldwide and over 900,000 deaths since early 2020, rightfully being classified as a pandemic. COVID-19 is diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction testing which looks at cycle threshold (CT) values of two genes, N2 and E. This study examined CT values of COVID-positive patients at the VA hospital in Reno as well as other lab values and comorbidities to determine if any could aid clinicians in predicting the need for hospitalization and higher levels of care. Multiple variables, including N2 CT value, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and ferritin were evaluated for potential associations with N2 CT value as well as required level of care (based on World Health Organization [WHO] ordinal score). The results suggest that patients with a N2 CT value less than 34 are four times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p = .0021) while controlling for age and comorbidities (DM, cardiac, kidney, and lung disease). Patients of age 55 or greater were 15.18 times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p = .012) controlling for N2 CT value and comorbidities. Furthermore, patients with ALC less than 1 were 5.88 times more likely to have WHO ordinal score of 4-8 (p = .00024). N2 CT values also appear to be associated with many commonly obtained markers such as ALC, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer. Patients with N2 CT values less than 34 were 3.49 times more likely to have ALC values less than 1, controlling for age and comorbidities (p = .0072) while patients 55 or older were 6.66 times more likely to have ALC less than 1 (p = .027).

In this study, we first verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor and that its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. The heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased &#945;-helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR2) site, than the HR1 sequence in S2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Then, we designed an HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly potent activities in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus transduction. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 was characterized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities.

The HR1 sequence in the fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 adopts a much higher helical stability than the HR1 sequence in the fusion protein of SARS-CoV and can interact with the HR2 site to form a six-helical bundle structure more efficiently, underlying the mechanism of the enhanced fusion capacity. Also, importantly, the design of membrane fusion inhibitors with high potencies against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has provided potential arsenals to combat the pandemic and tools to exploit the fusion mechanism.","output":"Design of Potent Membrane Fusion Inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, an Emerging Coronavirus with High Fusogenic Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 lockdowns have deeply impacted teaching programs. Online teaching has suddenly become the main form of medical education, a form that may be used as long as the pandemic continues. We aimed at analyzing how online teaching was perceived by both teachers and learners to help determine how to adapt curricula in the next few years. An anonymous cross-sectional survey of medical students, pediatric residents, neonatal fellows, and their respective teachers was conducted between June and August 2020 to assess feelings about quality, attendance, equivalence, and sustainability of online teaching programs. 146 Students and 26 teachers completed the survey. 89% of students agreed that the offered online teaching was an appropriate way of teaching during the pandemic. Less than half of learners and teachers felt they have received or provided a training of an equivalent level and quality as in usual courses. About one-third thought that this online teaching should continue after the crisis ends. Medical school students had significantly more mixed opinions on online teaching than residents and fellows did. Attendance of learners significantly improved with synchronous online classes (p < 0.001), and among more advanced learners (p < 0.002). Our study is the first of this kind to assess simultaneously the feelings of learners at different levels (medical students, residents, and fellows) and their respective teachers of pediatric on programs taught online. It showed that online programs were perceived as appropriate ways of teaching during the COVID pandemic. Further studies are, however, needed to assess the efficacy of such teaching methods on medical skills and communication capabilities.","output":"Perception of medical education by learners and teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey of online teaching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditionally, learner models estimate a students knowledge state solely based on their performance on attempting assessment items. This can be attributed to the fact that in many traditional educational systems, students are primarily involved in just answering assessment items.

In crowdsourcing educational systems, in addition to attempting assessment items, students are engaged with other various tasks such as creating resources, creating solutions, rating the quality of resources, and giving feedback. Past studies have demonstrated that engaging students in meaningful crowdsourcing tasks, also referred to as learningsourcing, has pedagogical benefits that can enhance student learning. In this paper, we present a learner model that leverages data from students learnersourcing contributions alongside attempting assessment items towards modelling of students knowledge state.

The study objective is to investigate awareness, perception, and attitude towards COVID-19 and infection control measures among ophthalmologists in Jordan. Methods: The design of the study was a cross-sectional survey among Jordanian ophthalmologists. An online survey was sent to 197 ophthalmologists on March 23, 2020. Information on participants' socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of clinical features of COVID-19, risk assessment and infection control measures for preventing disease transmission, and attitude towards treating patients with COVID-19 were collected. Results: A total of 132 ophthalmologists (mean age 40.5 years) responded, 23 (17.6%) had received training on infection control in ophthalmology. Most ophthalmologists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways to identify patients at risk of having the disease, correctly reported modes of transmission and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in the ophthalmic setup. Social media was the commonest source of information on COVID-19 (75%), and 38.2% were not provided with instructions on infection control plan to reduce transmission of COVID-19. Most ophthalmologists (79.5%) thought that the virus could be detected in tears, and 72.2% thought that red eye as a symptom of COVID-19. Conclusion: Ophthalmologists in Jordan were aware of the epidemiology of COVID-19 and related infection preventive measures. Knowledge was lacking regarding ocular aspects of the disease. Training on infection prevention needs to be improved. Access to guidelines from international ophthalmological organizations should be promoted and seeking updated literature from peer-reviewed journals needs to be encouraged.","output":"Awareness, Perceptions, and Attitude Regarding Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Among Ophthalmologists in Jordan: Cross-Sectional Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, reports of lead contamination have dramatically increased in Georgia.

In rare cases they can lead to sepsis, which may pose a vital threat to the patient. The purpose of this study was to analyse characteristics concerning etiology and progress of severe odontogenic infections with a fulminant development. METHODS: All patients with odontogenic infections requiring hospital admission were included in a retrospective analysis conducted from 02/2012 to 09/2017. Of 483 patients 16 patients (13 male, 3 female) showed severe exacerbation with septic progress. The average age was 52.8 years. All patients underwent at least one surgical procedure that involved an extraoral incision and drainage as well as high volume irrigation intraoperatively. At least one revision was required for four of the patients. Three patients showed an exceedingly severe disease progression with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and circulatory arrest. Antibiotic treatment was adjusted according to the results of an antibiogram and resistogram. Irrigation with saline was done several times a day. RESULTS: Sixteen patients showed odontogenic infections that spread over multiple maxillo-facial and cervical regions accompanied by septic laboratory signs. All these patients needed intensive care and a tracheostomy. The hospitalization period was 27.8 days on average. In 16 cases risk factors for the development of odontogenic abscesses like diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic alcohol and nicotine abuse, rheumatism and poor oral hygiene were present. Intraoperative swabs showed a typical polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic spectrum of oral bacteria, especially anaerobes and streptococci, mainly Streptocococcus viridans. CONCLUSION: Odontogenic infections with fulminant progression should be treated based on clinical and imaging data with immediate surgical incision and drainage including elimination of odontogenic foci as well as intensified intra- and postoperative irrigation. If needed, repeat imaging followed by further incisions should be performed. Immediate antibiotic treatment adapted to the antibiogram is of utmost importance. A combination of tazobactam and piperacillin has proven to be a good first choice and can be recommended for abscesses that spread over multiple levels with initial signs of severe infections.","output":"Severe odontogenic infections with septic progress C a constant and increasing challenge: a retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and importanceThe SARS-CoV-2 health crisis unleashed in Spain in March 2020 forced hospitals to urgently reorganise and adapt in an unprecedented way One of the strategies carried out was the establishment of clean circuits and hospitals from SARS-CoV-2 Aim and objectivesTo describe the organisational changes of a pharmacy service of a SARS-CoV-2 clean hospital and to measure their impact Material and methodsThe study was carried out in an 86 bed hospital (non-COVID-19 use) dependent on a 652 bed university hospital (with care for COVID-19 patients), located in a different location, from 11 March, when the WHO declared the pandemic, to 21 June 2020, ending the state of alarm The activity was compared with the same period in the previous year Outpatient pharmaceutical care unit (OPCU) patient surveys were conducted to measure impact The staff was temporarily reinforced with a specialist in the hospital pharmacy ResultsThe following implementations were carried out:Opening of OPCU, with 886 dispensations to 448 patients, compared with 34 dispensations to 9 patients the previous year 60 surveys were conducted, where 60% of patients expressed that had they had to travel to their usual hospital during the pandemic, they would not have collected their medication Furthermore, 93% of patients said they felt safe in their visit to the new OPCU Satisfaction evaluation was excellent (average 10/10) Medicalisation of a 165 bed nursing home Referral of day hospital patients 570 dispensations were made to 191 patients compared with 154 dispensations to 44 patients in 2019 Transfer of the oncology hospital ward Total stays increased from 3253 in the previous year to 4326 (33% increase) Creation of a specific respiratory emergency service, where SARSCCoVC2 positive cases were referred to the referral hospital Conclusion and relevanceAmong the new circuits, opening of the OPCU stood out because of the avoidance of a large number of trips to a dirty hospital in another town, the improvement in adherence and for the great organisational effort in a very short period of time The different measures allowed the non-COVID-19 activity to continue, minimising the risk of contagion for patients The health crisis due to SARS-CoV-2 has been a challenge and the hospital pharmacy has shown a great capacity for adaptation References and/or acknowledgementsConflict of interestNo conflict of interest","output":"4CPS-348 The hospital pharmacy in the creation of clean circuits in the face of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The present COVID-19 brief report addresses: (1) the problem of optimal design and resource allocation to mobile testing stations to ensure rapid results to the persons getting tested; (2) the proposed solution through a newly developed discrete event simulation model, experienced in on-campus saliva-based testing stations at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and (3) the lessons learned on how 10,000 samples (from noninvasive polymerase chain reaction COVID-19 tests) can be processed per day on campus, as well as how the model could be reused or adapted to other contexts by site managers and decision makers.","output":"A Discrete Event Simulation-Based Model to Optimally Design and Dimension Mobile COVID-19 Saliva-Based Testing Stations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 morbidity and mortality have significant gender disparities, with higher prevalence and mortality in men.

Two main designs of stents, the closed- (CCS) and open-cell (OCS), are used in combination for a crossing Y-construct. This in vitro study was conducted to assess the mechanical characteristics of each stent-combination and to suggest an optimal combination for clinical practice. METHODS The Enterprise and the Neuroform3 stents were used as closed-cell and open-cell stents, respectively. Four different Y-stent combinations; double CCSs (CCS-CCS; Enterprise-Enterprise), OCS followed by CCS (OCS-CCS; Neuroform-Enterprise), CCS followed by OCS (CCS-OCS; Enterprise-Neuroform), and double OCSs (OCS-OCS; Neuroform-Neuroform) were tested in a bifurcation aneurysm model. Images of the model were obtained by digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and morphological changes of Y-constructs caused by interaction between stents were compared. RESULTS Double OCSs showed the best stent apposition to model branches and no collapse of the second stent at the intersection, whereas Y-stent combinations using a CCS as the second stent showed tubular collapse of the second stent at the crossing point. These combinations revealed unsatisfactory apposition to the model branch in which the second stent was deployed. Most narrowing of the second stent was noted in the double CCSs construct, which resulted in poorest stent apposition. CONCLUSION Based on a simple in vitro experiment, we suggest that double OCSs Y-construct is optimal for achieving best stent-wall apposition. Furthermore, our findings suggest that Y-stent combinations utilizing a CCS as the second stent may increase the risk of thromboembolic complications due to poor stent-wall apposition.","output":"The impact of stent design on the structural mechanics of the crossing Y-stent: an in vitro study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risks posed by bioterrorism and the proliferation of biological weapons capabilities have increased concern about how the rapid advances in genetic engineering and biotechnology could enable the production of biological weapons with unique and unpredictable characteristics.

WHO guidelines on tuberculosis (TB) infection prevention and control (IPC) recommend a range of measures to reduce transmission in healthcare settings. These were evaluated primarily based on evidence for their effects on transmission to healthcare workers in hospitals. To estimate the overall impact of IPC interventions, it is necessary to also consider their impact on community-wide TB incidence and mortality. METHODS: We developed an individual-based model of Mtb transmission in households, primary healthcare (PHC) clinics, and all other congregate settings. The model was parameterised using data from a high HIV prevalence community in South Africa, including data on social contact by setting, by sex, age, and HIV/antiretroviral therapy status; and data on TB prevalence in clinic attendees and the general population. We estimated the proportion of disease in adults that resulted from transmission in PHC clinics, and the impact of a range of IPC interventions in clinics on community-wide TB. RESULTS: We estimate that 7.6% (plausible range 3.9%C13.9%) of non-multidrug resistant and multidrug resistant TB in adults resulted directly from transmission in PHC clinics in the community in 2019. The proportion is higher in HIV-positive people, at 9.3% (4.8%C16.8%), compared with 5.3% (2.7%C10.1%) in HIV-negative people. We estimate that IPC interventions could reduce incident TB cases in the community in 2021C2030 by 3.4%C8.0%, and deaths by 3.0%C7.2%. CONCLUSIONS: A non-trivial proportion of TB results from transmission in clinics in the study community, particularly in HIV-positive people. Implementing IPC interventions could lead to moderate reductions in disease burden. We recommend that IPC measures in clinics should be implemented for their benefits to staff and patients, but also for their likely effects on TB incidence and mortality in the surrounding community.","output":"Estimating the contribution of transmission in primary healthcare clinics to community-wide TB disease incidence, and the impact of infection prevention and control interventions, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The crisis in the education system generated by the appearance of covid-19 revealed the multiple gaps that exist due to the diversity of contexts to which students and teachers belong. This article reports on a case study which explored the challenges English teacher educators (tes) at a public university in Neiva, Colombia faced during the pandemic due to the imposition of emergency remote teaching (ert), the pedagogical strategies they used to respond to these challenges, and the ones that remain. To do this, data were collected from a questionnaire and a focus group with tes and pre-service teachers (psts) from the language teacher education program. The main findings show that the transition from classroom teaching to ert brought some challenges for tes and their trainees related to the social realities existing in the context of the latter. To respond to these challenges, tes had to adjust their teaching strategies and learn to use some technologies such as videoconferencing software and educational apps. Still some challenges remain for the future, such as enhancing pst's motivation, autonomy and classroom interaction. The study suggests the need to continue training language tes on the use of ert technologies and to find more and better ways to promote autonomous learning processes to adapt teaching practices to current times. ? 2021 Universidad de Antioquia.

The lack of tumor specificity remains a major drawback for effective chemotherapies and results in dose-limiting toxicities. However, a ligand-mediated drug delivery system should be able to render chemotherapy more specific to tumor cells and less toxic to normal tissues. In this study, we isolated a novel peptide ligand from a phage-displayed peptide library that bound to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The targeting phage bound to several NSCLC cell lines but not to normal cells. Both the targeting phage and the synthetic peptide recognized the surgical specimens of NSCLC with a positive rate of 75% (27 of 36 specimens). In severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing NSCLC xenografts, the targeting phage specifically bound to tumor masses. The tumor homing ability of the targeting phage was inhibited by the cognate synthetic peptide, but not by a control or a WTY-mutated peptide. When the targeting peptide was coupled to liposomes carrying doxorubicin or vinorelbine, the therapeutic index of the chemotherapeutic agents and the survival rates of mice with human lung cancer xenografts markedly increased. Furthermore, the targeting liposomes increased drug accumulation in tumor tissues by 5.7-fold compared with free drugs and enhanced cancer cell apoptosis resulting from a higher concentration of bioavailable doxorubicin. The current study suggests that this tumor-specific peptide may be used to create chemotherapies specifically targeting tumor cells in the treatment of NSCLC and to design targeted gene transfer vectors or it may be used one in the diagnosis of this malignancy.","output":"A Novel Peptide Enhances Therapeutic Efficacy of Liposomal Anti-Cancer Drugs in Mice Models of Human Lung Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic.

Examples include non-dignified care, lack of respect when giving care, discrimination and abandonment of care. The objective of this study was to assess knowledge and attitudes towards obstetric violence in a cohort of medical students in India and the UK. STUDY DESIGN: An online survey was sent to 240 UK and 280 Indian medical students. This incorporated a video showing a dramatized scenario of obstetric violence. The survey assessed participant's demographics and prior knowledge of obstetric violence. Participants scored their perceptions of eight behaviours in the video on visual analogue scales. Participants were asked to reflect on their own practice and score this. Comparisons of survey responses between UK and Indian participants were made using chi squared/Student's t-test. RESULTS: 62 Indian medical students and 58 UK medical students completed the survey. Indian medical students were significantly more likely to be male (p < 0.001). 26 % of UK participants had previously heard the term obstetric violence, compared to 34 % of Indian participants (p = 0.15). Both were able to correctly define obstetric violence at similar rates (32 % versus 34 %). Indian medical students were significantly less critical (p < 0.001) of all eight scored behaviours in the video of obstetric violence compared to their UK counterparts. UK medical students were significantly less likely to agree that the video had changed their perception on how teams should behave and act in this context (p < 0.001). 90 % of UK participants and 38 % of Indian participants had received training in professional behaviours. 14 % of UK participants had seen examples of obstetric violence in clinical practice compared to 49 % of Indian participants. CONCLUSIONS: UK and Indian medical students were able to identify behaviours associated with obstetric violence, although the majority were previously unaware of the term. Indian medical students in this study were less critical of obstetric violence in the video, which may be because of cultural reasons, greater numbers of male students, greater exposure to obstetric violence or less training on professional behaviours. Standardised training to prevent obstetric violence should be part of undergraduate medical training internationally.","output":"Obstetric violence: Comparing medical student perceptions in India and the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 has emerged as a major global health threat with a great number of deaths in China. We aimed to assess the association between Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and to compare the predictive ability of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age 65 (CURB65) score. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. SUBJECTS: Confirmed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized in the ICU of Tongji hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 178 potentially eligible patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, 23 patients (12.92%) were diagnosed as suspected cases, and one patient (0.56%) suffered from cardiac arrest immediately after admission. Ultimately, 154 patients were enrolled in the analysis and 52 patients (33.77%) died. Mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (23.23  6.05) was much higher in deaths compared with the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 10.87  4.40 in survivors (p < 0.001). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.13). In predicting hospital mortality, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score demonstrated better discriminative ability (area under the curve, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.942-0.990) than Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (area under the curve, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.808-0.926) and CURB65 score (area under the curve, 0.844; 95% CI, 0.784-0.905). Based on the cut-off value of 17, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score could predict the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 86.27%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score less than 17 was notably higher than that of patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and CURB65 score. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.","output":"Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II Score as a Predictor of Hospital Mortality in Patients of Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2017, approximately one in three U.S. adults reported having been told by a health care professional that they had high blood pressure (hypertension) (1).

To examine prevalence of self-reported hypertension and antihypertensive medication use by rural-urban classification and county, CDC analyzed data reported by 442,641 adults aged 18 years who participated in the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). In rural (noncore) areas, 40.0% (unadjusted prevalence) of adults reported having hypertension, whereas in the most urban (large central metro) areas, 29.4% reported having hypertension. Age-standardized hypertension prevalence was significantly higher in the most rural areas, compared with the most urban areas within nearly all categories of age, sex, and other demographic characteristics. Model-based hypertension prevalence across counties ranged from 18.0% to 55.0% and was highest in Southeastern* and Appalachian? counties. Model-based county-level prevalence of antihypertensive medication use among adults with hypertension ranged from 54.3% to 84.7%. Medication use also was higher in rural areas compared with use in most urban areas, with prevalence highest in Southeastern and Appalachian counties as well as counties in the Dakotas and Nebraska. CDC is working with states to enhance hypertension awareness and management through a strategy of team-based care that involves physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, and community health workers.

Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) are a group of antidiabetic drugs, the glucose reducing effect of which is founded on augmenting glucose-dependent insulin secretion with concomitant reduction of glucagon secretion and delayed gastric emptying. Apart from their glucose lowering effects, GLP1-RAs also exert a plethora of pleiotropic activities in the form of anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-obesogenic properties, with beneficial cardiovascular and renal impact. All these make this class of drugs a preferred option for managing patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and potentially helpful in those with SARS-CoV2 infection. AREAS COVERED: In the present article we propose a hypothetical molecular mechanism by which GLP1-RAs may interact with SARSCCoV-2 activity. EXPERT OPINION: The beneficial properties of GLP1-RAs may be of specific importance during COVID-19 infection for the most fragile patients with chronic comorbid conditions such as T2D, and those at higher cardiovascular and renal disease risk.

Naloxone can reverse opioid overdose, lower death rates, and enable a transition to medication for opioid use disorder. Though current formulations for community use of naloxone have been shown to be safe and effective public health interventions, they rely on bystander presence. We sought to understand the preferences and minimum necessary conditions for wearing a device capable of sensing and reversing opioid overdose among people who regularly use opioids. METHODS: We conducted a combined cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interview at a respite center, shelter, and syringe exchange drop-in program in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, during the COVID-19 pandemic in August and September 2020. The primary aim was to explore the proportion of participants who would use a wearable device to detect and reverse overdose. Preferences regarding designs and functionalities were collected via a questionnaire with items having Likert-based response options and a semi-structured interview intended to elicit feedback on prototype designs. Independent variables included demographics, opioid use habits, and previous experience with overdose. RESULTS: A total of 97 adults with an opioid use history of at least 3 months were interviewed. A majority of survey participants (76%) reported a willingness to use a device capable of detecting an overdose and automatically administering a reversal agent upon initial survey. When reflecting on the prototype, most respondents (75.5%) reported that they would wear the device always or most of the time. Respondents indicated discreetness and comfort as important factors that increased their chance of uptake. Respondents suggested that people experiencing homelessness and those with low tolerance for opioids would be in greatest need of the device. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of people sampled with a history of opioid use in an urban setting were interested in having access to a device capable of detecting and reversing an opioid overdose. Participants emphasized privacy and comfort as the most important factors influencing their willingness to use such a device. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04530591.

The proposed system preprocesses the chest X-ray image with WT which produces a set of approximation coefficients that include a limited number of high-magnitude coefficients. The proposed system introduces a novel threshold scanning technique that extracts only selected high-energy approximation coefficients. The thresholded coefficients are encoded using a modified version of the run-length encoding (RLE) scheme. The resulting code vector is used as the features representing the input image. These limited features are then presented to a SVM for classification (normal or COVID-19). The use of limited features in the proposed system significantly simplifies the work of the SVM classifier and increases its accuracy. Another advantage of diminishing the number of features is the reduction of the time complexity of the system.

Aeromonas is a highly heterogeneous group of bacteria, and the heterogeneity of the genus is attributed to variation and diversity in the virulence factors and toxins among various Aeromonas strains. One of the major toxins aerolysin, secreted by the bacterium, causes hemorrhagic-septicemia and diarrhea and can serve as a drug target. Here, we describe characterization, molecular phylogeny, and homology modeling of the aerolysin of A. hydrophila strain EUS112 (AhEUS112) cloned in our lab. The encoded aerolysin is 485 amino acids long with an N-terminal signal sequence of 23 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of the aerolysin of AhEUS112 revealed that it belongs to a diverse group of toxins, showing maximum similarity with aerolysins of other Aeromonas strains followed by Vibrio toxin. The homology model of the mature aerolysin of AhEUS112 was generated using the crystal structure of a mutant aerolysin (PDB#3g4n) as the template, which showed that the encoded aerolysin exists as a channel protein. Validation of the generated model using bioinformatics tool confirmed it to be a good quality model that can be used for drug design. Molecular dock analysis revealed that drugs, aralia-saponin I, cyclamin, ardisiacrispin B, and aralia-saponin II bind to aerolysin with a higher affinity as compared to other drugs and at functionally important amino acids of aerolysin.

Giant breast hamartoma (GMH) is very rare and can reach unexpected sizes in women. PRESENTATION OF THE CASE: A 26 year old Egyptian female presented with left breast lump since 3 years, gradually increasing in size, with no other associated complaints. No family history of breast cancer, she did not smoke or consume alcohol, and had no past medical history. Examination revealed a large soft freely mobile mass (12  9 cm) in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast at the 3C6 oclock position. There were no palpable axillary lymph nodes in both sides. Nipples and right breast were normal. DISCUSSION: The diagnosis of GMH can be made by examination and imaging only. The specific features that appear in mammogram and ultrasound can be used to reduce the need for core biopsy in hamartoma. Wide local excision is curative. We include a review of the literature of cases of GMH > 10 cm published during the last 15 years. CONCLUSION: A non-invasive mammogram and ultrasound provide sufficient evidence of the tumour, hence core biopsy might not be critically required. However, if a breast hamartoma is still clinically suspected but with inconclusive or unequivocal mammographic and ultrasonographic features or if there is suspicion of dysplasia, then invasive core biopsy is justified. Recurrence is low and prognosis is good.","output":"Giant mammary hamartoma in a middle aged female.

Given the nature of the interventions, the potential of an effect extending beyond the original one year of follow-up might be present. This study aims to determine the efficacy of this IPS on LTSA and termination of employment contract over five years by extended follow up of IPS trials. Methods Company records on sickness absence and termination of employment contract over five years were used from two randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the efficacy of the IPS (RCT I employees at high-risk for LTSA: intervention: N=263; RCT II high-risk employees with concurrent mild depressive complaints: intervention: N=139). Survival analysis was used to model time until the first LTSA episode and termination of employment contract. Results RCT I showed a decrease of 43.2 days of sickness absence (P=0.05) and a lower 5-year risk of LTSA in the intervention, as compared to the control group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.90], however no considerable impact on employment contract (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.54-1.35) (intention-to-treat, ITT). For RCT II, we found no large difference in days of SA and no difference in LTSA risk over five years (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.70-2.47), whereas the risk of termination of the employment contract was lower (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.99) (ITT).

Because patients auto-emit aerosols containing viable virus, these aerosols can be further propagated when patients undergo certain treatments including continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. This study aimed to assess the degree of viable virus propagated from mask leak in a PAP circuit. METHODS: Bacteriophage PhiX174 (108copies/mL) was nebulised into a custom PAP circuit. Mask leak was systematically varied to 0, 7, 21, 28 and 42 L/min at the mask interface. Plates containing Escherichia coli assessed the degree of viable virus settling on surfaces around the room. In order to contain virus spread a ventilated headboard and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was tested. RESULTS: Increasing mask leak was associated with virus contamination in a dose response manner (2= 58.24, df=4, p<0.001). Clinically relevant levels of leak (21 L/min) were associated with virus counts equivalent to using PAP with a standard vented mask. Viable viruses were recorded on all plates (up to 3.86m from source). A plastic hood with HEPA filtration significantly reduced viable viruses on all plates. HEPA exchange rates of 170 and 470m3/hr eradicated all evidence of virus contamination.

At the beginning of the pandemic many guidelines recommended postponing elective surgical procedures to reallocate resources. As regards, delay in cancer treatment could be effective on cancer progression. The aim of this systematic review was to outline a guideline for preoperative screening before cancer surgeries and protecting health care workers during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted through a search in electronic databases up to August 2020. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases were searched without time limitation. The keywords were a combination of preoperative, cancer surgery, COVID-19, and their synonyms. Results: The most commonly used ways to triage preoperatively were telephone pre-assessment for suspicious symptoms and history of contact or travel, 14-day self-isolation, in- hospital queries at admission, temperature monitoring, and isolation in a single room COVID-free ward or physical distancing. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test 24C72 h before operation was recommended commonly, except in inaccessible centers, but non-contrast chest-CT scan is not routinely advised for elective surgeries to salvage medical resources. Recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) for staffs were wearing N95 mask in addition to gown, gloves, eye protection in aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), and wearing gloves, hats, and disposable surgical masks, practice distancing, and hand hygiene for all staffs. Meanwhile team separation of hospital staffs caring for COVID-19 patients, segregated areas for COVID-19 clean and contact, restriction of visitors and family members, and personal distancing are mostly recommended.

They contain mutations in the spike glycoprotein that can affect virus infectivity, transmissibility, or sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies. Here we show that the emergence of new spike variants is accurately predicted by patterns of amino acid variability (volatility) in small virus clusters that phylogenetically-precede or chronologically-predate such events. For each spike position, volatility within the virus clusters, volatility at adjacent positions on the three-dimensional structure of the protein, and volatility across the network of co-volatile sites describe its likelihood for mutations. By combining these variables, early-pandemic sequences accurately forecasted mutations in lineages that appeared 6C13 months later. The patterns of mutations in variants Alpha and Delta, as well as the recently-appearing variant Omicron were also predicted remarkably well. Importantly, probabilities assigned to spike positions for within-lineage mutations were lineage-specific, and accurately forecasted the observed changes. Sufficient antecedent warning of the imminent changes in SARS-CoV-2 lineages will allow design of immunogens that address their specific antigenic properties.","output":"Patterns of Volatility Across the Spike Protein Accurately Predict the Emergence of Mutations within SARS-CoV-2 Lineages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has long been possible to isolate viruses from the stools by culture, though the viruses found are rarely implicated in disease of the gut.

This is because patients with thalassaemia can present with many and multiple co-morbidities including diabetes, heart, liver, endocrine and other conditions mainly secondary to iron overload and consequent to ineffective or suboptimal medical care and/or adherence to chelation treatment in particular.

Our hypothesis is that there are regional differences in stroke outcome depending on location during the COVID-19 study period which influences stroke epidemiology and clinical stroke practice. METHODS: The American Heart Association's 'Get with the Guidelines' (GWTG) database was used to evaluate the following categories: code stroke, diagnosis of stroke upon discharge, inpatient mortality, modified Rankin Score (mRS) upon discharge (morbidity), and time since last known well (LKW). Stroke registry data from February through June 2019 and 2020 were collected for retrospective review. RESULTS: The total number of strokes decreased in the US and CA, but increased in SHS during the COVID-19 study period. The US and SHS demonstrated no change in stroke mortality, but CA demonstrated a higher stroke mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was greater loss of independence with increased stroke morbidity in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a significant increase in time since LKW in the US and SHS, and an increase trend in time since LKW in CA during the COVID-19 study period.

Objective: to determine the safest and most effective anticoagulant for stroke prevention in patients with severe COVID-19. Patients and methods. A prospective study enrolled 520 patients with severe COVID-19. We used the following criteria for severe COVID-19: SpO2 <92% on room air at sea level, PaO2/FiO2 <300 mm Hg, respiratory rate >30 breaths/min, lung infiltrates >50% on computed tomography. The study included 509 patients, divided into three groups depending on the type of anticoagulant therapy: patients of the 1st group received 24-36 thousand IU of heparin, patients of the 2nd group - enoxaparin at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day, patients of the 3rd group - rivaroxaban at a dose of 20 mg/day. The duration of anticoagulant administration depended on the severity of the patient's condition, dynamics of laboratory parameters (D-dimer, fibrinogen, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count), and varied from 2 to 6 weeks.

The highest stroke incidence was observed in the group of patients receiving heparin. In contrast, the prevention of thrombotic complications in patients receiving low-molecular-weight anticoagulants or rivaroxaban showed the best results with minimal morbidity and mortality in severe COVID-19.

To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on EfficientNet, named ECOVNet, to detect COVID-19 from chest X-rays. To make the proposed model more robust, we have used one of the largest open-access chest X-ray data sets named COVIDx containing three classesCOVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. For feature extraction, we have applied an effective CNN structure, namely EfficientNet, with ImageNet pre-training weights. The generated features are transferred into custom fine-tuned top layers followed by a set of model snapshots. The predictions of the model snapshots (which are created during a single training) are consolidated through two ensemble strategies, i.e., hard ensemble and soft ensemble, to enhance classification performance. In addition, a visualization technique is incorporated to highlight areas that distinguish classes, thereby enhancing the understanding of primal components related to COVID-19. The results of our empirical evaluations show that the proposed ECOVNet model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves detection performance with 100% recall for COVID-19 and overall accuracy of 96.07%.

This study sought to evaluate whether there is any difference on the long-term results of TAR and non-TAR CABG patients. METHODS The Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL/CCTR), Clinical Trials.gov, Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Cincias da Sade (LILACS), and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies published by October 2020. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies with propensity score matching comparing TAR versus non-TAR CABG were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. The current barriers to implementation of TAR in clinical practice and measures that can be used to optimize outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Fourteen publications (from 2012 to 2020) involving a total of 22,746 patients (TAR: 8,941 patients; non-TAR: 13,805 patients) were included. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) for long-term mortality (over 10 years) was lower in the TAR group than in the non-TAR group (random effect model: HR 0.676, 95% confidence interval 0.586-0.779, P<0.001). There was evidence of low heterogeneity of treatment effect among the studies for mortality, and none of the studies had a particular impact on the summary result. The result was not influenced by age, sex, or comorbidities. We identified low risk of publication bias related to this outcome. CONCLUSION This review found that TAR presents the best long-term results in patients who undergo CABG. Given that many patients are likely to benefit from TAR, its use should be encouraged.","output":"Total Arterial Coronary Bypass Graft Surgery is Associated with Better Long-Term Survival in Patients with Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease: a Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. The pathogenesis is complex and has not been clearly elucidated, and there is no effective treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNA methylation is closely associated with the pathogenesis of AD, which sheds light on investigating potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of early AD and related possible therapeutic approaches. METHODS: Alzheimers disease patients samples and healthy controls samples were collected from two datasets in the GEO database. Using LIMMA software package in R language to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Afterward, DEGs have been subjected to enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG pathways. The PPI networks and Hub genes were created and visualized based on the STRING database and Cytoscape. ROC curves were further constructed to analyze the accuracy of these genes for AD diagnosis. RESULTS: Analysis of the GSE109887 and GSE97760 datasets showed 477 significant DEGs. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed terms related to biological processes related to these genes. The top ten Hub genes were found on the basis of the PPI network using the CytoHubba plugin, and the AUC areas of these top ranked genes were all greater than 0.7, showing satisfactory diagnostic accuracy.

Despite the widespread use of Bayesian NNHM, it has always been unclear to what extent the posterior inference is impacted by the heterogeneity prior (sensitivity S ) and by the uncertainty in the within-study standard deviation values (identification I ). Thus, to answer this question, we developed a unified method to simultaneously quantify both sensitivity and identification ( S - I ) for all model parameters in a Bayesian NNHM, based on derivatives of the Bhattacharyya coefficient with respect to relative latent model complexity (RLMC) perturbations. Three case studies exemplify the applicability of the method proposed: historical data for a conventional therapy, data from which one large study is first included and then excluded, and two subgroup meta-analyses specified by their randomization status. We analyzed six scenarios, crossing three RLMC targets with two heterogeneity priors (half-normal, half-Cauchy). The results show that S - I explicitly reveals which parameters are affected by the heterogeneity prior and by the uncertainty in the within-study standard deviation values. In addition, we compare the impact of both heterogeneity priors and quantify how S - I values are affected by omitting one large study and by the randomization status. Finally, the range of applicability of S - I is extended to Bayesian NtHM.

We (i) assessed associations between residential green space and cumulative incidence of, and relief from, loneliness over 4 years; and (ii) explored contingencies by age, sex, disability and cohabitation status. METHODS: Multilevel logistic regressions of change in loneliness status in 8049 city-dwellers between 2013 (baseline) and 2017 (follow-up) in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia study. Associations with objectively measured discrete green-space buffers (e.g. parks) (<400, <800 and <1600 m) were adjusted for age, sex, disability, cohabitation status, children and socio-economic variables. Results were translated into absolute risk reductions in loneliness per 10% increase in urban greening. RESULTS: The absolute risk of loneliness rose from 15.9% to 16.9% over the 4 years; however, a 10% increase in urban greening within 1.6 km was associated with lower cumulative incident loneliness [odds ratio (OR) = 0.927, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.862 to 0.996; absolute risk reduction = 0.66%]. Stronger association was observed for people living alone (OR = 0.828, 95% CI = 0.725 to 0.944). In comparison to people with <10% green space, the ORs for cumulative incident loneliness were 0.833 (95% CI = 0.695 to 0.997), 0.790 (95% CI = 0.624 to 1.000) and 0.736 (95% CI = 0.549 to 0.986) for 10-20%, 20-30% and >30% green space, respectively. Compared with the <10% green-space reference group with 13.78% incident loneliness over 4 years and conservatively assuming no impact on incident loneliness, associations translated into absolute risk reductions of 1.70%, 2.26% and 2.72% within populations with 10-20%, 20-30% and >30% green space, respectively. These associations were stronger again for people living alone, with 10-20% (OR = 0.608, 95% CI = 0.448 to 0.826), 20-30% (OR = 0.649, 95% CI = 0.436 to 0.966) and >30% (OR = 0.480, 95% CI = 0.278 to 0.829) green space within 1600 m.

With flexible endoscopy readily available in this setting, we sought to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of a transgastric natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) peritoneoscopy vs. laparoscopic exploration in the identification of intra-abdominal pathology in a porcine model. METHODS In this acute study, 15 pigs were randomized to demonstrate 0 to 4 pathologic lesions: small bowel ischemia (SBI), small bowel perforation (SBP), colon perforation (CP), and gangrenous cholecystitis (GC). Two blinded surgical endoscopists were allowed 60 min to perform NOTES or laparoscopy (LAP) to correctly identify or exclude each lesion. A prototype endoscope (R-scope, Olympus, Inc), which enables independent instrument mobility, was used in the NOTES arm. RESULTS When considering all lesions, LAP was more sensitive diagnostically than NOTES (77.4% vs. 61.3%) overall. LAP also displayed a slightly higher NPV compared with NOTES (79.4% vs. 70.7%). However, NOTES was 100% specific with 100% positive predictive value (PPV) compared with 93.1% and 92.3% with LAP, respectively. Individually, NOTES was found most sensitive with CP identification (87.5%) and least sensitive with SBP (37.5%). The sensitivity of NOTES for SBI and GC was 62.5% and 57.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The utilization of NOTES as a diagnostic tool may have an important role in the critically ill patient when operative intervention is highly morbid. Although it may be overall inferior diagnostically compared with laparoscopy, a positive identification was highly specific with a strong predictive value. Further investigation addressing an improved small bowel evaluation technique would be beneficial.

Methods: The authors performed independent research of the available literature in the most important electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Science Direct) in February 2021. After applying the exclusion criteria, the reviewers focused on the most relevant articles published during the last 10 years with respect to epidemiology and pathophysiology. Results: The data presented are a step forward in trying to elucidate the intricate relationship between obesity and MS, especially the causal relationship between childhood and adolescent obesity and MS, focusing on the epidemiological associations observed in the most relevant observational studies conducted in recent years. In the second part, the authors comment on the latest findings related to the pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain the correlations between obesity and multiple sclerosis, focusing also on the role of adipokines. Conclusions: Based on available epidemiological data, obesity in early life appears to be strongly associated with a higher risk of MS development, independent of other risk factors. Although much research has been done on the pathophysiology of obesity, MS, their possible common mechanism, and the role of adipokines, further studies are needed in order to explain what remains unknown.

The influence of various proportions of spent graphite (e.g., 5, 10, and 15 wt.% SG), harvested from end-of-life LIBs, on the performance of base AP-5 asphalt cement was studied. Multiple laboratory techniques have been employed to characterize the internal physiochemical interaction between the additive and the binder. These techniques include: elemental analysis (EA), thin-layer chromatography-flame ionization detection (TLC-FID), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), empirical test methods (e.g., penetration, softening point, viscosity, and ductility), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and multiple stress-creep recovery (MSCR). Prior to aging, SARA analysis demonstrated that the incremental SG addition into the AP-5 bitumen reduced the contents of saturates, aromatics, and resins, and increased the proportion of asphaltenes. After aging, the saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons kept decreasing; however, the resins increased and the asphaltenes declined. Accordingly, this has brought a progressive shift tendency in the stableCcolloidal system for all binders from sol-state towards sol-gel-state. FT-IR scan revealed that the SG has no apparent chemical interaction with the binder, and is endowed solely with filling effects. XRD diagnosis highlighted that the steady SG incorporation into the binder amplified its crystallinity; thereby boosting the thermomechanical properties of mastics. SEM imaging unveiled that the lower-dose of SG exhibited higher compatibility within the bitumen matrix; nevertheless, the intermediate/higher-doses made the binder body relatively rougher. DSR/MSCR/conventional tests indicated that when the asphalt is blended with the graphitic powder under unaged/aged conditions, it becomes stiffer, more viscous, and less cohesive; thereby rendering it more resistant to deformation but not to cracking. In summary, it is promisingly proven that the SG could be successfully used as an asphalt additive and could be beneficial for improving paving performance and mitigating the pollution caused by dead LIBs as well.","output":"Spent Graphite from End-of-Life Lithium-Ion Batteries (LIBs) as a Promising Nanoadditive to Boost Road Pavement Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transport of patients from the inpatient service to the operating room is a recurrent task in a hospital routine.

The central principle to organ allocation, the Final Rule is grounded on equitable allocation of cadaveric organs, regardless of background, including race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status, and there have been ongoing previous and current efforts in achieving the goal of equity in access to transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: Some of these disparities are caused by impeded access to the transplant waiting list (i.e., lack of referral to transplantation, socioeconomic constraints) and are somewhat beyond the purview of Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing (OPTN/UNOS) policy. This paper examines past and present OPTN/UNOS policy efforts that strive to make access to kidney transplantation more racially equitable. SUMMARY: Past and current policy efforts have brought the transplant community closer to the goal of achieving equity in access to transplantation.

AIMS OF THE STUDY: The aim is to confirm that repeated infusion of autologous adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) can be safely administered to patients with Parkinson's disease, and to investigate the effects of this as a pilot study. METHODS: Three patients with Parkinson's disease received five or six repeated infusions of ADSCs at intervals of approximately one month. Observations were based on medical examinations by a neurologist and interviews with the patient and caregivers. The severity of Parkinson's disease was assessed using the Hoehn & Yahr staging scale and Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). RESULTS: No adverse events were observed during the observation period from the start of treatment to six months after the end of the last dose. MDS-UPDRS improved in all three patients. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated administration of Autologous ADSCs for Parkinson's disease was safe and feasible.

Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program.

METHODS: Required testing volumes were developed using standard statistical methods based on test analytical performance, disease prevalence, desired precision, and population size. RESULTS: Widespread testing for individual health management cannot address surveillance needs. The number of people who must be sampled for public health surveillance and decision making, although not trivial, is potentially in the thousands for any given population or subpopulation, not millions. CONCLUSIONS: While the contributions of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 have received considerable attention, concerns abound regarding the availability of sufficient testing capacity to meet demand. Different testing goals require different numbers of tests and different testing strategies; testing strategies for national or local disease surveillance, including monitoring of prevalence, receive less attention. Our clinical laboratory and diagnostic infrastructure are capable of incorporating required volumes for many local, regional, and national public health surveillance studies into their current and projected testing capacity.

The experimental studies of the influence of ONS thickness on the resistive switching effect were obtained. An increase in the ONS thickness from 0.8  0.3 to 7.6  0.6 nm leads to an increase in the switching voltage Uset from 2.8  0.3 to 6.8  0.9 V.

This study aimed to assess the effects of liver injuries on the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1520 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 from Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, were enrolled. Chronic liver disease (CLD) was confirmed by consensus diagnostic criteria. Laboratory test results were compared between different groups. scRNA-seq data and bulk gene expression profiles were used to identify cell types associated with liver injury. RESULTS: A total of 10.98% of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 developed liver injury after admission that was associated with significantly higher rates of mortality (21.74%, p < 0.001) and intensive care unit admission (26.71%, p < 0.001). Pre-existing CLDs were not associated with a higher risk. However, fatty liver disease and cirrhosis were associated with higher risks, supported by evidences from single cell and bulk transcriptome analysis that showed more TMPRSS2(+) cells in these tissues. By generating a model, we were able to predict the risk and severity of liver injury during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that liver injury occurring during therapy as well as pre-existing CLDs like fatty liver disease and cirrhosis in patients with COVID-19 is significantly associated with the severity of disease and mortality, but the presence of other CLD is not associated. We provide a risk-score model that can predict whether patients with COVID-19 will develop liver injury or proceed to higher-risk stages during subsequent hospitalizations.

Italy was the first western country plagued by COVID-19 and one of the most affected in the early phase. During this period, we surveyed 2,223 Italians before the national lockdown. A quarter of the sample perceived COVID-19 less threatening than flu and would not vaccinate, if a vaccine was available. Besides, most people perceived containment measures, based on social distancing or wearing masks, not useful. This perceived utility was related to COVID-19 threat perception and efficacy beliefs. All these measures were associated with the use of media and their truthfulness: participants declared to mainly use the Internet, while health organizations websites were the most trusted. Although social networks were frequently used, they were rated lower for trustfulness. Our data differ from those obtained in other community samples, suggesting the relevance to explore changes across different countries and during the different phases of the pandemic.

In this study, two novel antitrypanosomals, tortodofuordioxamide (compound 2) and tortodofuorpyramide (compound 3), were chemically derived from the natural N-alkylamide tortozanthoxylamide (compound 1) through structural modification. The chemical structures of these compounds were confirmed through spectrometric and spectroscopic analysis, and their in vitro efficacy and possible mechanisms of action were, subsequently, investigated in Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), one of the causative species of African trypanosomiasis (AT). The novel compounds 2 and 3 displayed significant antitrypanosomal potencies in terms of half-maximal effective concentrations (EC(50)) and selectivity indices (SI) (compound 1, EC(50) = 7.3 M, SI = 29.5; compound 2, EC(50) = 3.2 M, SI = 91.3; compound 3, EC(50) = 4.5 M, SI = 69.9). Microscopic analysis indicated that at the EC(50) values, the compounds resulted in the coiling and clumping of parasite subpopulations without significantly affecting the normal ratio of nuclei to kinetoplasts.

This abundance and variety of vaccines created a historical moment to understand vaccine hesitancy better. Never before were more types of vaccines available for an illness and the intensity of vaccine-related public discourse is unprecedented. Yet, the heterogeneity of hesitancy by vaccine types has been neglected so far, even though factual or believed vaccine characteristics and patient attributes are known to influence acceptance. We address this problem by analysing acceptance and assessment of five vaccine types using information collected with a nationally representative survey at the end of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary, where a unique portfolio of vaccines were available to the public in large quantities. Our special case enables us to quantify revealed preferences across vaccine types since one could evaluate a vaccine unacceptable and even could reject an assigned vaccine to wait for another type. We find that the source of information that respondents trust characterizes their attitudes towards vaccine types differently and leads to divergent vaccine hesitancy. Believers of conspiracy theories were significantly more likely to evaluate the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) unacceptable while those who follow the advice of politicians evaluate vector-based (AstraZeneca and Sputnik) or whole-virus vaccines (Sinopharm) acceptable with higher likelihood. We illustrate that the rejection of non-desired and re-selection of preferred vaccines fragments the population by the mRNA versus other type of vaccines while it generally improves the assessment of the received vaccine. These results highlight that greater variance of available vaccine types and individual free choice are desirable conditions that can widen the acceptance of vaccines in societies.","output":"Understanding hesitancy with revealed preferences across COVID-19 vaccine types (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic COVID-19, caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as severe public health issue crippling world health care systems Substantial knowledge has been generated about the pathophysiology of the disease and possible treatment modalities in a relatively short span of time As of August 19, 2020, there is no approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19 More than 600 clinical trials for potential therapeutics are underway and the results are expected soon Based on early experience, different treatment such as anti-viral drugs (remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir), corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone) or convalescent plasma therapy are recommended in addition to supportive care and symptomatic therapy There are several treatments currently being investigated to address the pathological conditions associated with COVID-19 This review provides currently available information and insight into pathophysiology of the disease, potential targets, and relevant clinical trials for COVID-19","output":"COVID-19 associated complications and potential therapeutic targets.

In this regard, we aimed to measure the potential associations of the current use of PPIs with the infection rates of COVID-19 among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. DESIGN Data were derived from a Korean nationwide cohort study with propensity score matching. We included 132 316 patients older than 18 years who tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 January and 15 May 2020. Endpoints were SARS-CoV-2 positivity (primary) and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (secondary: admission to intensive care unit, administration of invasive ventilation or death). RESULTS In the entire cohort, there were 111 911 non-users, 14 163 current PPI users and 6242 past PPI users. After propensity score matching, the SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate was not associated with the current or past use of PPIs. Among patients with confirmed COVID-19, the current use of PPIs conferred a 79% greater risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19, while the relationship with the past use of PPIs remained insignificant. Current PPI use starting within the previous 30 days was associated with a 90% increased risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: A more case-based, comprehensive approach is warranted to assess supervised ML outcomes and forms the rationale for this study. This study aims to demonstrate how the item response theory (IRT) can be used to stratify the data based on how difficult each case is to classify, independent of the outcome measure of interest (eg, accuracy). This stratification allows the evaluation of ML classifiers to take the form of a distribution rather than a single scalar value. METHODS: Two large, public intensive care unit data sets, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and electronic intensive care unit, were used to showcase this method in predicting mortality. For each data set, a balanced sample (n=8078 and n=21,940, respectively) and an imbalanced sample (n=12,117 and n=32,910, respectively) were drawn. A 2-parameter logistic model was used to provide scores for each case. Several ML algorithms were used in the demonstration to classify cases based on their health-related features: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, naive Bayes, and a neural network. Generalized linear mixed model analyses were used to assess the effects of case difficulty strata, ML algorithm, and the interaction between them in predicting accuracy. RESULTS: The results showed significant effects (P<.001) for case difficulty strata, ML algorithm, and their interaction in predicting accuracy and illustrated that all classifiers performed better with easier-to-classify cases and that overall the neural network performed best. Significant interactions suggest that cases that fall in the most arduous strata should be handled by logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, or neural network but not by naive Bayes or K-nearest neighbors. Conventional metrics for ML classification have been reported for methodological comparison. CONCLUSIONS: This demonstration shows that using the IRT is a viable method for understanding the data that are provided to ML algorithms, independent of outcome measures, and highlights how well classifiers differentiate cases of varying difficulty. This method explains which features are indicative of healthy states and why. It enables end users to tailor the classifier that is appropriate to the difficulty level of the patient for personalized medicine.","output":"Using Item Response Theory for Explainable Machine Learning in Predicting Mortality in the Intensive Care Unit: Case-Based Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung diseases cause an enormous socioeconomic burden. Four of them are among the ten most important causes of deaths worldwide: Pneumonia has the highest death toll of all infectious diseases, lung cancer kills the most people of all malignant proliferative disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ranks third in mortality among the chronic noncommunicable diseases, and tuberculosis is still one of the most important chronic infectious diseases. Despite all efforts, for example, by the World Health Organization and clinical and experimental researchers, these diseases are still highly prevalent and harmful. This is in part due to the specific organization of tissue homeostasis, architecture, and immunity of the lung. Recently, several consortia have formed and aim to bring together clinical and molecular data from big cohorts of patients with lung diseases with novel experimental setups, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and mathematical modeling.

A retrospective study was conducted by identifying children admitted to a hospital with acute respiratory infections due to seven common viruses between January 2001 and December 2011. A total of 42,104 nasopharyngeal samples were tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses (IV-A and IV-B), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3), and adenovirus (ADV) by direct immunofluorescence assay. Meteorological data were obtained from Suzhou Weather Bureau. Correlations of viral prevalence with meteorological factors were evaluated using Spearman rank correlation and partial correlation. Multivariate time-series analysis including an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and generalized linear Poisson models was conducted to study the effect of meteorological factors on the prevalence of respiratory virus infection. RSV and IV-A activity showed distinctive winter peak, whereas PIV-3 and ADV peaked in the summer. Incidence of RSV was correlated with low environmental temperature, and PIV-3 only with high temperature. IV-A activity was correlated with both low temperature and high relative humidity. ADV activity was correlated with high total rainfall. In the ARIMA model, RSV-associated hospitalizations were predictable, and the monthly number of RSV cases decreased by 11.25 % (95 % CI: 5.34 % to 16.79 %) for every 1 C increase in the average temperature. Seasonality of certain respiratory virus may be explained by meteorological influences. The impact of meteorological factors on the prevalence of RSV may be useful for predicting the activity of this virus.","output":"Association of meteorological factors with childhood viral acute respiratory infections in subtropical China: an analysis over 11 years."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using two large-scale surveys among households, we examine the drivers of trust in banks, insurance companies, BigTechs, and other people in the United States and the Netherlands, and analyse whether the COVID-19 pandemic has affected public trust.

We explored the patients treated by thrombectomy to investigate the association between a favorable clinical outcome of EVMT in intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion (iICAO) and a set of predictors. METHODS A total of 38 iICAO patients treated by EVMTs were analyzed. Primary collateral grades (PCG) at baseline based on the integrity of Willis' circle were categorized into three degrees. The favorable outcomes, measured by modified Rankin scale (mRS), were defined as 2 at 90 days. The reperfusion was one of the most important confounders, defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI)  2b. The other risk factors included demographic characteristics, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, procedural EVMT, and PCG at baseline was adjusted to reveal the association with favorable outcomes. RESULTS Of 38 iICAO patients, 65.8% (25 in 38) achieved reperfusion. However, only 31.6% (12/38) achieved favorable outcomes at 90 days. With a PCG3, 61.5% of them achieved favorable outcomes, while only 37.5% of those with PCG2 and PCG1 achieved favorable outcomes (p = .003). In multivariable logistic regression, PCG was revealed as a predictor for favorable outcomes (OR 5.278, p = .019) after adjusting the reperfusion and other factors. CONCLUSIONS The PCG based on the integrity of Willis' circle might be an underlying predictor of the prognosis of AIS in patients with iICAO after EVMT. The function of intact anterior communicating artery (AcoA) and ipsilateral posterior communicating artery (PcoA) in favoring prognosis of the iICAO patients might need to be validation in future study.","output":"Collateral grade of the Willis' circle predicts outcomes of acute intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion before thrombectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common cause of hospital admissions, readmissions, and mortality worldwide. Digital health interventions (DHIs) that promote self-management, adherence to guideline-directed therapy, and cardiovascular risk reduction may improve health outcomes in this population. The \\"Corrie\\" DHI consists of a smartphone application, smartwatch, and wireless blood pressure monitor to support medication tracking, education, vital signs monitoring, and care coordination. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of this DHI plus standard of care in reducing 30-day readmissions among AMI patients in comparison to standard of care alone. METHODS A Markov model was used to explore cost-effectiveness from the hospital perspective. The time horizon of the analysis was 1 year, with 30-day cycles, using inflation-adjusted cost data with no discount rate. Currencies were quantified in US dollars, and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The results were interpreted as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Univariate sensitivity and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses tested model uncertainty. RESULTS The DHI reduced costs and increased QALYs on average, dominating standard of care in 99.7% of simulations in the probabilistic analysis. Based on the assumption that the DHI costs $2750 per patient, use of the DHI leads to a cost-savings of $7274 per patient compared with standard of care alone. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that this DHI is cost-saving through the reduction of risk for all-cause readmission following AMI.

Using administrative time-series data on mortality that varies by state, age, sex, and cause of death collected for the years 1979-2017, we find no relationship between unemployment and mortality on average. However, we observe beneficial health effects in economic downturns for young men aged 25 to 34 associated with a reduction in vehicle transport accidents.Our estimates imply 425 fewer deaths if Reserve Bank of Australia expectations of a doubling of unemployment rates are realized by the end of 2020. For the early 1980s, we also find a procyclical pattern in the mortality rates of infants. However, this pattern disappears starting from the mid-1980s, coincident with the full implementation of universal health care in Australia in 1984.

BAL outcomes include evidence of viral, bacterial, or fungal infection, presence of lipid laden macrophages, and cytology (eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes). Gastrointestinal outcomes include esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and pH impedance probe findings. Other characteristics include serum eosinophil, neutrophils, and lymphocytes; spirometry; FeNO; and IgE. RESULTS Seventy-two patients underwent BAL pepsin testing. Median age was 4.9 years, 30.6% had severe persistent asthma, and 59.2% were on reflux medication. There was an association between positive BAL pepsin assay and positive viral panel (p=0.002) or fungal culture (p=0.027). No significant association found between positive BAL bacterial culture; BAL cytology; presence of BAL lipid laden macrophages; IgE; spirometry; FeNO; CBC neutrophil, eosinophil, or lymphocytes; pH impedance testing parameters; or EGD pathology.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently included 'sudden loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and smell (anosmia/hyposmia)' as symptoms of COVID-19. If indeed these symptoms are reliable and specific forerunner symptoms of COVID-19, then it may facilitate detection and containment of the disease. Hence, we systematically evaluated the contemporary evidence on dysgeusia and anosmia as trigger prodromal symptoms, and their prevalence in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host and Web of Science databases were searched between 25 December 2019 and 30 May 2020. RESULTS: Of the 13 identified records, eight studies, totalling 11,054 COVID-19 patients, were included, as per the selection criteria. Eligible articles reflected research conducted mostly in the European community, as well as China, the US and Iran. In total, anosmia and dysgeusia symptoms were present in 74.9% and 81.3% ambulatory as well as hospitalized, mild-to-severe cases of COVID-19 patients, respectively.

Protection afforded by vaccination is frequently low. Methods: A patient cohort who had received bone marrow transplantation or CAR-T cells was studied following a 2-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination and compared to healthy vaccine recipients. Anti-Spike antibody and systemic innate responses were compared in the two vaccine cohorts. Findings: The patients had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibodies to the Wuhan strain, with proportional lower cross-recognition of Beta, Delta, and Omicron Spike-RBD proteins. Both cohorts neutralized WA1 and Delta but not Omicron. Vaccination elicited an innate cytokine signature featuring IFN-, IL-15 and IP-10/CXCL10, but most patients showed a diminished systemic cytokine response. In patients who failed to develop antibodies, the innate systemic was dominated by IL-8 and MIP-1a with significant attenuation in the IFN-, IL-15 and IP-10/CXCL10 signature response. Changes in IFN- and and IP-10/CXCL10 at priming vaccination and IFN-, IL-15, IL-7 and IL-10 upon booster vaccination correlated with the Spike antibody magnitude and were predictive of successful antibody development. Interpretation: These data identified a cytokine hub featuring IFN-, IL-15 and IP-10/CXCL10 characterizing a response to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. These data identify a cytokine signature as correlating with successful antibody development in patients with hematological disease treated with cell therapies. These approaches provide a tool to connect innate signatures associated with protective adaptive responses to vaccines.

So far, the only approved drug for these disorders is the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) falls short of being curative. The efficacy of HU in the management of thalassemia and SCD is generally attributed to its limited ability to boost the levels of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F,2?2), which decreases sickling by interfering with the polymerization of hemoglobin in patients with SCD and can partially correct the globin chain imbalance in ?-thalassemia patients, while at the same time facilitating O2 transport to myoglobin in peripheral tissues. The naturally occurring dietary polyphenol resveratrol (trans-3?5'4-trihydroxystilbene, RV), has also been postulated to induce Hb F production via a biochemical mechanism like HU. Preclinical studies using the human erythroleukemic K562 cell line suggested RV can induce Hb F production in a more robust manner than HU. However, clinical studies on the efficacy and effectiveness of RV are limited and conflicting. This study sought to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of RV in managing SCD compared to HU. A systematic literature review was conducted in peer-reviewed, published full-text articles investigating RV in the management of SCD. Eligible studies were required to report explicitly, including participants diagnosed with ?-thalassemia or SCD anemia or cultured cells with the SCD or thalassemia disease and where HU was included as a control. The analysis included thalassemia, RV type, RV dosage, duration of treatment, and outcome, Hb F induction and antioxidant activity. Additionally, a pilot study of RV in the management of adults with SCD who received treatment at National Hospital Abuja, Nigeria, was attempted but discontinued due to the COVID 19 pandemic. A case study of a single 23-year-old female SCD patient who had been taking RV [1000mg daily p.o.] for more than 6 years was included. Outcome variables evaluated include number of hospitalization episodes of pain crisis, need for blood transfusion, possible side effects and RBC indices. The early results of this metanalysis show that RV was as effective as HU in inducing production of Hb F in adult SCD patients and reducing hospital treatment days post RV treatment. Four primary treatment and curative therapies that have shown great potential and are currently used to prevent and treat acute and chronic complications in SCD, HU and blood transfusions, are the most well-established disease-modifying therapies used to prevent and treat complications associated with SCD. Other lesser used therapies include stem cell transplantation or the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), and the investigational gene therapy is the only known curative therapy that exists regarding SCD. The results of this study indicate that RV is an effective inducer of Hb F production in adults and shows promise as a cost effective and useful adjunct for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies including SCD and thalassemia.","output":"Use of trans-35'4-trihydroxystilbene (Resveratrol) as an adjunct in the treatment of Sickle Cell Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Given the high risk of COVID\\\\19 mortality, patients with cancer may be vulnerable to fear of COVID\\\\19, adverse psychological outcomes, and health care delays.

Respondents with more fear of COVID\\\\19 had a higher mean psychological distress score (10.21; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 9.38C11.03) compared to respondents with less fear (7.55; 95% CI 6.75C8.36). Additionally, 47% reported delaying care. Respondents with more fear of COVID\\\\19 had higher percentages of delayed care than those with less (56; 95% CI 39%C72% vs. 44%; 95% CI 28%C61%). These relationships persisted throughout the pandemic. For respondents with a COVID\\\\19 diagnosis in their household (n = 116), distress scores were similar despite higher delays in care (58% vs. 27%) than those without COVID\\\\19. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of COVID\\\\19 is linked to psychological distress and delays in care among patients with cancer. Furthermore, those who are personally impacted see exacerbated cancer care delays. Timely psychosocial support and health care coordination are critical to meet increased care needs of patients with cancer during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.","output":"Examining the association among fear of COVID\\\\19, psychological distress, and delays in cancer care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On March 9(th), 2020, the Italian government decided to go into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to changes in the workflow of radiological examinations. AIMS: Aim of the study is to illustrate how the workload and outcome of radiological exams changed in a community hospital during the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The exams performed in the radiology department from March 9(th) to March 29(th), 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and compared to the exams conducted during the same time-period in 2019. Only exams coming from the emergency department (ED) were included. Two radiologists defined the cases as positive or negative findings, based on independent blind readings of the imaging studies. Categorical measurements are presented as frequency and percentages, and p-values are calculated using the Chi-squared test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant reduction in the amount of exams performed in 2020: there were 143 (93|65% male, 60.721.5 years) patients who underwent radiological examinations from the ED vs. 485 (255|53% male, 51.224.8 years) in 2019. Furthermore, the total number of ED exams dropped from 699 (2019) to 215 (2020). However, the percentage of patients with a positive result was significantly higher in 2020 (69|48%) compared to 2019 (151|31%) (p<.001). The reduction of emergency radiological examinations might be a result of the movement restrictions enforced during the lockdown, and possible fear of the hospital as a contagious place. This translated to a relative increase of positive cases as only patients with very serious conditions were accessing the ED.

To investigate potential pathways to misdiagnosis, we interviewed 28 HIV testers in Zimbabwe and conducted weeklong observations at four testing facilities. Approaching adherence to national HIV testing algorithms as a social and scripted practice, dependent on the integration of certain competences, materials and meanings, our thematic analysis revealed three underlying causes of misdiagnosis: One, a lack of confidence in using certain test-kits, coupled with changes in testing algorithms and inadequate training, fed uncertainties with some testing practices. Two, difficult work conditions, including high workloads and resource-depleted facilities, compounded these uncertainties, and meant testers got distracted or resorted to testing short-cuts. Three, power struggles between HIV testers, and specific client-tester encounters created social interactions that challenged the testing process. We conclude that these contexts contribute to deviances from official and recommended testing procedures, as well as testing and interpretation biases, which may explain cases of misdiagnoses. We caution against user-error explanations to misdiagnosis in the absence of a broader recognition of how broader structural determinants affect HIV testing practices.","output":"Uncertainties, work conditions and testing biases: Potential pathways to misdiagnosis in point-of-care rapid HIV testing in Zimbabwe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To study the transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among 101 confirmed cases and their 387 household contacts and to determine risk factors associated with secondary attack among the household contacts.

By adopting a meso and macro perspective, we interviewed senior planning officers from eight health and social care partnership areas in Scotland and key actors in national agencies. The findings suggest that an overly complex Scottish governance landscape undermines the sustainability of co-production efforts. As part of a COVID-19 recovery, both the implementation of meaningful co-production and coordinated leadership for health and social care in Scotland need to be addressed, as should the development of evaluation capacities of those working across health and social care boundaries so that co-production can be evaluated and report to inform the future of the integration agenda.","output":"The Leadership of Co-Production in Health and Social Care Integration in Scotland: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes acute, highly transmissible respiratory infection in both humans and wide range of animal species. Its rapid spread globally and devasting effects have resulted into a major public health emergency prompting the need for methodological interventions to understand and control its spread. In particular, The ability to effectively retrace its transmission pathways in outbreaks remains a major challenge. This is further exacerbated by our limited understanding of its underlying evolutionary mechanism. Using NGS whole-genome data, we determined whether inter- and intra-host diversity coupled with bottleneck analysis can retrace the pathway of viral transmission in two epidemiologically well characterised nosocomial outbreaks in healthcare settings supported by phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, we assessed the mutational landscape, selection pressure and diversity of the identified variants. Our findings showed evidence of intrahost variant transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 after infection These observations were consistent with the results from the bottleneck analysis suggesting that certain intrahost variants in this study could have been transmitted to recipients. In both outbreaks, we observed iSNVs and SNVs shared by putative source-recipients pairs. Majority of the observed iSNVs were positioned in the S and ORF1ab region. AG, CT and TC nucleotide changes were enriched across SARS-COV-2 genome. Moreover, SARS-COV-2 genome had limited diversity in some loci while being highly conserved in others. Overall, Our findings show that the synergistic effect of combining withinhost diversity and bottleneck estimations greatly enhances resolution of transmission events in Sars-Cov-2 outbreaks. They also provide insight into the genome diversity suggesting purifying selection may be involved in the transmission.

SUBJECT DESIGN AND METHODS: The principles of qualitative description guided all sampling, data collection and analysis decisions. Data collection involved in-depth semi-structured interviews with 12 sexual health managers and/or supervisors from ten Ontario public health units. Directed content analysis was used to code and synthesize the data. Data collection and analysis was guided using constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. RESULTS: Factors that served as either barriers and facilitators to implementing a population health approach, were mainly in the inner and outer setting domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Participants identified the presence of community partnerships, adequate staff training on population health, and access to data on population health served as facilitators. In comparison, barriers to implementation included a lack of resources (human, financial) and clinicians value of and preferences for delivering services at the individual clinic level.

Among the restrictive measures, air traffic suspension is certainly quite effective in reducing the mobility on the global scale in the short term but it also has high socio-economic impact on the long and short term. The main focus of this study is to collect and prepare data on air passengers traffic worldwide with the scope of analyze the impact of travel ban on the aviation sector.

Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to these hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41-1.67% and job losses may reach the value of 25-30 millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66-1.98% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios.

However, information regarding the pathological roles and potential transmission to other felids is limited. In this article, we describe the identification of FeMV in 2 black leopards (Panthera pardus) in Thailand that showed severe azotemia and tubulointerstitial nephritis.

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses using polyclonal IgG antibodies against the FeMV matrix (M) protein showed FeMV-M antigen in renal tubular epithelial cells. These analyses also showed infiltrating lymphocytes in the renal parenchymal lesions and in the cytoplasm of lymphoid cells residing in the spleen, suggesting viral tropism and a possible pathological role.

The method also includes a target to a conserved region of the eukaryotic mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA gene to assess suitability of extracted DNA and a plasmid-based internal control to detect failure of PCR due to inhibition. This method was optimized and validated to detect Brucella spp. in multiple sample matrices, including fresh or frozen tissue, blood, and feces. The analytical limit of detection was low, with 95% amplification at 24 fg, or an estimated 7 bacterial genomic copies. When Brucella spp. were experimentally added to tissue or fecal homogenates, the assay detected an estimated 1-5 bacteria/l. An experiment simulating tissue autolysis showed relative persistence of bacterial DNA compared to host mitochondrial DNA. When used to screen 1,658 field-collected marine mammal tissues in comparison to microbial culture, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 70.4% and 98.3%, respectively.

To describe the incidence and nature of co-infection in critically ill adults with COVID-19 infection in England.Methodology. A retrospective cohort study of adults with COVID-19 admitted to seven intensive care units (ICUs) in England up to 18 May 2020, was performed. Patients with completed ICU stays were included. The proportion and type of organisms were determined at <48 and >48 h following hospital admission, corresponding to community and hospital-acquired co-infections.Results. Of 254 patients studied (median age 59 years (IQR 49-69); 64.6a% male), 139 clinically significant organisms were identified from 83 (32.7a%) patients. Bacterial co-infections/ co-colonisation were identified within 48 h of admission in 14 (5.5a%) patients; the commonest pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (four patients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (two patients). The proportion of pathogens detected increased with duration of ICU stay, consisting largely of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.

Interactive feedback-based virtual reality (VR) has recently moved to the forefront of spine surgery training, with most commercial products focusing on instrumentation. There is a paucity of learning tools directed at decompression principles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of VR simulation and its educational role in learning spinal anatomy and decompressive techniques. METHODS: A VR simulation module was created with custom-developed software. Orthopaedic and neurosurgical trainees were prospectively enrolled and interacted with patient-specific 3D models of lumbar spinal stenosis while wearing a headset. A surgical toolkit allowed users to perform surgical decompression, specifically removing soft tissues and bone. The module allowed users to perform various techniques in posterior decompressions and comprehend anatomic areas of stenosis. Pre- and post-module testing, and utility questionnaires were administered to provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the module as a learning device. RESULTS: 28 trainees were enrolled (20-orthopaedic, 8-neurosurgery) in the study. Pre-test scores on anatomic knowledge progressively improved and showed strong positive correlation with year-in-training (Pearson's r = 0.79). Following simulation, the average improvement in post-test scores was 11.4% in junior trainees (PGYI-III), and 1.0% in senior trainees (PGYIII-Fellows). Knowledge improvement approached statistical significance amongst junior trainees (p = 0.0542). 89% of participants found the VR module useful in understanding and learning the pathology of spinal stenosis. 71% found it useful in comprehending decompressive techniques. 96% believed it had utility in preoperative planning with patient-specific models.

Several cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented 48C142 days after the initial infection and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than 1 year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore potential immunity dynamics using contact data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalized individuals, a year for hospitalized individuals, and the effective reproduction number after lockdown ends is 1.2 (our worst-case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 387 000 infectious individuals and 125 000 daily new cases; threefold greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggest that longitudinal serological surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes place from the end of the lockdown in June until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary wave. Overall, our analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection as immunity to reinfection is not permanent.

METHODS Medical records of 42 consecutive eyes of 34 patients diagnosed with OAG who underwent MLT were retrospectively reviewed. The effectiveness was determined using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Failure was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction of <20% from baseline, an IOP >21 mm Hg during two consecutive follow-up visits, or surgical intervention for OAG. To determine the impact of MLT surgical expertise on clinical effectiveness, the eyes were divided into two groups according to whether the procedure was conducted by an experienced specialist (defined as a glaucoma specialist who had conducted at least ten MLT procedures) or a less experienced glaucoma specialist. The difference in expertise was determined using a log-rank test. RESULTS MLT was conducted by three glaucoma specialists. The overall survival rates were 0.76, 0.48, and 0.44 at 1, 3, and 6mo, respectively. The survival rates for MLT performed by a less experienced glaucoma specialist were 0.62, 0.31, and 0.25 (n=21 eyes) at 1, 3, and 6mo, respectively, whereas the survival rates for MLT performed by an experienced glaucoma specialist were 0.90, 0.64, and 0.64 (n=21 eyes) at 1, 3, and 6mo, respectively. The log-rank test showed a significant difference in the survival curves of the two groups (P=0.0061).

METHODS: We were tasked to construct and evaluate COVID-19 driven predictive models to identify possible planning and resource utilisation scenarios. We used system dynamics to derive a series of chain susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) models. We then built a discrete event simulation using the system dynamics output and bootstrapped electronic medical record data to approximate the weekly effect of tuning surgical volume on hospital census. We evaluated performance via a model fit assessment and cross-model comparison. RESULTS: We outlined the design and implementation of predictive models to support management decision making around areas impacted by COVID-19. The fit assessments indicated the models were most useful after 30 days from onset of local cases. We found our subreports were most accurate up to 7 days after model run.DiscusssionOur model allowed us to shape our health system's executive policy response to implement a 'hospital within a hospital'-one for patients with COVID-19 within a hospital able to care for the regular non-COVID-19 population.

Their protective capacity largely depends on the fraction of these that are filtered from the incoming air volume. While the performance and physics of different filter materials have been the topic of intensive study, less well understood are the effects of mask sealing. To address this, we introduce an approach to calculate the influence of face-seal leakage on filtration ratio and fit factor based on an analytical model and a finite element method (FEM) model, both of which take into account time-dependent human respiration velocities. Using these, we calculate the filtration ratio and fit factor for a range of ventilation resistance values relevant to filter materials, 500-2500 Paasam-1, where the filtration ratio and fit factor are calculated as a function of the mask gap dimensions, with good agreement between analytical and numerical models. The results show that the filtration ratio and fit factor are decrease markedly with even small increases in gap area. We also calculate particle filtration rates for N95 FFRs with various ventilation resistances and two commercial FFRs exemplars. Taken together, this work underscores the critical importance of forming a tight seal around the face as a factor in mask performance, where our straightforward analytical model can be readily applied to obtain estimates of mask performance.","output":"The critical importance of mask seals on respirator performance: An analytical and simulation approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is currently ravaging the world, and the United States has been largely unsuccessful at containing the coronavirus. One long-standing policy failure stands out as having exacerbated the pandemic in our country: the lack of a national mandate of paid sick leaves, without which workers face financial and workplace-cultural pressures to attend work while sick, thus spreading the virus to their fellow employees and the public at large.This Article provides the blueprint for a national, subsidized mandate of paid sick leaves and two additional insights about our tax institutions as mechanisms of effectuating broader societal goals. It first justifies a paid-sick-leave mandate on the grounds of market failures (both cognitive biases and externalities) and workplace equality. It also argues for the need of subsidies in order to protect lower-income workers from unemployment risks imposed by a national mandate. Second, the Article critically assesses the current federal legislative approach utilized in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). The Article then proposes designing a national employer mandate of paid sick leaves funded by general-revenue business tax credits and providing partial wage replacement.This Articles discussion of paid sick leaves yields two insights about our tax institutions. First, it questions the role of payroll taxes, which are highly regressive, impose burdens almost exclusively on labor, and are normatively unjustified when the spending funded by payroll taxes benefits the broader non-wage-earning public. Second, the Article reveals the malleability of tax institutions with respect to funding, administrability, and costs.

To monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota, we developed a federated data network in March 2020 using electronic health record (EHR) data from 8 multispecialty health systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this serial cross-sectional study, we examined patients of all ages who received a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test, had symptoms of a viral illness, or received an influenza test from January 3, 2016, through November 7, 2020. We evaluated COVID-19 testing rates among patients with symptoms of viral illness and percentage positivity among all patients tested, in aggregate and by zip code. We stratified results by patient and area-level characteristics. RESULTS: Cumulative COVID-19 positivity rates were similar for people aged 12-64 years (range, 15.1%-17.6%) but lower for adults aged 65 years (range, 9.3%-10.7%). We found notable racial and ethnic disparities in positivity rates early in the pandemic, whereas COVID-19 positivity was similarly elevated across most racial and ethnic groups by the end of 2020. Positivity rates remained substantially higher among Hispanic patients compared with other racial and ethnic groups throughout the study period. We found similar trends across area-level income and rurality, with disparities early in the pandemic converging over time.

Mothers knowledge can be considered as an important factor when determining childcare, as they are often the primary decision maker for their childrens healthcare issues. This study aimed to assess the level of mothers knowledge and practice on certain aspects of vaccination for their child/children in Greece. METHODS: This was an online cross-sectional survey, which collected information about mothers socio-demographic characteristics, vaccination-related information, and vaccine knowledge using a self-administered questionnaire. The survey was conducted between April 2020 and June 2020 and the study population included mothers over 18 years old with at least one child (< 18 years old), living in four broad geographical areas of Greece (Attica, Central Greece, North Greece, and Crete/Aegean Islands). RESULTS: A total of 1885 Greek mothers participated in the study. The majority stated that they vaccined their child/children (98%), and the most popular source of information about vaccination was their childs pediatrician (89%). About half of participants (52%) have delayed their child/children vaccination with their pediatricians suggestion being the main driver. The median knowledge score was 11 which indicates a high knowledge level for childhood vaccination among Greek mothers. Multiple linear regression analysis identified an inverse association between education and knowledge score, characterized by higher knowledge scores among individuals with secondary and even higher among those with higher education. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the strict adherence to the prescribed dosage as indicated by the local recommendations for each vaccine, was associated with most of the knowledge items included in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the vast majority of mothers in Greece did vaccinate their child/children, while pediatricians appear to have a very influential role in mothers decision making. High knowledge around vaccination was associated with mothers educational attainment, being particularly high among those who completed higher education. Considerable attention is required from public health authorities to promote vaccination through educational programs and campaigns, particularly aimed at people with lower educational attainment. Additionally, improving communication between pediatricians and mothers to reach those women who have not decided to vaccinate or delayed vaccination for their children, may prove to be very beneficial.

This diagnosis is challenging as most of the patients having COVID-19 infection stay asymptomatic while others showing symptoms are hard to distinguish from patients having different respiratory infections such as severe flu and Pneumonia. Due to cost and time-consuming wet-lab diagnostic tests for COVID-19, there is an utmost requirement for some alternate, non-invasive, rapid, and discounted automatic screening system. A chest CT scan can effectively be used as an alternative modality to detect and diagnose the COVID-19 infection. In this study, we present an automatic COVID-19 diagnostic and severity prediction system called COVIDC (COVID-19 detection using CT scans) that uses deep feature maps from the chest CT scans for this purpose. Our newly proposed system not only detects COVID-19 but also predicts its severity by using a two-phase classification approach (COVID vs non-COVID, and COVID-19 severity) with deep feature maps and different shallow supervised classification algorithms such as SVMs and random forest to handle data scarcity. We performed a stringent COVIDC performance evaluation not only through 10-fold cross-validation and an external validation dataset but also in a real setting under the supervision of an experienced radiologist. In all the evaluation settings, COVIDC outperformed all the existing state-of-the-art methods designed to detect COVID-19 with an F1 score of 0.94 on the validation dataset and justified its use to diagnose COVID-19 effectively in the real setting by classifying correctly 9 out of 10 COVID-19 CT scans.

METHOD: Multicenter, prospective cohort study, conducted in 17 pediatric intensive care units in five states in Brazil, from March to July 2020. Patients from 1 month to 19 years who met the MIS-C diagnostic criteria were included consecutively. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were included, with the following conditions: Kawasaki-like disease (n = 26), incomplete Kawasaki disease (n = 16), acute cardiac dysfunction (n = 10), toxic shock syndrome (n = 3), and macrophage activation syndrome (n = 1). Median age was 6.2 years (IQR 2.4-10.3), 70% were boys, 59% were non-whites, 20% had comorbidities, 48% reported a contact with COVID-19 cases, and 55% had a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR and/or serology. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 71%, shock symptoms in 59%, and severe respiratory symptoms in less than 20%. D-dimer was increased in 80% and cardiac dysfunction markers in more than 75%. Treatment included immunoglobulin (89%); corticosteroids, antibiotics, and enoxaparin in about 50%; and oseltamivir and antifungal therapy in less than 10%. Only 11% needed invasive mechanical ventilation, with a median duration of five days (IQR 5-6.5). The median length of PICU stay was six days (IQR 5-11), and one death occurred (1.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Most characteristics of the present MIS-C patients were similar to that of other cohorts. The present results may contribute to a broader understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and its short-term consequences.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illustrated this invisibility: only after summer 2020 it became clear that CKD was a major driver of COVID-19 mortality, both in terms of prevalence as a risk factor and of the risk conferred for lethal COVID-19. However, by that time the damage was done: news outlets and scientific publications continued to list diabetes and hypertension, but not CKD, as major risk factors for severe COVID-19. In a shocking recent example from Sweden, CKD was found to be diagnosed in just 23% of 57880 persons which fulfilled diagnostic criteria for CKD. In the very same large cohort, diabetes or cancer were diagnosed in 29% of persons, hypertension in 82%, cardiovascular disease in 39% and heart failure in 28%. Thus, from the point of view of physicians, patients and health authorities, CKD was the least common comorbidity in persons with CKD, ranking sixth, after other better-known conditions. One consequences of this lack of awareness, was that nephrotoxic medications were more commonly prescribed in patients with CKD that did not have a diagnosis of CKD.

In this paper, we extract and study the opinion of people from the top five worst affected countries by the virus, namely USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and South Africa. We propose a deep language-independent Multilevel Attention-based Conv-BiGRU network (MACBiG-Net), which includes embedding layer, word-level encoded attention, and sentence-level encoded attention mechanism to extract the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. The embedding layer encodes the sentence sequence into a real-valued vector. The word-level and sentence-level encoding is performed by a 1D Conv-BiGRU based mechanism, followed by word-level and sentence-level attention, respectively.

Preliminary data suggest that the efficacy of rTMS is reduced in patients taking benzodiazepines (BZD). Here, we use real-world data from a large sample to investigate the influence of lorazepam on the effectiveness of rTMS. METHODS From a retrospective cohort of clinically depressed patients that were treated with rTMS, we compared 176 patients not taking any BZD with 73 patients taking lorazepam with respect to changes in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRDS). RESULTS Both groups improved during rTMS according to HRDS scores, but the amelioration of symptoms was significantly less pronounced in patients taking lorazepam (18% vs. 38% responders in the non-lorazepam group). We could not see any association of intake regimen of lorazepam with response in rTMS. CONCLUSION Our observational study suggests that intake of lorazepam impedes the response to rTMS. The impact of lorazepam and other BZD on rTMS should receive more attention and be further investigated in prospective, hypothesis-based treatment studies to determine causal relationships between medication treatments and outcome.

In this process, a new type of body C the risky mobile body C is produced. At the same time, these measures run into problems due to the volatile nature of knowledge about bodies and diseases that they rely on.

Faster transmission rate and genetic modifications have provoked scientists to search for an immediate solution.

This paper highlights the different stages of viral-mediated inflammatory responses in the host respiratory system. Previously, known anti-inflammatory drugs and therapeutic strategies that might show potential in controlling the CS of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is also mentioned in this study. Our critical analysis provides insights into the inflammation cycle induced in the lungs by early virus replication, downregulation and shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and in the CS production. Identification of suitable targets within the inflammatory pathways for devising the therapeutic strategies useful in controlling the prognosis of COVID-19 finds a special mention in this article. However, antibody-dependent enhancement is the key aspect to consider before testing any drug/compound for therapeutic purposes.

To help clinicians in the rapid triage of patients at high risk of COVID-19 while waiting for RT-PCR results, different diagnostic prediction models have been developed. Our objective is to identify, compare, and evaluate performances of prediction models for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in adult patients in a health care setting. METHODS: A search for relevant references has been conducted on the MEDLINE and Scopus databases. Rigorous eligibility criteria have been established (e.g., adult participants, suspicion of COVID-19, medical setting) and applied by two independent investigators to identify suitable studies at 2 different stages: (1) titles and abstracts screening and (2) full-texts screening. Risk of bias (RoB) has been assessed using the Prediction model study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Data synthesis has been presented according to a narrative report of findings. RESULTS: Out of the 2334 references identified by the literature search, 13 articles have been included in our systematic review. The studies, carried out all over the world, were performed in 2020. The included articles proposed a model developed using different methods, namely, logistic regression, score, machine learning, XGBoost.

Variables with p-value < 0.25 in the bivariate logistic regression analysis were entered into the multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: This study involved 408 students with response rate of 96.6%. The levels of good knowledge, positive attitude and good practice towards COVID-19 were 69.6%, 56.6% and 65% respectively. After adjusting for covariates, being in the late adolescent age group (16C20), living with > 5 family size, and being single were predictors of knowledge level. Besides, being single, attending diploma (TVET) level trainings, and being year-two students were predictors of attitude levels. Similarly, urban residence, being regular students, and being year-one students were the independent predictors of practice level of students. CONCLUSION: In this study, only two-third of the students had good preventive practice level towards COVID-19, which is below the Organization's recommendation. Thus, the national, regional and local governments should develop effective and inclusive prevention strategies to address students who are at home due to COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Preventive Practice and Associated Factors towards COVID-19 among College Students in Amhara Region, Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The outbreak of COVID-19 has different effects on people's psychological and social aspects This study aimed to investigate the relationship between anxiety, self-compassion, and gender differences with self-care behaviors and fear of COVID-19 in Kermanshah Method: In the cross-sectional study, 403 people answered online questions on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) Scale, Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), and a questionnaire focusing on COVID-19-related behavior Pearson correlation coefficient and regression analysis were used for data analysis Results: There was a significant relationship between social distance and gender, and people who observed social distancing reported higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (p 0 05) There was a significant difference between those who answered yes to self-care behaviours related to washing and those who answered no in terms of variables of fear of COVID-19, the overall score of compassion, and subscales of compassion, including self-kindness and isolation (p &lt; 0 05) In relation to fear of COVID-19, married status, anxiety, and common humanity had a positive relationship with fear of COVID-19 However, self-judgment was negatively related to fear of COVID-19 (p &lt; 0 05) Conclusion: According to the findings of the present study, men and people who are less afraid of COVID-19 are more likely not to observe self-care behaviors Therefore, providing training about treatment protocols is necessary for these people To reduce the fear of this disease in people with high levels of fear, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other medical staff can implement protocols to increase compassion","output":"Anxiety, self-compassion, gender differences and COVID-19: Predicting self-care behaviors and fear of COVID-19 based on anxiety and self-compassion with an emphasis on gender differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Lung age estimation is a useful approach to determine pulmonary pathologies.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of NCDs in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico and analyze the increased risk due to comorbidities and risk factors on hospitalization, utilization of intensive care units and death. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 212,802 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by the Ministry of Health up to June 27, 2020. Odds ratios were performed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: Up to 47.40% of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were also reported with a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most frequent (20.12%). The report of at least one NCD significantly increased the risk of death with respect to patients without such diagnoses. Chronic kidney disease increased the risk of death the most (OR 2.31), followed by diabetes (OR 1.69), immunosuppression (OR 1.62), obesity (OR 1.42), hypertension (OR 1.24), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.20). The comorbidities that most increased the risk of ICU and of intubation were diabetes, immunosuppression and obesity. CONCLUSION: NCD comorbidities increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Given high NCD prevalence rates among the Mexican population, the pandemic poses a special threat to the health system and to society.

IL-35 is a newly identified IL-12 cytokine family member that plays an important protective role in a variety of immune system diseases by regulating Treg cell differentiation; however, the role of IL-35 in the pathogenesis of ARDS is still unclear. Here, we found that IL-35 was significantly elevated in adult patients with ARDS compared to controls. Additionally, IL-35 was positively and significantly correlated with IL-6, IL-10 and the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) but negatively correlated with TNF-, IL-1 and APACHE II score during ARDS. Moreover, the proportion of Treg/CD4(+) cells in the peripheral blood of ARDS patients and the expression of NF-B in PMBCs were significantly higher than in healthy individuals. Recombinant IL-35 improved survival in a murine model of CLP-induced ARDS. Additionally, IL-35 administration decreased the inflammatory response, as reflected by lower levels of cytokines (including IL-2, TNF-, IL-1 and IL-6) and less lung damage in CLP-induced ARDS.

However, a few studies involving anti-inflammatory activity and the mechanism of NZD have also been reported. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of NZD are illustrated. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that NZD suppresses LPS-induced inflammation by targeting the NF-B pathway in RAW264.7 cells. METHODS: LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells were employed to detect the effect of NZD on the release of cytokines by ELISA. Protein expression levels of related molecular markers were quantitated by western blot analysis. The levels of ROS, NO, and Ca(2+) were detected by flow cytometry. The changes in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were observed and verified by fluorescence microscopy. Using immunofluorescence assay, the translocation of NF-B/p65 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus was determined by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: NZD exhibited anti-inflammatory activity and reduced the release of inflammatory cytokines such as nitrite, TNF-, and IL-6. NZD suppressed the expression of the phosphorylated proteins like IKK/, IB, and p65. Besides, the flow cytometry results indicated that NZD inhibited the levels of ROS, NO, and Ca(2+) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. JC-1 assay data showed that NZD reversed LPS-induced MMP loss.

Abnormalities in the alveolar surfactant system have long been implicated in the pathogenetic sequelae of this life-threatening syndrome. This hypothesis is supported by similarities in pulmonary failure between patients with ARDS and preterm babies with infant respiratory distress syndrome, known to be triggered primarily by lack of surfactant material. Mechanisms of surfactant alterations in ARDS include: (a) lack of surface-active compounds (phospholipids, apoproteins) due to reduced generation/release by diseased pneumocytes or to increased loss of material (this feature includes changes in the relative composition of the surfactant phospholipid and/or apoprotein profiles); (b) inhibition of surfactant function by plasma protein leakage (inhibitory potencies of different plasma proteins have been defined); (c) incorporation of surfactant phospholipids and apoproteins into polymerizing fibrin upon hyaline membrane formation; and (d) damage/inhibition of surfactant compounds by inflammatory mediators (proteases, oxidants, nonsurfactant lipids). Alterations in alveolar surfactant function may well contribute to a variety of pathophysiological key events encountered in ARDS. These include decrease in compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatch including shunt flow due to altered gas flow distribution (atelectasis, partial alveolar collapse, small airway collapse), and lung edema formation. Moreover, more speculative at the present time, surfactant abnormalities may add to a reduction in alveolar host defense competence and an upregulation of inflammatory events under conditions of ARDS. Persistent atelectasis of surfactant-deficient and in particular fibrin-loaded alveoli may represent a key event to trigger fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis in late ARDS (collapse induration). Overall, the presently available data on surfactant abnormalities in ARDS lend credit to therapeutic trials with transbronchial surfactant administration. In addition to the classical goals of replacement therapy defined for preterm infants (rapid improvement in lung compliance and gas exchange), this approach will have to consider its impact on host defense competence and inflammatory and proliferative processes when applied in adults with respiratory failure.","output":"Alveolar surfactant and adult respiratory distress syndrome: Pathogenetic role and therapeutic prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The U.S. is the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Unlike most respiratory viruses, MeV does not infect the airway epithelium immediately. MeV traverses the epithelium within immune cells that carry it to lymphatic organs where amplification occurs. Infected immune cells then synchronously deliver large amounts of virus to the airways. However, our understanding of MeV replication in airway epithelia is limited. To model it, we use well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAE) from lung donors. In HAE, MeV spreads directly cell-to-cell forming infectious centers that grow for 3-5 days, are stable for a few days, and then disappear. Transepithelial electrical resistance remains intact during the entire course of HAE infection, thus we hypothesized that MeV infectious centers may slough off while preserving epithelial function. After documenting by confocal microscopy that infectious centers progressively detach from HAE, we recovered apical washes and separated cell-associated from cell-free virus by centrifugation. Virus titers were about 10 times higher in the cell-associated fraction than in the supernatant. In sloughed infectious centers, ciliary beating persisted and apoptotic markers were not readily detected, suggesting that they retain functional metabolism. Cell-associated MeV infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, modeling the first stage of infection in a new host. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified wound healing, cell growth, and cell differentiation as biological processes relevant for infectious center sloughing. 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining located proliferating cells underneath infectious centers. Thus, cells located below infectious centers divide and differentiate to repair the extruded infected epithelial patch. As an extension of these studies, we postulate that expulsion of infectious centers through coughing and sneezing could contribute to MeVs strikingly high reproductive number by allowing the virus to survive longer in the environment and by delivering a high infectious dose to the next host. AUTHOR SUMMARY Measles virus (MeV) is a respiratory pathogen that infects millions worldwide each year. Although sometimes mischaracterized as an innocuous childhood disease, measles remains a leading cause of death for children under five. MeV is the most contagious human virus and requires vaccination rates above 90% to maintain herd immunity. Global decreases in vaccination rates over the past ten years contributed to recent, widespread MeV outbreaks. We uncover here a novel mechanism by which MeV exits the human airways that may explain why it is much more contagious than other viruses. We document that infected cells containing cell-associated virus slough en masse from the airway epithelial sheet. These expelled infectious centers are metabolically active and can transmit infection to primary human monocyte-derived macrophages more efficiently than cell-free virus particles. Thus, cell-associated MeV can transmit host-to-host, a new paradigm for efficient respiratory virus transmission.","output":"Measles virus exits human airway epithelia via infectious center sloughing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Normal cytology, abnormal and atypical cells, non-cellular components, and infectious cell changes are largely described together with benign, malignant, and neuroendocrine lesions regarding exfoliative and aspiration cytology of the lung.

Objective: To determine whether a machine learning model can detect SARS-CoV-2 infection from physiological metrics collected from wearable devices. Design: A multicenter observational study enrolling health care workers with remote follow-up. Setting: Seven hospitals from the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City Participants: Eligibility criteria included health care workers who were 18 years of age or older, employees of one of the participating hospitals, with at least an iPhone series 6, and willing to wear an Apple Watch Series 4 or higher. We excluded participants with underlying autoimmune/inflammatory diseases, and medications known to interfere with autonomic function. We enrolled participants between April 29th, 2020, and March 2nd, 2021, and followed them for a median of 73 days (range, 3-253 days). Participants provided patient-reported outcome measures through a custom smartphone application and wore an Apple Watch, collecting heart rate variability and heart rate data, throughout the follow-up period.

Total need was highest for distance glasses [3.7% (95% CI 2.8-4.7) India; 0.8% (95% CI 0.5-1.1), Cameroon] and lowest for wheelchairs (0.1% both settings; 95% CI 0.03-0.3 India, 95% CI 0.04-0.3 Cameroon). Coverage for each AP was below 40%, except for distance glasses in India, where it was 87% (95% CI 77.1-93.0). The agreement between self-report and clinical impairment assessment of AP need was poor. For instance, in India, 60% of people identified through clinical assessment as needing distance glasses did not self-report a need. Conversely, in India, 75% of people who self-reported needing distance glasses did not require one based on clinical impairment assessment. CONCLUSIONS There is high need and low supply of three APs in two low-and middle-income settings. Methodological shortcomings highlight the need for improved survey methods compatible with the international classification of functioning, disability and health to estimate population-level need for AP and related services to inform advocacy and planning.","output":"Estimating assistive product need in Cameroon and India: results of population-based surveys and comparison of self-report and clinical impairment assessment approaches."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: During the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Health Care Workers (HCWs) have experienced an unexpected increase in workload which leads to feelings of uncertainty, anxiety, and isolation Furthermore, they are more vulnerable to contract the infection and transmit it to their family and colleagues Aim: To evaluate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on doctors life in term of personal and professional changes Materials and Methods: The present observational, cross-sectional study was conducted on doctors in various institutes of Udaipur, Rajasthan, India The study comprised an online questionnaire survey which consisted of three parts;the first part constituted demographic data, the second one constituted questions on the personal life status and changes, and the third part constituted questions regarding the professional life and some miscellaneous questions gauging the doctor's knowledge of the current scenario The collected data were entered in a Microsoft excel sheet, and the results were calculated Results: Most of the participants were between 25-34 years (47 8%) and male (71%) A majority of the doctors had a family with children (44 2%) and a spouse who was a HCW too (59 8%) A majority of the practitioners worked with patients with coronavirus (52 3%) and thus felt worried about their family members (93 3%) Although most participants knew about telemedicine (89 3%), most of the practitioners did not practice it (76 8%) Conclusion: Although HCWs do not face harassment, they suffer anxiety regarding contracting COVID-19 themselves and transmitting it to their family members","output":"Behavioural changes in the personal and professional lives of doctors during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emily Bronte was famously reclusive.

We evaluated the prevalence of COVID-19 infection at the time of reentry and cardiopulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 in elite athletes. All athletes returning to a USOPTF were required to go through a reentry protocol consisting of an electronic health history, a 6-day quarantine including twice-daily symptom surveys, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and pulmonary function testing. Athletes with current or prior COVID-19 infection also underwent an echocardiogram, cardiology consultation, and additional testing as indicated. All athletes followed rigorous infection prevention measures and minimized contact with the outside community following reentry. At the time of this report, 301 athletes completed the reentry protocol among which 14 (4.7%) tested positive for active (positive polymerase chain reaction test, n = 3) or prior (positive antibody test, n = 11) COVID-19 infection. During the study period, this cohort accrued 14,916 days living and training at USOPTFs. Only one (0.3%) athlete was subsequently diagnosed with a new COVID-19 infection. No cardiopulmonary pathology attributable to COVID-19 was detected. Our findings suggest that residential elite athlete training facilities can successfully resume activity during the COVID-19 pandemic when strict reentry and infection prevention measures are followed.

In particular, treatment options for elderly patients and patients with genetic risk factors with COVID-19-associated pneumonia are limited, and many patients die. Low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) of lungs was used to treat pneumonia many decades ago. Since the first report on the potential efficacy of LDRT for COVID-19-associated pneumonia was published on 1 April, 2020, tens of papers have addressed the importance of this treatment. Moreover, the findings of less than 10 clinical trials conducted to date are now available. We performed a detailed search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus and selected the nine most relevant articles. A review of these articles was conducted. The available data indicate that in oxygen-dependent elderly patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia, whole-lung radiation at doses of 0.5C1.5 Gy can lead to accelerated recovery and progress in clinical status, encephalopathy, and radiographic consolidation without any detectable acute toxicity. Although data collected so far show that LDRT could be introduced as a treatment with promising efficacy, due to limitations such as lack of randomization in most studies, we need further large-scale randomized studies, especially for elderly patients who are at greater risk of mortality due to COVID-19.

In particular, the moriche that grows in this region is wild and has been little studied; therefore, there are no reports of its potential as a source of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, information that could be useful for the conservation of the species. This study performed a physicochemical characterization of the oil extracted from the dried pulp of moriche and identified the fatty acids present in the oil, pulp and peel, seed, and flour of this fruit from the Bita River Basin, Vichada, Colombia. The fatty acid composition was characterized by gas chromatography, including physicochemical tests of interest in the oil according to AOCS protocols. The results showed that the highest fatty acid content was found in the extracted oil, with a distribution of 81.64% unsaturated fat and 18.36% saturated fat. These fats included 79.20% oleic acid (omega-9), 0.26% palmitoleic acid (omega-7), 1.01% linoleic acid (omega-6), 1% linolenic acid (omega-3), 16.91% palmitic acid, and 1.33% stearic acid.

CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of Covid-19 infection that occurred in a 24-year-old woman with MS and treated with alemtuzumab. The infection occurred 4 months after administration of the first course of alemtuzumab and had a benign course with subsequent development of antibodies. Furthermore, we present a brief review of the literature on similar published cases. DISCUSSION: We reviewed 17 articles concerning COVID-19 infection in MS patients in treatment with Alemtuzumab. In our case and all screened cases no severe course of disease was noted and no fatality was observed. Systematic compilation of this observation comforts clinicians about the course of Covid-19 infection despite alemtuzumab immunosuppressive treatment CONCLUSIONS: The risk of serious COVID-19 disease in MS patients treated with alemtuzumab is unknown.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic regardless of the use of diagnostic testing. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model that includes isolation of symptomatic individuals and tracing of contacts to assess the effects of the contact tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic in the state of S?o Paulo. RESULTS: For a selection efficacy (proportion of isolated contacts who are infected) of 80%, cases and deaths may be reduced by 80% after 60 days when 5000 symptomatic individuals are isolated per day, each of them together with 10 contacts. On the other hand, for a selection efficacy of 20%, the number of cases and deaths may be reduced by approximately 40% and 50%, respectively, compared with the scenario in which no contact-tracing strategy is implemented.

Simultaneously, there has been increasing recognition of the potential harm associated with delays in patient care as well as inefficiency of endoscopy units. With widespread vaccination of HCWs and the general population, a re-evaluation of AGAs prior recommendations was warranted. In order to update the role of pre-procedure testing for SARS-CoV2, the AGA guideline panel reviewed the evidence on (1) prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infections in individuals undergoing endoscopy, (2) patient and HCW risk of infections that may be acquired immediately before, during, or after endoscopy, (3) effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in reducing risk of infections and transmission, (4) patient and HCW anxiety, (5) patient delays in care and potential impact on cancer burden, and (6) endoscopy volumes. The panel considered the certainty of the evidence, weighed the benefits and harms of routine pre-procedure testing, and considered burden, equity, and cost using the GRADE framework. Based on very low certainty evidence, the panel made a conditional recommendation against routine pre-procedure testing for SARS-CoV2 in patients scheduled to undergo endoscopy.

It is actively secreted by the necrotic cells as a response to the inflammatory signaling pathway. HMGB1 binds to receptor ligands as RAGE, and TLR and becomes a pro-inflammatory cytokine with a robust capacity to trigger inflammatory response. It is a critical mediator of the pathogenesis of systemic inflammation in numerous inflammatory disorders. Release of HMGB1 is associated with different viral infections and strongly participates in the regulation of viral replication cycles. In COVID-19 era, high HMGB1 serum levels were observed in COVID-19 patients and linked with the disease severity, development of cytokine storm (CS), acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2-induced cytolytic effect may encourage release of HMGB1 due to nuclear damage. Besides, HMGB1 activates release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from immune cells and up-regulation of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, targeting of the HMGB1 pathway by anti-HMGB1 agents, such as heparin, resveratrol and metformin, may decrease COVID-19 severity. HMGB1 signaling pathway has noteworthy role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and linked with development of ALI and ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: This study was based on the Korea COPD Subgroup Study (KOCOSS) database, constructed in a multicenter COPD cohort study that recruited patients from 54 centers. CB was defined as CAT1 and CAT2 scores  3; severe CB was defined as CAT1 and CAT2 scores  4, while mild CB was defined as either a CAT1 or a CAT2 score < 4. Baseline characteristics, 1-year exacerbation rate, and 3-year FEV1 decline were compared in non-CB versus CB patients and in patients with mild CB versus severe CB. RESULTS: Among the 2162 patients enrolled in this study, 497 (23%) had CB. These patients were more likely than non-CB patients to be current smokers; they also had higher symptom and depression/anxiety scores. Lung function tests showed lower FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and DLco values in CB patients. Among CB patients, 67.6% had mild disease. Symptom and depression/anxiety scores were worse in patients with severe CB than in patients with mild CB. There were no significant differences in the lung function tests of the two groups. Analysis of 1-year exacerbation rates in CB patients and non-CB patients revealed that patients with CB more frequently had moderate-to-severe exacerbations (OR = 1.46, p < 0.01).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-nine NCCLs were restored at 18 participants. NCCLs were divided into three different universal adhesive groups: Clearfil Universal Bond (CU) (n = 31), iBOND Universal (IU) (n = 33), and G-Premio Bond (GP) (n = 35). Prior to the adhesive procedures, selective enamel etching was performed with 37% phosphoric acid in all experimental groups. Adhesive systems were applied following the manufacturers instructions, and the lesions were restored with a highly filled flowable resin composite (G-?nial Universal Flo). Restorations were finished and polished immediately after placement. All restorations were scored with regard to retention, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, sensitivity, surface texture, and color match using modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria after 1 week (baseline) and 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 60 months. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square and McNemars and Kaplan Meier tests. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: After 60 months, the recall rate was 72.2%. Survival rates of CU, IU, and GP restorations were 87%, 85.2%, and 96.5%, respectively. Five CU (25%), 8 IU (34.8%), and 12 GP (42.9%) restorations exhibit bravo scores for marginal adaptation. However, no differences were seen among them. CU showed lower bravo score than IU and GP for marginal discoloration (CU, 0%; IU, 26.1%; GP, 32.1%).

Employees health status is affected by labor on variable levels. Compared to people with a high socio-economic status, people of low socio-economic status (e.g. low level of education, low level of professional status or low wages) have a lower probability of maintaining a positive health status and hold a higher risk of developing illness. Furthermore, different occupations (connected with specific qualifications and status) hold unequal risk levels for employees when it comes to developing illness. This is particularly of interest in times when a highly infectious virus is a permanent threat to everyone. The risk of infection varies with the mode of interactive work: Occupational groups with direct interactive work hold higher risks of infection than respective groups with technically mediated interactive work. Apart from employees health protection, organizational interventions for preventing infections have unintentional effects on employees health status, which C again C depend on their field of occupation. Drawing on case study results, this paper compares the organizational crisis management and its challenges in social services (nursing care and domestic care) to those in IT services. We also address crisis managements impact on employees and their perceived working quality. We analyze whether the crisis management leads to a reduction of inequality and/or a deterioration of employees chances for a positive health status.","output":"Die Coronapandemie: Gesundheitliche Ungleichheit und betriebliches Krisenmanagement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The peak of the daily new infections in COVID-19 remained qualitative in description and elusive in arrival.

However, there was no brief instrument to screen for a range of psychological problems in different domains after a potentially traumatic event, and for risk factors and protective factors. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the internal consistency and concurrent validity of the Japanese version of the Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS) in a traumatized sample in Japan. Method: A total sample (n = 58) with varying levels of potential posttrauma symptoms due to domestic violence or other events were recruited into this study. Self-rating measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and alcohol problems were conducted to investigate the concurrent validity. Results: The results show that a range of posttrauma symptoms assessed by the GPS were highly endorsed by this traumatized sample in all domains except for self-harm, derealization, and depersonalization. The GPS sum score was highly correlated (r > 0.79) with other measures of PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Also, the subdomain scores showed acceptable correlations with corresponding domain measures. Participants who had been sexually assaulted or had unwanted sexual experiences, and participants who had been physically assaulted during childhood, had higher scores on the total GPS and on subdomains of PTSD, as well as symptoms associated with Complex PTSD. Conclusions: This study provides an initial indication that the GPS may be a useful screening tool for trauma survivors and elucidates that the consequences of trauma are not limited to PTSD.","output":"Screening for psychotrauma related symptoms: Japanese translation and pilot testing of the Global Psychotrauma Screen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. However, the prevalence of retesting positive by RT-PCR for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the associated patient characteristics, remain unclear. Methods We included 90 confirmed cases of COVID-19 treated in the Nanjing Public Health Center from January 20, 2020 to February 16, 2020 in this retrospective study. All patients completed treatment for COVID-19 and were retested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 4-20 days after completion of therapy. The clinical characteristics between patients with who retested positive versus negative by RT-PCR were compared, and the factors predictive of positive retesting were analyzed. Positive retesting was modeled with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The age range of the study population was 0.8-97 years, and all patients were cured or showed improvement. A total of 10 (11%) patients retested positive by RT-PCR 4-20 days after completion of therapy. As compared with patients who retested negative, those who retested positive had a lower percentage of pre-admission fever, a higher percentage of post-admission fever, a lower percentage of bilateral lung infection, higher white blood cell (WBC) count and creatine phosphokinase, and lower hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (all P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis of the above eight key variables showed that lower hs-CRP and higher WBC were independently associated with positive retesting by RT-PCR. A combination of hs-CRP and WBC were predictive of positive retesting, with an AUC of 0.859. Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 who retested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 had mild symptoms and better blood testing results. A combination of hs-CRP and WBC may predict positive retesting by RT-PCR; however, the sensitivity and specificity should be studied further.","output":"Comparison of clinical characteristics between patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who retested RT-PCR positive versus negative: a retrospective study of data from Nanjing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid the rapid transition towards a low-carbon world, this study resolves how a nationally-diverse board affects a firms inclination towards green innovation.

METHODS: A total of 269 patients who underwent CT for suspected COVID-19 were included in this retrospective analysis. COVID-19 was confirmed by reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction. Basic demographics (age and sex) and initial vital parameters (O(2)-saturation, respiratory rate, and body temperature) were recorded. Generalized mixed models were used to calculate the accuracy of vital parameters for detection of COVID-19 and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CT. A clinical score based on vital parameters, age, and sex was established to estimate the pretest probability of COVID-19 and used to define low, intermediate, and high risk groups. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The sole use of vital parameters for the prediction of COVID-19 was inferior to CT. After correction for confounders, such as age and sex, CT showed a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.78, and positive predictive value of 0.36. In the subgroup analysis based on pretest probability, positive predictive value and sensitivity increased to 0.53 and 0.89 in the high-risk group, while specificity was reduced to 0.68.

Its utility in text-mining and document retrieval tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known. An unsupervised machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has particularly been utilized for identifying latent (or hidden) topics in document collections and for deciphering the words that define one or more topics using a generative statistical model. Here we describe how SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutation profiles can be structured into a Bag of Words to enable identification of signatures (topics) and their probabilistic distribution across various genomes using LDA. Topic models were generated using ~47000 novel corona virus genomes (considered as documents), leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures (equivalent to topics) in the corpus of chosen genomes through coherence optimization. The document assumption for genomes also helped in identification of contextual nucleotide mutation signatures in the form of conventional N-grams (e.g. bi-grams and tri-grams). We validated the signatures obtained using LDA driven method against the previously reported recurrent mutations and phylogenetic clades for genomes. Additionally, we report the geographical distribution of the identified mutation signatures in SARS-CoV-2 genomes on the global map. Use of the non-phylogenetic albeit classical approaches like topic modeling and other data centric pattern mining algorithms is therefore proposed for supplementing the efforts towards understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes (and other pathogens/microbes).","output":"What if we perceive SARS-CoV-2 genomes as documents?

METHODS: Consecutive patients with no previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection attending the ED of the Policlinico Hospital of Bari between 23rd October and 4th November 2020 were enrolled. Clinical and demographic data were collected for all patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected on admission were subjected both to molecular (RT-qPCR) and antigen (CLEIA) tests for SARS-CoV-2. The performance of the CLEIA antigen test was analyzed using R Studio software and Microsoft Excel. Receiver operating characteristics were also performed. RESULTS: A total of 911 patients were enrolled, of whom 469 (51.5%) were male. Of the whole cohort, 23.7% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR and 24.5% by CLEIA. The overall concordance rate was 96.8%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the antigen test were 94.9% (95% CI, 91.9C97.0), 97.4% (95% CI, 96.5C98.1), 91.9% (95% CI, 89.0C94.0), and 98.4% (95% CI, 97.4C99.1), respectively.

However, there is little research into the impact of face masks on people with communication difficulties (pwCD) post\\\\stroke. AIMS: To explore the perspectives of service users and staff on a stroke rehabilitation unit in order to understand the impact of staff wearing face masks on the experience of rehabilitation for pwCD. Strategies that might improve the experience of rehabilitation for pwCD were also explored. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Semi\\\\structured interviews and a focus group were conducted with six pwCD and five health professionals (HPs) on a stroke rehabilitation unit. The data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Four main interacting themes were identified from the data: (1) face masks as a barrier to effective communication; (2) face masks as a barrier to human connection and therapeutic relationships; (3) the impact of face masks on an individual is influenced by multiple internal and external factors; and (4) there is a need for service provision to evolve to meet pwCD's needs when using face masks. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: Findings shed light on how face masks can act as a barrier for pwCD within the rehabilitative process, and emphasize that each individual with communication difficulties is likely to be affected to a differing extent, as a result of multiple interacting factors. HPs are encouraged to consider the individual holistically, tailor strategies and adapt to each individual's needs.

HPs should monitor closely the impact of face mask use on pwCD with whom they are working, and consider what adaptations to delivery are required. It would be helpful for clinicians to have a discussion with pwCD post\\\\stroke to understand the impact of face mask use on them personally and what strategies they would find most helpful within rehabilitation.

Therefore, this study aims to assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin on corrected QT (QTc). METHODS A baseline electrocardiogram and on-treatment baseline electrocardiogram were retrospectively collected in COVID-19 patients who received hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. The QTc interval was calculated, and the baseline and peak QTc intervals were compared. In addition, the peak QTc intervals of monotherapy and combination therapy were compared. RESULTS Of the 155 patients included, 102 (65.8%) patients were using hydroxychloroquine, and 53 (34.2%) patients were using hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin combination. The use of both hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin combined therapy significantly prolonged the QTc, and the QTc interval was significantly longer in patients receiving combination therapy.

Rare SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies elicited by past CCV infections were not associated with protection; however, the duration of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infections was significantly reduced in individuals with higher common betacoronavirus (?CoV) antibody titers. Since antibody titers decline over time after CCV infections, individuals in our cohort with higher ?CoV antibody titers were more likely recently infected with common ?CoVs compared with individuals with lower antibody titers. Therefore, our data suggest that recent ?CoV infections potentially limit the duration of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infections through mechanisms that do not involve cross-reactive antibodies.

Methods: This is a descriptive, multi-centered, observational design feasibility study based on an AI tool for the rapid detection of COVID-19 in chest computed tomography (CT) images of patients with respiratory difficulties attending the countrys public hospitals. The patients digital CT images were transmitted to the AI diagnostic platform, and after a few minutes, radiologists and pneumologists specialized in COVID-19 downloaded the images for evaluation, confirmation of diagnosis, and comparison with the genetic diagnosis (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)). It was also determined the percentage of agreement between two similar AI systems applied in parallel to study the viability of using it as an alternative method of screening patients with COVID-19 through telemedicine. Results: Between March and August 2020, 911 rapid diagnostic tests were carried out on patients with respiratory disorders to rule out COVID-19 in 14 hospitals nationwide. The average age of patients was 50.7 years, 62.6% were male and 37.4% female. Most of the diagnosed respiratory conditions corresponded to the age group of 27C59 years (252 studies), the second most frequent corresponded to the group over 60 years, and the third to the group of 19C26 years. The most frequent findings of the radiologists/pneumologists were severe pneumonia, bilateral pneumonia with pleural effusion, bilateral pulmonary emphysema, diffuse ground glass opacity, hemidiaphragmatic paresis, calcified granuloma in the lower right lobe, bilateral pleural effusion, sequelae of tuberculosis, bilateral emphysema, and fibrotic changes, among others. Overall, an average of 86% agreement and 14% diagnostic discordance was determined between the two AI systems. The sensitivity of the AI system was 93% and the specificity 80% compared with RT-PCR.

BACKGROUND: Pandemic fatigue is an emerging health concern among frontline clinical nurses as a consequence of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the various measures implemented to slow the spread of infection. As yet, no studies have investigated the link between pandemic fatigue and resilience, mental health, sleep quality and job contentment in frontline clinical nurses. METHODS: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study involving 255 frontline clinical nurses in the Philippines. The Pandemic Fatigue Questionnaire, Brief Resilience Scale, Job Contentment Scale and the Sleep Quality Scale were used to collect data through an online survey. RESULTS: The mean pandemic fatigue score was 3.086 (out of 5). Being vaccinated (? = 0.231, p < .001) and increased staffing levels (? = -0.488, p < .01) were associated with decreased pandemic fatigue in clinical nurses. Resilience partially mediated the relationships between (a) pandemic fatigue and mental health (? = -0.488, p < .001), (b) pandemic fatigue and sleep quality (? = -0.326, p < .001) and (c) pandemic fatigue and job contentment (? = -0.395, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Clinical nurses who received a COVID-19 vaccine and those who perceived sufficient staffing in their units reported lower levels of pandemic fatigue. Resilience reduces the effects of pandemic fatigue on clinical nurses' mental health, sleep quality and job contentment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: By providing frontline nurses with access to COVID-19 vaccines and ensuring sufficient staffing levels, nurse managers could effectively reduce or prevent pandemic fatigue and improve their mental health.

Many trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects are imprecise. Hence, clinicians may find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard care as the status quo. We study treatment choice from the perspective of statistical decision theory, which considers treatment options symmetrically when assessing trial findings. METHODS: We use the concept of near-optimality to evaluate criteria for treatment choice. This concept jointly considers the probability and magnitude of decision errors. An appealing criterion from this perspective is the empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed average patient outcome in the trial. RESULTS: Considering the design of some COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields treatment choices that are much closer to optimal than those generated by prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective hospital-based study was done during the first (March 2020 - January 2021) and the second (February 2021 - June 2021) waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects were grouped into four categories: first-wave CAROCM (n-4); second-wave CAROCM (n-27); first-wave non-mucor COVID (n-75), and second-wave non-mucor COVID (n-50). Data elements included age, gender, comorbidities, COVID-19 severity, steroid therapy, peak values of interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum ferritin and D-dimer, nadir values of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count (Pl.

We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics for pediatric acute pancreatitis (AP) with adult AP, and investigate the risk factor for acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP) in children. METHOD: From June 2013 to June 2019, a total of 130 pediatric patients with AP at the inpatient database were enrolled. Univariate analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to identify the risk factors for ARP in children. RESULT: Major etiologic factors in 130 patients were biliary (31.5%), idiopathic (28.5%). The etiology of pancreatitis in children was markedly different from that in adults (p < 0.001). Compared with the adult patients, the pediatric patients had significantly lower severity (p = 0.018) and occurrence rate of pancreatic necrosis (p = 0.041), SIRS (p = 0.021), acute peripancreatic fluid collection (p = 0.014). Univariate and Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that female (p = 0.020; OR 3.821; 95% CI 1.231C11.861), hypertriglyceridemia (p = 0.045; OR 3.111; 95% CI 1.024C9.447), pancreatic necrosis (p = 0.023; OR 5.768; 95% CI 1.278C26.034) were the independent risk factors of ARP. Hypertriglyceridemia AP had the highest risk of recurrence compared to other etiology (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Biliary and idiopathic disease were the major etiologies of AP in children. Children have simpler conditions than adults.

Yet, the relationship between the immune system and melanocytic nevi is unclear. Using a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, we found that 81.8% of the transplanted nevi underwent spontaneous regression, while peripheral skin remained intact. Nevus-resident CD4+ T helper 1 cells, which exhibited a massive clonal expansion to melanocyte-specific antigens, were responsible for nevus rejection. Boosting regulatory T cell suppressive function with low-dose exogenous human interleukin-2 injection or treatment with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II-blocking antibody prevented nevus rejection. Notably, mice with rejected nevus PDXs were protected from melanoma tumor growth. We detected a parallel CD4+ T cell-dominant immunity in clinically regressing melanocytic nevi. These findings reveal a mechanistic explanation for spontaneous nevus regression in humans and posit the activation of nevus-resident CD4+ effector T cells as a novel strategy for melanoma immunoprevention and treatment.","output":"Rejection of benign melanocytic nevi by nevus-resident CD4+ T cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral encephalitis is a devastating disease with high mortality, and survivors often suffer from severe neurological complications.

Under inflammatory conditions such as CNS viral infection, microglia promote innate and adaptive immune responses to protect the host. However, during viral infection, a dysregulated microglia-T-cell interplay may result in altered phagocytosis of neuronal synapses by microglia that causes neurocognitive impairment.

Many of these procedures are performed using laparoscopic minimally invasive techniques and employ the use of surgical mesh. The use of surgical mesh has been shown to reduce recurrence rates compared to standard suture repairs. The placement of surgical mesh in a ventral hernia repair procedure can be challenging, and may even complicate the procedure. Others have attempted to provide commercial solutions to the problems of mesh placement, but these have not been well accepted by the clinical community. In this article, two versions of shape memory polymer (SMP)-modified surgical mesh, and unmodified surgical mesh, were compared by performing laparoscopic manipulation in an acute porcine model. Also, SMP-integrated polyester surgical meshes were implanted in four rats for 30-33 days to evaluate chronic biocompatibility and capacity for tissue integration. Porcine results show that the modified mesh provides a controlled, temperature-activated, automated deployment when compared to an unmodified mesh. In rats, results indicate that implanted SMP-modified meshes exhibit exceptional biocompatibility and excellent integration with surrounding tissue with no noticeable differences from the unmodified counterpart. This article provides further evidence that an SMP-modified surgical mesh promises reduction in surgical placement time and that such a mesh is not substantially different from unmodified meshes in chronic biocompatibility.","output":"Biocompatibility and tissue integration of a novel shape memory surgical mesh for ventral hernia: in vivo animal studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rotavirus (RV) infection is the main cause of acute dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young children below 5 years old worldwide. RV infection causes a global shutoff of host proteins as many other viruses do. However, previous studies revealed that RV could selectively upregulated the expression of some host proteins that then played important roles in RV infection. To globally explor such host proteins that were upregulated in early human rotavirus (HRV) infection, proteomic methods were used and a total of ten upregulated host proteins were unambiguously identified. Cyclophilin A (CYPA), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, was among these upregulated host proteins. Following infection, CYPA was recruited to the viroplasm and interacted with HRV structural protein VP2; CYPA reduced host susceptibility to HRV infection and inhibited replication of HRV by repressing the expression of viral proteins. Furthermore, we found that the increased expression of CYPA in enterocytes of small intestine correlated to the period when BALB/c mice became resistant to RV diarrhea. Together, we identified CYPA as a novel host restriction factor that confered protection against RV infection and might contribute to host susceptibility to RV diarrhea.","output":"Proteomic methods reveal cyclophilin A function as a host restriction factor against rotavirus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mothers have experienced a near doubling of depression and anxiety symptoms pre- to during the COVID-19 pandemic. The identification of mechanisms that account for this increase can help inform specific targets for mental health recovery efforts. The current study examined whether women with higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms pre-pandemic, reported higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic, and whether these increases were mediated by perceived stress, strained relationships, coping attitudes, participation in activities, alcohol use, and financial impact. METHODS: Mothers (n = 1,333) from an ongoing longitudinal cohort (All Our Families; AOF) from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, completed online questionnaires prior to (2017C2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (May-July 2020). Mothers reported on depressive and anxiety symptoms pre- and during the pandemic, as well as perceived stress, engagement in physical and leisure activities, coping, alcohol use, and financial impact of the pandemic. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, maternal depression and anxiety symptoms pre-pandemic were strongly associated with COVID-19 depressive (r = 0.57, p<.01) and anxiety symptoms (r = 0.49, p<.01). Significant indirect effects between maternal depressive symptoms pre- and during COVID-19 were found for coping behavior (ab(cs)=0.014, 95%CI=0.005, 0.022, p=.001), perceived stress (ab(cs)=0.22, 95%CI=0.179, 0.258, p<.001), and strained relationships (ab(cs)=0.013, 95%CI= 0.005, 0.022, p=.003). For maternal anxiety symptoms pre- and during COVID-19, significant indirect effects were observed for perceived stress (ab(cs)=0.012, 95%CI=0.077, 0.154, p=.003) and strained relationships (ab(cs)=0.010, 95%CI=0.001, 0.018, p=.03).

However, most patients included in those studies underwent polysomnography because of symptoms, so the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in this population is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in children with myelomeningocele using screening polysomnography. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all children with myelomeningocele seen in a multi-disciplinary spina bifida clinic between 2016 and 2020 were referred for polysomnography regardless of clinical symptoms. Included children had not previously undergone polysomnography. The primary outcome for this study was presence of sleep disordered breathing, defined as Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI, number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour of sleep) greater than 2.5. Clinical and demographic variables relevant to myelomeningocele were also prospectively collected and tested for association with presence of sleep apnea. RESULTS: A total of 117 participants underwent polysomnography (age 1 mo to 21 yr, 49% male). The majority were white, non-Hispanic. Median AHI was 1.9 (interquartile range 0.6-4.2). A total of 49 children had AHI 2.5 or greater, yielding a sleep disordered breathing prevalence of 42% (95% CI 33%-51%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, children with more rostral neurological lesion levels had higher odds of sleep disordered breathing (OR for thoracic, mid-lumbar, and low-lumbar: 7.34, 3.70, 4.04, respectively, compared to sacral level, P = .043).

It has previously been assessed for concurrent validity and inter-rater reliability. In this study we examine whether it is suitable for administration over the telephone. DESIGN AND METHODS We recruited a sample of 107 AOD clients across public sector specialist AOD treatment services in New South Wales, Australia between 2016 and 2018. Participants had a mean age of 47 years and 46% were female. Participants completed a face-to-face ATOP and a phone ATOP with a researcher within 5 days. Comparisons between the two administration modes were undertaken using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for continuous or ordinal variables, and Cohen's Kappa for nominal variables. RESULTS Among 107 participants, 59% were attending for alcohol treatment and 41% for opioid treatment. Most ATOP items (76%) reached above 0.7 (good) or 0.9 (excellent) agreement between face-to-face and telephone use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the ATOP is a suitable instrument for telephone monitoring of recent substance use, health and social functioning among AOD clients. Its validation for remote use over the telephone will support staff to monitor clients' risks and outcomes-of particular relevance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in which services are increasingly relying on telework approaches to client monitoring.","output":"Assessing the validity of the Australian Treatment Outcomes Profile for telephone administration in drug health treatment populations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a highly globalized world affected by economic policies and a latent COVID-19 pandemic, companies need to organize or reorganize to achieve efficient operations.

The SEM micrographs show that starch presented bimodal distribution (size 3.9-10.4 m), while the smaller granules had a smooth surface and an oval or conical shape, the larger granules were spherical with holes and cracks on the surface. The starch presented low amylose content (<20%) and amylopectin branch chain length distribution with the absence of a shoulder, which is suggestive of perfect crystalline structure, and a higher proportion of medium chains (DP 13-24), despite the large number of short chains (DP 6-12), and on average DP 21.

Social media platforms have enormous potential to both support and deter patients decisions on healthcare. The current study demonstrated that the majority of YouTube videos on osteoporosis provide useful information with sufficient quality. PURPOSE: YouTube is the most popular video-sharing platform for patients seeking online information about their medical condition. However, there are concerns regarding the accuracy and quality of YouTube content. We aimed to analyze the quality of English-language YouTube videos on osteoporosis. METHODS: A YouTube search was performed on April 21, 2021, using the keywords osteoporosis, osteoporosis exercise, osteoporosis diet, and osteoporosis treatment. The reviewers recorded the content, source, and detailed characteristics of the included videos. The reliability and quality of the videos were analyzed using the modified DISCERN score and Global Quality Scale (GQS) score by a rheumatologist and endocrinologist. RESULTS: Of the 400 videos screened, 238 were included in the study after applying the exclusion criteria. A total of 205 (86.1%) videos revealed useful information about osteoporosis whereas 33 (13.9%) were misleading. In terms of quality, 48% of the videos were of high quality, 34% were of moderate quality, and 18% were of low quality. The videos posted by universities and professional organizations had the highest modified DISCERN and GQS scores indicating high reliability and quality. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the majority of YouTube videos on osteoporosis contained useful information with sufficient quality. However, physicians should be aware of misleading information and correct any misinformation during face-to-face meetings with patients. YouTube should consider creating partnerships with professional organizations in the field of osteoporosis to produce high-quality videos in line with their new health content policy.","output":"Quality of English-language videos available on YouTube as a source of information on osteoporosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of electronic media (EM) by youths has been widely described in the literature, indicating the relevance of understanding the factors that can protect against its risks. We aimed to explore the protective role of participating in extracurricular activities (ECAs) and of parental mediation in the use of EM by young people. A total of 1413 people (729 students, aged between 11 and 17 years old, and one of their parents) participated in this study. Youths who engaged in ECAs spent significantly less time per week on EM and perceived that the use of EM devices had less of a negative impact. When parents and their children presented a congruent notion of how much time youth spent on EM, parents perceived EM to have less of a negative impact on their children compared to dyads with discrepant assessments. The hierarchical regression results indicated that regardless of time spent per week on EM, engaging in ECAs was a significant predictor of perceiving a less negative impact, playing a role as a protective factor regarding the use of EM. The ubiquity of EM reinforces the importance of the focus of this study, and its results contribute to creating specific guidelines for parental education and educational policies.","output":"Protective Factors in the Use of Electronic Media According to Youth and Their Parents: An Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide, there were 463 million adults (20-79 years) with diabetes in 2019. These figures are expected to increase to 700 million by 2045. Additionally, approximately 4.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to diabetes, and global health care expenditures on individuals with diabetes were estimated to be 760 billion U.S. dollars. One of the most effective ways to control this debilitating disease is to prevent it before it happens, which, based on evidence from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) randomized controlled trial and other studies in different countries, is feasible with a change in weight, dietary habits, and physical activity levels. While many studies have shown the benefits of plant-based diets in diabetes prevention, no DPP studies have been found that have incorporated a plant-based diet for their dietary component. The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of implementing a worksite plant-based diabetes prevention program to inform larger randomized trials to be conducted in the future. This was a mixed-methods pilot study using a one group pretest-posttest design. The study was delivered to Teachers College, Columbia University employees and staff and was designed to use a modified version of the CDC's national curriculum, one that emphasizes plant-based eating patterns. The sessions ran during lunch hour where a healthy lunch that supported the behavior change goal of the session was provided. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) framework was used for both curriculum design and program evaluation. The principles of facilitated group discussion in a safe environment were used to deliver the sessions. The program was conducted in the spring semester of 2020, once a week, for a series of 13 weeks plus two voluntary booster sessions held 1 and 2 months after the program was completed. Midway through the semester, the program went virtual using synchronous video-conferencing technology due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on consumption of healthy and unhealthy plant- and animal-based foods, physical activity, and psychosocial variables were measured pre and post program using validated questionnaires;blood glucose values were measured as HbA1c using A1CNow SELFCHECK;and weights were measured weekly using Tanita SC-331S scales when classes were in-person and home scales when classes went virtual. Evaluations of participants' acceptability and satisfaction were assessed at the end of the program both quantitatively and through interviews. Finally, fidelity to the plant-based curriculum and evaluation of educational plan completion and engagement were done weekly. Forty-one individuals expressed interest in the study, but only 18 met the eligibility criteria, of whom 14 were finally enrolled, constituting 78%. The participants were ethnically/racially diverse. Attrition was very low with only one dropout, and this did not change when the program went virtual. Program delivery was in fact feasible and all 13 lessons and booster sessions were completed. The plant-based DPP was received with a high degree of acceptability and satisfaction by the participants. Participants described the safe environment created and the facilitated dialogue approach in the sessions, along with peer support as instrumental for their behavior changes. There were some significant improvements in the physiological, behavioral, and psychosocial outcome measures explored in the study which included: weight, diet quality in terms of plant-based and animal-based foods, physical activity levels, blood glucose levels, and behavioral and psychosocial determinants of behavior change of the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) theoretical framework.

This qualitative study focuses on women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV. AIM The aim of this study was to describe women's experiences of living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV. METHOD A purposive sample of fifteen women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV participated in the study. Data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews that were subjected to qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS One theme was identified, stabilizing an ever-present breathlessness by restoring strength, and three categories are as follows: managing a restricted everyday life as an expert of their illness, being afraid of contracting infections leading to suffocation and suffering and importance of continuous help and support from significant others and digital media. Breathlessness restricted women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, living with a body they have to wait for. Managing everyday life was adapted to their limited abilities and energy. This required detailed planning, good knowledge of their breathing and body. Women were afraid of contracting life-threatening infections that caused suffering, especially COVID-19. The fear leads to isolation and digital media was described as an important means of communication. Significant others gave support and help that was practical and emotional. Women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experienced lack of continuous help and support from healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION Stabilizing an ever-present breathlessness by restoring strength required women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV to conduct detailed planning to manage everyday life. Being afraid of contracting infections and the consequences of suffocation had increased since the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak, which led to self-isolation and an inactive everyday life. To get help, support and socialize, women used digital media.","output":"Living with an ever-present breathlessness: Women's experiences of living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted healthcare systems worldwide.

Materials and Methods: A sequential systematic literature search was conducted from December 2019 to 30 April 2020 through PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded the following results: \\"COVID-19\\" (n = 12,137), \\"Novel corona virus\\" (n = 63), \\"COVID-19 and dentistry\\" (n = 46), \\"COVID-19 and oral health\\" (n = 41), \\"Novel Corona virus and Dentistry\\" (n = 0), \\"dental health and Novel Coronavirus\\" (n = 26), and \\"dental practice and Novel Coronavirus\\" (n = 6). Results: After a careful review and eliminating articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final review included 13 articles. Management of infection control is discussed extensively in the literature and remains the main theme of many Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) articles on dentistry. Telephone triage using a questionnaire, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) for clinical and nonclinical staff, a preprocedural mouth rinse, and aerosol management have been discussed and implemented in few countries. Three studies recommended that elective treatments for patients with a temperature of >100.4 F or 38 C should be postponed or performed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) or negative-pressure room. Limiting the number of patients in the waiting area, the removal of shared objects, proper ventilation, and physical distancing were highly recommended. Psychological distress among dental professionals in relation to existing medical conditions and self-efficacy has been discussed. Conclusions: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the dental profession worldwide, our review highlights many practice management approaches to adopt the new norm.

While unprecedented strides have been made developing vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, there remains a need for highly effective and widely available regimens for ambulatory use for novel coronaviruses and other viral pathogens. We posit that a priority is to develop pan-family drug cocktails to enhance potency, limit toxicity, and avoid drug resistance. We urge cocktail development for all viruses with pandemic potential both in the short term (<1 to 2 years) and longer term with pairs of drugs in advanced clinical testing or repurposed agents approved for other indications. While significant efforts were launched against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in vitro and in the clinic, many studies employed solo drugs and had disappointing results. Here, we review drug combination studies against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses and introduce a model-driven approach to assess drug pairs with the highest likelihood of clinical efficacy. Where component agents lack sufficient potency, we advocate for synergistic combinations to achieve therapeutic levels. We also discuss issues that stymied therapeutic progress against COVID-19, including testing of agents with low likelihood of efficacy late in clinical disease and lack of focus on developing virologic surrogate endpoints. There is a need to expedite efficient clinical trials testing drug combinations that could be taken at home by recently infected individuals and exposed contacts as early as possible during the next pandemic, whether caused by a coronavirus or another viral pathogen.

STUDY DESIGN All consecutive patients undergoing gastric bypass were screened for enrollment in our study. Patients were randomly allocated to undergo knotless anastomosis with barbed suture (V-Loc? 180; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) (case group) or knot-tying anastomosis with 3/0 polyglactin sutures (Polysorb(?); Covidien) (control group). The primary outcome was the time needed for the gastrojejunal anastomosis and the operative time. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of leak, bleeding, and stenosis and the evaluation of the cost of the different procedures evaluated. RESULTS Among the 60 consecutive patients enrolled in our study, 30 underwent knot-tying anastomosis, and 30 underwent knotless anastomosis. The time needed for the anastomosis was significantly less (P<.001) in the knotless group, whereas no significant differences were found between the two groups for operative time (P=.151). We recorded one leak in the control group and one leak in the case group (P=1.000). One bleeding in the case group (P=1.000) and no stenosis in either group was recorded. Finally, in our experience, the knotless anastomosis was cheaper than the knot-tying anastomosis (P<.001).

The TMPRSS2 gene may be co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor genes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Basigin (BSG), but only TMPRSS2 demonstrates tissue-specific expression in alveolar cells according to single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our analysis of the structural variability of the TMPRSS2 gene based on genome-wide data from 76 human populations demonstrates that a functionally significant missense mutation in exon 6/7 in the TMPRSS2 gene is found in many human populations at relatively high frequencies, with region-specific distribution patterns. The frequency of the missense mutation encoded by rs12329760, which has previously been found to be associated with prostate cancer, ranged between 10% and 63% and was significantly higher in populations of Asian origin compared with European populations. In addition to single-nucleotide polymorphisms, two copy number variants were detected in the TMPRSS2 gene. A number of microRNAs have been predicted to regulate TMPRSS2 and BSG expression levels, but none of them is enriched in lung or respiratory tract cells. Several well-studied drugs can downregulate the expression of TMPRSS2 in human cells, including acetaminophen (paracetamol) and curcumin.

Mitigating such disease threats is challenging, partly because uncertainty about disease dynamics makes it difficult to identify the best management approaches. Serious impacts on susceptible populations most frequently occur when generalist pathogens are maintained within populations of abundant (often domestic) reservoir hosts, and spill over into less abundant host species. If this is the case, disease control directed at the reservoir host might be most appropriate. However, pathogen transmission within threatened host populations may also be important, and may not be controllable by managing another host species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated interspecific and intraspecific transmission routes, by comparing African wild dogs' exposure to six canine pathogens with behavioural measures of their opportunities for contact with domestic dogs and with other wild dogs. Domestic dog contact was associated with exposure to canine parvovirus, Ehrlichia canis, Neospora caninum and perhaps rabies virus, but not with exposure to canine distemper virus or canine coronavirus. Contact with other wild dogs appeared not to increase the risk of exposure to any of the pathogens. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings, combined with other data, suggest that management directed at domestic dogs might help to protect wild dog populations from rabies virus, but not from canine distemper virus.

Although he had no symptoms, such as fever or respiratory symptoms, he was hospitalized because of his advanced age. He was discharged 10 days after admission, and repeat COVID-19 PCR was negative. We planned radical surgery for the stomach tumor 6 weeks after recovery from the COVID-19 infection. A PCR-negative COVID-19 status was confirmed again before hospitalization. Open distal gastrectomy with Billroth I reconstruction was performed. We avoided ultrasonic scalpels and used a Crystal Vision 450D surgical smoke evacuator (I.C. Medical, Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA) to reduce intraoperative surgical smoke. The postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSION: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some patients are diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by preoperative antigen tests or PCR, even if they have no symptoms. If possible, elective surgery should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after recovery from COVID-19 infection to maximize safety. Moreover, surgeons must consider intraoperative surgical smoke.","output":"Patient with gastric cancer who underwent distal gastrectomy after treatment of COVID-19 infection diagnosed by preoperative PCR screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent emergence of highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has debilitating effect on public health system of the affected countries worldwide. Currently India is facing third wave of COVID-19 pandemic and going through a severe crisis. Within short span of time, the variant has shown high transmissibility and capability of evading the immune response generated against natural infection and vaccination. The immune escape potential of Omicron is a serious concern and further needs to be explored. In the present study, we have assessed the IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) response in breakthrough individuals vaccinated with two doses ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (n=25), breakthrough individuals vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (n=8) and unvaccinated individuals (n=6). All these individuals were infected with Omicron variant. The IgG antibody activity in the sera of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA breakthrough individuals was comparable with S1-RBD, while it was lesser in BNT162b2 mRNA breakthrough individuals with N protein and inactivated whole antigen IgG ELISA. BNT162b2 mRNA breakthrough individuals showed moderate reduction in NAb GMTs compared to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against Alpha, Beta and Delta. However, 3-fold higher reduction was observed with omicron variant in BNT162b2 mRNA than ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Apparently, Alpha variant was modestly resistant to the sera of unvaccinated individuals than Beta, Delta and Omicron.

While these symptoms arise acutely during the course of infection, less is known about the possible long-term consequences for the brain. Severely affected COVID-19 cases experience high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and acute respiratory dysfunction and often require assisted ventilation. All these factors have been suggested to cause cognitive decline. Pathogenetically, this may result from direct negative effects of the immune reaction, acceleration or aggravation of pre-existing cognitive deficits, or de novo induction of a neurodegenerative disease. This article summarizes the current understanding of neurological symptoms of COVID-19 and hypothesizes that affected patients may be at higher risk of developing cognitive decline after overcoming the primary COVID-19 infection.

The treatment, however, remains controversial but depends on institutional expertise. This case series reports the first experience with single-incision laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (SILTEP) repair of Spigelian hernias with telescopic extraperitoneal dissection in combination with inguinal hernia repair. METHODS From February 2013 to April 2014, all patients referred with inguinal or Spigelian hernias, without histories of extraperitoneal intervention, underwent SILTEP repair with telescopic extraperitoneal dissection. A single-port device, 5.5 mm/52 cm/30 angled laparoscope, and conventional straight dissecting instruments were used for all cases. Extraperitoneal dissection was performed under direct vision with preservation of preperitoneal fascia overlying retroperitoneal nerves. Inguinal herniorrhaphy was performed with lightweight mesh that covered low-lying Spigelian defects. High-lying Spigelian defects were repaired with additional mesh. RESULTS There were 131 patients with 186 (92 direct) inguinal hernias and 7 patients with 8 Spigelian hernias (6 incidental, including 1 bilateral and 2 preoperatively diagnosed), with a mean age of 51.3 years and a mean body mass index of 25.1 kg/m(2). An additional piece of mesh was used for 3 hernias. All Spigelian hernias were associated with direct inguinal hernias, and 8 combined inguinal and Spigelian hernias were successfully repaired with SILTEP repair with telescopic extraperitoneal dissection as day cases. There were no clinical recurrences during a mean follow-up period of 6 months (range, 1-15 months). CONCLUSIONS Combined Spigelian and inguinal hernias can be successfully treated with SILTEP herniorrhaphy with telescopic extraperitoneal dissection. The high incidence of Spigelian hernias associated with direct inguinal hernias suggests a high index of suspicion for Spigelian hernias during laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic repair of Spigelian hernia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 survivors who had acute respiratory symptoms might experience prolonged post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to further rehabilitation, somatic symptoms and related distress. The conservation of resource (COR) theory is a well-developed theory to understand how people develop PTSD symptoms in traumatic events. The current study aimed to examine the potential factors of PTSD symptoms and interrelationships among this factors among COVID-19 survivors based on the COR theory. This cross-sectional telephone survey enrolled 199 COVID-19 patients (Mean age = 42.7; 53.3% females) 6 months after their hospital discharge in five Chinese cities (i.e., Wuhan, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan, and Nanning). The results showed that 7% of participants were classified as having probable PTSD. The significant potential factors relating to PTSD symptoms included socio-demographic status, hospitalization experiences, post-hospitalization experiences, and psychological status. Besides, the proposed statistical mediation model based on the COR framework showed good model fit, (2)(df) = 17.286 (5), p = 0.004, CFI = 0.962, NNFI = 0.951, RMSEA = 0.077. Perceived resource loss/gain fully mediated the association between exposure to other patients' suffering during hospitalization and PTSD symptoms, and partially mediated the relationships from somatic symptoms/perceived impact of being infected with COVID-19 after discharge to PTSD symptoms. On the other hand, resilience was a full mediator in the relationship from ICU experience to PTSD symptoms and a partial mediator in the relationship from perceived impact to PTSD symptoms. The results provide preliminary support on applying the COR theory to understand the factors of PTSD symptoms among COVID-19 survivors. Interventions to reduce PTSD symptoms in this population can be developed based on the modifiable psychosocial mediators.","output":"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in COVID-19 Survivors 6 Months After Hospital Discharge: An Application of the Conservation of Resource Theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a broad, deep, and pervasive impact on our lives, our work, and how our justice system functions While it is easy to contemplate the ?system? as a massive behemoth that is impervious, impersonal, and impenetrable, the truth is that the ?system? is made up of people The men and women whose work is the building blocks of the justice system are individuals, each with their own narrative, experience, perspective, and role in the administration of justice To understand the system and the impact of COVID-19, it is essential to understand the stories of those who work in the system This article presents the individual and human stories of four professionals whose professional lives are a part of the justice system Each of these professionals tells their personal story of COVID-19 and reflects on how the pandemic affected them and their approach to the work that they do","output":"The Human Side of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As living in the midst of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic becomes the new normal, the heterogeneity in the burden and secondary mortality across global epidemics has become increasingly evident.

Although the potential benefits of sedation with volatile anesthetics in coronavirus disease 2019 patients are currently being discussed, the use of isoflurane in patients with coronavirus disease 2019Cinduced acute respiratory distress syndrome has not yet been reported. DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis of critically ill patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. SETTING: The study was conducted with patients admitted between April 4 and May 15, 2020 to our ICU. PATIENTS: We included five patients who were previously diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. INTERVENTION: Even with high doses of several IV sedatives, the targeted level of sedation could not be achieved. Therefore, the sedation regimen was switched to inhalational isoflurane. Clinical data were recorded using a patient data management system. We recorded demographical data, laboratory results, ventilation variables, sedative dosages, sedation level, prone positioning, duration of volatile sedation and outcomes. MEASUREMENTS & MAIN RESULTS: Mean age (four men, one women) was 53.0 ( 12.7) years. The mean duration of isoflurane sedation was 103.2 ( 66.2) hours. Our data demonstrate a substantial improvement in the oxygenation ratio when using isoflurane sedation. Deep sedation as assessed by the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale was rapidly and closely controlled in all patients, and the subsequent discontinuation of IV sedation was possible within the first 30 minutes.

This secondary analysis included 91 women randomised to self-monitoring who provided BP readings. Trial instructions were for daily SMBP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence was calculated as proportion of days on which SMBP readings were taken. Proportion of weeks in which at least 4 and at least 2 SMBP readings were taken was also calculated. Mean differences between clinic and SMBP measurements were calculated. RESULTS: Self-monitored BP data were available for 49 women with chronic hypertension and 42 women with gestational hypertension. Median percentage of days with SMBP readings was 77% (IQR 51, 89) in the chronic hypertension group and 85% (IQR 52, 95) in the gestational hypertension group. Adherence did not vary by different socio-demographic groups.

In the previous studies, various types of scaffolds and growth factors were used in impaired wound healing. However, there were several limitations to use them such as short half-life of growth factors in vivo and inadequate experimental conditions of wound-dressing material. Thus, our study aimed to determine the biocompatibility and stability of the matrix containing structurally stabilized epidermal growth factor (S-EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (S-bFGF). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We stabilized EGF and bFGF that are structurally more stable than existing EGF and bFGF. We developed biocompatible matrix using S-EGF, S-bFGF, and hyaluronate- collagen dressing (HCD) matrix. The developed matrix, S-EGF and S-bFGF loaded on HCD matrix, had no cytotoxicity, in vitro. Also, these matrixes had longer releasing period that result in enhancement of half-life. Finally, when these matrixes were applied on the wound of diabetic mice, there were no inflammatory responses, in vivo. Thus, our results demonstrate that these matrixes are biologically safe and biocompatible as wound-dressing material. CONCLUSIONS Our stabilized EGF and bFGF was more stable than existing EGF and bFGF and the HCD matrix had the capacity to efficiently deliver growth factors. Thus, the S-EGF and S-bFGF loaded on HCD matrix had improved stability.

An efficient patient handoff system is imperative to prevent miscommunication. Owning to limitations with our current handoff system and to an ever-increasing reliance on electronic health information, our residency program sought to modernize our handoff method. METHODS: To improve handoff communication, the HIPAA-compliant application Listrunner(?) was adopted. Members of the orthopaedic trauma team were oriented to the new application. Change-of-shift patient handoff was transitioned from the current email system to List-runner(?). After three months of using the new application, a web-based questionnaire was administered to all members of the care team to assess their experiences, including perceived benefits and limitations of the Listrunner(?) application. RESULTS: Seventeen orthopaedic resident physicians and three orthopaedic trauma attending physicians completed the survey. While almost half of the respondents were satisfied using email as a checkout tool, more than half of study participants indicated that it lacked security and several users believed there was a need for improvement.

We conducted a cross-cultural survey using demographically representative samples from the UK (n = 1533), USA (n = 1550) and Turkey (n = 1567). The most effective incentives in all three countries were vaccination of an expert scientist, followed by vaccination of friends and family members and knowing someone dying from the disease. Vaccination of an expert scientist was significantly more effective at increasing vaccine intention than any other incentive. Vaccine incentives, regardless of the incentive type, were much less effective for those who originally refused the COVID-19 vaccine than for those who were hesitant to receive the vaccine. Although the percentage of vaccine-hesitant participants was highest in Turkey, the mean effectiveness scores of incentives were also the highest in Turkey, suggesting that an informed vaccine promotion strategy can be successful in this country.

Recently, smokers have been found to be at higher risk of developing severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). E-cigarette aerosol inhalation (vaping) has been associated with several inflammatory lung disorders, including the recent e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) epidemic, and recent studies have suggested that vaping alters host susceptibility to pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To assess the impact of vaping on lung inflammatory pathways, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor known to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, mice were exposed to e-cigarette aerosols for 60 min daily for 1C6 months and underwent gene expression analysis. Hierarchical clustering revealed extensive gene expression changes occurred in the lungs of both inbred C57BL/6 mice and outbred CD1 mice, with 2,933 gene expression changes in C57BL/6 mice, and 2,818 gene expression changes in CD1 mice (>abs 1.25-fold change). Particularly, large reductions in IgA and CD4 were identified, indicating impairment of host responses to pathogens via reductions in immunoglobulins and CD4 T cells. CD177, facmr, tlr9, fcgr1, and ccr2 were also reduced, consistent with diminished host defenses via decreased neutrophils and/or monocytes in the lungs. Gene set enrichment (GSE) plots demonstrated upregulation of gene expression related to cell activation specifically in neutrophils. As neutrophils are a potential driver of acute lung injury in COVID-19, increased neutrophil activation in the lungs suggests that vapers are at higher risk of developing more severe forms of COVID-19. The receptor through which SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, ACE2, was found to have moderate upregulation in mice exposed to unflavored vape pens, and further upregulation (six-fold) with JUUL mint aerosol exposure. No changes were found in mice exposed to unflavored Mod device-generated aerosols. These findings suggest that specific vaping devices and components of e-liquids have an effect on ACE2 expression, thus potentially increasing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, exposure to e-cigarette aerosols both with and without nicotine led to alterations in eicosanoid lipid profiles within the BAL. These data demonstrate that chronic, daily inhalation of e-cigarette aerosols fundamentally alters the inflammatory and immune state of the lungs. Thus, e-cigarette vapers may be at higher risk of developing infections and inflammatory disorders of the lungs.","output":"Chronic E-Cigarette Aerosol Inhalation Alters the Immune State of the Lungs and Increases ACE2 Expression, Raising Concern for Altered Response and Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The fatality rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Italy is controversial and is greatly affecting discussion on the impact of containment measures that are straining the world's social and economic fabric, such as instigating large-scale isolation and quarantine, closing borders, imposing limits on public gatherings, and implementing nationwide lockdowns.

In this paper, we study LMTC under the zero-shot setting, which does not require any annotated documents with labels and only relies on label surface names and descriptions. To train a classifier that calculates the similarity score between a document and a label, we propose a novel metadata-induced contrastive learning (MICoL) method. Different from previous text-based contrastive learning techniques, MICoL exploits document metadata (e.g., authors, venues, and references of research papers), which are widely available on the Web, to derive similar document-document pairs. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets show that: (1) MICoL significantly outperforms strong zero-shot text classification and contrastive learning baselines; (2) MICoL is on par with the state-of-the-art supervised metadata-aware LMTC method trained on 10K-200K labeled documents; and (3) MICoL tends to predict more infrequent labels than supervised methods, thus alleviates the deteriorated performance on long-tailed labels.","output":"Metadata-Induced Contrastive Learning for Zero-Shot Multi-Label Text Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tremendous efforts are being made around the world to develop efficient ways to prevent/treat the novel -coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: : All English language published studies identified in our systematic search (up to February 3, 2021) examining the use of MSC-derived products to treat patients with COVID-19 were identified. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed for all studies. Nine studies were identified (189 patients) and four were controlled (93 patients). Three of the controlled studies reported on mortality (primary analysis) and were pooled through random effects meta-analysis. MSCs decreased the risk of death at study endpoint compared to controls (RR: 0.18, 0.04-0.74; p=0.02; I(2)=0%) although follow-up differed. Among secondary outcomes, IL-6 levels were most commonly reported and were decreased compared to controls (SMD: -0.69, -1.15 to -0.22, p=0.004; I(2)=0%) (n=3 studies).

A consensus statement on the preferred clinical pathway in the perioperative treatment of patients undergoing septorhinoplasty has yet to be approached formally. OBJECTIVES To investigate the perioperative treatment of patients undergoing septorhinoplasty and to identify common practice patterns based on the preferences of leading facial plastic surgeons. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We distributed an online survey to members of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. Specifically, fellowship directors and academic contact members were anonymously polled and stratified by the number of septorhinoplasties performed annually. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE A cohesive clinical guide to perioperative treatment after rhinoplasty. RESULTS Of the 92 members surveyed, 67 (73%) successfully completed the survey. The distribution of respondents included 43 academicians (64%) and 24 physicians in private practice (36%). Twenty-eight surgeons (42%) performed fewer than 50 rhinoplasties a year and 39 (58%), more than 50, representing 3510 to 4549 septorhinoplasties in total among respondents. Forty-four surgeons (66%) refrained from using any packing, and 41 (61%) used intranasal splints, with polymeric silicone splints the most popular of these (n = 24 [59%]). Sixty-six surgeons (99%) used external nasal splints, including 49 (74%) who used a thermoplastic splint and 49 (74%) who left the external nasal splint in place for 7 days or longer. The most common postoperative interventions to reduce edema and ecchymosis were elevation of the head of bed by 62 (93%), ice packs by 50 (75%), and Arnica montana by 33 (49%). Only 12 surgeons (18%) used postoperative corticosteroids to reduce edema. Fifty-six respondents (84%) prohibited participation in contact sports until at least 6 weeks after surgery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Perioperative care and practices after nasal surgery vary among the most highly trained and leading rhinoplasty surgeons. No published communication or consensus on perioperative practices has been disseminated in this setting. Given the results from those surgeons performing the most rhinoplasties in our field, some surgeons may choose to vary their practices to coincide with those of experienced surgeons. These guidelines could facilitate future studies of patient outcomes.","output":"Practice patterns in the perioperative treatment of patients undergoing septorhinoplasty: a survey of facial plastic surgeons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scale-up is the process of growing a venture in size. The paper identifies modularity and speed as keys to successful scale-up. On that basis four types of scale-up are identified: Smart, dumb, forced, and fumbled. Smart scale-up combines modularity and speed. Dumb scale-up is bespoke and slow, and very common. The paper presents examples of each type of scale-up, explaining why they were successful or not. Whether you are a small startup or Elon Musk trying to grow Tesla and SpaceX or Jeff Bezos scaling up Amazon - or you are the US, UK, Chinese, or other government trying to increase power production, expand your infrastructure, or make your health, education, and social services work better - modularity and speed are the answer to effective delivery, or so the paper argues. How well you deal with modularity and speed decides whether your efforts succeed or fail. Most ventures, existing or planned, are neither fully smart nor fully dumb, but have elements of both. Successful organizations work to tip the balance towards smart by (a) introducing elements of smart scale-up into existing ventures and (b) starting new, fully smart-scaled ventures, to make themselves less dumb and ever smarter.","output":"Four Ways to Scale Up: Smart, Dumb, Forced, and Fumbled"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Characterization of protein complexes, i.e. sets of proteins assembling into a single larger physical entity, is important, as such assemblies play many essential roles in cells such as gene regulation. From networks of protein-protein interactions, potential protein complexes can be identified computationally through the application of community detection methods, which flag groups of entities interacting with each other in certain patterns. Most community detection algorithms tend to be unsupervised and assume that communities are dense network subgraphs, which is not always true, as protein complexes can exhibit diverse network topologies. The few existing supervised machine learning methods are serial and can potentially be improved in terms of accuracy and scalability by using better-suited machine learning models and parallel algorithms. Here, we present Super.Complex, a distributed, supervised AutoML-based pipeline for overlapping community detection in weighted networks. We also propose three new evaluation measures for the outstanding issue of comparing sets of learned and known communities satisfactorily. Super.Complex learns a community fitness function from known communities using an AutoML method and applies this fitness function to detect new communities. A heuristic local search algorithm finds maximally scoring communities, and a parallel implementation can be run on a computer cluster for scaling to large networks. On a yeast protein-interaction network, Super.Complex outperforms 6 other supervised and 4 unsupervised methods. Application of Super.Complex to a human protein-interaction network with ~8k nodes and ~60k edges yields 1,028 protein complexes, with 234 complexes linked to SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 virus, with 111 uncharacterized proteins present in 103 learned complexes. Super.Complex is generalizable with the ability to improve results by incorporating domain-specific features. Learned community characteristics can also be transferred from existing applications to detect communities in a new application with no known communities.

Most women were exclusively breastfeeding (82%). Partial breastfeeding was associated with perceived low milk supply and longer pregnancy duration during the pandemic. Reduced mental health and wellbeing was associated with lower levels of family functioning, increased perceived stress, and perinatal anxiety. Longer pregnancy duration during the pandemic was associated with lower mental health wellbeing scores, while higher perceived stress scores were reported for regions with higher COVID-19 infection rates and women with perceived low milk supply. Women reported that the pandemic resulted in less pressure and more time for family bonding, while worries about the pandemic, family health, and parenting challenges were also cited.

A controlled, randomized, blocked, blind experiment containing 680 lactating pregnant dairy cows with a viable embryo diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography was performed. Two dairy operation sites (farm A and farm B) were selected. At each farm, the cows were randomly divided into control (CON) and ASP groups. The CON group was not subjected to pregnancy diagnosis via per rectum palpation. The ASP examinations were performed by one experienced veterinarian between Days 34 and 45 after breeding. All cows were reevaluated by transrectal ultrasonography only between 2 and 4 weeks later. Two calving rates were calculated: calving rate 1 (cows that calved from the initial number of pregnant cows) and calving rate 2 (cows that calved from cows pregnant at reexamination). In farm A, the percentages of early pregnancy loss were 11.5% (19 of 165) and 13.2% (24 of 182) for the CON and the ASP groups, respectively (P = 0.64). In farm B, the percentage of early pregnancy loss was 11.2% (19 of 170) for the CON group and 8.8% (14 of 159; P = 0.48) for the ASP group. In farm A, the percentage of late pregnancy loss was 7.6% (11 of 145) for the CON group and 5.5% (8 of 155; P = 0.39) for the ASP group. In farm B, the percentage of late pregnancy loss was 3.7% (5 of 137) for the CON group and 6.3% (8 of 127; P = 0.32) for the ASP group. In farm A, early pregnancy loss was higher than late pregnancy loss (12.4% vs. 6.3%; P = 0.01), and in farm B, the same tendency was detected (10.0% vs. 4.9%, for early and late pregnancy loss, respectively; P = 0.02).

LTF was produced by a single pulse of 5-HT 30 min after the membrane depolarization. This LTF was blocked when either ApLLP or ApC/EBP were blocked by specific antibodies. In contrast, ApLLP overexpression induced LTF in response to a single 5-HT treatment. Simultaneously, a siphon noxious stimulus (SNS) to intact Aplysia induced ApLLP and ApC/EBP expression, and single tail shock 30 min after SNS transformed short-term sensitization to long-term sensitization of siphon withdrawal reflex.

We aimed to examine the link between vitamin D supplementation and prevention of ARIs in an updated meta-analysis. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for studies listed from database inception to May 1, 2020. Double-blind RCTs of vitamin D3, vitamin D2, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) supplementation for any duration, with a placebo or low-dose vitamin D control, were eligible if they had been approved by a research ethics committee, and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy outcome. Studies reporting results of long-term follow-up of primary RCTs were excluded. Aggregated study-level data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, were obtained from study authors. Using the proportion of participants in each trial who had one or more ARIs, we did a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs to estimate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs (primary outcome) compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses were done to estimate whether the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25(OH)D concentration (<25 nmol/L vs 250-499 nmol/L vs 500-749 nmol/L vs >750 nmol/L), vitamin D dose (daily equivalent of <400 international units [IU] vs 400-1000 IU vs 1001-2000 IU vs >2000 IU), dosing frequency (daily vs weekly vs once per month to once every 3 months), trial duration (&#8804;12 months vs >12 months), age at enrolment (<100 years vs 100-1599 years vs 1600-6499 years vs &#8805;6500 years), and presence versus absence of airway disease (ie, asthma only, COPD only, or unrestricted). Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020190633. FINDINGS: We identified 1528 articles, of which 46 RCTs (75 541 participants) were eligible. Data for the primary outcome were obtained for 48 488 (981%) of 49 419 participants (aged 0-95 years) in 43 studies. A significantly lower proportion of participants in the vitamin D supplementation group had one or more ARIs (14 332 [613%] of 23 364 participants) than in the placebo group (14 217 [623%] of 22 802 participants), with an OR of 092 (95% CI 086-099; 37 studies; I2=356%, pheterogeneity=0018). No significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs was observed for any of the subgroups defined by baseline 25(OH)D concentration. However, protective effects of supplementation were observed in trials in which vitamin D was given in a daily dosing regimen (OR 078 [95% CI 065-094]; 19 studies; I2=535%, pheterogeneity=0003), at daily dose equivalents of 400-1000 IU (070 [055-089]; ten studies; I2=312%, pheterogeneity=016), for a duration of 12 months or less (082 [072-093]; 29 studies; I2=381%, pheterogeneity=0021), and to participants aged 100-1599 years at enrolment (071 [057-090]; 15 studies; I2=460%, pheterogeneity=0027). No significant interaction between allocation to the vitamin D supplementation group versus the placebo group and dose, dose frequency, study duration, or age was observed. In addition, no significant difference in the proportion of participants who had at least one serious adverse event in the vitamin supplementation group compared with the placebo group was observed (097 [086-107]; 36 studies; I2=00%, pheterogeneity=099). Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed as being low for all but three trials. INTERPRETATION: Despite evidence of significant heterogeneity across trials, vitamin D supplementation was safe and overall reduced the risk of ARI compared with placebo, although the risk reduction was small. Protection was associated with administration of daily doses of 400-1000 IU for up to 12 months, and age at enrolment of 100-1599 years.

METHODS A convenience sample of 22 EMT/Paramedics were recruited from an emergency department at one of the designated Ebola centers. Each provider participated in one of three on-site focus groups. Participants answered questions about how they gained their knowledge, felt about caring for EVD patients, made decisions about caring for EVD patients, and suggestions for improvement of ID preparedness. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and coded using inductive content analysis. RESULTS Analysis revealed five prominent themes: reactions to scare, education/training, danger, decision making, and suggestions for future responses. Overall, first responders were excited to be a part of the response to EVD. They were more comfortable caring for EVD patients if they received adequate education and transparency from the administration. This resulted in a decreased perceived danger of the disease and decreased hesitancy when caring for EVD patients. However, those that expressed the most hesitancy also expressed the most emotional distress. Suggestions for improvement of ID preparedness included continuing education, tiered training models, peer training models, collaboration between emergency medical services (EMS) systems, better communication between departments, and the development of an infectious disease response team. CONCLUSIONS Although first responders were excited to be a part of the response to EVD, this did not come without hesitation and emotional distress. Some of these concerns may be mitigated by first providing a clear definition of \\"duty to care,\\" followed by interventions such as the development of clear and consistent ID preparedness training and interventions that address the emotional distress experienced by these providers.","output":"Caring for Infectious Disease in the Prehospital Setting: A Qualitative Analysis of EMS Providers Experiences and Suggestions for Improvement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December of 2019, novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has spread around the world infecting millions of people and upending the global economy. One of the driving reasons behind its high rate of infection is due to the unreliability and lack of RT-PCR testing. At times the turnaround results span as long as a couple of days, only to yield a roughly 70% sensitivity rate. As an alternative, recent research has investigated the use of Computer Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19 from CT scans. Due to an inherent lack of available COVID-19 CT data, these research efforts have been forced to leverage the use of Transfer Learning. This commonly employed Deep Learning technique has shown to improve model performance on tasks with relatively small amounts of data, as long as the Source feature space somewhat resembles the Target feature space. Unfortunately, a lack of similarity is often encountered in the classification of medical images as publicly available Source datasets usually lack the visual features found in medical images. In this study, we propose the use of Multi-Source Transfer Learning (MSTL) to improve upon traditional Transfer Learning for the classification of COVID-19 from CT scans. With our multi-source fine-tuning approach, our models outperformed baseline models fine-tuned with ImageNet. We additionally, propose an unsupervised label creation process, which enhances the performance of our Deep Residual Networks.

OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of interventions to improve routine health information systems in terms of RHIS performance, and also, in terms of improved health system management performance, and improved patient and population health outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid and Embase Ovid in May 2019. We searched Global Health, Ovid and PsycInfo in April 2016. In January 2020 we searched for grey literature in the Grey Literature Report and in OpenGrey, and for ongoing trials using the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. In October 2019 we also did a cited reference search using Web of Science, and a 'similar articles' search in PubMed. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised and non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and time-series studies comparing routine health information system interventions, with controls, in primary, hospital or community health care settings. Participants included clinical staff and management, district management and community health workers using routine information systems. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently reviewed records to identify studies for inclusion, extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of bias. Interventions and outcomes were too varied across studies to allow for pooled risk analysis. We present a 'Summary of findings' table for each intervention comparisons broadly categorised into Technical and Organisational (or a combination), and report outcomes on data quality and service quality. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS We included six studies: four cluster randomised trials and two controlled before-after studies, from Africa and South America. Three studies evaluated technical interventions, one study evaluated an organisational intervention, and two studies evaluated a combination of technical and organisational interventions. Four studies reported on data quality and six studies reported on service quality. In terms of data quality, a web-based electronic TB laboratory information system probably reduces the length of time to reporting of TB test results, and probably reduces the overall rate of recording errors of TB test results, compared to a paper-based system (moderate certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of the electronic laboratory information system on the recording rate of serious (misidentification) errors for TB test results compared to a paper-based system (very low certainty evidence). Misidentification errors are inaccuracies in transferring test results between an electronic register and patients' clinical charts. We are also uncertain about the effect of the intervention on service quality (timeliness of starting or changing a patient's TB treatment) (very low certainty evidence). A hand-held electronic device probably improves the length of time to report TB test results, and probably reduces the total frequency of recording errors in TB test results between the laboratory notebook and the electronic information record system, compared to a paper-based system (moderate-certainty evidence). We are, however, uncertain about the effect of the intervention on the frequency of serious (misidentification) errors in recording between the laboratory notebook and the electronic information record, compared to a paper-based system (very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of a hospital electronic health information system on service quality (length of time outpatients spend at hospital, length of hospital stay, and hospital revenue collection), compared to a paper-based system (very low certainty evidence). High-intensity brief text messaging (SMS) may make little or no difference to data quality (in terms of completeness of documentation of pregnancy outcomes), compared to low-intensity brief text messaging (low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of electronic drug stock notification (with either data management support or product transfer support) on service quality (in terms of transporting stock and stock levels), compared to paper-based stock notification (very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of health information strengthening (where it is part of comprehensive service quality improvement intervention) on service quality (health worker motivation, receipt of training by health workers, health information index scores, quality of clinical observation of children and adults) (very low certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The review indicates mixed effects of mainly technical interventions to improve data quality, with gaps in evidence on interventions aimed at enhancing data-informed health system management. There is a gap in interventions studying information support beyond clinical management, such as for human resources, finances, drug supply and governance. We need to have a better understanding of the causal mechanisms by which information support may affect change in management decision-making, to inform robust intervention design and evaluation methods.","output":"Routine Health Information System (RHIS) improvements for strengthened health system management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has captured the world's attention, especially regarding the risk of stress.

Methods A total of 411 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in Kinshasa University Hospital and categorized into two groups according to the pandemic pattern, demographics, and disease severity. The clinical characteristics were compared according to the two waves. To describe survival from the first day of hospitalization until death, we used Kaplan Meier method. We used the Log Rank test to compare the survival curves between the two waves. The Cox regression was used to identify independent predictors of mortality. Results During the study period, 411 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital. The average age of patients in the 2nd wave was higher than in the first wave (between 34.9 and 67.9 years old vs between 58. 42.4 and 73.8 years old, p=0.026). The mean saturation was lower in the first wave than in the second. The death rate of patients in the first wave was higher than in the second wave (p=0.009). Survival was reduced in the first wave compared to the second wave. In the first wave, age over 60 years, respiratory distress, law oxygen saturation (lower than 89%) and severe stage of COVID-19 emerged as factors associated with death, while in the second wave it was mainly respiratory distress, law oxygen saturation (lower than 89%) and severe stage. The predictors of mortality present in both the first and second waves were respiratory distress and severe COVID-19 stage. Conclusion Mortality decreased in the second wave. Age no longer emerged as a factor in mortality in the second wave. Health system strengthening and outreach to those at high risk of mortality should continue to maintain and improve gains.

We determined COVID-19 status by PCR and metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). We compared clinical presentation, diagnostics, treatment, and outcomes. FINDINGS: Among 316 patients, 33 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 31 without COVID-19 tested positive for another respiratory virus. Among patients with additional viral testing (27/33), no SARS-CoV-2 co-infections were identified. Compared to those who tested negative, patients with COVID-19 reported longer symptoms duration (median 7d vs. 3d, p < 0.001). Patients with COVID-19 were more often hospitalized (79% vs. 56%, p = 0.014).

Several pathogens, including Escherichia coli (E. coli), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), and even the recent 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), can cause serious breathing and brain disorders, tissue injury and inflammation, leading to high rates of mortality and resulting in great loss to human physical and mental health as well as the global economy. These infectious diseases exploit the microbial and host factors to induce serious inflammatory and immunological symptoms. Thus the development of anti-inflammatory drugs targeting bacterial/viral infection is an urgent need. In previous studies, YojI-IFNAR2, YojI-IL10RA, YojI-NRP1,YojI-SIGLEC7, and YojI-MC4R membrane-protein interactions were found to mediate E. coli invasion of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which activated the downstream anti-inflammatory proteins NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 2(NLRP2), using a proteomic chip conjugated with cell immunofluorescence labeling. However, the studies of pathogen (bacteria/virus)-host cell interactions mediated by membrane protein interactions did not extend their principles to broad biomedical applications such as 2019-nCoV infectious disease therapy. The first part of this feature article presents in-depth analysis of the cross-talk of cellular anti-inflammatory transduction signaling among interferon membrane protein receptor II (IFNAR2), interleukin-10 receptor subunit alpha (IL-10RA), NLRP2 and [Ca2+]-dependent phospholipase A2 (PLA2G5), based on experimental results and important published studies, which lays a theoretical foundation for the high-throughput construction of the cytokine and virion solution chip. The paper then moves on to the construction of the novel GPCR recombinant herpes virion chip and virion nano-oscillators for profiling membrane protein functions, which drove the idea of constructing the new recombinant virion and cytokine liquid chips for HTS of leading drugs. Due to the different structural properties of GPCR, IFNAR2, ACE2 and Spike of 2019-nCoV, their ligands will either bind the extracellular domain of IFNAR2/ACE2/Spike or the specific loops of the GPCR on the envelope of the recombinant herpes virions to induce dynamic charge distribution changes that lead to the variable electron transition for detection.

It is also possible, at least in theory, for proteostasis mechanisms that promote strict quality control to greatly constrain accessible protein sequence space. Unfortunately, most efforts to understand how proteostasis mechanisms influence evolution rely on artificial inhibition or genetic knockdown of specific chaperones. The few experiments that perturb quality control pathways also generally modulate the levels of only individual quality control factors. Here, we use chemical genetic strategies to tune proteostasis networks via natural stress response pathways that regulate the levels of entire suites of chaperones and quality control mechanisms. Specifically, we upregulate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to test the hypothesis that the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis network shapes the sequence space accessible to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) protein. Elucidating factors that enhance or constrain Env sequence space is critical because Env evolves extremely rapidly, yielding HIV strains with antibody- and drug-escape mutations. We find that UPR-mediated upregulation of ER proteostasis factors, particularly those controlled by the IRE1-XBP1s UPR arm, globally reduces Env mutational tolerance. Conserved, functionally important Env regions exhibit the largest decreases in mutational tolerance upon XBP1s induction. Our data indicate that this phenomenon likely reflects strict quality control endowed by XBP1s-mediated remodeling of the ER proteostasis environment. Intriguingly, and in contrast, specific regions of Env, including regions targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies, display enhanced mutational tolerance when XBP1s is induced, hinting at a role for host proteostasis network hijacking in potentiating antibody escape. These observations reveal a key function for proteostasis networks in decreasing instead of expanding the sequence space accessible to client proteins, while also demonstrating that the host ER proteostasis network profoundly shapes the mutational tolerance of Env in ways that could have important consequences for HIV adaptation.","output":"The endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis network profoundly shapes the protein sequence space accessible to HIV envelope"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in December 2019, when the first cases were reported in Wuhan, China.

RESULTS: WeChat Index hits for \\"Feidian\\" (which means severe acute respiratory syndrome in Chinese) stayed at low levels until 16 days ahead of the local authority's outbreak announcement on December 31, 2019, when the index increased significantly. The WeChat Index values persisted at relatively high levels from December 15 to 29, 2019, and rose rapidly on December 30, 2019, the day before the announcement.

One factor likely to motivate individuals is the extent they have a sense of purpose in life, based on the health correlates of purpose and purposeful individuals desire to return to their pre-pandemic environments. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined sense of purpose as a predictor of COVID-19 vaccination willingness in the United States immediately following the initial approval of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States in 2020. METHODS: A nationwide sample of U. S. adults (N = 2009) completed a poll including information on their sense of purpose in life, demographic factors, and depressive symptoms, immediately following the initial approval of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States in 2020. In addition, they reported on how willing they would be to get the vaccine, assuming that the costs would be covered, as well as their motivations to get the vaccine. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses found that sense of purpose predicted greater willingness to get vaccinated, even when accounting for demographic factors, political affiliation, and psychological wellbeing. Adults higher on sense of purpose reported greater importance of getting the vaccine for personal health, the health of others, and to return to regular activities. Exploratory analyses also suggest that purpose may provide a stronger impetus to vaccinate among those in age groups associated with lower risk for severe COVID-19 complications. Conclusions: Although cross-sectional in nature, the current findings suggest sense of purpose in life may be an important factor in encouraging vaccination.

Diagnostic tools require rapid and accurate methods, of which a capture ELISA method may be useful. Toward this goal, we have prepared and characterized soluble full\\\\length nucleocapsid proteins (N protein) from SARS and 229E human coronaviruses. N proteins form oligomers, mostly as dimers at low concentration. These two N proteins degrade rapidly upon storage and the major degraded N protein is the C\\\\terminal fragment of amino acid (aa) 169C422. Taken together with other data, we suggest that N protein is a two\\\\domain protein, with the N\\\\terminal aa 50C150 as the RNA\\\\binding domain and the C\\\\terminal aa 169C422 as the dimerization domain. Polyclonal antibodies against the SARS N protein have been produced and the strong binding sites of the anti\\\\nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibodies produced were mapped to aa 1C20, aa 150C170 and aa 390C410. These sites are generally consistent with those mapped by sera obtained from SARS patients. The SARS anti\\\\NP antibody was able to clearly detect SARS virus grown in Vero E6 cells and did not cross\\\\react with the NP from the human coronavirus 229E. We have predicted several antigenic sites (15C20 amino acids) of S, M and N proteins and produced antibodies against those peptides, some of which could be recognized by sera obtained from SARS patients. Antibodies against the NP peptides could detect the cognate N protein clearly. Further refinement of these antibodies, particularly large\\\\scale production of monoclonal antibodies, could lead to the development of useful diagnostic kits for diseases associated with SARS and other human coronaviruses.","output":"Biochemical and immunological studies of nucleocapsid proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome and 229E human coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Remote or mobile consulting (mConsulting) is being promoted to strengthen health systems, deliver universal health coverage and facilitate safe clinical communication during COVID-19 and beyond. We explored whether mConsulting is a viable option for communities with minimal resources in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods We reviewed evidence published since 2018 about mConsulting in LMICs and undertook a scoping study (pre-COVID) in two rural settings (Pakistan, Tanzania) and five urban slums (Kenya, Nigeria, Bangladesh), using policy/document review, secondary analysis of survey data (from the urban sites), and thematic analysis of interviews/workshops with community members, healthcare workers, digital/telecommunications experts, mConsulting providers, local and national decision-makers. Project advisory groups guided the study in each country. Results We reviewed five empirical studies and seven reviews, analysed data from 5,219 urban slum households and engaged with 419 stakeholders in rural and urban sites. Regulatory frameworks are available in each country. mConsulting services are operating through provider platforms (n=5-17) and, at community-level, some direct experience of mConsulting with healthcare workers using their own phones was reported - for emergencies, advice and care follow-up. Stakeholder willingness was high, provided challenges are addressed in technology, infrastructure, data security, confidentiality, acceptability and health system integration. mConsulting can reduce affordability barriers and facilitate care-seeking practices.

It is unclear if these markers are associated with severe infection in patients with cancer due to underlying tumor related inflammation. We sought to further understand the inflammatory response related to COVID-19 infection in patients with gynecologic cancer. Methods: Patients with a history of gynecologic cancer hospitalized for COVID-19 infection with available laboratory data were identified. Admission laboratory values and clinical outcomes were abstracted from electronic medical records. Severe infection was defined as infection requiring ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or resulting in death. Results: 86 patients with gynecologic cancer were hospitalized with COVID-19 infection with a median age of 68.5 years (interquartile range (IQR), 59.0C74.8). Of the 86 patients, 29 (33.7%) patients required ICU admission and 25 (29.1%) patients died of COVID-19 complications. Fifty (58.1%) patients had active cancer and 36 (41.9%) were in remission. Patients with severe infection had significantly higher ferritin (median 1163.0 vs 624.0 ng/mL, p < 0.01), procalcitonin (median 0.8 vs 0.2 ng/mL, p < 0.01), and C-reactive protein (median 142.0 vs 62.3 mg/L, p = 0.02) levels compared to those with moderate infection. White blood cell count, lactate, and creatinine were also associated with severe infection. D-dimer levels were not significantly associated with severe infection (p = 0.20).

The current work is to investigate the effect and possible mechanism of Uncaria rhynchophylla (UR) on thioacetamide- (TAA-) induced ALI in rats. UR (100 and 200 mg/kg) was orally administrated with TAA (200 mg/kg of bodyweight, intraperitoneal injection) for 3 consecutive days. ALI was confirmed using histological examination and the factors associated with OS and liver function activity measured in serum. Moreover, expressions of inflammation and collagen-related proteins were measured by the Western blot analysis. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), which mediates OS in the ALI control group, was manifested by a significant rise compared with the normal group. UR significantly reduced AST, ALT, and ammonia levels in serum. The nuclear factor-B (NF-B) activation induced by TAA led to increase both inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Whereas, UR administration remarkably suppressed such an overexpression. UR supplementation improved matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-1, -2, and -8. In contrast, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases- (TIMP-) 1 level increased significantly by UR treatment. In addition, the histopathological analysis showed that the liver tissue lesions were improved obviously by UR treatment. UR may ameliorate the effects of TAA-induced ALI in rats by suppressing both OS through MPO activation and proinflammatory factors through NF-B activation. In conclusion, UR exhibited a potent hepatoprotective effect on ALI through the suppression of OS.","output":"Effect of Uncaria rhynchophylla against Thioacetamide-Induced Acute Liver Injury in Rat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine rates of emerging adults (EA) adherence to preventative health behavior recommendations during early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate demographic (i.e., gender, years of education, socioeconomic status, school enrollment status, and living situation) and exposure and impact-related correlates of adherence. METHODS: Participants were 273 [M (SD) age = 22 (2.1) years, 55% female, 32% from minoritized groups] EA completed an online survey of adherence to 11 preventative health behaviors recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during summer 2020. Participants rated adherence via a visual analog scale. Participants also reported demographic information and completed the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Adolescent and Young Adult Version (CEFIS-AYA). RESULTS: Median levels of adherence to preventative recommendations ranged from 66% to 100%. Highest adherence levels (Mdn > 90%) were reported for quarantining if exposed to COVID-19; covering mouth when sneezing; avoiding the elderly/those at high risk; and avoiding large gatherings. Median adherence was <80% for mask wearing; maintaining a 6-foot distance; avoiding in-person visits with romantic partners or friends; and disinfecting surfaces. Female gender was the only variable significantly associated with overall adherence, and it explained 4% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Following guidelines related to social distancing practices may be particularly challenging for EA, possibly because of unique developmental needs of this group, and males may be at greater risk for non-adherence to CDC recommendations.

While the course of pediatric COVID-19 infections is mostly asymptomatic or very mild, patients with immunosuppressive therapy are at high risk of a severe infection. We conducted a multicenter survey with pediatric heart transplantation centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland (15 centers) to evaluate the risk of a severe COVID-19 infection after pediatric heart transplantation. Method: Retrospective analyses of all COVID-19 infections between February 2020 and June 2021 of patients after pediatric heart transplantation with medical care in one of the German, Austrian, or Swiss pediatric heart transplantation centers. Results: Twenty-one patients (nine male) with a mean age of 8.34  5.33 years at time of transplantation and on average 8.33  8.49 years after transplantation suffered from COVID-19 infection. Reasons for transplantation were dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 17), restrictive cardiomyopathy (n = 2), and congenital heart disease (n = 2). The immunosuppressive therapy consisted of tacrolimus (n = 17), cyclosporine A (n = 3), everolimus (n = 10), mycophenolate mofetil (n = 11), azathioprine (n = 1), and steroids (n = 3). Twelve patients had an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, the other patients complained about cough (n = 3), rhinitis (n = 3), fever (n = 2), myalgia/fatigue (n = 5), diarrhea (n = 1), pain (n = 2), anosmia (n = 3), and loss of taste (n = 4). None of the patients showed dyspnea or reduced left ventricular function. Only one patient showed an increase in the degree of tricuspid regurgitation. Eight patients needed therapy in an outpatient setting and only two patients were hospitalized. One of these patients had a positive SARS-CoV-2 testing while on ICU early after heart transplantation. Interestingly, this patient had had a COVID-19 infection some weeks before heart transplantation. None of the patients needed oxygen supply or noninvasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation. None of the patients needed a change of the immunosuppressive medication. No specific signs for graft dysfunction were found by noninvasive testing (echocardiography or electrocardiogram).

In an effort to understand how early action to find and control the virus is associated with cumulative outcomes, we explored how country\\\\level testing capacity affects later COVID\\\\19 mortality. METHODS: We used the Our World in Data database to explore testing and mortality records in 27 countries from December 31, 2019, to September 30, 2020; we applied Cox proportional hazards regression to determine the relationship between early COVID\\\\19 testing capacity (cumulative tests per case) and later COVID\\\\19 mortality (time to specified mortality thresholds), adjusting for country\\\\level confounders, including median age, GDP, hospital bed capacity, population density, and nonpharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: Higher early testing implementation, as indicated by more cumulative tests per case when mortality was still low, was associated with a lower risk for higher per capita deaths. A sample finding indicated that a higher cumulative number of tests administered per case at the time of six deaths per million persons was associated with a lower risk of reaching 15 deaths per million persons, after adjustment for all confounders (HR = 0.909; P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Countries that developed stronger COVID\\\\19 testing capacity at early timepoints, as measured by tests administered per case identified, experienced a slower increase of deaths per capita.

The pathogenesis of the disease is not precisely understood, and its attacks are often unpredictable but tend to worsen during the summer. LV affects women more often. This increased risk for LV in women might be related to sex-specific physiological conditions, such as pregnancy, or a higher incidence of LV-associated conditions, such as connective tissue diseases, hypercoagulable states, and venous stasis in women. The typical clinical appearance of LV consists of three main findings: livedo racemose, atrophie blanche, and skin ulcers. The purpose of this comprehensive review was to analyze LV in all aspects and mainly focus on early diagnosis for successful clinical management with a holistic and multidisciplinary approach. A detailed history, dermatological examination, and laboratory testing are essential for a diagnosis of LV. When LV is clinically suspected, a skin biopsy should be taken to confirm the diagnosis. Another critical step is to investigate the underlying associated conditions, such as connective tissue diseases, hypercoagulable states, thrombophilia, and malignancy. Unfortunately, no associated conditions can be detected in approximately 20% of all cases (idiopathic LV) despite all efforts. The diagnosis of the disease is delayed in most patients. Thus, irreversible, permanent scars appear. Early and appropriate treatment reduces pain and prevents the development of scars and other complications. Antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants can be preferred as the first-line treatments along with general supportive measures. Other therapeutic options might be considered in unresponsive cases. Preference for refractory cases is based on availability, clinical experience, and patient-related factors (comorbidities, age, sex, and compliance).

We used linear regression to determine whether RVP was associated with length of stay (LOS), duration of antibiotics and the number of diagnostic microbiology tests ordered, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS We found that the association between results of the RVP and LOS was dependent on a patient's admission service, specifically admission to the hematology/oncology service. We also found that patients with a positive RVP had a shorter duration of intravenous antibiotic administration (P = 0.03; 42% reduction in the geometric mean), but that this was influenced by the primary admission service. We also found that positive results of the RVP were associated with decreased LOS and shorter duration of antibiotics in patients with some common respiratory diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS This study lacked sufficient evidence to claim an association between a positive RVP and LOS in pediatric patients, adjusting for their underlying diagnosis. However, we found that a positive RVP was associated with a shorter duration of intravenous antibiotic administration in certain groups of patients and those with some common respiratory diagnoses. These findings help clarify the utility of rapid viral testing in the management of hospitalized pediatric patients.","output":"Role of a respiratory viral panel in the clinical management of pediatric inpatients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Multiple gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver enzyme abnormalities, have been variably reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The American Gastroenterological Association Institute Clinical Guideline Committee and Clinical Practice Updates Committee performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data on GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify published and unpublished studies using OVID Medline and preprint servers (medRxiv, LitCovid, and SSRN [Social Science Research] up until April 5, 2020; major journal sites were monitored for US publications until April 19, 2020. We analyzed the prevalence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver function tests abnormalities, using a fixed-effect model and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. RESULTS: We identified 118 studies and used a hierarchal study selection process to identify unique cohorts. We performed a meta-analysis of 47 studies including 10,890 unique patients. Pooled prevalence estimates of GI symptoms were as follows: diarrhea 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2%-8.2%), nausea/vomiting 7.8% (95% CI, 7.1%-8.5%), and abdominal pain 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%). Most studies reported on hospitalized patients. The pooled prevalence estimates of elevated liver abnormalities were as follows: aspartate transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.5%) and alanine transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.4%). When analyzed comparing data from China to studies from countries other than China, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and liver abnormalities were more prevalent outside of China, with diarrhea reported in 18.3% (95% CI, 16.6%-20.1%). Isolated GI symptoms were reported rarely. We also summarized the Gl and liver adverse effects of the most commonly utilized medications for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 in <10% of patients. In studies outside of China, estimates are higher. Further studies are needed with standardized GI symptoms questionnaires and liver function test checks on admission to better quantify and qualify the association of these symptoms with COVID-19.

Materials and Methods Clinical data, including demographics, signs, symptoms, comorbidities and blood test results and chest CT scans of 346 patients from two hospitals in the Hubei province, China, were used to develop machine learning models for automated severity assessment of diagnosed COVID-19 cases. We compared the predictive power of clinical and imaging data by testing multiple machine learning models, and further explored the use of four oversampling methods to address the imbalance distribution issue. Features with the highest predictive power were identified using the SHAP framework. Results Targeting differentiation between mild and severe cases, logistic regression models achieved the best performance on clinical features (AUC:0.848, sensitivity:0.455, specificity:0.906), imaging features (AUC:0.926, sensitivity:0.818, specificity:0.901) and the combined features (AUC:0.950, sensitivity:0.764, specificity:0.919). The SMOTE oversampling method further improved the performance of the combined features to AUC of 0.960 (sensitivity:0.845, specificity:0.929). Discussion Imaging features had the strongest impact on the model output, while a combination of clinical and imaging features yielded the best performance overall. The identified predictive features were consistent with findings from previous studies. Oversampling yielded mixed results, although it achieved the best performance in our study. Conclusions This study indicates that clinical and imaging features can be used for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 patients and have the potential to assist with triaging COVID-19 patients and prioritizing care for patients at higher risk of severe cases.

METHODS Volunteers from employees of the animal market were recruited and their serum specific antibody against SARS-CoV were determined by enzyme linked immunesorbent assay (ELISA) method. RESULTS Positive SARS-CoV specific IgG antibody was found 25.61% (n = 328), 13.03% (n = 238), 12.59% (n = 135), 5.04% (n = 139) and 9.43% (n = 53) among volunteers, which were sampled in May 2003, Dec. 2003, Jan. 2004, July 2004 and June 2005 respectively. No specific IgM antibody was found in all of those samples. Among 129 samples which were tested twice or more, 97 were all negative, 18 all positive, 13 changed from positive to negative but only one sample from negative to positive. When the volunteers were divided by the duration of their working experiences as short-term or long-term, those who had worked at animal market for less than or more then 6 months when being tested, the positive rate for long-term employees were relatively constant, however, all of the persons employed after January 2004, when the palm civets and raccoon dogs were culled from the market, were tested negative. CONCLUSION The prevalence of specific antibody against SARS-CoV in employees of the animal market were somehow related with the presence or absence of palm civet. No serum was tested positive for persons who were employed after palm civets and raccoon dogs were culled from market. This data indicated that the SARS-CoV might have been from the palm civets and raccoon dog, and the animal market seemed to serve as one of the sources of infection.","output":"[Study on the dynamic prevalence of serum antibody against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in employees from wild animal market in Guangzhou]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the question of devolution in the light of the Covid\\\\19 pandemics impact on English local government Criticism of the governments handling of the crisis is widespread and tends to focus on the highly centralised nature of the British state Here, we attribute the challenges faced by regional and local government in responding to the pandemic primarily to the asymmetric nature of power relations that characterise financial planning and control mechanisms, devised and overseen by the Treasury We argue that the ongoing crisis underlines the need for a democratic form of devolutionincluding further fiscal powers for regional and local governmentto support the economic recovery In a context of increasing fiscal uncertainty, the Treasury should seek to unlock the existing powers of local leaders by reforming centralised budgetary constraints and taking accountability and monitoring mechanisms closer to citizens [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Political Quarterly is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"English Devolution and the Covid\\\\19 Pandemic: Governing Dilemmas in the Shadow of the Treasury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is increased energy requirements associated with the higher rate of cellular proliferative activity.

In this article, two authors (T.V. and N.G.) from the Department of Neurosurgery who were deployed in the COVID-19 testing ward between April 25 and May 31, 2020 share their experience. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted including all those who were admitted in this ward. The patients were studied according to their demographic profiles, diagnoses, admitting departments, travel history, and presence/absence of COVID-19-related symptoms. Relevant history regarding occupation, contact with patient with known COVID-19, and comorbid illness was noted. Those who tested positive for COVID-19 were studied further. The data from the institute's official record were updated until August 14, 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 256 admissions in the ward, of whom 148 (92 male, 56 female) were patients and 108 were patients' attendants/relatives. Most patients were admitted under the departments of internal medicine (33, 22.3%) and general surgery (19, 12.8%). Of 148 patients, 46 (31.1%) were admitted as they were planned for a surgery/intervention. Among 148 patients, 29 (19.6%) had history of travel to or were residents of a red zone, 4 (2.7%) had history of contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, whereas 6 (4.1%) were health care workers. One hundred four patients (70.2%) showed no COVID-19-related symptoms. Thirty-four patients (22.9%) had associated comorbid conditions.

Evidence so far has documented a heightened risk of mortality to people with chronic conditions. There is a dearth of evidence regarding chronic disease patients' intention and practice on the preventive measures. This study tried to fill this gap by assessing the intention to practice and practice on personal preventive measures (PPMs) among adults with chronic conditions. Materials and Methods: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Ethiopia among 806 adults with chronic conditions by employing a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS software version 25. Binary logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with intention and practice. Level of statistical significance was declared at a P-value of less than 0.05. Results: The study showed that 52% (95% CI=47.61-54.80) and 76.3% (95% CI=73.36-79.24) of adults with chronic conditions were intending to practice and had ever practiced the personal preventive measures. Participants' subjective norm (SN) (AOR=4.94; 95% CI=3.49-6.96) and perceived behavioral control (PBC) (AOR=4.13; 95% CI=2.69-6.34) were the factors associated with their intention. Good knowledge and a positive attitude were found to be significant factors associated with the participants' actual practice of the PPMs among other independent factors. Conclusion: Around half of the participants were intending to practice PPMs, and three-quarters had good practice on the PPMs against COVID-19. Interventions targeted to improve intention and practice on the PPMs need to take into account improving knowledge and attitude, and build positive subjective norms and heighten the confidence to control the preventive behaviors.","output":"Intention and Practice on Personal Preventive Measures Against the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Adults with Chronic Conditions in Southern Ethiopia: A Survey Using the Theory of Planned Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Although people living with HIV (PLWH) are immunodeficient, it is not clear if they are more susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection than HIV-na?ve individuals.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 857 PLWH (age18 years) who were in care in the Wuchang district and 1048 randomly selected HIV-na?ve residents from the same district. We compared the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the proportion of asymptomatic carriers, and the seroprevalence of antibodies in the two groups.

The transition to, and the maintenance of chronic pain require new gene expression to support biochemical and structural changes within the pain pathway. The regulation of gene expression at the level of mRNA translation has emerged as an important step in the control of protein expression in the cell. Recent studies show that signaling pathways upstream of mRNA translation, such as mTORC1 and ERK, are upregulated in chronic pain conditions, and their inhibition effectively alleviates pain in several animal models. Despite this progress, mRNAs whose translation is altered in chronic pain conditions remain largely unknown. Here, we performed genome-wide translational profiling of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord dorsal horn tissues in a mouse model of neuropathic pain, spared nerve injury (SNI), using the ribosome profiling technique.

Whether this relates to increased infection risk, more severe disease progression, or worse in-hospital survival is unknown. The contribution of comorbidities or socioeconomic deprivation to ethnic patterning of outcomes is also unclear. Methods: We conducted a case-control and a cohort study in an inner city primary and secondary care setting to examine whether ethnic background affects the risk of hospital admission with severe COVID-19 and/or in-hospital mortality. Inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (n = 872 cases) were compared with 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people residing in the same region. For the cohort study, we studied 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Analyses were adjusted for socio-demographic and clinical variables. Findings: The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63-3.71] and 2.97 [2.30-3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.24 [1.83-2.74] for Black, 2.70 [2.03-3.59] for Mixed/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (adjusted OR 1.01 [0.70-1.46]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4-16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 1.06 [0.82-1.37]) or Mixed/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.72 [0.47-1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality but with a large confidence interval (adjusted HR 1.71 [1.15-2.56]). Interpretation: Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease, but do not affect in-hospital mortality risk. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians.

It implies a shift of endowment in financial markets, and its effects on economic inequality, financial deepening and total economic income. Theoretical models are proposed, where the public sector seeks alternatives to a lockdown, allowing self-regulation of the economy, taxing capital or seeking joint policies with other states. In the first model, the economy is self-regulating with the help of the financial sector. Nonetheless, inequality is generated and in other models, the public sector tries to intervene. First, the public sector minimizes inequality by taxing capital, allowing a redistribution of wealth and income, with a tax rate that depends only on the differential impacts of the black swan on the different markets. Finally, a coordination of policies between the different countries affected is proposed to prevent black swans and other negative externalities.

Results: Estrogens stimulate the humoral response to viral infections, while testosterone and progesterone give an immune suppression of both innate and cell-mediated immune responses. We hypothesise that estrogens, in particular estradiol but also synthetic estrogen such as ethinylestradiol, could protect women from the most serious complications of COVID-19. The use of medications that keep hormonal levels high and stable, such as combined hormonal contraceptive, could therefore play a protective role.

Materials and methods: We examined 49 patients, which were hospitalized for inpatient treatment of COVID-19 infection from May to June 2020. Study group included 24 men (49%) and 25 women (51%), median age 58 years [48; 70], BMI 26.4 kg/m2 [24.3; 30.5]. All patients were diagnosed with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 with median percent of lung involvement equal to 29% [14; 37], 22 patients (45%) required oxygen support upon admission. Median SpO2 was equal to 95% (92; 97), median NEWS score was equal to 3 [2; 6]. Participants were tested for vitamin D metabolites (25(OH)D3, 1,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3 and D3) by UPLC-MS/MS, free 25(OH)D and vitamin D-binding protein by ELISA, as well as PTH by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and routine biochemical parameters of blood serum (calcium, phosphorus, albumin) at the time of admission. Results: patients had in general very low 25()D3 levels - median 10.9 ng/mL [6.9; 15.6], corresponding to a pronounced vitamin D deficiency in half of the patients. Levels of 24,25(OH)2D3 were also low C 0.5 ng/mL [0.2; 0.9], and resulting vitamin D metabolite ratios (25(OH)D3/24,25(OH)2D3) were high-normal or elevated in most patients C 24.1 [19.0; 39.2], indicating decreased activity of 24-hydroxylase. Levels of 1,25(OH)2D3, on the contrary, were high-normal or elevated - 57 pg/mL [46; 79], which, in accordance with 25(OH)D3/1,25(OH)2D3 ratio (219 [134; 266]) suggests an increase in 1-hydroxylase activity. Median level of 3-epi-25(OH)D3 was 0.7 ng/mL [0.4; 1.0] and D3 metabolite was detectable only in 6 patients. Median DBP level was 432 mg/L [382; 498], median free 25(OH)D was 5.6 pg/mL [3.3; 6.7], median calculated free 25(OH)D was 2.0 pg/mL [1.4; 3.3]. Most patients had albumin-adjusted serum calcium level in the lower half of reference range (median 2.24 mmol/L [2.14; 2.34]). Seven patients had secondary hyperparathyroidism and one patient had primary hyperparathyroidism, the rest of the patients had PTH levels within the normal range.25(OH)D3 levels showed significant negative correlation with percent of lung involvement (r = -0.36, p<0.05) and positive correlation with SpO2 (r = 0.4, p<0.05). 1,25(OH)2D3 levels correlated positively with 25(OH)D3 levels (r = 0.38, p<0.05) and did not correlate significantly with PTH levels (p>0.05). Conclusion: Our data suggests that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection have significant impairment of vitamin D metabolism, in particular, an increase in 1-hydroxylase activity, which cannot be fully explained by pre-existing conditions such as vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The observed profound vitamin D deficiency and association of vitamin D levels with markers of disease severity indicate the importance of vitamin D supplementation in these patients.","output":"Vitamin D Metabolism Is Significantly Impaired in COVID-19 Inpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is currently considered a systemic infection involving multiple systems and causing chronic complications. Compared to other post-viral fatigue syndromes, these complications are wider and more intense. The most frequent symptoms are profound fatigue, dyspnea, sleep difficulties, anxiety or depression, reduced lung capacity, memory/cognitive impairment, and hyposmia/anosmia. Risk factors for this condition are severity of illness, more than five symptoms in the first week of the disease, female sex, older age, the presence of comorbidities, and a weak anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. Different lines of research have attempted to explain these protracted symptoms; chronic persistent inflammation, autonomic nervous system disruption, hypometabolism, and autoimmunity may play a role. Due to thyroid high ACE expression, the key molecular complex SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect the host cells, thyroid may be a target for the coronavirus infection. Thyroid dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a combination of numerous mechanisms, and its role in long-COVID manifestations is not yet established. The proposed mechanisms are a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on target cells, an indirect effect of systemic inflammatory immune response, and a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis leading to decreased serum TSH. Only a few studies have reported the thyroid gland status in the post-COVID-19 condition. The presence of post-COVID symptoms deserves recognition of COVID-19 as a cause of post-viral fatigue syndrome.

Although the role of N protein in viral replication is relatively well described, no structural data are currently available regarding the N proteins of alphacoronaviruses. Moreover, our understanding of the mechanisms of RNA binding and nucleocapsid formation remains incomplete. In this study, we solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD, residues 10 to 140, and CTD, residues 221 to 340, respectively) of the N protein of HCoV-NL63, both at a 1.5-? resolution. Based on our structure of NTD solved here, we proposed and experimentally evaluated a model of RNA binding. The structure of the CTD reveals the mode of N protein dimerization.

The climate crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic have contributed to a predominant view of islands as both exceptional spaces and testbeds to be scaled up onto continental or planetary levels. Likewise, the metaphor of the island is foundational to Western thought yet has been less explored in the context of scientific processes and technology development. Bringing together science and technology studies (STS) with critical Island Studies and related fields, this special section expands upon the spatial dimension of sociotechnical imaginaries to consider islands and their imaginations as both preexisting and channeling visions of science and technology. The introduced concept of Island Imaginaries captures the mutual constitution of island visions and their materialization in scientific, technological and technocratic endeavors that are imagined and pursued by scientific communities, policymakers, and other social collectives. Such an approach explores the co-constitutive dynamic of islands as sites for the foundation of technoscientific knowledge regimes, and the concomitant rendering of islands as conducive places for discovery and experimentation. The special section offers empirical case studies with insights into islands as synecdoche for larger wholes (the Earth), as experimental and exceptional sites for trialing business creation and political orders (in Singapore, and for Asia), and as variously interpreted laboratory paradise (of Hawaii).

Even though several guidelines for the management of infectious corpses have been proposed, the limited number of post-mortem analyses during the pandemic has led to inaccuracies in the counting of COVID-19 deaths and contributed to a lack of important information about the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Due to the impossibility of carrying out autopsies on all corpses, the scientific community has raised the question of whether confirmatory analyses could be performed on exhumed bodies after a long period of burial to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Post-mortem lung samples were collected from 16 patients who died from COVID-19 infection and were buried for a long period of time. A custom RNA extraction protocol was developed to enhance extraction of viral RNA from degraded samples and highly sensitive molecular methods, including RT-qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), were used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The custom extraction protocol developed allowed us to extract total RNA effectively from all lung samples collected. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was effectively detected in all samples by both RT-qPCR and ddPCR, regardless of the length of burial. ddPCR results confirmed the persistence of the virus in this anatomical niche and revealed high viral loads in some lung samples, suggesting active infection at the time of death. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the lung even after a long post-mortem interval (up to 78 days). The extraction protocol herein described, and the highly sensitive molecular analyses performed, could represent the standard procedures for SARS-CoV-2 detection in degraded lung specimens.

However, the results of studies on the effect of COVID-19 on male reproduction are controversial. OBJECTIVE: To summarize current research on the effects of COVID-19 on male reproduction. METHODS: A systematic review of English literature was performed using PubMed and Ovid Embase up to 18 August 2020. Research articles on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen, the effects of the virus on semen parameters and any pathological changes in the testes were evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. Six of 176 survivors (3.4%) and 1 of 13 decedents (7.7%) in 2 of 12 studies were positive for viral RNA in semen and testicular tissue, respectively. After stratification of patient groups, we found that the virus was detected in the relatively early stage of infection, 6-16 days after disease onset, in semen from survivors. Two of 3 studies reported that some participants had substandard semen quality after COVID-19, and 1 study found that COVID-19 may impair semen quality in a severity-related manner. Pathological analyses showed that injuries to the seminiferous tubule occurred in all decedents (N = 11). Another study found that orchitic and testis fibrin microthrombi occurred in patients with fatal disease (100%, N = 2). Scrotal discomfort of orchiepididymitis or spermatic cord inflammation has also been reported in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Current studies suggest that semen is rarely considered a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material during the infection period but not in the semen of recovered patients.

Additionally, two recent studies suggested that nicotine replacement therapy was associated with improved neurological outcomes among smokers who had sustained an SAH compared with smokers who did not receive nicotine. METHODS Patients who underwent endovascular or microsurgical repair of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS, 2009-2011) and stratified by cigarette smoking. Multivariable logistic regression analyzed in-hospital mortality, complications, tracheostomy or gastrostomy placement, and discharge to institutional care (a nursing or an extended care facility). Additionally, the composite NIS-SAH outcome measure (based on mortality, tracheostomy or gastrostomy, and discharge disposition) was evaluated, which has been shown to have excellent agreement with a modified Rankin Scale score greater than 3. Covariates included in regression constructs were patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, socioeconomic status, comorbidities (including hypertension, drug and alcohol abuse), the NIS-SAH severity scale (previously validated against the Hunt and Hess grade), treatment modality used for aneurysm repair, and hospital characteristics. A sensitivity analysis was performed matching smokers to nonsmokers on age, sex, number of comorbidities, and NIS-SAH severity scale score. RESULTS Among the 5784 admissions evaluated, 37.1% (n = 2148) had a diagnosis of tobacco use, of which 31.1% (n = 1800) were current and 6.0% (n = 348) prior tobacco users. Smokers were significantly younger (mean age 51.4 vs 56.2 years) and had more comorbidities compared with nonsmokers (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in mortality, total complications, or neurological complications by smoking status. However, compared with nonsmokers, smokers had significantly decreased adjusted odds of tracheostomy or gastrostomy placement (11.9% vs 22.7%, odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.78, p < 0.001), discharge to institutional care (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.89, p = 0.002), and a poor outcome (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55-0.77, p < 0.001). Similar statistical associations were noted in the matched-pairs sensitivity analysis and in a subgroup of poor-grade patients (the upper quartile of the NIS-SAH severity scale). CONCLUSIONS In this nationwide study, smokers experienced SAH at a younger age and had a greater number of comorbidities compared with nonsmokers, highlighting the negative ramifications of cigarette smoking among patients with cerebral aneurysms. However, smoking was also associated with paradoxical superior outcomes on some measures, and future research to confirm and further understand the basis of this relationship is needed.","output":"Cigarette smoking and outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a nationwide analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Vaccine hesitancy can limit the benefits of available vaccines in halting the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Previously published studies paid little attention to Arab countries, which has a population of over 440 million. In this study, we present the results of the first large-scale multinational study that measures vaccine hesitancy among Arab-speaking subjects. Methods: An online survey in Arabic was conducted from 14 January 2021 to 29 January 2021. It consisted of 17 questions capturing demographic data, acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, attitudes toward the need for COVID-19 vaccination and associated health policies, and reasons for vaccination hesitancy. R software v.4.0.2 was used for data analysis and visualization. Results: The survey recruited 36,220 eligible participants (61.1% males, 38.9% females, mean age 32.6  10.8 years) from all the 23 Arab countries and territories (83.4%) and 122 other countries (16.6%). Our analysis shows a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabs in and outside the Arab region (83% and 81%, respectively). The most cited reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and distrust in health care policies, vaccine expedited production, published studies and vaccine producing companies. We also found that female participants, those who are 30-59 years old, those with no chronic diseases, those with lower level of academic education, and those who do not know the type of vaccine authorized in their countries are more hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination. On the other hand, participants who regularly receive the influenza vaccine, health care workers, and those from countries with higher rates of COVID-19 infections showed more vaccination willingness. Interactive representation of our results is posted on our project website at https://mainapp.shinyapps.io/CVHAA. Conclusions: Our results show higher vaccine hesitancy and refusal among Arab subjects, related mainly to distrust and concerns about side effects.

Activated HIF-1 translocates into the nucleus and binds to hypoxia response elements to promote the transcription of target genes.

In this study, we attempted to determine if CTSL is a hypoxia responsive target gene of HIF-1, and decipher its role in melanocytes in association with the autophagic pathway. The results of our luciferase reporter assay showed that the expression of CTSL is transcriptionally activated through the binding of HIF1- at its promoter. Under autophagy-inducing starvation conditions, HIF-1 and CTSL expression is highly upregulated in melan-a cells. The mature form of CTSL is closely involved in melanosome degradation through lysosomal activity upon autophagosomeClysosome fusion. The inhibition of conversion of pro-CTSL to mature CTSL leads to the accumulation of gp100 and tyrosinase in addition to microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) II, due to decreased lysosomal activity in the autophagic pathway.

METHODS: We investigated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in seropositive and seronegative health care workers attending testing of asymptomatic and symptomatic staff at Oxford University Hospitals in the United Kingdom. Baseline antibody status was determined by anti-spike (primary analysis) and anti-nucleocapsid IgG assays, and staff members were followed for up to 31 weeks. We estimated the relative incidence of PCR-positive test results and new symptomatic infection according to antibody status, adjusting for age, participant-reported gender, and changes in incidence over time. RESULTS: A total of 12,541 health care workers participated and had anti-spike IgG measured; 11,364 were followed up after negative antibody results and 1265 after positive results, including 88 in whom seroconversion occurred during follow-up. A total of 223 anti-spike-seronegative health care workers had a positive PCR test (1.09 per 10,000 days at risk), 100 during screening while they were asymptomatic and 123 while symptomatic, whereas 2 anti-spike-seropositive health care workers had a positive PCR test (0.13 per 10,000 days at risk), and both workers were asymptomatic when tested (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.44; P = 0.002).

Methods: : This study was designed as a single-center, retrospective, and observational study. The patients were divided into three groups relative to the date of the first COVID-19 case in Turkey, which was March 10, 2020 (Group A: before the pandemic;Group B: pandemic period;Group C: the same period one year before the pandemic). A total of 413 patients were included in the study. Results: : In terms of treatment modality, the rate of open appendectomy was significantly higher in group B (p<0.001). Rates of conversion to open surgery, as well as rates of complicated appendicitis were also significantly higher in group B (p=0.027, p=0.024, respectively). While there was no difference between the groups in terms of preoperative hospitalization duration (p=0.102), it was found that the duration of symptoms, operation time, and postoperative length of hospital stay were significantly higher in Group B (p<0.001, p=0.011, p=0.001, respectively). In addition, the complication rate in group B (8.9%) was also significantly higher than in the other two groups (p=0.023). Conclusion: We found that the rate of open surgery, the rate of conversion of laparoscopic surgery to open surgery, complication rates, mean operation time, and postoperative hospital stay were significantly higher in acute appendicitis patients that underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic period. We believe that the main reason for this negative outcome is the late admission of the patients to the hospital.","output":"Characteristics and Outcomes of Acute Appendicitis Cases During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to discuss the strategic role of telehealth technologies in managing the COVID-19 pandemic Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint paper, based on opportune information published and discussed by scholars and managers from different sources;the authors gathered this information to discuss the implications of telehealth during the outbreak Findings: Based on examples and benchmarking, the authors found that it is possible to lean on telehealth technologies as a frontline ally to avoid the spread of the virus by tracking, testing and treating (3Ts model) Research limitations/implications: Together with information published on COVID-19, the authors present their critical observations on the use of telehealth However, the authors acknowledge that there are restrictions on the use of new technologies in health-care practices that were not addressed by this paper, and they suggest further research to address this limitation Practical implications: Governments, health-care organizations and managers are encouraged to take advantage of the information published in this paper One of the benefits of telehealth is the possibility of bringing patients and physicians together virtually, without the need for physical contact Henceforth, the authors suggest a more comprehensive implementation of best practices from telehealth to relieve congested health-care facilities and to avoid the risk of further infection Social implications: The economic and social impacts of the virus are considered unprecedented by governments worldwide Therefore, the authors advocate that telehealth practices embedded in health-care practices relieve the pressure that naturally arise during this type of critical event Originality/value: In this timely paper, the authors provide invaluable information related to the impact of telehealth technologies on flattening the infection curve of COVID-19 ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Flattening the infection curve C understanding the role of telehealth in managing COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Photobiomodulation therapy, alone (PBMT) or combined with a static magnetic field (PBMT-sMF), has been demonstrated to be effective in the regeneration of tissues, modulation of inflammatory processes, and improvement in functional capacity.

Therefore, in this case report, we demonstrated the use of PBMT-sMF for peripheral oxygen saturation, pulmonary function, massive lung damage, and fibrosis as a pulmonary complication after COVID-19. Case report: A 53-year-old Mexican man who presented with decreased peripheral oxygen saturation, massive lung damage, and fibrosis after COVID-19 received PBMT-sMF treatment once a day for 45 days. The treatment was irradiated at six sites in the lower thorax and upper abdominal cavity and two sites in the neck area. We observed that the patient was able to leave the oxygen support during the treatment, and increase his peripheral oxygen saturation. In addition, the patient showed improvements in pulmonary severity scores and radiological findings.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases. Its impact on surgical oncology is still to elucidate. METHODS: A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors. The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy. RESULTS: In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%). After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median -50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median -50%). The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7-5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22-4.4) after (P = 0.036). In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week. The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6-10) versus 3 (3-4) weeks (P < 0.001). Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeat multidisciplinary discussion of patients. The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%). Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%). CONCLUSIONS: This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list. The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately. The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.","output":"A Snapshot of Elective Oncological Surgery in Italy During COVID-19 Emergency: Pearls, Pitfalls, and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers have been at increased risk of exposure, infection and serious complications from COVID-19. Antibody testing has been used to identify staff members who have been previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, and has been rolled out rapidly in the United Kingdom. a number of published comment and editorial articles raising concerns about antibody testing in this context. We present perceptions of NHS healthcare workers in relation to SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. METHODS: Electronic survey regarding perceptions towards SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing which was distributed to all healthcare workers at a major NHS tertiary hospital following implementation of antibody testing. RESULTS: In total, 560 healthcare workers completed the survey (80% female; 25% of BAME background; 58% from frontline clinical staff). Exploring whether they previously had COVID-19 was the primary reported reason for choosing to undergo antibody testing (85.2%). In case of a positive antibody test, 72% reported that they would feel relieved, whilst 48% felt that they would be happier to work in a patient-facing area. Moreover, 12% responded that a positive test would mean \\"social distancing is less important\\", with 34% of the responders indicating that in this case they would be both less likely to catch COVID-19 and happier to visit friends/relatives. CONCLUSIONS: NHS staff members primarily seek out SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing for an appropriate reason. Based on our findings and given the lack of definite data regarding the extent of immunity protection from a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, significant concerns may be raised regarding the reported interpretation by healthcare workers of positive antibody test results.

It is not only a risk factor for incident HF, but is also associated with worse outcomes in prevalent HF. Therefore, antihyperglycaemic management in patients at risk of or with established HF is of importance to reduce morbidity/mortality. Following revision of the drug approval process in 2008 by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, several cardiovascular outcome trials on antihyperglycaemic drugs have recently investigated HF endpoints. Signals of harm in terms of increased risk of HF have been identified for thiazolidinediones and the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor saxagliptin, and therefore, these drugs are not currently recommended in HF. Sulfonylureas also have an unfavourable safety profile and should be avoided in patients at increased risk of/with HF. Observational studies have assessed the use of metformin in patients with HF, showing potential safety and potential survival/morbidity benefits.

Till May 2021, almost 172 million people have been affected globally due to the contagious spread of Covid-19. Although the distribution of vaccines has been started, the worldwide mass distribution is yet to happen. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), wearing a facemask can reduce the contagious spread of Covid-19 significantly. The governments of different countries have recommended implementing the \\"no mask, no service\\" method to impede the spread of Covid-19. However, even the improper wearing of a facemask can obstruct the goal and lead to the spread of the virus. Therefore, to ensure public safety, a system for monitoring facemasks on faces, commonly known as a facemask detection algorithm, is essential for overcoming this crisis. The facemask detection algorithms are part of the object detection algorithms which are used to detect objects in an image. Among the various object detection algorithms, deep learning showed tremendous performance in facemask detection for its excellent feature extraction capability than the traditional machine learning algorithms. However, there remains a lot of scope for future research to build an efficient facemask detection system. Therefore, this study aims to draw attention to the researchers by providing a narrative and meta-analytic review on all the published works related to facemask detection in the context of Covid-19. Because facemask detection algorithms are run mainly by adopting object detection algorithms, this paper also explores the progress of object detection algorithms over the last few decades. A comprehensive analysis of different datasets used in facemask detection techniques by many studies has been explored. The performance comparison among these algorithms is discussed in narrative and meta-analytic approaches.

The risk of large outbreaks in dense course settings is contrasted by the benefits of in-person teaching. Transmission risk depends on a range of parameters, such as vaccination coverage, number of contacts and adoption of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs). Due to the generalised academic freedom in Europe, many universities are asked to autonomously decide on and implement intervention measures and regulate on-campus operations. In the context of rapidly changing vaccination coverage and parameters of the virus, universities often lack the scientific facts to base these decisions on. To address this problem, we analyse a calibrated, data-driven simulation of transmission dynamics of 10755 students and 974 faculty in a medium-sized university. We use a co-location network reconstructed from student enrolment data and calibrate transmission risk based on outbreak size distributions in other Austrian education institutions. We focus on actionable interventions that are part of the already existing decision-making process of universities to provide guidance for concrete policy decisions. Here we show that with the vaccination coverage of about 80% recently reported for students in Austria, universities can be safely reopened if they either mandate masks or reduce lecture hall occupancy to 50%.

The extent to which subjective social status (SSS), one's perception of relative standing compared to others in a social hierarchy, might mitigate the effects of COVID-19-related health worries on mental health has not yet been reported, despite SSS often outperforming socioeconomic status as a predictor of various health outcomes including depression. This cross-sectional survey study tested the moderating effect of SSS on association between COVID-19- related health worries and mental health symptoms (depressive and generalized anxiety) among a sample of 1,637 perinatal women from the United States who took part in the Perinatal Experiences and COVID-19 Effects (PEACE) Study between May 2020 and June 2021. We found that high subjective social status was protective against depressive symptoms when self-reported COVID-19-related worry was low. When COVID-19-related worry was high, subjective social status was no longer influential. Higher levels of COVID-19-related health worries were associated with more anxiety symptoms, and higher subjective social status did not moderate anxiety symptomatology at either level of COVID-19-related worry. Although higher SSS has historically been protective against mental health decline, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic it may not be sufficiently protective against anxiety, or against depression for those who experience high levels of worry regarding the effects of COVID-19 on health.","output":"Subjective social status, COVID-19 health worries, and mental health symptoms in perinatal women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coverage of stents with healthy endothelium is crucial to the success of cardiovascular stent implantation.

The research method was descriptive, of structural equations type. The statistical population included all the elderly living in nursing homes in Ardabil in 2020, from which 160 were selected using purposive sampling. Used to collect data were Alipour et al.'s Corona Anxiety Scale, Sense of Coherence- 13 scale of Antonovsky, Calhoun et al.'s Perceived Stress Scale, and Zimet et al.'s Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is up-regulated in patients with heart failure. We sought to examine the potential association between reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of the 1162 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention between February 2014 and October 2018, we enrolled 889 patients with available clinical follow-up data. Follow-up was conducted by telephone interviews 1 month after the start of the French lockdown which began on 17 March 2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to LVEF 60;40% (reduced LVEF) (n = 91) or &#8805;40% (moderately reduced + preserved LVEF) (n = 798). The incidence of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death was significantly higher in the reduced LVEF group as compared with the moderately reduced + preserved LVEF group (9% vs. 1%, P 60; 0.001). No association was found between discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blockers and COVID-19 test positivity. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, reduced LVEF was an independent predictor of COVID-19 hospitalization or death (odds ratio: 6.91, 95% confidence interval: 2.60 to 18.35, P 60; 0.001).

However, implementing research in emergency settings poses the challenge of producing valuable knowledge rapidly while upholding research ethical standards. Research ethics committees (RECs) therefore must conduct timely and rigorous ethics reviews and oversight of COVID-19 research. In the LA region, there is limited knowledge on how countries have responded to this need. To address this gap, the objective of our project is to explore if LA countries developed policies to streamline ethics review and oversight of research in response to the pandemic while ensuring its adherence to ethical standards, and to analyze to what extent these governance frameworks are in accordance with international guidance. Methods: We conducted a descriptive and exploratory study assessing the COVID-19 research ethics governance frameworks of 19 LA countries, considering 4 dimensions based on international COVID-19 ethics guidance documents: (i) ethics review organizational model adopted, (ii) measures to coordinate between RECs and other research stakeholders, (iii) operational guidance for RECs, and (iv) key ethical issues for review and oversight of COVID-19 research. Results: 10 out of 19 LA countries have some policy to streamline ethics review of COVID-19 research. Of these countries only 6 issued comprehensive documents following international guidance that contemplated strategies with recommendations for concrete actions for a timely and rigorous review. Conclusion: LA countries adopted partial strategies and operational guidance that may demonstrate a lack of a comprehensive view of research ethics for the review and oversight of COVID-19 research. Continuing efforts should be directed to strengthen LA countries' research capacity to respond timely and ethically to future health emergencies.

Accordingly, it has been hypothesized to have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal BCG childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate, thus allowing us to estimate the BCGs effect without the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. METHODS: Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after 1975, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 10005 (CI95: [08130-11881]) and 12046 (CI95: [07532-16560]), allowing us to reject fairly modest effects of universal BCG vaccination. We can reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by 19% and the number of hospitalizations by 25%. CONCLUSIONS: While the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19 among middle-aged individuals.","output":"BCG vaccination in infancy does not protect against COVID-19.

Our study aims to evaluate the impact of both cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities on a high-risk population with COVID-19 infection and coronary artery disease (CAD) compared to those without CAD. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients who tested COVID-19 positive via reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assay. We compared the characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without CAD. Population demographics, comorbidities and clinical outcomes were collected and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with inpatient mortality. RESULTS: A final sample population of 355 patients was identified, 77 of which had a known diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Our study population had a higher proportion of females, and those with CAD were significantly older. The rates of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, as well as heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significantly higher in the CAD population. Lactate dehydrogenase was the only inflammatory marker significantly lower in the CAD group, while troponin and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly higher in this population. Patients with CAD also had significantly higher inpatient mortality (31% vs 20%, P = 0.046) and need for renal replacement therapy (33% vs 11%, P < 0.0001) compared to the non-CAD group. However, only age [odds ratio 1.041 (1.017-1.066), P = 0.001] was significantly associated with mortality in the overall population after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, while the presence of CAD was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with CAD and COVID-19 have higher rates of comorbidities, inpatient mortality and need for renal replacement therapy compared to their non-CAD counterparts. However, CAD in itself was not associated with mortality after adjusting for other covariates, suggesting that other factors may play a larger role in the increased mortality and poor outcomes in these patients.","output":"The relationship between coronary artery disease and clinical outcomes in COVID-19: a single-center retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination can prevent infection and disease due to SARS-CoV-2.

Among the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening disease that requires immediate invasive intervention to drain the air from the thoracic cavity. However, other etiologies with manifestations similar to those of tension pneumothorax should also be considered after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. We report a rare case of a patient with thoracic stomach syndrome mimicking tension pneumothorax after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction. CASE PRESENTATION A 49-year-old Asian woman was admitted to our intensive care unit after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with whole-stomach reconstruction while under sedation and intubated. Despite initial stable vital signs, the patient rapidly developed tachypnea, low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. Chest radiography revealed a mediastinal shift and led to a presumptive diagnosis of tension pneumothorax. Hence, an aspiration catheter was inserted into the right pleural space. However, her clinical symptoms did not improve. Chest computed tomography was performed, which revealed a significantly distended reconstructed stomach that was compressing the nearby lung parenchyma. Her respiration improved immediately after nasogastric tube placement. After the procedure, we successfully extubated the patient. CONCLUSIONS Similar to tension pneumothorax, thoracic stomach syndrome requires immediate drainage of air from the thoracic cavity. However, unlike tension pneumothorax, this condition requires nasogastric tube insertion, which is the only way to safely remove the accumulated air and avoid possible complications that could occur due to percutaneous drainage. For patient safety, it might be clinically important to place nasogastric tubes after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction, even if radiographic guidance is required.

During corona infection, viruses bind to host proteins and employ a variety of cellular pathways for their own purposes. Cell signaling is important for the regulation of cellular function. SARS-CoV-2 infection alters multiple signal transduction pathways that are critical for cell survival. The virus causes a severe and prolonged period of hypercytokinemia with misusing of these signaling cascades. Hyperactivation of the host immune system after infection with SARS-CoV-2 is the main cause of death in COVID-19 patients. Thus, to develop effective therapeutic approaches, it is necessary to first understand the problem and the underlying molecular pathways implicated in host immunological function/dysfunction. A number of intracellular signaling cascades have been implicated in infected cell pathways, including MAPK pathway, NF-Kappa B pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and TLRI signaling cascades.

DESIGN: Multicentre pragmatic randomised clinical trial. SETTING: 15 hospitals in Canada and the United States from May 2020 until May 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible patients had a laboratory confirmed or a clinically highly suspected diagnosis of covid-19, needed supplemental oxygen (up to 50% fraction of inspired oxygen), and were able to independently lie prone with verbal instruction. Of the 570 patients who were assessed for eligibility, 257 were randomised and 248 were included in the analysis. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 1:1 to prone positioning (that is, instructing a patient to lie on their stomach while they are in bed) or standard of care (that is, no instruction to adopt prone position). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death, mechanical ventilation, or worsening respiratory failure defined as needing at least 60% fraction of inspired oxygen for at least 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included the change in the ratio of oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early on the basis of futility for the pre-specified primary outcome. The median time from hospital admission until randomisation was 1 day, the median age of patients was 56 (interquartile range 45-65) years, 89 (36%) patients were female, and 222 (90%) were receiving oxygen via nasal prongs at the time of randomisation. The median time spent prone in the first 72 hours was 6 (1.5-12.8) hours in total for the prone arm compared with 0 (0-2) hours in the control arm. The risk of the primary outcome was similar between the prone group (18 (14%) events) and the standard care group (17 (14%) events) (odds ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.92). The change in the ratio of oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen after 72 hours was similar for patients randomised to prone positioning and standard of care.

Serum 25(OH)D concentrations in shelter dogs were not different from control dogs (t(45) = ?1.4, P = .17). Serum 25(OH)D concentration was not associated with duration of time in the shelter (F(1, 140) = 1.7, P = .2, R (2) = 0.01).

Theoretical and conceptual arguments have suggested that elevated levels of acquired capability (AC) could be an explanatory factor accounting for this increased risk. However, empirical research utilizing the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale (ACSS) in military populations has yielded mixed findings. METHODS To better ascertain what factors are associated with AC, and whether methodological limitations may be contributing to mixed findings, a systematic review was conducted. RESULTS A total of 31 articles utilized the ACSS to examine factors associated with AC, including combat history, in United States (U.S.) military personnel and Veterans. Nearly all studies (96.8%) were rated high risk of bias. Use of the ACSS varied, with seven different iterations utilized. Nearly all studies examined correlations between the ACSS and sample characteristics, mental health and clinical factors, Interpersonal Theory of Suicide constructs, and/or suicide-specific variables. Results of higher-level analyses, dominated by cross-sectional designs, often contradicted correlational findings, with inconsistent findings across studies. LIMITATIONS Included studies were non-representative of all U.S. military and Veteran populations and may only generalize to these populations. CONCLUSIONS Due to the high risk of bias, inconsistent use of the ACSS, lack of sample heterogeneity, and variability in factors examined, interpretation of current ACSS empirical data is cautioned.

It has been shown to help image registration between different respiratory phases. This registration step is, for example, useful for radiotherapy planning or calculating local lung ventilation. Knowing the location of motion discontinuity, that is, sliding motion near the pleura, allows a better control of the registration preventing unrealistic estimates. Nevertheless, existing methods for motion-mask segmentation are not robust enough to be used in clinical routine. This article shows that it is feasible to overcome this lack of robustness by using a lightweight deep-learning approach usable on a standard computer, and this even without data augmentation or advanced model design. METHODS: A convolutional neural-network architecture with three 2D U-nets for the three main orientations (sagittal, coronal, axial) was proposed. Predictions generated by the three U-nets were combined by majority voting to provide a single 3D segmentation of the motion mask. The networks were trained on a database of nonsmall cell lung cancer 4D CT images of 43 patients. Training and evaluation were done with a K-fold cross-validation strategy. Evaluation was based on a visual grading by two experts according to the appropriateness of the segmented motion mask for the registration task, and on a comparison with motion masks obtained by a baseline method using level sets. A second database (76 CT images of patients with early-stage COVID-19), unseen during training, was used to assess the generalizability of the trained neural network. RESULTS: The proposed approach outperformed the baseline method in terms of quality and robustness: the success rate increased from 53 % to 79 % without producing any failure. It also achieved a speed-up factor of 60 with GPU, or 17 with CPU. The memory footprint was low: less than 5 GB GPU RAM for training and less than 1 GB GPU RAM for inference. When evaluated on a dataset with images differing by several characteristics (CT device, pathology, and field of view), the proposed method improved the success rate from 53 % to 83 % . CONCLUSION: With 5-s processing time on a mid-range GPU and success rates around 80 % , the proposed approach seems fast and robust enough to be routinely used in clinical practice. The success rate can be further improved by incorporating more diversity in training data via data augmentation and additional annotated images from different scanners and diseases. The code and trained model are publicly available.","output":"Improving motion-mask segmentation in thoracic CT with multiplanar U-nets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Viral pandemics have had catastrophic consequences on population health and economies. The Philippine government intends to establish the Virology Institute of the Philippines, one of the key areas of which will be virology research. This project aimed to develop the institutes research agenda across the fields of human, plant, and animal virology. METHODOLOGY: Key considerations for the prioritization methodology were (1) the imminent establishment of the Virology Institute of the Philippines, (2) mobility restrictions caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, (3) the timeline to develop the research agenda, and (4) the need to separate the research agenda for the three fields of human, plant, and animal virology. The process was fully conducted online in four steps: stakeholder identification, soliciting research priorities, generating initial research priorities, and final prioritization consultations conducted on Zoom Pro. RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants attended three online consultations between 21 and 27 July 2020 through Zoom Pro. Participants selected the research prioritization criteria and its weights, and used these to evaluate the research priorities. The final research agenda covers topics in epidemiology, diagnostics, surveillance, biosafety, and genomics. CONCLUSION: This initiative resulted in the first research agenda for the Virology Institute of the Philippines across the three fields of human, plant, and animal virology. An expert-driven process which places a premium on consensus-building facilitated through online platforms was the most feasible approach to develop the research agenda. This process resulted in an agenda aligned with the mandates of national research councils but leaves gaps on areas such as emerging infectious diseases.

The COVID-19 pandemic hindered dental education, as school buildings were closed. Online dental teaching provided an alternative teaching tool for dental education. However, the efficiency of online dental teaching and student preferences for online dental teaching are unclear. AIM: To investigate the satisfaction with online dental teaching practices among undergraduate dental students and standardized resident physician training students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: A total of 104 undergraduate dental students and 57 standardized resident physician training students from Zhejiang University participated in the study. A 12-item survey was conducted. This investigation included the teaching methods received, frequency of classes, degree of satisfaction, preferred teaching method, whether to participate in a course regarding COVID-19 prevention, and the effects of teaching. The percentages were then calculated and evaluated for each item. RESULTS: A total of 161 students (104 undergraduate dental students and 57 standardized resident physician training students) participated in this survey. All students had online dental classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lecture-based learning (LBL), case-based learning (CBL), problem-based learning (PBL), team-based learning (TBL), and research-based learning (RBL) were selected as teaching methods. Students were more satisfied with LBL and CBL than PBL, RBL, and TBL. The majority of students had more than four classes per week. The most selected protective measures were hand washing, wearing masks, and wearing gloves. A total of 46.6% of students participated in courses on COVID-19. After training, the students consciously chose to wear face shields and protective clothing. CONCLUSIONS: Dental students accepted online dental learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DESIGN: A qualitative study based on grounded theory. METHODS: Individual semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted from January 2020-February 2020 with 10 nurses who were isolated at home sharing the experiences of the epidemic of COVID-19. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analysed using constant comparative data analysis. RESULTS: Analyses of the collected data reveal that the psychological changes of nurses during home isolation reflect a complex, dynamic, and gradually adaptive process that was affected by many factors. Nurses had many negative emotional reactions in the early stages of isolation and positive emotions gradually increased during home isolation. After release from home isolation, they become more confident and calm after. Six categories of coping strategies were identified, including reasoned cognition; autosuggestion; develop healthy protective behaviours; shifting attention; social support; and the power of a role model. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides a better understanding of the psychological changes and the coping strategies used among nurses isolated at home. It is necessary to pay more attention to negative emotions in the early stages of home isolation to help nurses adjust quickly. The coping strategies used by nurses are likely to help those in home isolation reduce negative psychological changes and experience more optimal self-adjustment.

Whole-body, breath, and dermal emissions were assessed. The comparison of directly measured OH reactivity and that of the summed reactivity of individually measured species revealed no significant shortfall. Ozone exposure (37 ppb) was found to have little influence on breath OH reactivity but enhanced dermal OH reactivity significantly. Without ozone, the whole-body OH reactivity was dominated by breath emissions, mostly isoprene (76%). With ozone present, OH reactivity nearly doubled, with the increase being mainly caused by dermal emissions of mostly carbonyl compounds (57%). No significant difference in total OH reactivity was observed for different age groups (teenagers/young adults/seniors) without ozone.

While the FDA has authorized use of mAB therapy in children ages 12-17 years, clinical outcomes in this population have yet to be described. This study aims to assess the pediatric clinical experience in a low social economic setting. Methods Retrospective study conducted among children and adolescents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 12/1/2020 to 6/1/2021, met  1 eligibility criterion based on pre-determined institutional guidelines. Individuals were identified by patient-level data linked to pharmacy and medical claims with ICD-10 codes for COVID-19. Electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, time to receipt of mAB therapy from positive test, adverse effects, and clinical outcomes. Primary clinical end point was hospitalization and/or medical visit at 28 days. Descriptive summary statistics were used for the entire cohort. Results Overall, 17 met eligibility criteria. Thirteen patients with a mean age of 16 years, received casirivimab and imdevimab mAB therapy: 4 declined treatment. Among the treated patients, 61.5% (n=8) were male, 38.6% (n=5) Hispanic/Latino;38.6% (n=5) non-Hispanic Black;7.7% (n=1) White. Seven out of 12 had a BMI  95th% for gender and age. Eight patients (61.5%) met  1 criteria with obesity (n=8) as the most common factor followed by immunocompromised state (n=6, 46.2%) tied with neurodevelopmental disorder (n=6, 46.2%).

METHODS From August to December 2015, patients who underwent US-guided thermal ablation of liver tumors at our hospital with available CT/MRI images were enrolled consecutively. Both CT/MRI-CEUS and US-CEUS fusion imaging were performed in all patients to evaluate treatment responses. The applicable rate, success rate of registration and duration time were recorded. Complications were monitored in the follow-up period, and CECT/MRI within three months were taken as the standard reference of technical efficacy. RESULTS A total of 157 liver tumors (19  8 mm, range 8-55 mm) in 115 patients (54  11 years old, range 2 7 84 years old) were enrolled. The applicable rate of US-CEUS fusion imaging was 61.1% (96/157) because of inconspicuous lesions in US, lower than that of CT/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging (99.7% (155/157)) (p < .05). However, the success rate of registration in US-CEUS fusion imaging (93.8% (90/96)) was superior to that of CT/MRI-US fusion imaging (81.3% (126/155)) (p < .05), especially for cases combined with alternative preablation surgeries or procedures (p < .05).

The method is used for investigating the COVID-19 spread by first solving an inverse problem for estimating the infectivity and recovery rates from real data. Then, the estimated rates are used to compute the evolution of the disease. The time-depended parameters are estimated for the World and several countries (The United States of America, Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden, Russia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand) and used for investigating the COVID-19 spread in these countries.","output":"Dynamics of COVID-19 Using Inverse Problem for Coefficient Identification in SIR Epidemic Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What is the future of the BRICS (BrazilCRussiaCIndiaCChinaCSouth Africa) group? BRICS has transformed in record time from a global non\\\\entity into an informal institution that pursues global policy leadership, features extensive policy coordination among five powerful countries, and creates its own organizations. While BRICS momentum seemed unstoppable, a militarized dispute between India and China in 2020 raised questions about the groups future. This contribution concludes the Special Section by arguing that the BRICS group is not broken. Instead, it faces a range of strategic, geopolitical and operational challenges: how it addresses them will define its future trajectory and its impact on global governance. This essay analyses the situation from a conflict resolution perspective while bringing together insights from the five BRICS countries. It conceptualizes new directions for the BRICS group. Two possible internal conflict management scenarios are outlined: circumventing conflict and making institutional adjustments. Yet the real test of the groups resilience is its ability to exert collective leadership and improve global governance.

Financial business strategies then generated a series of crises exacerbated by COVID-19. In rental housing, a crisis of affordability has led to displacement pressures and a COVID-related flood of evictions. In seniors housing, a crisis of care has been exposed by disproportionate deaths in long-term care and retirement homes nationwide.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective and cross-sectional study included 294 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary referral pandemic center. The study cohort was grouped into tertiles based on the initial PNI values as T1, T2, and T3. The PNI was calculated for each case and the prognostic value of this index was compared to CURB-65 and 4C mortality risk scores in predicting in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Patients stratified into the T1 tertile had a lower lymphocyte count, serum albumin level, and PNI values. In a multivariate analysis, the PNI (OR: 0.688,%95CI: 0.586C0.808, p < 0.001) was an independent predictor for all-cause in-hospital death. After adjusting for confounding independent parameters, patients included in the T1 tertile were found to have 11.2 times higher rates of in-hospital mortality compared to the T3 group, which was presumed as the reference group. In addition, we found that the area under curve (AUC) value of PNI was significantly elevated than that of serum albumin level and total lymphocyte counts alone. [(AUC):0.79 vs AUC:0.75 vs AUC:0.69; respectively). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the PNI is independently related with in-hospital mortality in patient with COVID-19 and cardiovascular risk factors. The power of the PNI was also validated using well-accepted risk scores of COVID-19 such as CURB-65 and 4C mortality risk scores.","output":"Is prognostic nutritional index a predictive marker for estimating all-cause in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular risk factors?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This study aimed at investigating the effects of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) service on Burnout syndrome (BOS) development in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN The authors conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTINGS Eight ICUs within 5 tertiary hospitals in 1 country. PARTICIPANTS Intensive care practitioners (nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists). INTERVENTION Using an online questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel. In addition, demographic variables, workload, salary satisfaction, and caring for COVID-19 patients were assessed. Participants were divided based on working in an ICU with ECMO (ECMO-ICU) and without (non-ECMO-ICU) ECMO service, and burnout status (burnout and no burnout). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The response rate for completing the questionnaire was 36.4% (445/1,222). Male patients represented 53.7% of the participants. The overall prevalence of burnout was 64.5%. The overall burnout prevalence did not differ between ECMO- and non-ECMO-ICU groups (64.5% and 63.7, respectively). However, personal accomplishment (PA) score was significantly lower among ECMO-ICU personnel compared with those in a non-ECMO-ICU (42.7% v 52.6, p = 0.043). Significant predictors of burnout included profession (nurse or physician), acquiring COVID-19 infection, knowing other practitioners who were infected with COVID-19, salary dissatisfaction, and extremes of workload. CONCLUSION Burnout was equally prevalent among participants from ECMO- and non-ECMO-ICU, but PA was lower among participants in the ICU with an ECMO service.

The transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 in negative nasopharyngeal swabs cases has rarely been addressed previously. This study evaluated two clusters of COVID-19 in six patients, four of whom (66.7%) tested negative for RNA of SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs.

One case resulted in a sequential familial cluster of infection. All patients either self-quarantined at home or were admitted to hospital for isolated treatment. All recovered and were anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG- and/or IgM-positive (100%) for serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the recovery stage. Our study provides a cautionary warning that negative results for nasopharyngeal swabs of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection can increase the risk of nosocomial infection among health care providers.

Limited information is available about this stage of recovery or the lingering effects of the virus on pulmonary function and inflammation. This study aimed to describe lung function in patients recovering from COVID-19 hospitalization and to identify biomarkers in serum and induced sputum samples from these patients. METHODS: Patients admitted to Spanish hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection by a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were recruited for this study. Each hospital screened their lists of discharged patients at least 45 days after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were divided into mild/moderate and severe disease groups according to the severity of their symptoms during hospitalization. Patients' epidemiological and medical histories, comorbidities, chronic treatments, and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Pulmonary function tests, the standardized 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and chest computed tomography (CT) were also performed. The levels of proteases, their inhibitors, and shed receptors were measured in serum and induced sputum samples. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients with respiratory function tests were included in this study. The median number of days after the onset of symptoms was 104 (IQR 89.25, 126.75).

Energy and environmental effects were studied in a real case study near Rome by varying occupancy profiles, lighting and appliance schedules, and HVAC systems. Results show that, during the heating period, the lockdown scenario led to the lowest hours of discomfort (?29% on average), but the highest in the cooling period (up to +154%, +28% on average). The same scenario led to reasonable reduction of energy needs for heating (?14%), but also highlighted a significant increase (+60%) for the cooling period.

This technique is used in order to examine the degree of persistence of the series, looking at the spot and futures markets in Spain and Portugal. The results indicate that all the series are fractionally integrated, showing long memory and mean reverting behaviour. Moreover, a close relation between energy consumption and energy prices is found in the spot market whereas it is not found in the futures market.

We identified the most important proteins in both networks, those that have the maximal value of calculated invariants, these proteins are considered as the most: affected, connected or those that best monitor the flow of information in the network, among them we find UBC, a human protein related with ubiquination, linked with different stages of coronavirus disease, and ORF7A a virus protein that induces apoptosis in infected cells, associated with virion tethering. Using the constructed networks, we establish the more significant diseases corresponding with human proteins and their connections with other proteins. It is relevant that the identified diseases coincide with comorbidities, particularly the subnetwork of diabetes involves a great quantity of virus and human proteins (56%) and interactions (60%), this could explain the effect of this condition as an important cause of disease complications.","output":"Network analysis and disease subnets for the SARS-CoV-2/Human interactome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted cardiovascular healthcare.

Understanding of the mechanisms by which CD8TRM achieve effective immune protection remains incomplete in a naturally recurring human disease. Using laser capture microdissection and transcriptional profiling, we investigate the impact of CD8TRM on the tissue microenvironment in skin biopsies sequentially obtained from a clinical cohort of diverse disease expression during herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) reactivation. Epithelial cells neighboring CD8TRM display elevated and widespread innate and cell-intrinsic antiviral signature expression, largely related to IFNG expression. Detailed evaluation via T-cell receptor reconstruction confirms that CD8TRM recognize viral-infected cells at the specific HSV-2 peptide/HLA level. The hierarchical pattern of core IFN- signature expression is well-conserved in normal human skin across various anatomic sites, while elevation of IFI16, TRIM 22, IFITM2, IFITM3, MX1, MX2, STAT1, IRF7, ISG15, IFI44, CXCL10 and CCL5 expression is associated with HSV-2-affected asymptomatic tissue. In primary human cells, IFN- pretreatment reduces gene transcription at the immediate-early stage of virus lifecycle, enhances IFI16 restriction of wild-type HSV-2 replication and renders favorable kinetics for host protection. Thus, the adaptive immune response through antigen-specific recognition instructs innate and cell-intrinsic antiviral machinery to control herpes reactivation, a reversal of the canonical thinking of innate activating adaptive immunity in primary infection. Communication from CD8TRM to surrounding epithelial cells to activate broad innate resistance might be critical in restraining various viral diseases.","output":"Tissue-Resident-Memory CD8(+) T Cells Bridge Innate Immune Responses in Neighboring Epithelial Cells to Control Human Genital Herpes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Allergy is increasingly reported by patients and members of the public with evidence of prevalence increasing.

METHODS Internet searches using \\"allergy test kit\\" and \\"intolerance test\\" were performed to identify DTC food allergy tests. Each company was contacted to enquire if they had ISO15189 accreditation, what methods of testing they used and the extent of individual clinical input used to guide the test requested or result interpretation. RESULTS 24 online companies providing DTC food allergy testing were identified, of which 22 were contactable. One laboratory had ISO15189 accreditation, which was also the only laboratory using clinically recognised specific IgE testing and had a clinician involved in the process. Other laboratories used bioresonance or IgG and at most involved a nutritionist.

Using an instrumental variables approach, we find that a higher anticipated F-1 student visa refusal rate decreases the number of international SAT takers, decreases the probability of sending SAT scores to US colleges, and decreases international student enrollment in the US. The decreases are larger among international students with higher measured academic achievement. We also document academic achievement of international students and show that over 40 percent of high-scoring international SAT takers do not pursue US college education.","output":"Best and Brightest?

By far the most common type of uveitis in Germany and neighboring countries is classical equine recurrent uveitis (ERU), which is caused by chronic intraocular leptospiral infection and is the main cause of infectious uveitis in horses. Other infectious causes are extremely rare and are usually clinically distinguishable from ERU. ERU can be treated very effectively by vitreous cavity lavage (vitrectomy). For proper indications of this demanding surgery, it is necessary to differentiate ERU from other types of uveitis in which vitrectomy is not helpful. This can be conducted on the basis of anamnesis in combination with ophthalmologic findings and by aqueous humor examination. During vitrectomy, vitreous material is obtained. These vitreous samples have historically been used for numerous etiologic studies. In this way, a chronic intraocular leptospiral infection has been shown to be the cause of typical ERU and, among other findings, ERU has also been recognized as a biofilm infection, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of ERU and explaining some thus far unexplainable phenomena of ERU. ERU may not only have transmissible aspects to some types of uveitis in humans but may also serve as a model for a spontaneously occurring biofilm infection.

It has been determined that the disease is very contagious and can cause acute respiratory distress (ARD). Medical imaging has the potential to help identify, detect, and quantify the severity of this infection. This work seeks to develop a novel auto-detection technique for verified COVID-19 cases that can detect aberrant alterations in traditional X-ray pictures. METHODS: Nineteen separate-colored layers were created from X ray scans of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Each layer represents objects that have a similar contrast and can be represented by a single color. On a single layer, objects with similar contrasts are formed. A single color image was created by extracting all the objects from all the layers. The prototype model could recognize a wide range of abnormal changes in the image texture based on color differentiation. This was true even when the contrast values of the detected uncleared abnormalities varied a little. RESULTS: The results indicate that the proposed novel method is 91% accurate in detecting and grading COVID-19 lung infection when compared to the opinions of three experienced radiologists evaluating chest X-ray images. Additionally, the method can be used to determine the infection site and severity of the disease by categorizing the X-rays into five severity levels. CONCLUSION: By comparing affected tissue to healthy tissue, the proposed COVID-19 auto-detection method can identify locations and indicate the severity of the disease, as well as predict where the disease may spread.","output":"A Novel Multicolour-thresholding Auto-detection Method to Detect the Location and Severity of Inflammation in Confirmed SARS-COV-2 Cases Using Chest X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vertical flow immunoassays (VFIAs) are considered potential point-of-care testing (POCT) devices compared to lateral flow assays due to their ability to analyze a comparatively large sample volume and ease of multiplexing.

Herein, we carefully analyzed key parameters that accounted for the proper functionality of VFIA that can be modified to enhance the overall sensitivity of VFIA. In particular, we focused on improving the stability of conjugate pads impregnated with capture antibodies, maintaining a controlled flow rate to ensure higher analyte reactivity with capture antibodies, and enhancing the absorption efficiency. The results showed that air-drying of conjugate pads in the presence of 5% (w/v) lactose significantly improved the stability of antibodies during long-term storage. Integration of dissolvable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) membrane of optimal concentration as a time-barrier film into the sensor delayed the flow of samples, thereby increasing the biorecognition interaction time between immunoreagents for the formation of immuno-complexes, which in turn led to higher sensitivity of the assay. Furthermore, the employment of an absorbent pad with higher water holding capacity significantly reduced the non-specific binding of immunocomplexes, thereby reducing the possibility of false-negative results.","output":"Optimizing Effective Parameters to Enhance the Sensitivity of Vertical Flow Assay for Detection of Escherichia coli"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Cancer patients particularly those on active anti-cancer treatment have been reported to be at a high risk of severe COVID-19 infection and deaths.

Methods This is a retrospective observational study of all adult cancer patients at SKMCH & RC Pakistan, from 15th March - 10th July,2020 diagnosed with COVID-19 within 4 weeks of receiving anti-cancer treatment, where a purposive sampling was carried out. Cancer Patients who did not receive anti-cancer treatment and clinical or radiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without a positive RT-PCR test were excluded. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality after 30 days of COVID\\\\19 test. Data was analyzed through SPSS version 23. Categorical parameters were computed using Chi-Square test, keeping p-value <0.05 as significant. Results A total of 201 cancer patients with COVID\\\\19 were analyzed. The median age of patients was 45 (18-78) years. Mild symptoms were present in 162(80.6%) patients and 39(19.4%) had severe symptoms. The risk of death was statistically significant (p-value <0.05) amongst patients above 50 years of age, with metastatic disease and on palliative anti-cancer treatment. Anti-cancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy and surgery) recieved within preceding 4 weeks, had no statistically significant (p-value >0.05) impact on mortality. Conclusion In cancer patients with COVID-19, mortality appears to be principally driven by age, advanced stage of the disease and palliative intent of cancer treatment.

Estimated face mask use and thoughts about wearing face masks were assessed using measures developed for this study. Participants also answered questions about their general mood, social anxiety and basic demographic data. Multiple regression was used to examine factors associated with mask wearing. Participants estimated mask wearing was low when in public spaces, such as the park (17%) or walking on the high street (36%). However, broadly fitting with UK guidance at the time, rates were considerably higher when in situations of closer proximity to others, such as on public transport (94%), in a shop or caf (62%), when speaking to somebody in an enclosed public space (67%) or in a busy area when social distancing was not possible (79%). When looking at estimated mask wearing when in proximity to others, positive social cognitions (e.g., Ill look confident and competent wearing a mask) were associated with more wearing, whereas negative social cognitions (e.g., Ill look anxious, Ill look foolish) were associated with less wearing. These results remained after controlling for factors that have indicated increased risk from COVID-19 (age, gender, ethnicity, presence of a health condition or pregnancy), belief about the health benefit for others and levels of depression and social anxiety.

We sought to report elective surgical case distribution, associated gross hospital earnings and regional hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity as elective surgical cases are cancelled and then resumed under simulated trends of COVID-19 incidence. METHODS: A retrospective, cohort analysis was performed using insurance claims from 161 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2008 to December 31,2017. COVID-19 cases were calculated using a generalized Richards model. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports on the number of hospitalized and intensive care patients by age were used to estimate the number of cases seen in the ICU, the reduction in elective surgeries and the financial impact of this from historic claims data, using a denominator of all inpatient revenue and outpatient surgeries. RESULTS: Assuming 5% infection prevalence, cancelling all elective procedures decreases ICU overcapacity from 340% to 270%, but these elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR 74, 80) (1.1 trillion (T) US dollars) to inpatient hospital plus outpatient surgical gross earnings per year. Musculoskeletal, circulatory and digestive category elective surgical cases compose 33% ($447B) of total revenue. CONCLUSIONS: Procedures involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and digestive system account for the largest loss of hospital gross earnings when elective surgery is postponed.

Results From 47 eligible patients (27 female patients), 32 were children. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) was the indication for anakinra therapy in 42.6% of patients. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) was the most common underlying diagnosis (19/47) followed by the spectrum of AID. Off-label use was noted in 38.3% patients. Recommended dose was exceeded in 21 children (mean induction dose 5.1, highest dose 29.4 mg/kg/day) and two adults;five patients were treated intravenously. The mean treatment duration for SJIA was 1.4 years, that for AID was 2.2 years, and that for patients with higher anakinra dose was 9.7 (19.3) months. The mean follow-up duration was 2.7 (1.7) years.

We discussed the validity and reliability of the proposed method by conducting a user test of an electric-assisted four-wheeled cycle for frail elderly people in Kakegawa city in Shizuoka, Japan. We also succeeded in marking the points that need attention, which is about 33% of the total amount of utterance data (1626 utterances), and thus confirmed the potential of the proposed method.

Participants of this retrospective cohort study were obstetrics patients with suspected COVID-19 who underwent an RT-PCR test in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. Maternal-perinatal features were analysed according to the results of this test. Clinical, radiological and analytical characteristics that could be associated with a negative result were also explored. In a final subgroup analysis, patients were included if they had pneumonia and a negative test result for the virus. Out of the 111 obstetric patients with suspected COVID-19 that were enrolled, 38.7% returned a negative result. In this RT-PCR-negative group, we recorded lower rates of pneumonia (21.4% vs. 45.6%, p = 0.009), severe or critical clinical features (4.7% vs. 11.8% and 0.0% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.02, respectively), lower lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (168 UI/L vs. 224.5 UI/L, p = 0.003), a greater need for maternal treatment (60.3% vs 24.4%, p < 0.001), a reduced need for oxygen therapy (2.4% vs 28.8%, p < 0.001) and a lower rate of intensive care unit admission (0.0% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.046) than the RT-PCR-positive group. While no differences were found in other variables, the monocyte count was higher (946.2/L vs. 518.8/L, p = 0.022) in this group. The predictive model for a negative test result included the monocyte count, LDH level and no need for oxygen therapy. This model was able to identify 73.5% of patients with a negative RT-PCR result. Only 11% of the patients with pneumonia testing negative for the virus had IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The proportion of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 and a negative RT-PCR result was nearly 39%. In these patients, the symptoms were mild and the systemic severity of the disease was lower. The monocyte count, LDH level and no need for oxygen therapy were the factors that were more related to a negative test result in this group.

Previous studies have revealed that the NS1 protein is able to induce apoptosis via an extrinsic pathway. However, it remains unclear whether the intrinsic pathway is also associated with this apoptosis. The present study used a clone of the NS1 gene from avian influenza A/Jiangsu/1/2007 and observed the localization of the NS1 protein and cytochrome c release from mitochondria and the change of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in lung cancer cells. Cytotoxicity was detected using an MTT assay and the number of apoptotic cells was counted using a flow cytometer. Following the isolation of mitochondria, western blotting was performed to compare cytochrome c release from the mitochondria in cells before and after apoptosis. The change of MMP was detected using JC-1 staining. Furthermore, the results reveal that the majority of the NS1 protein was localized in the cell nucleus, and that it may induce apoptosis of human lung epithelial cells. The apoptosis occurred with marked cytochrome c release from mitochondria and a change of the MMP.

This suspicion can also lead to medical confusion and inappropriate management of acute respiratory syndrome due to causes other than MERS-CoV. METHODS: We studied the characteristics and outcome of patients hospitalized for suspected MERS-CoV infection in the isolation wards of two referral infectious disease departments in the Paris area between January 2013 and December 2016. RESULTS: Of 93 adult patients (49 male (52.6%), median age 63.4 years) hospitalized, 82 out of 93 adult patients had returned from Saudi Arabia, and 74 of them were pilgrims (Hajj). Chest X-ray findings were abnormal in 72 (77%) patients. The 93 patients were negative for MERS-CoV RT-PCR, and 70 (75.2%) patients had documented infection, 47 (50.5%) viral, 22 (23.6%) bacterial and one Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Microbiological analysis identified Rhinovirus (27.9%), Influenza virus (26.8%), Legionella pneumophila (7.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.5%), and non-MERS-coronavirus (6.4%). Antibiotics were initiated in 81 (87%) cases, with two antibiotics in 63 patients (67.7%). The median duration of hospitalization and isolation was 3 days (1C33) and 24 h (8C92), respectively. Time of isolation decreased over time (P < 0.01). Two patients (2%) died. CONCLUSION: The management of patients with possible MERS-CoV infection requires medical facilities with trained personnel, and rapid access to virological results.

METHODS: A qualitative survey method was used to assess CRNA experience with critical care ventilators. Prior to deployment in the ICU, CRNAs were trained by clinical lead respiratory therapists. Education included respiratory clinical practices and ventilator management. Sixty-minute sessions were held with demonstration stations set up in ICUs for hands-on experience. RESULTS: Fifty-six CRNAs responded to our survey (63%). A mean  SD of 9.48  12.27 h was spent training prior to deployment in the ICU. CRNAs were at the bedside a mean  SD of 73.0  40.6 h during the pandemic.

Inpatient admissions (0.36 vs 0.50, p<0.001), outpatient visits (4.78 vs 5.68, p<0.001), number of abdominal CT scans (0.18 vs 0.23, p=0.002), number of upper endoscopies (0.10 vs 0.19, p<0.001), and number of colonoscopies (0.04 vs 0.10, p<0.001) were higher during the 6 months after the start of the pandemic (compared to the 6 months before). Prescription rate for PPIs, H2 blockers, opioids, and anti-platelet agents were also higher during the pandemic (Table 1). Patients had higher rates of symptoms including abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and weight loss during the pandemic, as reported by ICD coding. Similar trends were seen when stratifying by FGID type, and by SARS-CoV-2 test positivity (but did not reach statistical significance in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group. Active smoking, cough, pneumonia, and diarrhea-predominant IBS were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 among patients with FGID, while alcohol use and functional dyspepsia decreased this risk (Table 2). Discussion: Health care utilization among patients with FGIDs increased significantly during the pandemic, independent of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Increased psychosocial stress and increased utilization of telehealth visits may partially explain this trend. Our data suggest that smoking status, cough, pneumonia, and diarrhea-predominant IBS could independently determine the increased risk of COVID-19 among patients with FGID.(Table presented)(Table presented)","output":"113 COVID-19 PANDEMIC INCREASED HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION AMONG PATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is a standard and crucial examination method used for suspected cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) In profoundly affected or limited resource areas, CXR imaging is preferable owing to its availability, low cost, and rapid results However, given the rapidly spreading nature of COVID-19, such tests could limit the efficiency of pandemic control and prevention In response to this issue, artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning are promising options for automatic diagnosis because they have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the analysis of visual information and a wide range of medical images This paper reviews and critically assesses the preprint and published reports between March and May 2020 for the diagnosis of COVID-19 via CXR images using convolutional neural networks and other deep learning architectures Despite the encouraging results, there is an urgent need for public, comprehensive, and diverse datasets Further investigations in terms of explainable and justifiable decisions are also required for more robust, transparent, and accurate predictions CCBY","output":"Deep Learning Approaches for Detecting COVID-19 from Chest X-ray Images: A Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Through collating observations from various studies and complementing these findings with one author's study, a detailed overview of the benefits and drawbacks of asynchronous email interviewing is provided.

INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the operation of outpatient care worldwide for months. The new framework was set in Hungary by the health emergency regulations that existed from 11. 03. 2020 to 17. 06. 2020. OBJECTIVE: In the second half of the emergency period, between 22. 04. 2020 and 05. 05. 2020, we surveyed the opinion of physicians involved in epilepsy care about the extent to which patient care had changed and how they experienced the changes in person. METHOD: An internet questionnaire survey was conducted among neurologists registered for the annual congress of the Hungarian Chapter of the International League Against Epilepsy. Nine single- or multiple-choice questions and 'free comment' fields were available. RESULTS: Of 116 neurologists contacted, 33 responded (28%), and a total of 30 comments were recorded. 73% said the changes caused a serious difficulty, 15% thought it would have serious consequences. Reception of new patients was stopped in 53%, and 25% encountered great difficulties. In 49%, the problems of the cared patients could be solved using remote visits, but 24% could not solve them properly. 68% of outpatient visits took the form of documented telephone conversations. Two-thirds of doctors feared catching the virus, 40% of whom felt they were not getting enough protection. 6% caught the infection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has mostly affected the issuance of new expert opinions, but care tasks have not always been adequately addressed. The damage was significantly mitigated by the flexibility of the care staff. Telephone visits, if necessary, can replace personal doctor-patient encounters in epileptology. The technical development of remote visit applications and their documentation issues are important. During the pandemic period, great care must be taken to protect staff in order to avoid infection and increase the sense of safety of doctors.

In this study, we investigated the associations of SES with self-reported, tested and diagnosed COVID-19 status in the general population. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were 49 474 men and women (4612 years) residing in the Northern Netherlands from the Lifelines cohort study. SES indicators and lifestyle factors (i.e., smoking status, physical activity, alcohol intake, diet quality, sleep time and TV watching time) were assessed by questionnaire from the Lifelines Biobank. Self-reported, tested and diagnosed COVID-19 status was obtained from the Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 4711 participants who self-reported having had a COVID-19 infection, 2883 participants tested for COVID-19, and 123 positive cases were diagnosed in this study population. After adjustment for age, sex, lifestyle factors, body mass index and ethnicity, we found that participants with low education or low income were less likely to self-report a COVID-19 infection (OR [95% CI]: low education 0.78 [0.71 to 0.86]; low income 0.86 [0.79 to 0.93]) and be tested for COVID-19 (OR [95% CI]: low education 0.58 [0.52 to 0.66]; low income 0.86 [0.78 to 0.95]) compared with high education or high income groups, respectively.

Until now, no specific treatment is available against SARS-CoV-2. The causal virus SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects lung cells, leading to respiratory illness ranging in severity from the common cold to deadly pneumonia. This, with comorbidities, worsens the clinical outcome, particularly for immunosuppressed individuals with COVID-19. Interestingly, the commensal gut microbiota has been shown to improve lung infections by modulating the immune system. Therefore, fine-tuning of the gut microbiome with probiotics could be an alternative strategy for boosting immunity and treating COVID-19. Here, we present a systematic biological network and meta-analysis to provide a rationale for the implementation of probiotics in preventing and/or treating COVID-19. We have identified 90 training genes from the literature analysis (according to PRISMA guidelines) and generated an association network concerning the candidate genes linked with COVID-19 and probiotic treatment. The functional modules and pathway enrichment analysis of the association network clearly show that the application of probiotics could have therapeutic effects on ACE2-mediated virus entry, activation of the systemic immune response, nlrp3-mediated immunomodulatory pathways, immune cell migration resulting in lung tissue damage and cardiovascular difficulties, and altered glucose/lipid metabolic pathways in the disease prognosis. We also demonstrate the potential mechanistic domains as molecular targets for probiotic applications to combat the viral infection. Our study, therefore, offers probiotics-mediated novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 warfare.","output":"Systematic Network and Meta-analysis on the Antiviral Mechanisms of Probiotics: A Preventive and Treatment Strategy to Mitigate SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research question: Is there vertical transmission (from mother to baby antenatally or intrapartum) after SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infected pregnancy?

PURPOSE: To develop an artificial intelligence algorithm to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other causes of abnormalities at chest radiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, a deep neural network, CV19-Net, was trained, validated, and tested on chest radiographs in patients with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. For the chest radiographs positive for COVID-19, patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with findings positive for pneumonia between February 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, were included. For the nonCCOVID-19 chest radiographs, patients with pneumonia who underwent chest radiography between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019, were included. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to characterize diagnostic performance. To benchmark the performance of CV19-Net, a randomly sampled test data set composed of 500 chest radiographs in 500 patients was evaluated by the CV19-Net and three experienced thoracic radiologists. RESULTS: A total of 2060 patients (5806 chest radiographs; mean age, 62 years  16 [standard deviation]; 1059 men) with COVID-19 pneumonia and 3148 patients (5300 chest radiographs; mean age, 64 years  18; 1578 men) with nonCCOVID-19 pneumonia were included and split into training and validation and test data sets. For the test set, CV19-Net achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.93). This corresponded to a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 87, 89) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI: 77, 80) by using a high-sensitivity operating threshold, or a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI: 77, 79) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI: 88, 90) by using a high-specificity operating threshold.

Given the massive release of misleading information during the pandemic, some pharmacies recommend drugs such as ivermectin, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine that are not useful for preventing or treating COVID-19 and could expose patients to unnecessary adverse drug reactions (ADRs), drug-drug interactions (DDIs), disease masking, and antibiotic resistance. RATIONALE: SM with drugs advertised for COVID-19 can have consequences, and people should be aware of approved uses, potential contraindications, and ADRs. Thus, the aim of this study was to know the drug therapies including natural products and homeopathic drugs offered by Colombian pharmaceutical establishments for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, as well as the information provided on the safe use of the product. METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional mystery shopping study was carried out to determine the pharmaceutical alternatives for the management of COVID-19 offered by pharmaceutical establishments (drugstores, pharmacies, homeopathic pharmacies, and nutritional supplements stores) in Colombia, and information related to the safe use of the product. The study included 482 pharmaceutical establishments from 16 Colombian departments. Data collection was done through telephone calls to each of the establishments following an interview protocol pretending to be a patient who presents symptoms related to COVID-19. RESULTS: About 57.3% (276) of the establishments recommended a product for the treatment of COVID-19 infection, 66.6% (321) asked whether the caller had COVID-19 symptoms and what they are, and 44.2% (213) suggested taking a COVID-19 test. Of 59 drugs suggested by pharmacies, the most recommended were azithromycin, ivermectin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and ASA (aspirin). From the establishments that recommended a product, dosage was indicated in 85.5% (236) of the pharmaceutical establishments and 14.5% (40) of the establishments reported the most common adverse effects of this substance. About 9.4% (26) of the establishments reported possible interactions of the recommended drugs and substances with food, beverages, or supplements.Conclusion: Pharmaceutical establishments in Colombia seem to have significantly contributed to self-medication for COVID-19 in Colombia during the pandemic. This behavior is inappropriate, since the mild forms of the disease do not have a specific treatment.

Methods Annually, we measured GFR by iohexol disappearance from plasma (iGFR) and serum concentrations of creatinine and cystatin C. We calculated eGFRcr and the creatinine-cystatin C combination equation (eGFRcr-cys) with and without race adjustment. We used multilevel mixed models to account for the within-visit linked structure of the multiple GFR measures, further nested within repeated observations for individuals. We examined the association between lean mass, HIV status, and eGFRcr bias in a subset with body composition measures. Results 207 HIV-positive and 107 HIV-negative AA participants contributed 781 and 376 study visits, respectively, with valid measures of iGFR, creatinine, and cystatin C. Among PLWH, omitting the race adjustment (compared with retaining it) changed average eGFRcr bias from 9.1 to -3.9 ml/min/1.73 m2. Moreover, estimation accuracy improved significantly when race adjustment was omitted rather than retained: 86% vs. 78% for eGFRcr (P<0.001) and 91% vs. 88% for eGFRcr-cys (P=0.045).

Aside from excess low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD), mainly characterized by elevated triglycerides and decreased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, is often present in T2DM obese patients. Bariatric surgery, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), has become a reference treatment in that population. However, the respective effects of RYGB vs SG on lipid metabolism in T2DM patients have been rarely studied. METHODS A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, comparing the effects of RGYBG vs SG on lipid metabolism 12 months after surgery in T2DM patients, was performed. RESULTS Four studies including a total of 298 patients (151 patients in the RYGB and 147 patients in the SG group) were examined. Despite a greater decrease in body mass index and greater improvement in glycemic control in RYGB compared to SG. RYGB vs SG was more effective in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C levels (mean difference [MD] -26.10 mg/dL, 95 % CI -38.88 to -13.50, p<0.00001; [MD] -20.10 mg/dL, 95 % CI -27.90 to -12.20, p<0.00001 and MD 31.90 mg/dl, 95 % CI -46.90 to -16.80, p<0.00001, respectively).

The results also revealed that the perception of the respondent faculty members toward their emotional intelligence from different universities and states is more or less the same and also the demographic variable gender has a significant impact on emotional intelligence during the present pandemic. CONCLUSION Besides having theoretical implications that open pathways for conducting further research, the findings of the study may serve as a reference for service practitioners in designing strategies that will ensure superior performance of faculty members in higher educational institutions during the pandemic.","output":"Navigating COVID-19 with emotional intelligence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation is a unique post-translational modification that regulates many biological processes, such as DNA damage repair. During DNA repair, ADP-ribosylation needs to be reversed by ADP-ribosylhydrolases. A group of ADP-ribosylhydrolases have a catalytic domain, namely the macrodomain, which is conserved in evolution from prokaryotes to humans. Not all macrodomains remove ADP-ribosylation. One set of macrodomains loses enzymatic activity and only binds to ADP-ribose (ADPR). Here, we summarize the biological functions of these macrodomains in DNA damage repair and compare the structure of enzymatically active and inactive macrodomains. Moreover, small molecular inhibitors have been developed that target macrodomains to suppress DNA damage repair and tumor growth. Macrodomain proteins are also expressed in pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, these domains may not be directly involved in DNA damage repair in the hosts or pathogens. Instead, they play key roles in pathogen replication. Thus, by targeting macrodomains it may be possible to treat pathogen-induced diseases, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","output":"ADP-ribosylhydrolases: from DNA damage repair to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scaffolds support and promote the formation of new functional tissues through cellular interactions with living cells. Various types of scaffolds have found their way into biomedical science, particularly in tissue engineering. Scaffolds with a superior tissue regenerative capacity must be biocompatible and biodegradable, and must possess excellent functionality and bioactivity. The different polymers that are used in fabricating scaffolds can influence these parameters. Polysaccharide-based polymers, such as collagen and chitosan, exhibit exceptional biocompatibility and biodegradability, while the degradability of synthetic polymers can be improved using chemical modifications. However, these modifications require multiple steps of chemical reactions to be carried out, which could potentially compromise the end products biosafety. At present, conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS), polyaniline, and polypyrrole, are often incorporated into matrix scaffolds to produce electrically conductive scaffold composites. However, this will reduce the biodegradability rate of scaffolds and, therefore, agitate their biocompatibility. This article discusses the current trends in fabricating electrically conductive scaffolds, and provides some insight regarding how their immunogenicity performance can be interlinked with their physical and biodegradability properties.","output":"Advocating Electrically Conductive Scaffolds with Low Immunogenicity for Biomedical Applications: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Since being declared a global pandemic, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) took over healthcare providers and researchers interest. However, other epidemic diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), are still a health issue that aggravate under the umbrella of health facilities exhaustion. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tuberculosis management. Methods A retrospective analysis of the quarterly reports issued by a tuberculosis management unit from 2017 to June 2021, including data of 12 subunits. The changes in pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis incidence trends (new + relapsed cases) throughout the 4 years were reported. The quarterly changed percentages in cases numbers along 2020 and first half of 2021 was compared with that of the same periods in 2019. Results Incidence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis was higher than pulmonary tuberculosis throughout the 4 year study periods (7.69 vs. 4.49, 9.44 vs. 4.33, 7.75 vs. 3.58, and 7.82 vs. 2.94/100.000 population, respectively) with a noticeable decline in the incidence of pulmonary TB during 2020. The second quarter of 2020 showed the lowest tuberculosis incidence rate with a 41.6% decline in the total number of diagnosed cases while 2nd quarter of 2021 showed 21.2% decline. During 2020, only 4 cases of multidrug-resistant TB were reported (compared to an average of 8 cases of MDR-TB yearly before the COVID-19 era). Conclusion There was a noticeable drop in tuberculosis case detection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown, started in Egypt by the end of March 2020, could contribute to the marked drop in the second quarter. However, a steady partial decline was continued during the first half of 2021, which foretells a growing problem.","output":"The burden of COVID-19 pandemic on tuberculosis detection: a single-center study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing availability of telemedicine video visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults have greater challenges in getting care through telemedicine. OBJECTIVE: We aim to better understand the barriers to telemedicine in community-dwelling older adults to improve the access to and experience of virtual visits. METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods needs assessment of older adults at two independent living facilities (sites A and B) in Northern California between September 2020 and March 2021. Voluntary surveys were distributed. Semistructured interviews were then conducted with participants who provided contact information. Surveys ascertained participants preferred devices as well as comfort level, support, and top barriers regarding telephonic and video visits. Qualitative analysis of transcribed interviews identified key themes. RESULTS: Survey respondents (N=249) average age was 84.6 (SD 6.6) years, and 76.7% (n=191) of the participants were female. At site A, 88.9% (111/125) had a bachelors degree or beyond, and 99.2% (124/125) listed English as their preferred language. At site B, 42.9% (51/119) had a bachelors degree or beyond, and 13.4% (16/119) preferred English, while 73.1% (87/119) preferred Mandarin. Regarding video visits, 36.5% (91/249) of all participants felt comfortable connecting with their health care team through video visits. Regarding top barriers, participants at site A reported not knowing how to connect to the platform (30/125, 24%), not being familiar with the technology (28/125, 22.4%), and having difficulty hearing (19/125, 15.2%), whereas for site B, the top barriers were not being able to speak English well (65/119, 54.6%), lack of familiarity with technology and the internet (44/119, 36.9%), and lack of interest in seeing providers outside of the clinic (42/119, 35.3%). Three key themes emerged from the follow-up interviews (n=15): (1) the perceived limitations of video visits, (2) the overwhelming process of learning the technology for telemedicine, and (3) the desire for in-person or on-demand help with telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial barriers exist for older adults in connecting with their health care team through telemedicine, particularly through video visits. The largest barriers include difficulty with technology or using the video visit platform, hearing difficulty, language barriers, and lack of desire to see providers virtually.

The mathematical analysis of compartmental models with subpopulations shows that the in-school contact rates affects the overall course of the pandemic only above a certain threshold that separates an influence phase from a non-influence one. The threshold, that we calculate via linear approximation in several cases, seems to appear in all contexts, including outbreaks or new strains upsurge, lockdowns, and vaccination campaigns excluding children, albeit with different values. Our theoretical findings are then confirmed by several data-driven studies that have previously identified the phase transition in specific cases. Specific outcomes of this study are: opposite conclusions reached by studies of the same or similar situations might depend on, possibly small, differences in modeling or in parameter estimation from the very noisy Covid-19 data, that result in identifying different phases; it is possible to keep schools open at any stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, but suitably strict rules must be applied at all times or else this becomes highly detrimental to virus containment efforts; as the threshold during vaccination turns out to correspond to the internal transmission rate that would lead to virus extinction if the school population was isolated, the needed strict control can be sustained only for very brief periods; as a result, either schools will have to face a prolonged closure or children need to be vaccinated as well.","output":"A new threshold reveals the uncertainty about the effect of school opening on diffusion of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of administrative data in health and social science research continues to expand, with increased availability of data and interest from funders. Researchers, however, continue to experience delays in access, storage and sharing of administrative data. Training opportunities are limited and typically specific to individual data providers or focussed on the analytical aspects of working with administrative data. The CENTRIC study was funded by the Information Commissioners Office, with the aim of developing a broader training curriculum for researchers working with administrative data in the UK. METHODS: A mixed-methods design informed curriculum content, including surveys with researchers, focus group discussions with data providers and workshops with members of the public. Researchers were identified from relevant administrative data networks and invited to participate in an online survey identifying training needs. Data providers were approached with a request to input to a face-to-face or online meeting with two members of the research team about their experiences of working with researchers. Data were analysed within the broad framework of the interview schedule, free text responses in the survey were analysed thematically. RESULTS: 107 researchers responded to the online survey and four data providers participated in the focus groups. We identified five main themes, relating to research training needs for UK researchers working with administrative data: communication; timelines; changes & amendments; future-proofing applications; and, the availability of training and support. Data providers either provided additional evidence on these learning needs or ways to address identified challenges. Six modules were developed addressing these training needs.

METHODS: We conducted active, prospective surveillance for ARIs (defined as 2 new signs/symptoms of respiratory illness) among all residents in three PCCFs near New York City from December 7, 2016 to May 7, 2017. The parents/guardians of some residents also provided consent for research specimen collection at the start of the study. In that subset, nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained 4 days of ARI symptom onset and weekly for 4 weeks of follow-up to assess viral shedding. Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1), parainfluenzavirus (PIV 1C4), metapneumovirus (MPV), adenovirus (AdV), bocavirus (BoV), enterovirus, parechovirus, and M. pneumoniae were tested by the Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 real-time RT-PCR panel. RESULTS: Subset with research specimen collection: Among 79 residents (aged 0C20 years, median = 8), 60 ARIs were reported in 37 (47%) residents. Swabs were obtained at illness onset for 53/60 ARI episodes; among these, there were 25 single-virus detections and five co-detections. An additional 33 single- and five co-detections occurred in 175 follow-up swabs (table). Molecular typing of 32 RV+ specimens identified 13 RV types. All residents: During the 2016C2017 influenza season, 308/322 (96%) age-eligible residents received influenza vaccine and 168/364 (46%) received prophylactic antivirals for influenza exposures. Although influenza was not detected in research swabs, it was detected in 3/200 tests conducted for clinical purposes. CONCLUSION: ARIs were common among residents of three PCCFs, and a variety of respiratory viruses were detected.

Finally, we evaluated outcomes stratified by age. DATA SOURCES A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and preprint websites was conducted between January 1, 2020, and December 10, 2020. Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews identification: CRD42020203369. STUDY SELECTION Studies reporting on consecutive in-hospital cardiac arrest with a resuscitation attempt among patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were synthesized according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or through an independent third reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS Eight studies reporting on 847 in-hospital cardiac arrest were included. In-hospital cardiac arrest incidence varied between 1.5% and 5.8% among hospitalized patients and 8.0-11.4% among patients in ICU. In-hospital cardiac arrest occurred more commonly in older male patients. Most initial rhythms were nonshockable (83.9%, [asystole = 36.4% and pulseless electrical activity = 47.6%]). Return of spontaneous circulation occurred in 33.3%, with a 91.7% in-hospital mortality. In-hospital cardiac arrest events in ICU had higher incidence of return of spontaneous circulation (36.6% vs 18.7%; p < 0.001) and relatively lower mortality (88.7% vs 98.1%; p < 0.001) compared with in-hospital cardiac arrest in non-ICU locations. Patients greater than or equal to 60 years old had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than those less than 60 years (93.1% vs 87.9%; p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS Approximately, one in 20 patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 received resuscitation for an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Hospital survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest within the ICU was higher than non-ICU locations and seems comparable with prepandemic survival for nonshockable rhythms. Although the data provide guidance surrounding prognosis after in-hospital cardiac arrest, it should be interpreted cautiously given the paucity of information surrounding treatment limitations and resource constraints during the pandemic.

Starting in 2013, flexible and integrative psychiatric care model projects according to 64b SGB V German Social Law (FIT64b) have been implemented. The study PsychCare combines quantitative and qualitative primary data with routine health insurance data for the evaluation of these models. Effects, costs and cost-effectiveness from the perspectives of patients, relatives and care providers are compared with standard care. Additionally, quality indicators for a modern, flexible and integrated care are developed. This article describes the rationale, design and methods of the project. Methods: PsychCare is built on a multiperspective and multimethod design. A controlled prospective multicenter cohort study is conducted with three data collection points (baseline assessment, follow-up after 9 and 15 months). A total of 18 hospitals (10 FIT64b model and 8 matched control hospitals) have consecutively recruited in- and outpatients with pre-specified common and/or severe psychiatric disorders. Primary endpoints are differences in change of health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction. Sociodemographic and service receipt data of the primary data collection are linked with routine health insurance data. A cost-effectiveness analysis, a mixed method, participatory process evaluation by means of qualitative surveys and the development of quality indicators are further elements of PsychCare. Discussion and Practical Implications: The results based on data from different methodological approaches will provide essential conclusions for the improvement of hospital based mental health care in Germany.

Equal number of IIM patients without anti-MDA5 antibody were selected as controls. Line blot immunoassay was used to detect the autoantibodies. The onset of disease, presenting clinical features and subsequent complications were analyzed for any seasonality. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients with anti-MDA5 positive DM were studied. The mean age at diagnosis was 53.0  12.3 years and the mean follow-up duration was 20.6  23.1 months. Two third of the patients (66%) had the clinically amyopathic phenotype.

A decline in the rates of primary PCI has been observed globally during the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Fear of exposure to in-hospital infection has been hypothesized as the main mechanism of this phenomenon, also contributing to a delayed presentation of patients with STEMI. However, a formal assessment of initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) among STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is still lacking. We therefore compared pre-hospital ECGs of STEMI patients hospitalized in Italy after the first reported case of COVID-19 on 21 February 2020 with data from the same period in 2019 to identifying potential changes between the two periods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prehospital ECGs were obtained from the STEMI care network in the Campania region. Deidentified ECGs were analysed by two expert reviewers who were blinded to date of recording. Pathological Q-waves were defined as a Q-wave with a duration 40 ms and/or depth 25% of the R-wave in the same lead or the presence of a Q-wave equivalent. These criteria have been shown to be associated with final infarct size at cardiac magnetic resonance. For all conventional STEMI, the timing of STEMI onset was estimated with the Anderson-Wilkins (AW) acuteness score, ranging from 1 (least acute) to 4 (most acute). From 21 February 2020 to 16 April 2020, a total of 3239 pre-hospital ECGs were recorded by the emergency medical system and 167 (5.15%) were classified as STEMI. During the same period in 2019, 3505 pre-hospital ECGs were recorded, and 196 (5.59%) were classified as STEMI. There was no difference between the two study periods in terms of age, gender, type, and location of STEMI (Table 1). Pathological Q-waves were present in 54.5% of ECGs recorded during the COVID-19 period compared with 22.1% of ECGs recorded in the same period in 2019 (risk difference 32.3, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 21.2C43.5 percentage points). There was also an increase in the mean number of Q-waves during the COVID-19 compared with the control period (1.4 vs. 0.9; P < 0.001). These findings remained similar when QS- and qR complexes were analysed separately. Consistently, the AW score was significantly lower during the COVID-19 period (2.4 vs. 2.8; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital ECGs of STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic presented more frequently with signs of late ischemia compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Approximately, one out of two patients had already pathological Q-waves in the initial ECG. The AW acuteness score is superior to patient history (historical timing) in predicting myocardial salvage and mortality after reperfusion in STEMI patients, thus explaining the higher mortality rate and the increased risk of infarct-related complications observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"777 Prehospital ECG in patients with acute myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HF, B3LYP, and MP2 wave functions in combination with Pople 6-31, 6-311 augmented with polarization functions on all atoms and Dunning double- and triple-zeta basis sets have been employed to investigate the structures and torsional potential function of the nitro group in 2-nitropyridine-N-oxide (2-NPO) and a variety of its fluorinated derivatives. The augmentation of the basis sets with diffuse functions showed a marked effect on the profile and barriers of the NO(2) torsional potential. Depending on the applied model chemistry, the heterocyclic ring in some 2-NPOs has proved to be non-planar. The non-planarity of the ring was characterized by CremerCPople puckering amplitude Q. The disruption of the ring planarity in some NPOs was accounted for the distinctive reactivity and impact sensitivity of these heterocycles. Consistently, the NBO and the AIM analyses furnished clear evidence for the accentuated weakness of the CCNO(2) bond and provided evidence for the electronic interplay between the NO(2) group, the fluorine substituent and the heterocyclic ring. Deletion of all off-diagonal Fock-matrix elements (NOSTAR) to separate hyperconjugative stabilizing interactions from steric interactions was used. The effect of nitration and fluorination on the aromaticity of the studied 2-NPOs was investigated by using the NICS descriptors NICS(1) and NICS(1)(zz). These NICS indices have shown that the fluorination in para position to the nitro group exhibits the highest degree of aromaticity within the fluorinated 2-NPOs.

The range of symptoms associated with each infection can be wide ranging in both presentation and severity, depending on age of the patient, underlying co-morbidities and other confounding factors. In this chapter we describe the most common respiratory infections ranging from relatively mild infections such as the common cold, through to more serious presentations including pneumonia. Data are presented from a general practitioner morbidity surveillance system based in England and Wales. Each acute respiratory syndrome is described in respect of seasonality, secular trends and microbiological aetiology providing an insight into the complex nature of these acute respiratory episodes. The more serious endpoints of acute respiratory infections are hospitalisation and death. Many acute respiratory infections are mild in nature and generally self-limiting and therefore do not commonly require further medical interventions. However, despite major advances in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory infections in recent years, hospitalisation and deaths continue to exert pressures on national health resources and provide an economic burden in countries across the world on an annual basis.","output":"Common respiratory infections diagnosed in general practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DNA-based screening in individuals without known risk factors potentially identifies those who may benefit from genetic counseling, early medical interventions, and/or avoidance of late or missed diagnoses. While not currently in widespread usage, technological advances in genetic analysis overcome barriers to access by enabling less labor-intensive and more cost-efficient means to discover variants of clinical importance. This study describes the technical validation of a 430-gene next-generation sequencing based assay, GeneCompass(TM), indicated for the screening of healthy individuals in the areas of actionable health risks, pharmaceutical drug response, and wellness traits. The test includes genes associated with Mendelian disorders and genetic susceptibility loci, encompassing 14 clinical areas and pharmacogenetic variants. The custom-designed target enrichment capture and bioinformatics pipelines interrogate multiple variant types, including single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions (indels), copy number variants, and functional haplotypes (star alleles), including tandem alleles and structural variants. Validation was performed against reference DNA from three sources: 1000 Genomes Project (n = 3), Coriell biobank (n = 105), and previously molecularly characterized biological specimens: blood (n = 15) and saliva (n = 11). Analytical sensitivity and specificity for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were 97.57% and 99.99%, respectively, and for indels were 74.57% and 97.34%, respectively.

By comparing with the Western urban discourse, we clarify the process of how Tokyo became divided in terms of residential conditions. The national government focused on the growth of major metropolitan areas, stimulating suburban development and homeownership in the suburbs from the 1950s to the 1980s. However, after the late 1990s, the target shifted from the suburbs to the city centers. Alongside global competition among cities, the long-term recession of the Japanese economy, and social changes, continuous investment to grow central Tokyo has increased in importance. In contrast, suburban neighborhoods are facing challenges related to an aging population and an increase in housing vacancies. Although government intervention is necessary, there are limited possibilities for the outer suburbs to revitalize and re-grow. The sharp contrast between the growth in city centers and the shrinking suburbs, and specifically the divided Tokyo, will become more obvious in the next decade.","output":"Divided Tokyo: Housing Policy, the Ideology of Homeownership, and the Growing Contrast Between the City Center and the Suburbs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A limited outbreak of nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis (NIB) occurred in three Delmarva (DMV) commercial broiler chicken flocks in 2011. Isolates of NIB virus (NIBV)--DMV/1639/11, DMV/3432/11, and DMV/3902/11--were characterized by sequence analysis of the N-terminal subunit (S1) of the spike (S) gene. Findings indicated that the isolates were identical to each other and to PA/9579A/10, a 2010 isolate from poultry in Pennsylvania. The 2010 and 2011 isolates appear to have originated from a 1997-2000 NIB outbreak in Pennsylvania. DMV/1639/11 and PA/9579A/10 were determined to be nephropathogenic in susceptible chickens, yielding virus reisolations from kidney and inducing characteristic interstitial nephritis microscopic lesions. In a controlled laboratory study, 40% of chickens vaccinated with a combination live vaccine containing infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains Massachusetts (Mass) + Connecticut (Conn) were positive on virus isolation attempts after challenge with DMV/1639/11, compared with only 13% of Mass + Arkansas (Ark) vaccinates. Both combination vaccines gave partial protection against the development of DMV/1639/11-induced renal lesions. Although numerically fewer chickens vaccinated with Mass + Conn had interstitial nephritis compared with those vaccinated with Mass + Ark, neither vaccine combination offered greater protection (P < 0.05) than observed in unvaccinated chickens challenged with DMV/1639/11. Mass + Ark vaccinations, applied under commercial conditions in the hatchery (spray) and on-farm (spray), did not protect the trachea or kidney from DMV/1639/11 challenge.

Antibodies against S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) have been shown to confer a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Assays quantitatively measuring anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be of great value for NAb screening of potential donors for convalescent-phase plasma therapy, assessing natural or vaccine-induced immunity, stratifying individuals for vaccine receipt, and documenting vaccine response. METHODS: Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S), a high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence double-antigen sandwich immunoassay for quantitative measurement of pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, was evaluated against NT on 357 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. NT was performed in a BSL-3 laboratory using a Slovenian SARS-CoV-2 isolate; the NT titer &#8805;1:20 was considered positive. RESULTS: Elecsys-S detected pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 352/357 (98.6 %) samples. NAb were identified by NT in 257/357 (72 %) samples. The Elecsys-S/NT agreement was moderate (Cohen's kappa 0.56). High NT titer antibodies (&#8805;1:160) were detected in 106/357 (30 %) samples. Elecsys-S's pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations correlated with individual NT titer categories (the lowest concentrations were identified in NT-negative samples and the highest in samples with NT titer 1:1,280), and the Elecsys-S cutoff value for reasonable prediction of NAb generated after natural infection was established (133 BAU/mL). CONCLUSION: Although NT should remain the gold standard for assessing candidates for convalescent-phase plasma donors, selected commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays with optimized cutoff, like Elecsys-S, could be used for rapid, automated, and large-scale screening of individuals with clinically relevant NAb levels as suitable donors.","output":"Performance of the rapid high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay targeting total antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain in comparison to the neutralization assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tinea capitis, which are fungal infections caused by some dermatophyte species, are common in developing countries, such as Algeria, where they represent a public health concern. In order to define the epidemiological, clinical and diagnostic features of these infections, a prospective study was conducting from September 2018 to May 2019, at the University Hospital of Tizi-Ouzou (Algeria). PATIENTS All patients addressed to the Laboratory of Parasitology-Mycology of the University Hospital of Tizi-Ouzou for a suspected Tinea capitis, were included in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Before sampling, contact with animals or soil, presence of similar lesions in the family circle, and previous antifungal or corticosteroid treatment were searched. Mycological examination included direct microscopic examination of the samples, and culture on Sabouraud agar slants at 27C for up to 4weeks. RESULTS Out of the 87 samples examined, 46 allowed us to confirm the diagnosis of Tinea capitis, representing a positivity rate of 52.9%. The sex ratio was 1.09 (52.2% males vs. 47.8% females among the infected patients), and the infection mainly involved children of 4-6years (43.3%). Thirty-four strains of dermatophytes were isolated.

We aimed to describe recovery 1 year after hospital discharge for COVID-19, identify factors associated with patient-perceived recovery, and identify potential therapeutic targets by describing the underlying inflammatory profiles of the previously described recovery clusters at 5 months after hospital discharge. METHODS: The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study recruiting adults (aged 18 years) discharged from hospital with COVID-19 across the UK. Recovery was assessed using patient-reported outcome measures, physical performance, and organ function at 5 months and 1 year after hospital discharge, and stratified by both patient-perceived recovery and recovery cluster. Hierarchical logistic regression modelling was performed for patient-perceived recovery at 1 year. Cluster analysis was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach using clinical outcomes at 5 months. Inflammatory protein profiling was analysed from plasma at the 5-month visit. This study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN10980107, and recruitment is ongoing. FINDINGS: 2320 participants discharged from hospital between March 7, 2020, and April 18, 2021, were assessed at 5 months after discharge and 807 (327%) participants completed both the 5-month and 1-year visits. 279 (356%) of these 807 patients were women and 505 (644%) were men, with a mean age of 587 (SD 125) years, and 224 (278%) had received invasive mechanical ventilation (WHO class 7C9). The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was unchanged between 5 months (501 [255%] of 1965) and 1 year (232 [289%] of 804). Factors associated with being less likely to report full recovery at 1 year were female sex (odds ratio 068 [95% CI 046C099]), obesity (050 [034C074]) and invasive mechanical ventilation (042 [023C076]). Cluster analysis (n=1636) corroborated the previously reported four clusters: very severe, severe, moderate with cognitive impairment, and mild, relating to the severity of physical health, mental health, and cognitive impairment at 5 months. We found increased inflammatory mediators of tissue damage and repair in both the very severe and the moderate with cognitive impairment clusters compared with the mild cluster, including IL-6 concentration, which was increased in both comparisons (n=626 participants). We found a substantial deficit in median EQ-5D-5L utility index from before COVID-19 (retrospective assessment; 088 [IQR 074C100]), at 5 months (074 [064C088]) to 1 year (075 [062C088]), with minimal improvements across all outcome measures at 1 year after discharge in the whole cohort and within each of the four clusters. INTERPRETATION: The sequelae of a hospital admission with COVID-19 were substantial 1 year after discharge across a range of health domains, with the minority in our cohort feeling fully recovered. Patient-perceived health-related quality of life was reduced at 1 year compared with before hospital admission. Systematic inflammation and obesity are potential treatable traits that warrant further investigation in clinical trials.

To this end, a descriptive approach was used, and data were collected using a questionnaire. The sample included students at English language programs (ELP) in some Saudi universities at levels 5 and 6 since they took the phonetics and phonology course at the beginning of the pandemic. There was an educational challenge during the coronavirus that compelled the conventional system of education to accept the status quo where educators found themselves obliged to shift abruptly from a traditional, face-to-face educational environment to fully online instruction. However, most of our Saudi academic institutions were not prepared for such a sudden and quick change. During the COVID-19 lockdown, language teachers in English Departments at Saudi Universities (ELP) resorted to the different type of teaching which depended mostly on technology where internet-wired personal computers or tablets played a significant role, and which expanded the scope of the teaching process and practically increased orientation on the teachers' part. Moreover, students' independence and self-teaching seemed to have increased, which could have influenced their cognition and skills. This study discussed the way language teachers in ELP dealt with the challenging content of the phonology course during Covid-19. The findings show that there were some problems at the beginning moving from traditional to virtual classes, where the students depended upon themselves and adapted to the change.

A phylogenetic analysis based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences placed the sapovirus strains from African carnivores in a monophyletic group. Within this monophyletic group, sapovirus strains from spotted hyenas formed one independent sub-group, and those from bat-eared fox and African lion a second sub-group.

The mechanism by which dysfunctional endothelial cells and pericytes contribute to the vasculopathy, however, remains unknown. In this study, we used human blood vessel organoids (VOs) generated from iPSC of 22q11.2 DS patients to model the vascular malformations and genetic dysfunctions. We combined high-resolution lightsheet imaging and single-cell transcriptome analysis to link the genetic profile and vascular phenotype at the single-cell level. We developed a comprehensive analytical methodology by integrating deep learning-mediated blood vessel segmentation, network graph construction, and tessellation analysis for automated morphology characterization. We report that 22q11.2DS VOs demonstrate a smaller size with increased angiogenesis/sprouting, suggesting a less stable vascular network. Overall, clinical presentations of smaller vascular diameter, less connected vasculature, and increased branch points were recapitulated in 22q11.2DS VOs. Single-cell transcriptome profiling showed heterogeneity in both 22q11.2DS and control VOs, but the former demonstrated alterations in endothelial characteristics that are organ-specific and suggest a perturbation in the vascular developmental process. Intercellular communication analysis indicated that the vascular dysfunctions in 22q11.2 deletion were due to a lower cell-cell contact and upregulated extracellular matrix organization involving collagen and fibronectin. Voronoi diagram-based tessellation analysis also indicated that the colocalization of endothelial tubes and mural cells was different between control and 22q11.2 VOs, indicating that alterations in EC and mural interactions might contribute to the deficits in vascular network formation.

Validity and reliability studies of tele-neuropsychological testing have been conducted in MCI or mild AD dementia patients (e.g., MMSE=25+); few studies have assessed the feasibility of neurologic examination by video, and none in atypical dementias, assuming that patients with some types (e.g., language, comportment) or greater severity of cognitive-behavioral impairment would be unable to participate. Here we report the feasibility of telehealth services for a multi-disciplinary dementia subspecialty clinic that include cognitive-behavioral and neurologic assessment with patients with atypical neurodegenerative syndromes. METHODS: 104 patient-carepartner (P-C) dyads met with providers in the MGH FTD Unit by videoconference (March-December, 2020) for routine clinical care. P-Cs completed validated questionnaires assessing cognition-mood/behavior/function on REDCap prior to video clinical interview and cognitive assessment, including the MoCA and Boston Cognitive Exam (BCE2.0), a newly revised brief cognitive assessment battery adapted for telehealth. P-Cs met with a neurologist for a basic neurologic examination (including eye-movement examination), review of assessment results, and discussion of care plan. P-Cs completed a satisfaction survey. RESULTS: The 104 P-Cs included a range of atypical neurodegenerative disorders (bvFTD, PCA, PPA, CBS, PSP, eoAD, Multidomain syndrome) mild-to-severe impairment (CDR range: 0-3). 76% completed the MoCA (25% had CDR=2). 36% also completed the BCEv2.

The results show that: i) Skepticism, risk ubiquity, and personal immunity beliefs lead to maladaptive threat appraisal; ii) wearing masks and social distancing are antecedents of fear of infection while using transit and reduced transit use; iii) higher perceived threat deters transit use, while trust in transit operators motivates transit use; and iv) in a franchised transit system, trust in transit operators depends on the perceived level-of-service and trust in the ability of government authorities to regulate, monitor and enforce transit operators' preventive and protective actions.","output":"Transit use reduction following COVID-19: the effect of threat appraisal, proactive coping and institutional trust"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the outsourcing situation in Taiwanese hospitals and compares the differences in hospital ownership and in accreditation levels. METHODS: This research combined two kinds of methods: a questionnaire survey and the in-depth interview to two CEOs of the sample hospitals. One hospital is not-for-profit, while the other is a public hospital and the research samples are from the hospital data from Taiwan's 2005 to 2007 Department of Health qualifying lists of hospital accreditation. The returned questionnaires were analyzed with STATISTICA(? )7.1 version software. RESULTS: The results for non-medical items showed medical waste and common trash both have the highest rate (94.6 percent) of being outsourced. The gift store (75 percent) and linen (73 percent) follow close behind, while the lowest rate of outsourcing is in utility maintenance (13.5 percent). For medical items, the highest rate of outsourcing is in the ambulance units (51.4 percent), while the hemodialysis center follows close behind with a rate of 50 percent. For departments of nutrition, pharmacy, and nursing however, the outsourcing rate is lower than 3 percent. This shows that Taiwan's hospitals are still conservative in their willingness to outsource for medical items. The results of the satisfaction paired t-test show that the non-medical items have a higher score than the medical items. The factor analysis showed the three significant factors in of non medical items' outsourcing are \\"performance\\", \\"finance\\", and \\"human resource\\".

This study proposes a reliable hybrid dynamic bandwidth slice forecasting framework that combines the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and local smoothing methods to improve the network forecasting model. Moreover, the proposed framework can dynamically react to all the changes occurring in the data series. Backbone traffic was used to validate the proposed method. As a result, the forecasting accuracy improved significantly with the proposed framework and with minimal data loss from the smoothing process.

The main impediments to increasing their representation are an insufficient pipeline and the long time required to train a pediatric radiologist. A greater representation of minorities can only be achieved through the enduring nurturing of future pediatric radiologists along every step in the professional life cycle of a physician, from high school through fellowship completion. Restructuring of faculty recruitment and faculty development policies is also required. A key component of faculty development and overall wellness is mentorship.

Then, we designed attribute descriptors to perceive attributes of instances and edges from time series data, and we calculated the attribute weights via an analytic hierarchy process, thereby computing the influence between instances and the influence of features in influencing patterns. Next, we constructed influencing metrics and set a threshold to discover high influencing patterns.

Accordingly, it is expected that information transmission between equities and digital assets has been altered due to the hostile impact of the pandemic outbreak on financial markets. As a result, the ensuing perverse risk among markets is presumed to rise during severe uncertainties occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impetus of this study is to examine the degree of asymmetry and nonlinear directional causality between global equities and cryptocurrencies in the frequency domain. Hence, we employ both the variational mode decomposition (VMD) and the Rnyi effective transfer entropy techniques. Analyses of the study are presented for three sample periods;these are the full sample period, the pre-COVID-19 period, and the COVID-19 pandemic period. We gauge a mixture of asymmetric and nonlinear bidirectional and unidirectional causality between global equities and cryptocurrencies for the sample periods. However, the COVID-19 pandemic period appears to be driving the estimates for the full sample period, which indicates a negative flow. Thus, the direction and significance of the information flow between the markets for the full sample correspond to the one observed during the COVID-19 pandemic period. We, consequently, establish a significant directional, dynamical, and scale-dependent information flow between global equities and cryptocurrencies. Notwithstanding, throughout the study samples, we mainly find a negative significant information flow from global equities to cryptocurrencies. We detect that most cryptocurrencies exhibit similar behaviour of information flow to global equities for each of the sample periods. The outcome provides pertinent signals to investors with diverse investment horizons who would want to diversify, hedge, or employ cryptocurrencies as a safe haven for global equities during uncertainties, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2021 Emmanuel Asafo-Adjei et al.","output":"Information Flow between Global Equities and Cryptocurrencies: A VMD-Based Entropy Evaluating Shocks from COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify the internal mechanism of the relationship between physical activity and mental health in home exercises.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in the host cells as a receptor of Spike-I Glycoprotein of COVID-19 which causes final infection. ACE2 is highly expressed in the bladder, ileum, kidney and liver, comparing with ACE2 expression in the lung-specific pulmonary alveolar type II cells. In this study, the single-cell RNAseq data of the five tissues from different humans are curated and cell types with high expressions of ACE2 are identified. Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction networks have been established. From the network, potential biomarkers which can form functional hubs, are selected based on k-means network clustering. It is observed that angiotensin PPAR family proteins show important roles in the functional hubs. To understand the functions of the potential markers, corresponding pathways have been researched thoroughly through the pathway semantic networks. Subsequently, the pathways have been ranked according to their influence and dependency in the network using PageRank algorithm. The outcomes show some important facts in terms of infection. Firstly, renin-angiotensin system and PPAR signaling pathway can play a vital role for enhancing the infection after its intrusion through ACE2. Next, pathway networks consist of few basic metabolic and influential pathways, e.g. insulin resistance. This information corroborate the fact that diabetic patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the key regulators of the aforementioned pathways are angiontensin and PPAR family proteins.

Accordingly, this paper reports on the highly sensitive and specific detection of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins in COVID-19 patients. In this methodology, spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins belonging to the coronavirus genome were immobilized on the surface of a gold sensor using self-assembled monolayers. Previously, serum from COVID-19 patients was screened by immunochromatography-based COVID-19 IgG rapid test and/or ELISA in house to determine the presence of IgG titers. Serum from COVID-19-positive patients presenting with IgG were added on the surface and, at the time they bound to proteins, they caused refractive changes in the SPR angle. The antibody detection limit was determined through successive injections into the SPR apparatus - these injections ranged from pure (without dilution) to 1 : 200 L. The system has shown good reproducibility between runs after coated surface regeneration with 0.1 M glycine-HCl solution (pH 3.0); all experiments were tested in triplicate. The antibodies targeted both S and N fragments and gave a high assay sensitivity by identifying 19 out of 20 COVID-19-positive patients. Most importantly, the assay time took less than 10 min.

Main recommendations: (1) A medical team should be assigned to evaluate severe and critical COVID-19 for early monitoring of cardiac-arrest warning signs. (2) Psychological counseling and treatment are highly recommended, since sympathetic and vagal abnormalities induced by psychological stress from the COVID-19 pandemic can induce cardiac arrest. (3) Healthcare workers should wear personal protective equipment (PPE). (4) Mouth-to-mouth ventilation should be avoided on patients suspected of having or diagnosed with COVID-19.

Somewhat of a crisis in mental health has emerged across the general population through the evolution of the pandemic. A national Canadian survey identified a quadrupling of those experiencing pervasive elevated anxiety symptoms early in the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels, and a doubling of those with pervasive elevated depressive symptoms. Independent of the pandemic, persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can face multiple challenges related to their disease, which can result in a significant psychosocial burden and psychologic distress. Anxiety and depression have been found to be more prevalent in persons with IBD. Many potential factors contribute to the increased psychologic distress and negative impacts on mental health of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons with IBD. These include the fears of contracting COVID-19 or infecting other people. Many believe that IBD or its treatments predispose them to an increased risk of COVID-19 or a worse outcome if acquired. Concerns about access to health care add to mental distress. People with IBD generally report lower quality of life (QOL) compared to community controls. Psychologic interventions, in addition to adequate disease control, have been shown to improve health-related QOL. Uncertainty is another factor associated with reduced health-related QOL.

We report a case that probably resulted in the death of a patient from an erroneous interpretation of POC-BG readings due to interference from high-dose vitamin C. METHODS: Retrospective case review RESULTS: Our patient was admitted following a syncopal episode associated with an acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. She was found to have significant hyperglycemia with blood glucose >600 mg/dL on POC testing, associated with moderate ketoacidosis. She was treated with intravenous insulin as a case of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She developed severe hypoglycemia, which was confirmed on a venous BG, and her condition was complicated by an apparent stroke-like state. The patient deteriorated and subsequently died. We found no report of vitamin C causing apparent DKA, as seen in our case. CONCLUSION: POC-BG monitoring is very commonly used in intensive care unit settings to monitor BG as they are minimally invasive, convenient, and quick.

METHODS: The relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records with an implemented Caprini score and were retrospectively evaluated. The score was calculated twice: by the physician on admission and by the investigator at discharge (death). The final assessment considered additional risk factors that occurred during inpatient treatment. Besides the original Caprini score (a version of 2005), the modified version added the elevation of D-dimer and specific scores for COVID-19 as follows: two points for asymptomatic, three points for symptomatic, and five points for symptomatic infection with positive D-dimer. Cases were evaluated retrospectively. The primary end point was symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) detected during inpatient treatment and confirmed by appropriate imaging testing or autopsy. The secondary end points included those observed during hospitalization (admission to the intensive care unit, a requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, death, bleeding), and those assessed at 6-month follow-up (symptomatic VTE, bleeding, death). The association of eight different versions of the Caprini score with VTE events was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients (83 males and 85 females at the age of 58.3  12.7 years) were admitted to the hospital between April 30 and May 29, 2020, and were discharged or died to the time of data analysis. The original Caprini score varied between 2 and 12 (5.4  1.8) at the admission and between 2 and 15 (5.9  2.5) at discharge or death. The maximal score was observed with modification including specific COVID-19 points of 5 to 20 (10.0  3.0). Patients received prophylactic (enoxaparin 40 mg once daily: 2.4%), intermediate (enoxaparin 80 mg once daily: 76.8%), or therapeutic (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily: 20.8%) anticoagulation. Despite this, symptomatic VTE was detected in 11 (6.5%) inpatients. Of the 168 individuals, 28 (16.7%) admitted to the intensive care unit, 8 (4.8%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 8 (4.8%) died. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was detected in two (1.2%) cases. The Caprini score of all eight versions demonstrated a significant association with inpatient VTE frequency. The highest predictability was observed for the original scale when assessed at discharge (death). Only symptomatic VTE was reported after discharge with a cumulative incidence of 7.1%. This did not affect the predictability of the Caprini score. Extended antithrombotic treatment was prescribed to 49 (29%) patients with a cumulative incidence of bleeding of 1.8% at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified a significant correlation between the Caprini score and the risk of VTE in patients with COVID-19. All models including specific COVID-19 scores showed equally high predictability, and use of the original Caprini score is appropriate for patients with COVID-19.","output":"The original and modified Caprini score equally predicts venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The arrival of COVID-19 and accompanying restrictions posed many challenges to education communities worldwide In response, a large-scale virtual reality (VR) course was constructed and deployed at Colorado State University for a remote human anatomy course Enrolled students received a VR capable laptop and head-mounted display and participated in synchronous online laboratory and recitation sessions The program enabled students to work collaboratively in a common virtual space and learn human anatomy from digital cadavers and volumized medical data (CT and MRI) We hypothesized that VR is an effective method to increase student engagement and knowledge acquisition in human anatomy Qualitative data was collected on student engagement, confidence, and reactions to the new technology Quantitative data assessed student knowledge acquisition and retention of anatomical spatial relationships when using VR and two-dimensional (2D) methods Results suggested that using VR matched 2D methods in terms of student knowledge acquisition and retention of anatomical relationships Qualitative data indicated that VR enhanced student engagement and increased opportunities for students to interact with teaching assistants, peers, and the content Students further reported the unique aspects of the VR program allowed them to explore the content in novel ways There was a statistically significant increase in student examination scores when compared to previous in-person laboratories Overall, the virtual classroom maintained the rigor of traditional gross anatomy laboratories without negatively impacting student examination scores and provided a high level of accessibility, without compromising learner engagement This novel approach provides a highly engaging and interactive solution to distance education","output":"A Large-Scale Virtual Reality Deployment for Distance Education in Human Anatomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plants have had historical significance in medicine since the beginning of civilization. The oldest medical pharmacopeias of the African, Arabian, and Asian countries solely utilize plants and herbs to treat pain, oral diseases, skin diseases, microbial infections, multiple types of cancers, reproductive disorders among a myriad of other ailments. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 65% of the world population solely utilize botanical preparations as medicine. Due to the abundance of plants, plant-derived medicines are more readily accessible, affordable, convenient, and have safer side-effect profiles than synthetic drugs. Plant-based decoctions have been a significant part of Jamaican traditional folklore medicine. Jamaica is of particular interest because it has approximately 52% of the established medicinal plants that exist on earth. This makes the island particularly welcoming for rigorous scientific research on the medicinal value of plants and the development of phytomedicine thereof.

This change deeply impacted typical working routines, affecting both well-being and productivity. Moreover, this pandemic will have long-lasting effects in the software industry, with several tech companies allowing their employees to work from home indefinitely if they wish to do so. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and understand how a typical working day looks like when working from home and how individual activities affect software developers' well-being and productivity. We performed a two-wave longitudinal study involving almost 200 globally carefully selected software professionals, inferring daily activities with perceived well-being, productivity, and other relevant psychological and social variables. Results suggest that the time software engineers spent doing specific activities from home was similar when working in the office. However, we also found some significant mean differences. The amount of time developers spent on each activity was unrelated to their well-being, perceived productivity, and other variables.

Some of these cases may be caused by the recently described human bocavirus (hBoV). The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and the potential clinical relevance of hBoV in pediatric patients. METHODS: We tested 835 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) obtained between 2002 and 2005 from pediatric in-patients with acute respiratory tract diseases at the University of Wrzburg, Germany, for the presence of hBoV DNA. The specificity of positive PCR reactions was confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: HBoV DNA was found in 87 (10.3 %) of the NPAs. The median age of the infants and children with hBoV infection was 1.8 years (mean age 2.0 years; range 18 days C 8 years). Infections with hBoV were found year-round, though most occurred in the winter months. Coinfections were found in 34 (39.1 %) of the hBoV positive samples. RSV, influenza A, and adenoviruses were most frequently detected as coinfecting agents. Sequence determination of the PCR products in the NP-1 region revealed high identity (99 %) between the nucleotide sequences obtained in different years and in comparison to the Swedish viruses ST1 and ST2. An association of hBoV with a distinct respiratory tract manifestation was not apparent. CONCLUSION: HBoV is frequently found in NPAs of hospitalized infants and children with acute respiratory tract diseases. Proving the clinical relevance of hBoV is challenging, because application of some of Koch's revised postulates is not possible. Because of the high rate of coinfections with hBoV and other respiratory tract pathogens, an association between hBoV and respiratory tract diseases remains unproven.","output":"Frequent detection of bocavirus DNA in German children with respiratory tract infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the application of RNAscope in the clinical diagnostic field compared to the current gold standard methods employed for testing gene expression levels, including immunohistochemistry (IHC), quantitative real time PCR (qPCR), and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), and to detect genes, including DNA in situ hybridisation (DNA ISH). METHODS: This systematic review searched CINAHL, Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases for studies that were conducted after 2012 and that compared RNAscope with one or more of the gold standard techniques in human samples. QUADAS-2 test was used for the evaluation of the articles risk of bias. The results were reviewed narratively and analysed qualitatively. RESULTS: A total of 27 articles (all retrospective studies) were obtained and reviewed. The 27 articles showed a range of low to middle risk of bias scores, as assessed by QUADAS-2 test. 26 articles studied RNAscope within cancer samples. RNAscope was compared to different techniques throughout the included studies (IHC, qPCR, qRT-PCR and DNA ISH). The results confirmed that RNAscope is a highly sensitive and specific method that has a high concordance rate (CR) with qPCR, qRT-PCR, and DNA ISH (81.8C100%). However, the CR with IHC was lower than expected (58.7C95.3%), which is mostly due to the different products that each technique measures (RNA vs. protein). DISCUSSION: This is the first systematic review to be conducted on the use of RNAscope in the clinical diagnostic field. RNAscope was found to be a reliable and robust method that could complement gold standard techniques currently used in clinical diagnostics to measure gene expression levels or for gene detection. However, there were not enough data to suggest that RNAscope could stand alone in the clinical diagnostic setting, indicating further prospective studies to validate diagnostic accuracy values, in keeping with relevant regulations, followed by cost evaluation are required.

This is particularly relevant for risk of increased mortality. However, underlying medical conditions of those using opioids may influence mortality findings due to confounding by indication. Similarly, non-opioid analgesics are also associated with an increased risk of mortality, too. METHODS We have conducted a systematic review of propensity score matched observational studies comparing mortality associated with opioid use compared to non-opioid analgesics. Clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar, MEDLINE and Scopus were searched from inception to July 2020. Propensity score matched observational studies comparing opioids to non-opioid analgesics in real world settings were analysed. Primary outcome was pooled adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of all-cause death. Effects were summarized by a random effects model. RESULTS Four studies with seven study arms and 120 186 patients were analyzed. Pooled aHR for all-cause death was 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.47, 1.95). When mortality risk was confined to out-of-hospital deaths, the pooled aHR was 2.12 (95% CI 1.46, 3.09). The most frequent cause of death was cardiovascular death. Before matching, patients with opioids were older and had more somatic diseases than patients with non-opioids. Despite extensive propensity score matchings and sensitivity analyses, all studies could not fully exclude confounding by indication. CONCLUSIONS Possibly, opioids are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk compared to non-opioid analgesics. When considering treatment options for patients with CNCP, the possible risk of increased all-cause mortality with opioids should be discussed.","output":"Is opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain associated with a greater risk of all-cause mortality compared to non-opioid analgesics?

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the possible association of HScore parameters with severity in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in Medline via PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases using all HScore and COVID-19 keywords. The studies were all from 2020, and the study language was limited to English. The records were screened based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Random/fixed-effect models were employed for meta-analysis, based on the I(2) index of parameters. The pooled mean differences were estimated for continuous parameters. The pooled odds-ratio was estimated for fever. The level of significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: Eighteen studies (comprising 2459 patients) out of 26151 screened studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the level of leukocyte, neutrophil, aspartate transaminase (AST), ferritin, and fibrinogen were significantly higher in sCOVID-19 patients than in non-severe ones. Significant lower levels of lymphocyte, platelet, and hemoglobin were also found in sCOVID-19 patients than non-severe patients. Fever was nearly associated with two times increased odds of sCOVID-19 (P=0.051). CONCLUSION: Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypohemoglobinemia, hyperferritinemia, high levels of AST, and fever are common features of both sCOVID-19 and HLH. However, the leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and hyperfibrinogenemia found in sCOVID-19 are in contrast with HScore. Conclusively, HScore parameters could be risk factors for sCOVID-19.

Ninety percent of HRVs immunogenic variants use as receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a cell surface glycoprotein that promotes intercellular signaling in processes derived from inflammation response. As HRV receptor, ICAM-1 positions the virus to within striking distance of the membrane, and then triggers a conformational change in the virus that ultimately results in delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, across a lipid bilayer. The interaction between ICAM-1 and HRVs has been analyzed by the combination of crystal structures of HRVs and ICAM-1 fragments with electron microscopy reconstructions of the complexes.

Although assessments of general mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic have been widely reported, there is not adequate research on how schizophrenia patients have been affected. According to the World Health Organization (2020), individuals with chronic diseases who do not pay attention to their personal hygiene and the rules of protection from COVID-19 have a higher risk of getting infected than the healthy individuals who observe these measures. It is well known that the risk of Covid-19 infection is raised among schizophrenia patients due to negligence on the requisite control of personal hygiene and health conditions related to smoking and diabetes ( Cohn et al., 2004; Dinan et al., 2004; Krieger et al. 2019). The cognitive impairment in this disorder which reduces the perceptions on the necessity of self protection and the awareness of the risks proposed to underlie this raised risk of COVID-19 positivity (Yao et al. 2020). These patients have difficulty in following the preventive regulations (Palomar-Ciria et al., 2020). Apart from the risk of infection, there is also the risk of pandemic related development of auditory or visual hallucinations and delusional symptoms by acute and chronic psychosis patients during and after the pandemic (Brown et al. 2020, Cowan 2020). Therefore, this survey has been organised to evaluate the reaction developed by schizophrenia patients to the pandemic conditions. The first Covid-19 case was reported in Turkey on 11 March 2020 (Anadolu Agency, 11.03.2020) which was followed by the gradual increase in case numbers. In order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and maintain the existing public health, the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health established a 'Scientific Committee'' and prepared effective strategies including social isolation, quarantine, school closures, social distancing and wearing face mask in the community. During this process, the approximately 250 schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients followed up by the Psychosis Outpatient Unit of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital Psychiatry Department (DEUPD) were instructed to visit the outpatient unit only in emergency conditions. It was determined that there were 176 schizophrenia patients whose follow up visit appointments for the period of April 1 - June 22, 2020, scheduled before the announcement of the pandemic, were cancelled. Therefore, the survey reported here was conducted with the schizophrenia patients of the DEUPD online and by telephone connections during 10- 20 May, 2020, the 9th and the 10th weeks of the pandemic. Only 76 (43.19%) of the 176 patients joined the survey, since 4 (2.27%) refused to participate and 96 (54.4%) could not be contacted. The survey aimed to determine the incidence of Covid-19 diagnosis among these schizophrenia patients and their attitude to the preventive measures against the infection during the first 2 months of the pandemic, together with how they felt and their needs for psychiatric consultation on outpatient basis during this period. The surveyed 76 patients consisted of 49 (64%) males and 27 (35%) females, with 73 (96.1%) dwelling in urban and 3 (3.9%) in suburban areas; and only 11 (14.5%) employed while 65 (85.5%) were not working. Only two patients reported consulting emergency services for Covid-19 symptoms. The rest of the patients did not report consulting a healthcare facility for suspecting Covid-19 symptoms or Table 1. Data on the demographic, clinical and social features of the schizophrenia patients during the COVID-19 pandemic n=76 Mean SD Gender (F/M) 27 (35.5%) / 49 (64.5%) Age 44.54 12.21 Disease duration 16.62 9.96 Patients living /with Alone 3 (3.9%) Parent(s) 43 (56.6%) Spouse/children 25 (32.9%) Sibling (s) 1 (1.3%) Relative(s) 2 (2.6%) Friend(s) 2 (2.6%) Yes No Need to see a psychiatrist 23 (30.3%) 53 (69.7%) Subjective psychiatric complaints 32 (42.1%) 44 (57.9%) Consultation with an emergency service 2 (2.6%) 74 (97.4%) Planning to go to the hospital in the post-quarantine period 58 (76.3%) 18 (23.7%) Wearing a mask in community 67 (88.2%) 4 (5.3%) Keeping social distancing 68 (89.5%) 3 (3.9%) Expressed feeling Loneliness 26 (34.2%) 49 (64.5%) Depressed 31 (40.8%) 44 (57.9%) Despaired 22 (28.9%) 52 (68.4%) Anxious 25 (32.9%) 49 (64.5%) Difficulty of going to the hospital in the quarantine period 53 (69.7%) 23 (30.3%) hospital admission for Covid-19 infection or psychotic attack or incidences of Covid-19 related hallucination or delusions. During this 2-month period, 4 patients had experienced fatigue, 2 had episodes of dry cough and 7 had experienced shortness of breath, which can be associated with the nature of schizophrenia, the sedentary life style.and cigarette smoking. Medication was prescribed by a psychiatrist for 10 patients and by a family doctor for 16 patients or supplied directly by pharmacies for 45 patients on the basis of prescriptions with 1-year validity issued by the hospital* (Table 1). Much as it had been aimed to contact all patients with cancelled appointments, this objective was not attainable The patients who were not reached are likely to include those with low awareness and difficulty of adapting to infection prevention strategies. On the other hand, regardless of the level of awareness of the pandemic and compliance with the rules, phone use by these patients might have been limited by economic and environmental reasons, as well as the difficulties imposed by the pandemic. In conclusion, it is possible to say that most of the patients with schizophrenia were aware of the risk of COVID-19 infection, and understood and mostly obeyed the general health rules and advices of healthcare professionals even if they had difficulty in doing so. This could also have resulted from the nature of schizophrenia with preference for social isolation even if this can worsen the prognosis. On the other hand, patients need to be in contact with a mental healthcare professional in extraordinary situations of a pandemic. This survey did not find a remarkable increase in positive symptom severity in association with COVID-19 as most patients included in the survey had not seen a psychiatrist or mental healthcare professional for two months with 53 patients stating that they did not have to need. However, 58 patients also stated that despite planning to make a consultation after normalization of the quarantine measures, the anxiety of contagion outweighed the option of visiting outpatient clinics. This anxiety over Covid-19 infection, however, may make it difficult for patients to understand the level of the need to see a psychiatrist and may be associated with the assumption that the pandemic would be taken under control in the normalization process with a decrease in the risk of contagion. On the results of this survey, it may be concluded that strategies for prevention of COVID-19 spread were effective among schizophrenia patients and that there is need to develop a system that reaches all patients and keeps them socially connected during the COVID-19 pandemic. *In Turkey, prescription reports with 1-year validity are issued for patients with chronic disorders. The medications can only be prescribed by a specialist, and in the case of pyshchiatric disorders, by a consultant psychiatrist. When the report is confirmed by a hospital committee of specialists, a family doctor is able to issue prescriptions. According to the decision of the Ministry of Health, patients who have medication prescription reports valid for one year would be able to get their medicines directly from pharmacies without having to consult a psychiatrist or family doctor during the pandemic.

We investigated the prognostic capacity of SpO(2)/FiO(2) for mortality in patients with ARDS due to COVIDC19. METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of a national multicenter cohort study in invasively ventilated patients with ARDS due to COVIDC19. The primary endpoint was 28Cday mortality. RESULTS: In 869 invasively ventilated patients, 28Cday mortality was 30.1%. The SpO(2)/FiO(2) on day 1 had no prognostic value. The SpO(2)/FiO(2) on day 2 and day 3 had prognostic capacity for death, with the best cut-offs being 179 and 199, respectively. Both SpO(2)/FiO(2) on day 2 (OR, 0.66 [95%CCI 0.46C0.96]) and on day 3 (OR, 0.70 [95%CCI 0.51C0.96]) were associated with 28Cday mortality in a model corrected for age, pH, lactate levels and kidney dysfunction (AUROC 0.78 [0.76C0.79]).

Using single B-cell culture and fate-mapping, we have characterized BCR repertoires in recall GCs following boost immunizations at sites local or distal to the priming. Local boosts with homologous antigen recruit to recall GCs progeny of primary GC B cells more efficiently than do distal boosts. Recall GCs following local boosts contain significantly more B cells with elevated levels of Ig mutations and higher avidity BCRs. This local preference is unaffected by blockade of CD40:CD154 interaction that terminate active, primary GC responses. Local boosts with heterologous antigens elicit secondary GCs with B-cell populations enriched for cross-reactivity to the priming and boosting antigens; in contrast, cross-reactive GC B cells are rare following distal boosts. Our findings indicate the importance of locality in humoral immunity and inform serial vaccination strategies for evolving viruses.

Establishing improved management of flow regimes requires better understanding of how fish respond to altered flow components, such as flow magnitude. Based on the results of a recent systematic map on the impacts of flow regime changes on direct outcomes of freshwater or estuarine fish productivity, evidence clusters on fish abundance and biomass responses were identified for full systematic review. The primary goal of this systematic review is to address one of those evidence clusters, with the following research question: how do changes in flow magnitude due to hydropower operations affect fish abundance and biomass? METHODS: This review follows the guidelines of the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence. It examined commercially published and grey literature originally identified during the systematic map process and a systematic search update. All articles were screened using an a priori eligibility criteria at two stages (title and abstract, and full-text) and consistency checks were performed at all stages. All eligible articles were assessed for study validity and specifically designed data extraction and study validity tools were used. A narrative synthesis included all available evidence and meta-analysis using the standardized mean difference (Hedges g) was conducted where appropriate. REVIEW FINDINGS: A total of 133 studies from 103 articles were included in this systematic review for data extraction and critical appraisal. Most studies were from North America (60%) and were conducted at 146 different hydropower dams/facilities. Meta-analysis included 268 datasets from 58 studies, separated into three analyses based on replication type [temporal (within or between year replication) or spatial]. Fish abundance (226 datasets) and biomass (30 datasets) had variable responses to changes in flow magnitude with estimated overall mean effect sizes ranging from positive to negative and varying by study design and taxa. In studies with temporal replication, we found a detectable effect of alterations to the direction of flow magnitude, the presence of other flow components, sampling methods, season, and fish life stage. However, we found no detectable effect of these moderators for studies with spatial replication. Taxonomic analyses indicated variable responses to changes in flow magnitude and a bias towards salmonid species. CONCLUSIONS: This synthesis did not find consistent patterns in fish abundance or biomass responses to alterations or changes in flow magnitude. Fish responses to flow magnitude alterations or changes were highly variable and context dependent. Our synthesis suggests that biotic responses may not be generalizable across systems impacted by hydroelectric power production and operations, where specific features of the system may be highly influential. Site-specific and adaptive management may be necessary. To improve study validity and interpretability, studies with long-term continuous monitoring, and both temporal and spatial replication are needed. When this gold standard is unfeasible, studies should strive, at minimum, to maximize replication within both intervention and comparator groups for either temporal or spatial designs. To further address knowledge gaps, studies are needed that focus on non-salmonids, multiple seasons, and systems outside of North America.

The aim of the study was to explore the views of centre visitors and operational staff towards this COVID-19 workforce wellbeing provision. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken with twenty-four (20F, 4M) employees from an acute hospital trust in the UK.

The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. OBJECTIVE: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQs end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. METHODS: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of 0.75 (=.05; power [1C]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead timetime to predict decompensationand its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19.

Here, we report preliminary results on the efficacy and safety of Gam-COVID-Vac from the interim analysis of this phase 3 trial. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia. We included participants aged at least 18 years, with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG and IgM tests, no infectious diseases in the 14 days before enrolment, and no other vaccinations in the 30 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo, with stratification by age group. Investigators, participants, and all study staff were masked to group assignment. The vaccine was administered (05 mL/dose) intramuscularly in a prime-boost regimen: a 21-day interval between the first dose (rAd26) and the second dose (rAd5), both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from day 21 after receiving the first dose. All analyses excluded participants with protocol violations: the primary outcome was assessed in participants who had received two doses of vaccine or placebo, serious adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose at the time of database lock, and rare adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received two doses and for whom all available data were verified in the case report form at the time of database lock. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04530396). FINDINGS: Between Sept 7 and Nov 24, 2020, 21a977 adults were randomly assigned to the vaccine group (n=16a501) or the placebo group (n=5476). 19a866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included in the primary outcome analysis. From 21 days after the first dose of vaccine (the day of dose 2), 16 (01%) of 14a964 participants in the vaccine group and 62 (13%) of 4902 in the placebo group were confirmed to have COVID-19; vaccine efficacy was 916% (95% CI 856-952). Most reported adverse events were grade 1 (7485 [940%] of 7966 total events). 45 (03%) of 16a427 participants in the vaccine group and 23 (04%) of 5435 participants in the placebo group had serious adverse events; none were considered associated with vaccination, with confirmation from the independent data monitoring committee.

Moreover, individual willingness and readiness of a community may also vary based on the acquired level of knowledge about the incident and its cause and available management options. Educational initiatives, proper communication, and timely information at the community level were found to be the necessary steps to counteract misinformation and to promote a successful implementation of public health strategies and attenuate the effects of a pandemic.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a longitudinal study using municipality-level mortality data. METHODS: We investigated the patterns and spatial correlation of EM of men aged &#8805;75 years during the first two pandemic waves (March-April 2020 vs November 2020) of COVID-19, using the mortality data released by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. EM was estimated at the municipality level to accurately detect the critical areas within the region. RESULTS: The areas that were mostly hit during the first wave of COVID-19 were generally spared by the second wave: EM of men aged &#8805;75 years in the municipality of Bergamo plummeted from +472% in March and April to -13% in November, and in Cremona the variation was from +344% to -19%. Conversely, in November 2020 EM was higher in some areas that had been protected in the first wave of the pandemic. Spatial correlation widely corroborates these findings, as large sections of the hot spots of EM detected in the first wave of the pandemic changed into cold spots in the second wave, and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the specular distribution of EM between the first and second wave of the pandemic, which may entail the consequences of social distancing measures and individual behaviors, local management strategies, 'harvesting' of the frailer population and, possibly, acquired immune protection.

Methods: Descriptive statistics were used to present frequencies of vaccine acceptance. Logistic regression was used to explore predictors of vaccine acceptance based on sociodemographic characteristics, hesitancy to take other vaccines in the past, previous diagnosis of COVID-19, and individual risk perception of COVID-19. Chi square analysis was used to compare informational needs differences between hesitant and non-hesitant individuals across socio-demographic groups. Results: From a sample of 1003 individuals, 439 (44%) reported that they were very likely to get the vaccine, the rest reported some level of hesitancy. Older age, Albanian ethnicity, post-secondary school education, previous diagnosis of COVID-19, previous vaccine acceptance of other vaccines, and increased risk perception of COVID-19 infection were all found to be negatively associated with vaccine hesitancy.

We rationally designed and synthesized a series of modified bombesin (BN) peptide analogs to study the influence of charge and spacers at the N-terminus, as well as amino acid substitutions, on both receptor binding affinity and pharmacokinetics. This enabled development of a novel (64/67)Cu-labeled BN peptide for PET imaging and targeted radiotherapy of BN receptor-positive tumors. Our results show that N-terminally positively charged peptide ligands had significantly higher affinity to human gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) than negatively charged or uncharged ligands (IC(50): 3.20.5 vs 26.33.5 vs 41.52.5 nM). The replacement of Nle(14) by Met, and deletion of D-Tyr(6), further resulted in 8-fold higher affinity. Contrary to significant changes to human GRPr binding, modifications at the N-terminal and at the 6(th), 11(th), and 14(th) position of BN induced only slight influences on affinity to mouse GRPr. [Cu(II)]-CPTA-[Ala(11)] BN(7-14) ([Cu(II)]-BZH7) showed the highest internalization rate into PC-3 cells with relatively slow efflux because of its subnanomolar affinity to GRPr. Interestingly, [(64/67)Cu]-BZH7 also displayed similar affinities to the other 2 human BN receptor subtypes. In vivo studies showed that [(64/67)Cu]-BZH7 had a high accumulation in PC-3 xenografts and allowed for clear-cut visualization of the tumor in PET imaging. In addition, a CPTA-glycine derivative, forming a hippurane-type spacer, enhanced kidney clearance of the radiotracer. These data indicate that the species variation of BN receptor plays an important role in screening radiolabeled BN. As well, the positive charge from the metallated complex at the N-terminal significantly increases affinity to human GRPr. Application of these observations enabled the novel ligand [(64/67)Cu]-BZH7 to clearly visualize PC-3 tumors in vivo.

Purpose: This study aimed to describe the parameters of coagulation function and evaluate the association between the fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR) and SAP in patients with AIS. Patients and methods: A total of 932 consecutive patients with AIS were included. Coagulation parameters were measured at admission. All patients were classified into two groups according to the optimal cutoff FAR point at which the sum of the specificity and sensitivity was highest. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance potential confounding factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of SAP. Results: A total of 100 (10.7%) patients were diagnosed with SAP. The data showed that fibrinogen, FAR, and D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were higher in patients with SAP, while albumin was much lower. Patients with SAP showed a significantly increased FAR when compared with non-SAP (P < 0.001). Patients were assigned to groups of high FAR (0.0977) and low FAR (<0.0977) based on the optimal cut-off value. Propensity score matching analysis further confirmed the association between FAR and SAP. After adjusting for confounding and risk factors, multivariate regression analysis showed that the high FAR (0.0977) was an independent variable predicting the occurrence of SAP (odds ratio =2.830, 95% CI = 1.654C4.840, P < 0.001).

There was no difference in age, prostate size, pathology T stage and PSA among groups. BNPS ratio is significantly low in the Retzius-sparing group (0.250.10 vs. 0.460.14, p=0.000). Early continence was improved in the Retzius-sparing group and early continence within the first week was 73.3% compared to 26.7% (p=0.000), but no difference was seen at one year (100.0% vs. 93.30%, p=0.150). The independent risk factors affecting post-operative continence were age and approach. The association between less bladder neck descent as BNP ratio and continence was also confirmed (HR=0.048, 95%CI=0.005-0.420, p=0.006). CONCLUSION With the advantage of more normal pelvic anatomy preserved in Retzius-sparing RARP, it was associated with less bladder neck descent and better early continence outcome. Age was also an independent risk factor for postoperative continence.","output":"Retzius-sparing Robotic-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Associated with Less Bladder Neck Descent and Better Early Continence Outcome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The expected number of secondary infections arising from each index case, the reproduction number, or $R$ number is a vital summary statistic for understanding and managing epidemic diseases. There are many methods for estimating $R$;however, few of these explicitly model heterogeneous disease reproduction, which gives rise to superspreading within the population. Here we propose a parsimonious discrete-time branching process model for epidemic curves that incorporates heterogeneous individual reproduction numbers. Our Bayesian approach to inference illustrates that this heterogeneity results in less certainty on estimates of the time-varying cohort reproduction number $R_t$. Leave-future-out cross-validation evaluates the predictive performance of the proposed model, allowing us to assess epidemic curves for evidence of superspreading. We apply these methods to a COVID-19 epidemic curve for the Republic of Ireland and find some support for heterogeneous disease reproduction. We conclude that the 10\\\\% most infectious index cases account for approximately 40-80\\\\% of the expected secondary infections. Our analysis highlights the difficulties in identifying heterogeneous disease reproduction from epidemic curves and that heterogeneity is a vital consideration when estimating $R_t$.","output":"Assessing epidemic curves for evidence of superspreading"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has recently become a global health crisis.

METHODS Patients with esophageal cancer undergoing esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction and cervical anastomosis were eligible for participation after written informed consent. Patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio. Primary endpoint was anastomotic leak rate defined as external drainage of saliva from the site of the anastomosis or intra-thoracic manifestation of leak. Secondary endpoints included anastomotic stricture rate at one year follow up, number of endoscopic dilatations, dysphagia-score, hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality. Patients were blinded for intervention. RESULTS Between August 2011 and July 2014, 174 patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy. Ninety-three patients were randomized to ETE (n = 44) or SMA (n = 49).

Infections can be diagnosed as COVID-19 and registered, or they can be asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic, or even full-blown but undiagnosed and unregistered when patients recovered at home. Estimation of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is difficult and remains a subject of speculations. Here we present a population screening for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies in Polish citizens (N = 501) who had never been positively diagnosed with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were collected in Wroc?aw (Lower Silesia) on 15th and 22nd May 2021. Sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N = 22) or from vaccinated citizens (N = 14) served as positive controls. Sera were tested with Microblot-Array COVID-19 IgG and IgA (quantitative) that contain specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens: NCP, RBD, Spike S2, E, ACE2, PLPro protein, and antigens for exclusion cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses: MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV 229E Np, HCoV NL63 Np. Within the investigated population of healthy individuals who had never been positively diagnosed with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, we found that 35.5% (178 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and 52.3% (262 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA; 21.2% of the investigated population developed virus-specific IgG or IgA while being asymptomatic. Anti-RBD IgG, which represents virus-neutralizing potential, was found in 25.6% of individuals (128 out of 501). These patients, though positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, cannot be identified in the public health system as convalescents due to undiagnosed infections, and they are considered unaffected by SARS-CoV-2. Their contribution to population immunity against COVID-19 should however be considered in predictions and modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, the majority of the investigated population still lacked anti-RBD IgG protection (74.4%); thus vaccination against COVID-19 is still of the most importance for controlling the pandemic.","output":"Hidden fraction of Polish population immune to SARS-CoV-2 in May 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Only 2% of clinical trials took place in Africa before COVID-19, yet drugs now offered were mostly tested on non-Africans, says Bernhards Ogutu, chief research officer with the Kenya Medical Research Institute [ ]there is concern over the lack of information on the efficacy of new drugs and vaccines in African populations Bartholomew Dicky Akanmori, regional adviser for vaccine research and regulation, WHO Regional Office for Africa, says that more studies are needed to assess the long-term safety and duration of protection of different COVID-19 vaccines in different population groups","output":"Africa's need for more COVID-19 clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: An exaggerated inflammatory immune response is observed in cases of COV&Iacute;D 19.

Methods: This single-center retrospective study included 160 adult patients with confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab COVID-19 PCR test results, who were followed up in the ICU between 01 March and 01 August 2020. Hospital files were scanned and patients given and not given vitamin C were assigned, to Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores, the data entries on demographics, ventilation, laboratory tests, duration of ICU stay, discharge, and mortality were compared. Interventions with antiviral and antibacterial agents. steroids, cytokine apheresis, and renal replacement therapy were evaluated. Results: Vitamin C treatment was started in patients with raised neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at admission to ICU, who made up 20% of the total 160 ICU patients. Mortality incidence was higher among patients with raised NLR. Vitamin C at the doses used did not affect the inflammatory parameters, length of stay or mortality, and 37.5% of the patients recovered and were discharged from the ICU.

This is especially the case in Namibia where LRTIs are currently the third leading cause of death, 300 deaths in children under 5 years of age. To reduce the burden of Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTIs) on health systems and ensure appropriate patient management, it is critical to know the most prevalent pathogens leading to LRTIs and their susceptibility patterns in the local setting. Consequently, the objective was to formulate cumulative antibiograms for ICUs of referral hospitals in Namibia to guide future antibiotic use. METHODS A retrospective analytical cross-sectional study was conducted over two years. The cumulative antibiograms were constructed in accordance with current guidelines. RESULTS 976 first isolate cultures were obtained from ICUs of the different referral hospitals. K. pneumoniae (8.8%, 8.1%) was a predominant pathogen in Windhoek Central hospital ICU in 2017 and 2018. In Oshakati intermediate hospital ICU, Enterobacter sp. (22.2%) and P. aeruginosa (37.5%) were the common pathogens in 2017 and 2018, respectively. A. baumannii isolates were > 90% susceptibility to colistin, carbapenems and tigecycline in 2017. In 2017, K. pneumoniae isolates were more susceptible to carbapenems (94% and 93.8% among isolates), amikacin (89.3%) and tigecycline (88.7%). In 2018, K. pneumoniae isolates were 100% susceptible amikacin, colistin and carbapenems. S. maltophilia isolates were more than 80% susceptible to all the tested antibiotics. S. aureus isolates were 100% susceptible to linezolid, rifampicin, teicoplanin, vancomycin in 2017 and in 2018. Its susceptibility to these antibiotics did not change.

This has also compromised the capacity for application of specialized Parkinson's disease (PD) therapies to an unknown extent. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study using administrative database of all hospitalized patients with main diagnosis of PD receiving multimodal complex treatment (PD-MCT), initial setup of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) or continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI) in Germany. We compared case numbers and clinical characteristics of the pandemic (March 16th - May 15th, 2020) and post-lockdown (July 16th - September 15th, 2020) period with the pre-pandemic (January 16th - March 15th, 2020) and historical control period (March 16th - May 15th, 2019). RESULTS: We identified a strong decline for PD-MCT(-62.8%) and for the application of drug pump-based therapies (-69.4%) during the first peak phase of the pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period while specialized PD treatment procedures increased again in the post-lockdown phase. Advanced disease was a marker for PD-MCT patients during the pandemic period.

At present no effective vaccine is available. Our speciality needs to collectively address the urgent issue of risk of transmission in dermatology practice. A case series of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from Wuhan described that 41.3% of their patients may have acquired the infection from the hospital.

Dermatology patients are generally seen in clinics and in outpatient departments in hospitals. Patients wait together in the waiting area, intermingle and then are seen by the physician in their chamber. This can cause transmission of the pathogen among patients and from patient to physician. Social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment are important for preventing the spread of infection and dermatology practices also have to incorporate these aspects.

We also aimed to investigate whether CT findings may be predictive of patients outcome. METHODS: From March 6 to March 22, 2020, 130 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients were enrolled for this single-center analysis and chest CT examinations were retrospectively evaluated. A semi-quantitative CT score was calculated based on the extent of lobar involvement (0:0%; 1, < 5%; 2:5C25%; 3:26C50%; 4:51C75%; 5, > 75%; range 0C5; global score 0C25). Data were matched with clinical stages and laboratory findings. Survival curves and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the role of CT score as a predictor of patients outcome. RESULTS: Ground glass opacities were predominant in early-phase ( 7 days since symptoms onset), while crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis characterized late-phase disease (> 7 days). CT score was significantly higher in critical and severe than in mild stage (p < 0.0001), and among late-phase than early-phase patients (p < 0.0001). CT score was significantly correlated with CRP (p < 0.0001, r = 0.6204) and D-dimer (p < 0.0001, r = 0.6625) levels.

OBJECTIVE: The impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns in Saarland regarding patient care in the ambulatory pediatric setting and general consultation, early preventive consultancy as well as specialized medical care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All 53 pediatric practices in Saarland were asked to report their case numbers for calendar weeks 2C26 in 2019 and 2020. These data were analyzed via descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Data from 34 (64%) of Saarlands pediatric practices were evaluated. There was a decline of ?37% regarding overall cases during lockdown, ?9.4% of early diagnosis cases and ?35% regarding specialized medical consultancy (4 specialized practices). After lockdown the overall case numbers were significantly reduced with ?17.1% in comparison to 2019, the early diagnosis cases caught up nearly completely with +9.4% and also the specialized care showed catch-up effects with +7%. CONCLUSION: Lockdown-related collateral damage regarding preventive performances/activities could be avoided in the ambulatory pediatric setting in Saarland. Cancelled/postponed activities caught up during the observation period. During the observation period, the overall case numbers remained lower than 2019.

The aim of this study was to determine if participating in golf is associated with greater functional outcomes, satisfaction, or improvement in quality of life (QoL) compared to non-golfers. METHODS: All patients undergoing primary THA over a one-year period at a single institution were included with one-year postoperative outcomes. Patients were retrospectively followed up to assess if they had been golfers at the time of their surgery. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to assess the independent association of preoperative golfing status on outcomes. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of a total of 308 patients undergoing THA, of whom 44 were golfers (14%). This included 120 male patients (39%) and 188 female patients (61%), with an overall mean age of 67.8 years (SD 11.6). Golfers had a greater mean postoperative Oxford Hip Score (OHS) (3.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 to 5.5); p < 0.001) and EuroQol visual analogue scale (5.5 (95% CI 0.1 to 11.9); p = 0.039). However, there were no differences in EuroQoL five-dimension score (p = 0.124), pain visual analogue scale (p = 0.505), or Forgotten Joint Score (p = 0.215). When adjusting for confounders, golfers had a greater improvement in their Oxford Hip Score (2.7 (95% CI 0.2 to 5.3); p < 0.001) compared to non-golfers. Of the 44 patients who reported being golfers at the time of their surgery, 32 (72.7%) returned to golf and 84.4% of those were satisfied with their involvement in golf following surgery. Those who returned to golf were more likely to be male (p = 0.039) and had higher (better) preoperative health-related QoL (p = 0.040) and hip-related functional scores (p = 0.026).

Establishment of chronic infection by M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis depends on its subversion of host immune responses. This includes blocking the ability of infected macrophages to be activated by gamma interferon (IFN-) for clearance of this intracellular pathogen. To define the mechanism by which M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis subverts this critical host cell function, patterns of signal transduction to IFN- stimulation of uninfected and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected bovine monocytes were determined through bovine-specific peptide arrays for kinome analysis. Pathway analysis of the kinome data indicated activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, a hallmark of IFN- signaling, in uninfected monocytes. In contrast, IFN- stimulation of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes failed to induce patterns of peptide phosphorylation consistent with JAK-STAT activation. The inability of IFN- to induce differential phosphorylation of peptides corresponding to early JAK-STAT intermediates in infected monocytes indicates that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis blocks responsiveness at, or near, the IFN- receptor. Consistent with this hypothesis, increased expression of negative regulators of the IFN- receptors SOCS1 and SOCS3 as well as decreased expression of IFN- receptor chains 1 and 2 is observed in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes. These patterns of expression are functionally consistent with the kinome data and offer a mechanistic explanation for this critical M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis behavior.

Previous studies have shown that there are drug-to-drug interactions between antiretroviral drugs and antidepressants. Therefore, an effective and safe treatment method was needed. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychological therapy in clinical treatment. Computerized CBT (cCBT) was proven to be an effective alternative to CBT and does not require face-to-face therapy between a therapist and the patient, which suited the COVID-19 pandemic response. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the cCBT program we developed in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We customized a cCBT program focused on improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19, and then, we assessed its effectiveness. Screening was based on symptoms of depression or anxiety for patients who scored &#8805;7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) or the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). A total of 252 patients with COVID-19 at five sites were randomized into two groups: cCBT + treatment as usual (TAU; n=126) and TAU without cCBT (n=126). The cCBT + TAU group received the cCBT intervention program for 1 week. The primary efficacy measures were the HAMD17 and HAMA scores. The secondary outcome measures were the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Assessments were carried out pre- and postintervention. The patients' symptoms of anxiety and depression in one of the centers were assessed again within 1 month after the postintervention assessment. RESULTS: The cCBT + TAU group displayed a significantly decreased score on the HAMD17, HAMA, SDS, SAS, and AIS after the intervention compared to the TAU group (all P<.001). A mixed-effects repeated measures model revealed significant improvement in symptoms of depression (HAMD17 and SDS scores, both P<.001), anxiety (HAMA and SAS scores, both P<.001), and insomnia (AIS score, P=.002) during the postintervention and follow-up periods in the cCBT + TAU group. Additionally, the improvement of insomnia among females (P=.14) and those with middle school education (P=.48) in the cCBT + TAU group showed no significant differences when compared to the TAU group.

For some viruses, the genome is the only viral mRNA and expression is regulated primarily at the translational level and by limited proteolysis of polyproteins. Other virus groups also generate subgenomic mRNAs later in the reproductive cycle. For nidoviruses, subgenomic mRNA synthesis (transcription) is discontinuous and yields a 5' and 3' coterminal nested set of mRNAs. Nidovirus transcription is not essential for genome replication, which relies on the autoprocessing products of two replicase polyproteins that are translated from the genome. We now show that the N-terminal replicase subunit, nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), of the nidovirus equine arteritis virus is in fact dispensable for replication but crucial for transcription, thereby coupling replicase expression and subgenomic mRNA synthesis in an unprecedented manner. Nsp1 is composed of two papain-like protease domains and a predicted N-terminal zinc finger, which was implicated in transcription by site-directed mutagenesis. The structural integrity of nsp1 is essential, suggesting that the protease domains form a platform for the zinc finger to operate in transcription.","output":"A zinc finger-containing papain-like protease couples subgenomic mRNA synthesis to genome translation in a positive-stranded RNA virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in North American men.

The impact of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) monotherapy or combination on long-term complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus was studied. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes treated with DPP-4i or SGLT2i during a 3-year period were identified in the database of the National Institute of Health Insurance Fund in Hungary. All-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), lower limb amputation (LLA) and cancer were assessed. Outcomes of add-on SGLT2i to DPP-4i treatment in comparison with switching DPP-4i therapy to SGLT2i were also evaluated. After propensity score matching, survival analysis was performed with a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, both SGLT2i and DPP-4i groups included 18 583 patients. All-cause mortality (HR, 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.94; p=0.0057), HHF (HR, 0.81; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92; p=0.0018), and risk of cancer (HR, 0.75; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.86; p<0.0001) were lower in the SGLT2i population compared with DPP-4i. Risk of LLA was higher in the SGLT2i group (HR, 1.35; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77; p=0.0315).

CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2i treatment leads to a lower risk of overall mortality, HHF and cancer when compared with DPP-4i treatment. Adding SGLT2i to DPP-4i instead of switching from DPP-4i to SGLT2i further lowers the risk of all-cause mortality.","output":"Risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor and/or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor: a nationwide study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common histological type of kidney cancer and has high heterogeneity.

The application of this combination of methodologies permitted us to generate human single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) against two proteins: green fluorescent protein (GFP) and thioredoxin (Trx) in a short time, using as low as 5 g of purified protein. These scFvs showed specific reactivity against their respective targets and worked well by ELISA and western blot. The scFvs were able to recognise as low as 31 ng of protein of their respective targets by western blot.

This study aimed to provide early estimates of how stress and demographics will interact with shifts in harmful alcohol consumption from before the COVID-19 outbreak to 2 months into social distancing. DESIGN: Cross-sectional convenience sample. SETTING: Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1684 Australians aged 18-65 years who drink at least monthly. MEASUREMENTS: Items from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the stress subscale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). FINDINGS: Overall, harmful drinking decreased during social distancing measures in our sample [2019 score = 8.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 7.9-8.4; during the pandemic = 7.3, 95% CI = 7.1-7.6]. Younger drinkers, particularly young women, decreased their consumption the most, but there was a small increase in consumption in middle-aged women. Drinkers experiencing high levels of stress also reported a relatively higher shift in harmful consumption compared with those with low levels of stress (? = 0.65, P = 0.003), despite reporting a small decrease overall.

This studys aim is to identify the causes that lead to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights regarding the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed the Jewish holiday of Purim in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, [Formula: see text] , of 0.69. In the second scenario which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by [Formula: see text] of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

We hypothesize that wastewater surveillance programs provide an effective alternative for detecting emerging variants and assessing COVID-19 incidence, particularly when clinical surveillance is limited. Here, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater from eight locations across Southern Nevada between March 2020 and April 2021. Trends in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations (ranging from 4.3 log10 gc/L to 8.7 log10 gc/L) matched trends in confirmed COVID-19 incidence, but wastewater surveillance also highlighted several limitations with the clinical data. Amplicon-based whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 86 wastewater samples identified the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.429 (Epsilon) lineages in December 2020, but clinical sequencing failed to identify the variants until January 2021, thereby demonstrating that pooled wastewater samples can sometimes expedite variant detection. Also, by calibrating fecal shedding (11.4 log10 gc/infection) and wastewater surveillance data to reported seroprevalence, we estimate that ~38% of individuals in Southern Nevada had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of April 2021, which is significantly higher than the 10% of individuals confirmed through clinical testing. Sewershed-specific ascertainment ratios (i.e., X-fold infection undercounts) ranged from 1.0 to 7.7, potentially due to demographic differences. Our data underscore the growing application of wastewater surveillance in not only the identification and quantification of infectious agents, but also the detection of variants of concern that may be missed when diagnostic testing is limited or unavailable.","output":"Use of wastewater surveillance for early detection of Alpha and Epsilon SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and estimation of overall COVID-19 infection burden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Patients with diabetes mellitus admitted to hospital with COVID-19 have poorer outcomes. However, the drivers of poorer outcomes are not fully elucidated. We performed detailed characterization of patients with COVID-19 to determine the clinical and biochemical factors that may be drivers of poorer outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 889 consecutive inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 9 and April 22, 2020 in a large London National Health Service Trust. Unbiased multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine variables that were independently and significantly associated with increased risk of death and/or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: 62% of patients in our cohort were of non-white ethnic background and the prevalence of diabetes was 38%. 323 (36%) patients met the primary outcome of death/admission to the ICU within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Male gender, lower platelet count, advancing age and higher Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score (but not diabetes) independently predicted poor outcomes on multivariate analysis. Antiplatelet medication was associated with a lower risk of death/ICU admission. Factors that were significantly and independently associated with poorer outcomes in patients with diabetes were coexisting ischemic heart disease, increasing age and lower platelet count. CONCLUSIONS: In this large study of a diverse patient population, comorbidity (ie, diabetes with ischemic heart disease; increasing CFS score in older patients) was a major determinant of poor outcomes with COVID-19.

Between April and November (1-8 months after the infection), the antibodies were measured repeatedly within the period of several weeks. The virus neutralizing tests was used as well as the ECLIA assay by Roche (total immunoglobulins), CMIA assay by Abbott (IgG) and ELISA assay by Euroimmun (IgG and IgA). Six months from the infection, neutralizing antibodies were detected in 18 out of 20 seniors. High levels of neutralizing antibodies correlated with higher levels of immunoglobulins and were a good predictor of an increase of IgG in the autumn during the second wave of the epidemic in the Czech Republic.

Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2. To determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples. We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa.

METHODS: A refined inventory of outcomes for AMS interventions in care homes, compiled from a previous study, was rated in a three-round international Delphi survey with 82 participants, using a nine-point Likert scale (from 1, unimportant, to 9, critical). This was followed by an online consensus exercise with 12 participants from Northern Ireland to finalise the COS content. Subsequently, a suitable outcome measurement instrument (OMI) was selected for each outcome in the COS by: identifying existing OMIs through a literature search and experts suggestions, assessing the quality of OMIs, and selecting one OMI for each core outcome via a two-round international Delphi survey with 59 participants. RESULTS: Of 14 outcomes initially presented, consensus was reached for inclusion of five outcomes in the COS after the three-round Delphi survey and the online consensus exercise, comprising the total number of antimicrobial courses prescribed, appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing, days of therapy per 1000 resident-days, rate of antimicrobial resistance, and mortality related to infection. Of 17 potential OMIs identified, three were selected for the two-round Delphi exercise after the quality assessment. Consensus was reached for selection of two OMIs for the COS.

Findings indicated that a majority of the participants are still playing pickleball outdoors, but less frequently. They reported lower social connections through pickleball and in their daily life. While perceived physical health scores were stable, participants reported significantly lower mental health, higher loneliness, and lower life satisfaction during the pandemic. Those playing less pickleball were significantly more likely to report lower life satisfaction during the pandemic. The findings from this study have implications for both leisure practitioners and public health professionals as they strategize ways to continue to offer recreation experiences safely.","output":"An examination of pickleball participation, social connections, and psychological well-being among seniors during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many survivors of COVID-19 have developed symptoms and diseases similar to those observed after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the symptoms that appear after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been eradicated and to determine their relationship with COVID-19 severity. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in all eligible confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection from Saudi Arabia. Study participants were randomly selected using computerized random sampling from a population of 314,821 patients. Descriptive statistics were used to describe baseline demographic data and clinical characteristics. Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages, while continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations. RESULTS: Approximately 70% of patients were found to have five or fewer symptoms simultaneously. Late symptoms (in the ongoing symptomatic COVID-19) occurred in 225 (225%) patients with the most common late symptoms being loss of smell, loss of taste, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cough (524%, 311%, 115%, 102%, and 89% of patients with late symptoms, respectively). We also found that the presence of acute symptoms of COVID-19 and admission to the hospital were significant independent predictors of the post-COVID-19 condition. CONCLUSION: Saudi patients with COVID-19 develop a wide range of symptoms, similar to those observed and reported in other countries. The loss of smell, the loss of taste, shortness of breath, and fatigue were the main persistent symptoms. Regular follow-up of COVID-19 survivors is highly recommended to minimize the burden of the post-acute COVID-19 condition and improve the quality of life of patients.","output":"Post-acute COVID-19 Condition in Saudi Arabia: A National Representative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 disease is an international public health concern.

Due to the absence of simultaneous real-world data for these vaccines, we aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity between vaccines using a dynamic national monitoring strategy. METHODS: From March 12, 2021, 28 testing stations for SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection were installed in hotspots based on cellular-phone mobility tracking within the most populated cities in Chile. Individuals voluntarily approaching the testing stations were invited to do a lateral flow test by finger prick and respond to a questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, vaccination status (including type of vaccine if one was received), variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and comorbidities. We compared the proportion of individuals testing positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG across sites by week since vaccination between recipients of CoronaVac and BNT162b2. Unvaccinated participants served as a control population and were matched to vaccinated individuals on the basis of date of presentation to the testing station, gender, and age group. Individuals were excluded from the analysis if they were younger than 18 years, had no declared gender, had an invalid IgG test result, had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on PCR, could not recall their vaccination status, or had been immunised against COVID-19 with vaccines other than CoronaVac or BNT162b2. Here, we report data collected up to July 2, 2021. FINDINGS: Of 64 813 individuals enrolled, 56 261 were included in the final analysis, of whom 33 533 (596%) had received at least one dose of the CoronaVac vaccine, 8947 (159%) had received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and 13 781 (245%) had not received a vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity during week 4 after the first dose of CoronaVac was 281% (95% CI 250C312; 220 of 783 individuals), reaching a peak of 774% (755C793; 1473 of 1902 individuals) during week 3 after the second dose. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity during week 4 after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was 794% (757C831; 367 of 462 individuals), increasing to 965% (949C981; 497 of 515 individuals) during week 3 after the second dose and remaining above 92% until the end of the study. For unvaccinated individuals, IgG seropositivity ranged from 60% (44C76; 49 of 810 individuals) to 187% (125C249; 28 of 150 individuals) during the 5 month period. Regression analyses showed that IgG seropositivity was significantly lower in men than women and in people with diabetes or chronic diseases for CoronaVac vaccine recipients (p<00001), and for individuals aged 60 years and older compared with people aged 18C39 years for both vaccines (p<00001), 3C16 weeks after the second dose. INTERPRETATION: IgG seropositivity was lower after CoronaVac than after BNT162b2 and declined over time since vaccination for CoronaVac recipients but not BNT162b2 recipients. Prolonged IgG monitoring will allow further evaluation of seropositivity overtime, providing data, in conjunction with effectiveness studies, for possible future re-assessment of vaccination strategies.

In the absence of red flags, the clinical utility of routine or repeat radiographs to assess the structure and function of the spine is controversial. OBJECTIVES To determine the diagnostic and therapeutic utility of routine or repeat radiographs (in the absence of red flags) of the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine for the functional or structural evaluation of the spine. Investigate whether functional or structural findings on repeat radiographs are valid markers of clinically meaningful outcomes. The research objectives required that we determine the validity, diagnostic accuracy and reliability of radiographs for the structural and functional evaluation of the spine. EVIDENCE REVIEW We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Index to Chiropractic Literature from inception to November 25, 2019. We used rapid review methodology recommended by the World Health Organization. Eligible studies (cross-sectional, case-control, cohort, randomized controlled trials, diagnostic and reliability) were critically appraised. Studies of acceptable quality were included in our synthesis. The lead author extracted data and a second reviewer independently validated the data extraction. We conducted a qualitative synthesis of the evidence. FINDINGS We identified 959 citations, screened 176 full text articles and critically appraised 23. No relevant studies assessed the clinical utility of routine or repeat radiographs (in the absence of red flags) of the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine for the functional or structural evaluation of the spine. No studies investigated whether functional or structural findings on repeat radiographs are valid markers of clinically meaningful outcomes. Nine low risk of bias studies investigated the validity (n = 2) and reliability (n = 8) of routine or repeat radiographs. These studies provide no evidence of clinical utility. CONCLUSION We found no evidence that the use of routine or repeat radiographs to assess the function or structure of the spine, in the absence of red flags, improves clinical outcomes and benefits patients. Given the inherent risks of ionizing radiation, we recommend that chiropractors do not use radiographs for the routine and repeat evaluation of the structure and function of the spine.","output":"The clinical utility of routine spinal radiographs by chiropractors: a rapid review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A number of different human pathogens code for their own enzymes involved in the synthesis of the RNA cap structure.

METHODS: We report a case series of five infants with perinatal HPP, with confirmed TBM, who were treated with asfotase alfa and observed for 3C7 years. Additionally, we reviewed respiratory function data in a subgroup of patients with perinatal and infantile HPP included in the clinical trials of asfotase alfa, who required high-pressure respiratory support (positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] 6 cm H(2)O and/or peak inspiratory pressure 18 cm H(2)O) during the studies. RESULTS: The case series showed that TBM contributed significantly to respiratory morbidity, and prolonged respiratory support with high PEEP was required. However, TBM improved over time, allowing weaning of all patients from ventilator use. The review of clinical trial data included 20 patients and found a high degree of heterogeneity in PEEP requirements across the cohort; median PEEP was 8 cm H(2)O at any time and some patients presented with high PEEP (8 cm H(2)O) over periods of more than 6 months.

Although the Chinese Government has already carried out a series of emergency education and training programmes to improve public health staff's capability of emergency preparedness, it remains unclear if these training programmes are effective and feasible. The purpose of this research was to evaluate an emergency preparedness training programme and to develop a participatory training approach for emergency response. METHODS: Seventy-six public health staff completed the emergency preparedness training programme. The effectiveness of the training was evaluated by questionnaire before training, immediately after training and 12 months after training (follow-up). Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted throughout the training period. RESULTS: The emergency preparedness training improved the knowledge levels and increased attitudinal and behavioural intention scores for emergency preparedness (P<0.01). The results at follow-up showed that the knowledge levels and attitudinal/behavioural intention scores of participants decreased slightly (P>0.05) compared with levels immediately after training (P<0.01). However, there was a significant increase compared with before training (P<0.01). Moreover, more than 80% of participants reported that the training process and resources were scientific and feasible. CONCLUSIONS: The emergency preparedness training programme met its aims and objectives satisfactorily, and resulted in positive shifts in knowledge and attitudinal/behavioural intentions for public health staff. This suggests that this emergency training strategy was effective and feasible in improving the capability of emergency preparedness.","output":"Evaluating the effectiveness of an emergency preparedness training programme for public health staff in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several case studies demonstrated that many asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 underwent fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) examination for various indications.

The masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) has long been regarded as a dietary generalist that feeds primarily on fruits and small mammals. Both types of food resources may vary spatially and temporally and the diet of P. larvata is expected to change in response to variation in the availability and distribution of these resources. To address the effects of such variation on foraging by masked palm civets, we studied a population of P. larvata inhabiting a highly heterogeneous habitat in central China consisting of primary forest, selectively logged forest, logged forest, broad-leaved and coniferous forest plantations, and cultivated farmland. Available food resources included wild fruits, cultivated fruits, leaves, plant cortexes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, small mammals, molluscs, and arthropods. The abundance of these food categories varied significantly among seasons and habitats and civets altered consumption of these categories according to their temporal and spatial availability. The diversity of items consumed also varied significantly among seasons and habitats. From June to October, wild fruits were the main food of civets in forest habitats, whereas cultivated fruits were the main food in farmland. In contrast, from November to May, civets in forested habitats consumed primarily rodents and birds. Concordant with these changes was a shift from foraging in primary forest (November-May) to foraging in logged forest and farmland (June-October) that appeared to be associated with the availability of fruits. These results demonstrate the ability of civets to change their diet, both spatially and temporally, in response to changing food resources. To better understand how foraging behavior of civets varies with resource availability, similar studies should be conducted in tropical environments characterized by year-round availability of fruit.","output":"Dietary Shifts in Relation to Fruit Availability among Masked Palm Civets (Paguma larvata) in Central China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are distinguished by the ability to generate epidemics or pandemics, with their corresponding diseases characterized by severe respiratory illness, such as that which occurs in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS\\\\CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS\\\\CoV), and, today, in SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, an outbreak that has struck explosively and uncontrollably beginning in December 2019 and has claimed the lives of more than 1.9 M people worldwide as of January 2021.

AD is typically diagnosed using an integrated knowledge and assessment of multiple biomarkers and interrelated factors.

More often than not, prospective AD cases are accompanied by other progressive, age-related dementing neuropathologies including, predominantly, a neurovascular and/or cardiovascular component, multiple-infarct dementia (MID), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and/or strokes or 'mini-strokes' often integrated with other age-related neurological and non-neurological disorders including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Especially over the last 40 years, enormous research efforts have been undertaken to discover, characterize, and quantify more effectual and reliable biological markers for AD, especially during the pre-clinical or prodromal stages of AD so that pre-emptive therapeutic treatment strategies may be initiated. While a wealth of genetic, neurobiological, neurochemical, neuropathological, neuroimaging and other diagnostic information obtainable for a single AD patient can be immense: (i) it is currently challenging to integrate and formulate a definitive diagnosis for AD from this multifaceted and multidimensional information; and (ii) these data are unfortunately not directly comparable with the etiopathological patterns of other AD patients even when carefully matched for age, gender, familial genetics, and drug history. Four decades of AD research have repeatedly indicated that diagnostic profiles for AD are reflective of an extremely heterogeneous neurological disorder.

METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study conducted on patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalised. In this study, 55 patients were included. The patients were divided into two groups as the ozone and control group. Ozone therapy (major autohemotherapy) was applied to 37 patients who were being treated with the appropriate COVID-19 treatment protocol determined by the infectious diseases committee of our hospital. The ozone treatment protocol consisted of seven sessions (one session per day) of intravenous ozone administration, applied in a volume of 100 mL and a concentration of 30 g/mL. Only the conventional COVID-19 treatment protocol was applied to 18 patients in the control group. Clinical follow-up was performed until the discharge of the patients from the hospital with successful treatment or until the mortality occurred. Factors affecting mortality were analysed using univariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalisation was required in 6 of the 37 patients who were treated with ozone (16.2%), while 4 of 18 patients in the control group required ICU treatment (22.2%) (P = .713). When the mortality rates between the two groups were compared, mortality was lower in the ozone group (P = .032). As a result of univariate logistic regression analysis performed to investigate the factors affecting mortality, treatment with ozone therapy was determined as a risk factor for mortality. Patients receiving ozone therapy appear to have a lower mortality risk (odds ratio [OR]: 0.149, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.026-0.863, P = .034).

The experience nevertheless provides an opportunity to investigate the optimal design of remote labs, with similar learning goals as in-person labs. In this study we explore the three most common approaches to remote labs: recorded experiments, applet-based experiments, and at-home projects. We use surveys and interviews to make two comparisons: remote labs vs. in-person labs;the different types of remote labs. Examining these two questions we find that remote labs perform as well as in-person labs and students learn the most from at home physics experiments while also enjoying those the most.","output":"How Well Do Remote Labs Work?

The new method for detection of these viruses was applied simultaneously with real-time PCR for the detection of six bacterial pathogens in clinical samples from 1700 pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Of all the patients, 32.5% were suspected to have single bacterial infections; 1.9%, multiple bacterial infections; 15.2%, coinfections of bacteria and viruses; 25.8%, single viral infections; and 2.1%, multiple viral infections. In the remaining 22.6%, the etiology was unknown. The breakdown of suspected causative pathogens was as follows: 24.4% were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 14.8% were Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 11.3% were Haemophilus influenzae, and 1.4% were Chlamydophila pneumoniae. The breakdown of viruses was as follows: 14.5% were RV, 9.4% were RSV, 7.4% were hMPV, 7.2% were PIV, and 2.9% were HBoV.

The management of lithiatic renal pathology requires investigations at the initial macromolecular stages. Hence, the current study was designed to unravel the protein make-up of human kidney stones and its impact on renal cells' altered proteome, induced as the consequence of CaOx injury. CaOx kidney stones were collected from patients; stones were pooled for entire cohort, followed by protein extraction. Immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and flow-cytometric analysis revealed the promising antilithiatic activity of kidney stone matrix proteins. The iTRAQ analysis of renal cells showed up-regulation of 12 proteins and down-regulation of 41 proteins due to CaOx insult, however, this differential expression was normalized in the presence of kidney stone matrix proteins. Protein network analysis revealed involvement of up-regulated proteins in apoptosis, calcium-binding, inflammatory and stress response pathways. Moreover, seven novel antilithiatic proteins were identified from human kidney stones' matrix: Tenascin-X-isoform2, CCDC-144A, LIM domain kinase-1, Serine/Arginine receptor matrix protein-2, mitochondrial peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase, volume-regulated anion channel subunit-LRRC8A and BMPR2. In silico analysis concluded that these proteins exert antilithiatic potential through crystal binding, thereby inhibiting the crystal-cell interaction, a pre-requisite to initiate inflammatory response.

Many \`\`structured models'' capture aspects of the contact structure through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An important observation in such models, is that once a fraction $1-1/\\\\mathcal{R}_0$ has been infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an epidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold can be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because the disease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunizing higher-risk individuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited \`\`first wave'' may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a second wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we systematically analyse a number of mean-field models for networks and other structured populations to address issues relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, we consider herd-immunity under several scenarios. We confirm that, in networks with high degree heterogeneity, the first wave confers herd-immunity with significantly fewer infections than equivalent models with lower degree heterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in the contact network, then this effect might become more subtle. Indeed, modifying the structure can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during the first wave and make the second wave more substantial. We confirm this finding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with real data and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of the mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. We find that results regarding herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, the duration of lockdown and how lockdown is implemented.","output":"The impact of network properties and mixing on control measures and disease-induced herd immunity in epidemic models: a mean-field model perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been reported that ACE2 is the main host cell receptor of 2019-nCoV and plays a crucial role in the entry of virus into the cell to cause the final infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 243 patients with TBI admitted to our hospital were included in this study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were utilized to analyze the association between lactate and AKI. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to verify the predictive value of lactate and the logistic model. RESULTS: Acute kidney injury group had higher age (p = 0.016), serum creatinine (p < 0.001), lactate (p < 0.001), and lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS; p = 0.021) than non-AKI group.

This review focuses on our current knowledge of filovirus egress and the viral and host factors and processes that are involved. Within the virus, these factors consist of the major matrix protein, viral protein 40 (VP40), which is necessary and sufficient for viral particle release, and nucleocapsid and glycoprotein that interact with VP40 to promote egress. In the host cell, some proteins are hijacked by filoviruses in order to enhance virion budding capacity that include members of the family of E3 ubiquitin ligase and the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, while others such as tetherin inhibit viral egress. An understanding of these molecular interactions that modulate viral particle egress provides an important opportunity to identify new targets for the development of antivirals to prevent and treat filovirus infections.","output":"Host and Viral Proteins Modulating Ebola and Marburg Virus Egress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic and the measures adopted for its control have had a significant impact, both in and at health, social and personal levels.

Clarifying the host range of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will provide instructive information for the containment of viral spillover. The spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 is the key determinant of receptor utilization, and therefore amino acid mutations on S will probably alter viral host range. Here, in order to evaluate the impact of S mutations, we constructed 20 Hela cell lines stably expressing ACE2 orthologs from different animals, and prepared 27 pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 carrying different spike mutants, among which 20 bear single mutation and the other 7 were cloned from emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including D614G, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.135), Lambda (B.1.429) and Mu (B.1.525).

Furthermore, the S mutants of real SARS-CoV-2 variants comprising N501Y showed significantly acquired abilities to infect cells expressing mouse ACE2, indicating a critical role of N501Y in expanding SARS-CoV-2 host range. In addition, A262S and T478I significantly enhanced the utilization of various mammals ACE2. In summary, our results indicated that T478I and N501Y substitutions were two S mutations important for receptor adaption of SARS-CoV-2, potentially contributing to spillover of the virus to many other animal hosts.

Successful policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) interventions to reduce obesity must reflect the circumstances of the population. We used a health equity lens to identify barriers and facilitators for healthy food access in Martin County, Kentucky, to design interventions responsive to social, cultural, and historical contexts. METHODS: We conducted 5 focus groups in Martin County, Kentucky, in fall 2019 to obtain perspectives on the local food system and gauge acceptability of PSE interventions. We used grounded theory to identify perceived barriers and facilitators for healthy eating. RESULTS: Thirty-four adults (27 women; median age, 46 years) participated in 5 groups. One prominent theme was declining interest in farming; many participants believed this decline was generational. One participant noted, Most of my adult male relatives worked in the coal mines, and they worked 6 days a week. . . . My grandpa had the garden, but then my dads generation is the one quit gardening. Another shared, You would probably have to have someone to teach [gardening]. Instead of enhancing farmers markets, participants suggested building community capacity for home gardens to increase vegetable consumption. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the importance of obtaining community input on the development of PSE interventions to mitigate inequities in obesity. Although farmers market interventions were deemed not feasible, other solutions to enhance access to produce were identified.

These etiopathological mechanisms, in addition to the hemodynamic and respiratory compromises characterizing severe COVID-19, can culminate in the emergence of various acute stroke phenotypes, such as arterial and venous thromboses, and hemorrhages. COVID-19-associated strokes have been encountered in younger patients with no cerebrovascular risk factors but the disease is also found to target older patients with comorbidities who are more likely to contract the more severe forms of the disease. Anticoagulation, antiplatelets, statins, thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy remain the cornerstone therapies for patients with ischemic strokes and COVID-19. An important aspect of secondary stroke prevention is blood pressure management recommendations which are currently being revisited as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone antagonists were initially thought to be detrimental to infected patients due to the interaction of the virions with ACE2 receptors.

Apart from patients with obvious EI, the identification of a such behavior during a real-life consultation is unreliable. We therefore describe a machine learning algorithm to screen for EI, as actimetry measurements are difficult to implement. Complete datasets for 1409 COPD patients were obtained from COLIBRI-COPD, a database of clinicopathological data submitted by French pulmonologists. Patient- and pulmonologist-reported estimates of PA quantity (daily walking time) and intensity (domestic, recreational, or fitness-directed) were first used to assign patients to one of four PA groups (extremely inactive [EI], overtly active [OA], intermediate [INT], inconclusive [INC]). The algorithm was developed by (i) using data from 80% of patients in the EI and OA groups to identify phenotype signatures of non-PA-related clinical variables most closely associated with EI or OA; (ii) testing its predictive validity using data from the remaining 20% of EI and OA patients; and (iii) applying the algorithm to identify EI patients in the INT and INC groups. The algorithms overall error for predicting EI status among EI and OA patients was 13.7%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 (95% confidence intervals: 0.75C0.92). Of the 577 patients in the INT/INC groups, 306 (53%) were reclassified as EI by the algorithm. Patient- and physician- reported estimation may underestimate EI in a large proportion of COPD patients.

Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis. Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2.

We investigated the patterns of demyelination and oligodendrocyte pathology in this model. In early stages of the disease infection of oligodendrocytes was associated with a downregulation of expression of mRNA for proteolipid protein in the absence of myelin destruction. When demyelinating lesions were formed infected oligodendrocytes were destroyed by necrosis, whereas oligodendrocytes that did not contain detectable virus antigen or RNA were in part dying by apoptosis. At this stage of the disease remyelination of the lesions was pronounced. At later stages after infection virus antigen was nearly completely cleared from the lesions. In spite of the lack of detectable virus, ongoing demyelination and unspecific tissue destruction occurred, and oligodendrocytes were mainly destroyed by apoptosis. These late lesions revealed only minimal central remyelination, but they were frequently repaired by Schwann cells. Our studies suggest that the mechanisms of myelin destruction in this model of virus-induced demyelination are complex and that the patterns of tissue damage may change during the course of the disease.","output":"Patterns of oligodendrocyte pathology in coronavirus-induced subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis in the Lewis rat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Minimally invasive surgery including laparoscopic and robotic surgery was recently approved for clinical use in hepatobiliary surgery. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the feasibility and technical aspects of robotic single incision for hepatobiliary surgery using the GelPort laparoscopic system in a preliminary animal study. METHODS We performed eight robotic single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) procedures, including four cholecystectomies and four lateral segmentectomy of the liver, in a porcine study using the da Vinci S-HD Surgical System. A single-channel GelPort access was placed through a 2.5-cm single incision for robotic access. A 12-mm camera port, two 8-mm ports for the robotic arms and one 5-mm port for the patient-side assistant were inserted. A Mini Loop Retractor was applied to retract the fundus of the gallbladder. The EndoWrist dissector and grasping forceps was introduced to fine-dissect Calot's triangle. The instruments were crossed to avoid \\"sword fighting\\" and clashing of instruments in the abdomen. The cystic duct was divided after double ligation and the gallbladder was removed. Hepatic transection was performed with bipolar Harmonic shears and LigaSure for vascular pedicles. RESULTS All robotic SILS procedures were completed (8/8, 100%). The cholecystectomies and hepatectomies were safely performed in average operating times of 70 min (15) and 60 min (20), respectively, with minimal blood loss. There were no conversions, re-interventions or extension of the skin incision. CONCLUSIONS Robotic hepatobiliary SILS is technically feasible and safe using GelPort as a single-incision access platform.

The present manuscript is aimed at specifically describing the echocardiographic assessment of the right ventricle, mainly focusing on the most useful parameters and the time of examination. The RV direct involvement happens quite often due to preferential lung tropism of COVID-19 infection, which is responsible for an interstitial pneumonia characterized also by pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction (and thus an RV afterload increase), often evolving in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The indirect RV involvement may be due to the systemic inflammatory activation, caused by COVID-19, which may affect the overall cardiovascular system mainly by inducing an increase in troponin values and in the sympathetic tone and altering the volemic status (mainly by affecting renal function). Echocardiographic parameters, specifically focused on RV (dimensions and function) and pulmonary circulation (systolic pulmonary arterial pressures, RV wall thickness), are to be measured in a COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure and ARDS. They have been selected on the basis of their feasibility (that is easy to be measured, even in short time) and usefulness for clinical monitoring. It is advisable to measure the same parameters in the single patient (based also on the availability of valid acoustic windows) which are identified in the first examination and repeated in the following ones, to guarantee a reliable monitoring. Information gained from a clinically-guided echocardiographic assessment holds a clinical utility in the single patients when integrated with biohumoral data (indicating systemic activation), blood gas analysis (reflecting COVID-19-induced lung damage) and data on ongoing therapies (in primis ventilatory settings).","output":"Echocardiographic assessment of the right ventricle in COVID -related acute respiratory syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent research has shown that Coronavirus (CoV) replication depends on active immunophilin pathways.

The common risk factors identified with regard to suicidal behavior are fear of COVID-19, economic instability, poor access to healthcare facilities, pre-existing psychiatric disorders, and social disconnect. The studies done so far have reported either case studies or have made an effort to understand the risk factors. An understanding of the underlying causal pattern from existing theories, behind these risks, will enable adopting appropriate prevention mechanisms. Hence, this review examines evidence related to risk factors of suicides that occurred during COVID 19 and discusses it in the light of three major theoretical approaches: interpersonal model, stress diathesis model, and cognitive model. The insights obtained from the three viewpoints reveal that perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, stress sensitivity, cognitive errors such as magnification, catastrophic thinking, arbitrary inference, and mind-reading are likely reasons behind these risk factors for suicide. It is suggested that awareness regarding COVID-19 stressors, use of community-based approaches like gatekeeper training, and brief online psychotherapy by using techniques of mindfulness, interpersonal psychotherapy, and cognitive behavior therapy can be useful in reducing suicide risk during COVID-19.","output":"Theoretical Mapping of Suicidal Risk Factors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mini-Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous vaccines have been generated to decrease the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.

METHODS: We evaluated risk factors for COVID-19 infection in three, preexisting, longitudinal, Latinx family cohorts in the San Francisco Bay Area from May through September 2020 (N=383 households, 1875 people). All households were previously recruited before the pandemic. For the COVID-19 sub-study, participants responded to a telephone interview where we assessed food consumption patterns, housing and employment status, and history of COVID-19 infection. Secondhand smoke exposure was based on previously collected selfreported data, and environmental pollution exposure was determined from census tract residence. Non-parametric tests and multiple logistic regression were used to assess independent predictors of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Larger household size increased risk for infection (OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.12C2.23, p<0.01) as did increasing number of children in household (OR=3.79; 95% CI: 1.51C9.56).

METHODS: A total of 1618 adult patients present at two Emergency Department triage centers and for whom qRT-PCR tests had been performed were included in this study. Six previously published models were reconstructed and assessed using diagnostic tests as sensitivity (Se) and negative predictive value (NPV), discrimination (Area Under the Roc Curve (AUROC)) and calibration measures. Agreement was also measured between them using Kappas coefficient and IntraClass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). A sensitivity analysis has been conducted by waves of patients. RESULTS: Among the 6 selected models, those based only on symptoms and/or risk exposure were found to be less efficient than those based on biological parameters and/or radiological examination with smallest AUROC values (< 0.80). However, all models showed good calibration and values above > 0.75 for Se and NPV but poor agreement (Kappa and ICC < 0.5) between them. The results of the first wave were similar to those of the second wave.

A double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding protein, PACT, plays an important role in potentiating RIG-I function. We have shown previously that arenaviral nucleoproteins (NPs) suppress type I IFN production via their RNase activity to degrade PAMP RNA. We report here that NPs of arenaviruses block the PACT-induced enhancement of RIG-I function to mediate type I IFN production and that this inhibition is dependent on the RNase function of NPs, which is different from that of a known mechanism of other viral proteins to abolish the interaction between PACT and RIG-I. To understand the biological roles of PACT and RIG-I in authentic arenavirus infection, we analyze growth kinetics of recombinant Pichinde virus (PICV), a prototypical arenavirus, in RIG-I knockout (KO) and PACT KO mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Wild-type (WT) PICV grew at higher titers in both KO MEF lines than in normal MEFs, suggesting the important roles of these cellular proteins in restricting virus replication. PICV carrying the NP RNase catalytically inactive mutation could not grow in normal MEFs but could replicate to some extent in both KO MEF lines. The level of virus growth was inversely correlated with the amount of type I IFNs produced. These results suggest that PACT plays an important role in potentiating RIG-I function to produce type I IFNs in order to restrict arenavirus replication and that viral NP RNase activity is essential for optimal viral replication by suppressing PACT-induced RIG-I activation.IMPORTANCE We report here a new role of the nucleoproteins of arenaviruses that can block type I IFN production via their specific inhibition of the cellular protein sensors of virus infection (RIG-I and PACT).

Maintaining their activity with functional electrical stimulation (FES) may improve outcome. We studied feasibility of breath-synchronized expiratory population muscle FES in a mixed ICU population (Holland study) and pooled data with our previous work (Australian study) to estimate potential clinical effects in a larger group. METHODS: Holland: Patients with a contractile response to FES received active or sham expiratory muscle FES (30 min, twice daily, 5 days/week until weaned). Main endpoints were feasibility (e.g., patient recruitment, treatment compliance, stimulation intensity) and safety. Pooled: Data on respiratory muscle thickness and ventilation duration from the Holland and Australian studies were combined (N = 40) in order to estimate potential effect size. Plasma cytokines (day 0, 3) were analyzed to study the effects of FES on systemic inflammation. RESULTS: Holland: A total of 272 sessions were performed (active/sham: 169/103) in 20 patients (N = active/sham: 10/10) with a total treatment compliance rate of 91.1%. No FES-related serious adverse events were reported. Pooled: On day 3, there was a between-group difference (N = active/sham: 7/12) in total abdominal expiratory muscle thickness favoring the active group [treatment difference (95% confidence interval); 2.25 (0.34, 4.16) mm, P = 0.02] but not on day 5. Plasma cytokine levels indicated that early FES did not induce systemic inflammation. Using a survival analysis approach for the total study population, median ventilation duration and ICU length of stay were 10 versus 52 (P = 0.07), and 12 versus 54 (P = 0.03) days for the active versus sham group. Median ventilation duration of patients that were successfully extubated was 8.5 [5.6C12.2] versus 10.5 [5.3C25.6] days (P = 0.60) for the active (N = 16) versus sham (N = 10) group, and median ICU length of stay was 10.5 [8.0C14.5] versus 14.0 [9.0C19.5] days (P = 0.36) for those active (N = 16) versus sham (N = 8) patients that were extubated and discharged alive from the ICU. During ICU stay, 3/20 patients died in the active group versus 8/20 in the sham group (P = 0.16).

Methods: Using a purposive sampling method, participants were recruited from the Korean Psychological Association's Mental Health and Wellness Center in G city, South Korea, from May 5 to December 30, 2020. The interviews were analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method. Data saturation was reached after interviewing 14 participants. Results: The experiences of patients recovering from COVID-19 were clustered into 4 main themes and 10 subthemes:, namely, the patients' 1) stigmatization, leading to anxiety, fatigue, and concern about neighbors;2) negative emotions: anger and helplessness;3) coping strategies under pressure: increased gratitude, self-reflection, and self-efficacy;and 4) ways of overcoming internalized stigma: personal growth and hope for the future. Discussion: The results suggest that the positive and negative emotions of patients recovering from COVID-19 are interwoven and coexist against the background of the pandemic. Improvement of social networks, development of coping skills, and psychological growth play an important role in alleviating the psychological burden of recovering patients.","output":"A Phenomenological Study on the Lived Experiences of Patients Recovered from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the world, creating significant impact on people's lives and subjective wellbeing. While previous studies have shown that students' wellbeing and how they manage their emotions are critical to students' learning, less research has considered their specific impacts on student engagement in online learning. AIMS: The aim of this study is to examine how students' subjective wellbeing and emotion regulation strategies (viz cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) are associated with student engagement in online learning during the pandemic. SAMPLE: A total of 965 students from a university in China participated in the study. METHODS: The data were collected online during the COVID-19 from March to July 2020, which included measures of wellbeing, emotion regulation strategie, and online learning engagement. RESULTS: Structural equation modelling results showed that wellbeing was positively associated with both the use of reappraisal and suppression. Moreover, mediation analysis showed that reappraisal partially mediated the relationship between wellbeing and all types of online learning engagement (including cognitive, emotional and behavioural engagements). Conversely, suppression was found to have a small mediating effect between wellbeing and behavioural engagement of online learning only. No such effect was found on cognitive and emotional engagements. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide evidence on the positive relationship between wellbeing and both the strategies of suppression and reappraisal during the pandemic. However, only reappraisal has positive impact on learning, suggesting the importance of effective regulation strategies on students' online engagement. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.","output":"Subjective wellbeing and emotion regulation strategies: How are they associated with student engagement in online learning during Covid-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper considers whether the COVID-19 stay-at-home order affected crimes targeting women. To answer this question, we use national municipal-level crime data from Mexico's National Public Security System. The NPSS reports sexual crimes, lapses in alimony, domestic violence, and femicides. Using the NPSS, we track monthly changes in crimes targeting women using an event-study design. Our results show that lapses in alimony, sexual crimes, and domestic violence follow a U-shaped trend. Each crime declined during the stay-at-home order, and then rose back to pre-COVID levels by October. Then, we analyze potential mechanisms for the reduction in crimes against women. We find that infection risk, victim-criminal match, and banning the sale of alcohol are related to higher declines in crime.","output":"The Great Crime Recovery: Crimes Against Women During, and After, the COVID-19 Lockdown in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS) has multiple etiological agents associated with its occurrence, including two viruses and at least three Escherichia coli isolates. Myco Curb (MC) contains organic acids and is used as a feed additive to inhibit growth of many bacteria and toxin-producing molds but not viruses. Studies evaluating the influence of MC on BW, feed conversion, and mortality indicate that turkey poults tolerate MC at 1.25% but not 2.50%, but higher MC content in feed provides greater suppression of growth of bacterial isolates commonly associated with PEMS. In two PEMS experiments, 1.25% MC was blended into poult starter feed and was maintained in the feed for the duration of the 3-wk experiments. In these experiments, 1-d-old commercial poults were placed into battery brooders and were given turkey starter feed and water ad libitum. At 6 d posthatch, PEMS-designated poults were given a 1-mL oral gavage of a 10% suspension of feces from PEMS-infected poults. BW depression due to PEMS was not alleviated by MC, although there was less variation in mean BW of the MC-fed poults, and there was a highly significant reduction in mortality (68% in PEMS-exposed with MC vs. 32.5% in PEMS-exposed without MC). The reduction in mortality in the MC-fed poults was attributed to decreased bacterial content of the gut and to maintenance of packed cell volume and hemoglobin content. It was concluded that MC might be a potential nutritional intervention during PEMS.","output":"Influence of a propionic acid feed additive on performance of turkey poults with experimentally induced poult enteritis and mortality syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Case details: A case of a 50-year old HIV-positive man is presented, with focus on visualization of post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) of the lungs, in comparison to a forensic control case. He had been found dead at home, a day after his nasopharyngeal swab had returned positive for SARS-COV-2, three days after the sample had been taken as an outpatient, over five weeks after first exhibiting possible symptoms. 3D-visualization was performed by visually discriminating correlates for aerated, poorly aerated and non-aerated lung regions. The visual side-by-side comparison with a control case shows the deterioration beyond any normal post-mortem finding, however. The PMCT findings in the lungs resemble those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while histologically identified inflammation also shows, in part binuclear, lymphocytes. In addition, acute liver dystrophy and acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys were found. Except coronary artery atherosclerosis, there appeared to be no remarkable pathology of the heart. Comment: With the pandemic impact of SARS-COV-2, a range of issues unfolds, also for medicolegal investigations into deaths, as we report the first Swiss case with post-mortem CT where death had occurred due to a SARS-COV-2 infection, with features of a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, as an outpatient. As this pandemic from the view of risk assessment does constitute a black swan, underestimated fat tails as technical reason should be addressed by also analyzing apparent extreme single observations. This case of an outpatient (without hospital or intensive-care treatment) shows a pulmonary progression beyond the typical findings of COVID-19, to a non-specific picture of ARDS, where histologically, in part binuclear lymphocytes were remarked. What appeared to be an initially slow progression with final rapid escalation raises the question whether nasopharyngeal swabs alone or added pulmonary CT might be better for screening high-risk patients. The reported symptoms and relatively late medical consultation in this case appeared to contrast with the extensive pathology, raising the question whether any search for super-spreaders should not just focus on asymptomatic but under-reported symptomatic patients, and whether their prolonged circulation in everyday life would justify measures such as for example more extensive face mask policies. As post-mortem testing for SARS-COV-2 may not be available for every case, PMCT may provide sensitive testing for lung changes related to COVID-19. In order to allow for more precise medicolegal investigations in the context of COVID-19, however, any more specific extra tests may have to be financed by stakeholders in epidemiology, infectious disease or policy.","output":"Implications for forensic death investigations from first Swiss post-mortem CT in a case of non-hospital treatment with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduccin:los coronavirus son una amplia familia de virus que logran causar enfermedades tanto en animales como en humanos En humanos, se sabe que varios coronavirus ocasionan infecciones respiratorias que consiguen ir desde el resfriado comn hasta enfermedades ms complicadas como el sndrome respiratorio de Oriente Medio (MERS) y el sndrome respiratorio agudo severo (SRAS) El coronavirus que se ha manifestado ms recientemente causa la enfermedad por coronavirus COVID-19 Objetivo: presentar un pronstico con el uso del modelo lineal de Brown de la dinmica de transmisin del COVID- 19 en Colombia Materiales y mtodos: para desarrollar la investigacin se utiliz la base de datos de las personas infectadas con el COVID-19, la informacin de los datos corresponde al perodo 6 de marzo 2020 al 10 de mayo de 2020 Para su anlisis de prediccin se manej el mtodo de prediccin modelo de BROWN, utilizando el paquete estadstico SPSS v 25 Resultados:se determin por anlisis de prediccin que el nmero total de infectados por el COVID-19 en Colombia a 31 de agosto de 2020 estarn alrededor de 69848, de esta poblacin 41110 corresponde a hombres y 28738 a mujeres Conclusiones: se evidenci una alta poblacin de casos confirmados por coronavirus en Colombia a 31 de agosto de 2020;esto pone en alerta la red pblica hospitalaria del pas, adems que obliga a las personas y comunidades a mantenerse en cuarentena por la emergencia sanitaria Introduction: Coronaviruses is a broad family of viruses that manage to infect both animals and humans Several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections in humans, ranging from a common cold to more complicated conditions such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) The newly emerged coronavirus causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Objective: to predict the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Colombia using Brown ?s linear model Materials and Methods: the database including people infected with Covid-19 was used to develop the research This information corresponds to the period between March 6 2020 and May 10 2020 The Brown ?s model method was used for the predictive analysis in the SPSS v 25 statistical package Results: our prediction analysis indicates that the number of people infected by COVID-19 in Colombia by August 31 2020 will be around 69848;of this population, 41110 would be men and 28738 women Conclusions: a high population of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Colombia is forecasted as of August 31 2020;this places the public hospital network of the country on alert and forces individuals and communities to remain in quarantine due to the health emergency Introduo: Os coronavrus s?o uma ampla famlia de vrus que conseguem causar doen?as em animais e humanos Em humanos, sabe-se que vrios coronavrus causam infeces respiratrias que variam do resfriado comum a doen?as mais complicadas, como a sndrome respiratria do Oriente Mdio (MERS) e a sndrome respiratria aguda grave (SARS) O coronavrus manifestado mais recentemente causa a doen?a de coronavrus COVID-19 Objetivo:apresentar uma previs?o com o uso do modelo linear de Brown da dinamica de transmiss?o do COVID-19 na Col?mbia Metodologia: Para desenvolver a pesquisa, foi utilizado o banco de dados de pessoas infectadas com COVID-19, as informaes dos dados correspondem ao perodo de 6 de mar?o de 2020 a 20 de abril de 2020 Para sua anlise de previs?o, o mtodo de previs?o do modelo BROWN, usando o pacote estatstico SPSS v 25 Resultados:Foi determinado por anlise de previs?o que o nmero total de infectados com COVID-19 na Col?mbia em 31 de julho seria de 33 219 casos confirmados, 17213 casos para homens e 16006 para mulheres Conclus?es:Uma alta populao de casos confirmados por Coronavrus na Col?mbia foi evidenciada em 31 de julho de 2020, o que coloca em alerta a rede de hospitais pblicos do pas, alm de for?ar a quarentena de pessoas e comunidades devido  emergncia de sade","output":"Uso de modelo predictivo para la dinmica de transmisin del Covid-19 en Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Cypriot healthcare system has undergone a number of major transformations since the induction of the Republic of Cyprus in the European Union over 10 years ago. Currently Cyprus is undergoing a major reform, namely the introduction of a primary care driven national healthcare system. The aim of the study was to assess the existing state of training, support, quality, guidelines and infrastructure towards a better healthcare system in Cyprus. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods study combining statistical data until October 2016 and workshop discussions delivered in Cyprus in November 2015. We used anonymised data provided: (1a) by the Cyprus Medical Association of all registered medical doctors up to October 2016; (1b); by the Ministry of Health (MoH) Health Monitoring Unit up to October 2016; (2) during a workshop organised with representatives from the Royal College of Physicians, the European Commission and the Health Insurance Organization. RESULTS: The gender ratio of men over women is disproportionate, with over 85% of the medical doctors undertaking their training in Greece, Eastern Europe and neighbouring countries, while the current record does not hold a relevant specialty information for 4 out of 10 doctors. The results show lack of statutory inspection systems, application of revalidation principles or implementation of peer-review clinical services on the island. There are eight proposed recommendations made by the workshop participants towards the transformation of the Cypriot healthcare system and the development of the Cyprus Quality Improvement Institute. These are aimed at addressing gaps in quality of care, adherence to clinical guidelines and implementation of audits, development of doctors revalidation and peer-review of clinical services, accreditation of service implementation, establishment of a statutory inspection system as well as the set-up of an incentives program as part of the general healthcare system (GHS) of Cyprus.

Methods A total of 511 health care workers were randomly selected from two designated tuberculosis medical institutions in Anhui province. Results There were 139 people in epidemic prevention and control positions (27.20%). Depression level: female was higher than male;nurse was higher than doctor;middle and junior job titles were higher than senior titles;junior college degree or below were higher than bachelor's degree, master's degree and above;isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly higher than those of non-prevention and control positions ( P < 0.05). Loneliness scores: doctors were higher than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were higher than those of non-prevention and control positions ( P < 0.05). Social support: doctors were lower than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly lower than those of non-prevention and control positions ( P < 0.05). The score of social support was negatively correlated with depression and loneliness ( P < 0.001), while depression was positively correlated with loneliness ( P < 0.001). Health care workers most want to receive one-to-one psychological counseling (29.75%), and provide crisis management (24.07%). The awareness rate of health care workers on COVID-19's knowledge was relatively high. Conclusions The psychological problems of health care workers, especially women, nurses with low educational background, low professional title, and staff in the epidemic prevention and control positions are relatively serious. We should focus on this population, and take targeted intervention measures.","output":"Analysis on mental health status and needs of health care workers in designated medical institutions of tuberculosis during the epidemic period of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic diseases are one of the most severe health issues in the world, due to their terrible clinical presentations such as long onset cycle, insidious symptoms, and various complications. Recently, machine learning has become a promising technique to assist the early diagnosis of chronic diseases. However, existing works ignore the problems of feature hiding and imbalanced class distribution in chronic disease datasets. In this paper, we present a universal and efficient diagnostic framework to alleviate the above two problems for diagnosing chronic diseases timely and accurately. Specifically, we first propose a network-limited polynomial neural network (NLPNN) algorithm to efficiently capture high-level features hidden in chronic disease datasets, which is data augmentation in terms of its feature space and can also avoid over-fitting. Then, to alleviate the class imbalance problem, we further propose an attention-empowered NLPNN algorithm to improve the diagnostic accuracy for sick cases, which is also data augmentation in terms of its sample space. We evaluate the proposed framework on nine public and two real chronic disease datasets (partly with class imbalance). Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed diagnostic algorithms outperform state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, and can achieve superior performances in terms of accuracy, recall, F1, and G_mean. The proposed framework can help to diagnose chronic diseases timely and accurately at an early stage.","output":"A novel early diagnostic framework for chronic diseases with class imbalance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to have a huge impact, especially during the pandemic period.

METHODS A search was performed on June 5th, 2021, in four databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid APA PsycInfo, and Web of Science) for original research reporting on BS/BD in PWE, with no restriction on language or time of publication. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) original research, 2) cross-sectional study design component, 3) reported a lifetime prevalence of BS/BD or enough information to calculate an estimate, and 4) reported the method by which participants were deemed bipolar. Studies based on an exclusively pediatric population were excluded. To calculate pooled lifetime prevalence of BS/BD, two meta-analytic random-effects models were fitted, one for BS, and the other for BD. Risk of bias was assessed using a standardized appraisal tool for studies reporting prevalence. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. RESULTS A total of 750 records were screened, and 17 studies were included for analysis: seven provided prevalence estimates for only BS, eight for only BD, and two for both BS and BD. After outlier exclusion and subgroup analysis using screening method as a moderator, the pooled prevalence of BS in PWE was 12.3% [95% CI; 10.6-14.1%] (7,506 PWE). The pooled prevalence of BD in PWE was 4.5% [95% CI; 2.2-7.4%] (48,334 PWE). Considerable heterogeneity was present - more so for BD than for BS - and could be explained through differences in population demographics and study methodology. DISCUSSION This study's main limitation was regarding the certainty of evidence. Notwithstanding, our estimates of prevalence should prompt further research on BS/BD in PWE. Given the significant morbidity associated to BD, clinicians should carefully screen PWE for BS.","output":"Prevalence of Bipolar Symptoms or Disorder in Epilepsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Coronavirus 2019 (the covid-19) pandemic, schools continuously strive to provide consistent education to their students. Teachers and education policymakers are seeking ways to re-open schools, as it is necessary for community and economic development. However, in light of the pandemic, schools require customized schedules that can address the health concerns and safety of the students considering classroom sizes, air conditioning equipment, classroom systems, e.g., self-contained or compartmentalized. To solve this issue, we developed the School-Virus-Infection-Simulator (SVIS) for teachers and education policymakers. SVIS simulates the spread of infection at a school considering the students' lesson schedules, classroom volume, air circulation rates in classrooms, and infectability of the students. Thus, teachers and education policymakers can simulate how their school schedules can impact current health concerns. We then demonstrate the impact of several school schedules in self-contained and departmentalized classrooms and evaluate them in terms of the maximum number of students infected simultaneously and the percentage of face-to-face lessons. The results show that increasing classroom ventilation rate is effective, however, the impact is not stable compared to customizing school schedules, in addition, school schedules can differently impact the maximum number of students infected depending on whether classrooms are self-contained or compartmentalized. It was found that one of school schedules had a higher maximum number of students infected, compared to schedules with a higher percentage of face-to-face lessons. SVIS and the simulation results can help teachers and education policymakers plan school schedules appropriately in order to reduce the maximum number of students infected, while also maintaining a certain percentage of face-to-face lessons.","output":"School Virus Infection Simulator for Customizing School Schedules During COVID-19 (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever is a notifiable disease within Australia. Although studies in endemic regions give an indication of acquisition risk, many countries lack reliable data, and little is known of the absolute or relative risk in Australian travellers. By combining notified case data with travel statistics provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the aim of this study was to give an indication of risk for typhoid acquisition among Australian travellers. METHODS: Australian typhoid notifications between 1st January 2010 and 30th June 2017 were grouped by country of acquisition and age category (<15 or 15 years). Australian travel data were used to inform time at risk and incidence rate of Australian typhoid notifications pertaining to country and region of acquisition. Salmonella Paratyphi infections, though notifiable, were excluded as the focus was vaccine preventable illness. Data from New South Wales and Victoria were used to examine the incidence in those acquiring infection in their country of birth (COB) against travellers who did not. RESULTS: Nine hundred twenty-three cases of typhoid were notified over the period of review, 96% of which were acquired overseas. The greatest determinant of risk was travel destination, with countries in south Asia associated with highest crude incidence rate (252 per 100 000 person-years), particularly Bangladesh. Younger age and immigrants returning to their COB were generally associated with higher risk of acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of typhoid fever in Australian travellers to endemic regions is considerable. Immigrants returning to their COB appear to be at higher risk and it is likely that this risk extends to their traveling dependents. These findings help clinicians and public health officials to plan and advise pre-travel vaccination strategies with at-risk individuals and groups.

The rapid implementation and availability of several COVID-19 vaccines is now a global health-care priority but more information about humoral responses to single- and double-dose vaccine is needed. METHODS: 163 health care workers (HCW) of the Padua University Hospitals, who underwent a complete vaccination campaign with BNT162b2 vaccine were asked to collect serum samples at 12 (t12) and 28 (t28) days after the first inoculum to allow the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies (Ab) using chemiluminescent assays against the spike (S) protein and the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the virus, respectively. RESULTS: Significant differences were found at t12 for infection-na?ve and subjects with previous-natural infection who present higher values of specific antibodies, while no significant differences have been found between t12 and t28. No statistically significant difference was found between male and female, while lower Ab levels have been observed in subjects older than 60 years at t12 but not at t28.

The study of its natural origin and host range is of particular importance for source tracing, monitoring of this virus, and prevention of recurrent infections. One major approach is to test the binding ability of the viral receptor gene ACE2 from various hosts to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to cover a large collection of species. METHODS: In this paper, we applied state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and created a pipeline reaching >87% accuracy in predicting binding between different ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike. RESULTS: We further validated our prediction pipeline using 2 independent test sets involving >50 bat species and achieved >78% accuracy. A large-scale screening of 204 mammal species revealed 144 species (or 61%) were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections, highlighting the importance of intensive monitoring and studies in mammalian species.

Data on hesitancy amongst child and adolescent populations is largely confined to parent opinion. We investigated the characteristics of vaccine hesitant children and adolescents using results from a large, school-based self-report survey of the willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccination in students aged 9 C18 years in England. METHODS: Data from the OxWell Student Survey on mental health, life experiences and behaviours were used, collected from four counties across England. Local authority partners recruited schools. The vaccine hesitancy question gave six response options and were clustered to inform delivery: eager and willing were categorised as vaccination opt-in, don't know and not bothered categorised as undecided, and unwilling and anti-vaccination categorised as opt-out. We conducted a multinomial regression to determine associations between vaccine hesitancy and sociodemographic, health behaviour and social connection variables. FINDINGS: 27,910 students from 180 schools answered the vaccine hesitancy question between 14th May and 21st July 2021, of whom 13984 (50.1%) would opt-in to take a vaccination, 10322 (37.0%) were undecided, and 3604 (12.9%) would opt-out. A lower percentage of younger students reported that they would opt-in to vaccination, for example, 35.7% of 9-year-olds and 51.3% of 13-year-olds compared to 77.8% of 17-year-olds would opt-in to take a vaccination. Students who were opt-out or undecided (a combined vaccine hesitant group) were more likely to come from deprived socioeconomic contexts with higher rates of home rental versus home ownership and their school locations were more likely to be in areas of greater deprivation. They were more likely to smoke or vape, spend longer on social media, feel that they did not belong in their school community but had lower levels of anxiety and depression. The vaccine hesitant students- the undecided and opt-out groups- were similar in profile, although the opt-out students had higher reported confirmed or probable previous COVID-19 infection than the opt-in group, whereas those undecided, did not. INTERPRETATION: If government vaccination strategies move towards vaccinating younger school-aged students, efforts to increase vaccination uptake may be necessary. Compared with students who would opt-in, those who were vaccine hesitant had greater indicators of social deprivation and felt a lack of community cohesion by not feeling a sense of belonging at their school. There were indications that those students who would opt-out had higher levels of marginalisation and mistrust.

Several models and algorithms have been developed and applied for both identifying COVID-19 cases and for assessing and predicting the risk of developing unfavourable outcomes. Our aim was to summarize how AI is being currently applied to COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a PubMed search using as query MeSH major terms \\"Artificial Intelligence\\" AND \\"COVID-19\\", searching for articles published until December 31, 2021, which explored the possible role of AI in COVID-19. The dataset origin (internal dataset or public datasets available online) and data used for training and testing the proposed ML/DL model(s) were retrieved. RESULTS: Our analysis finally identified 292 articles in PubMed. These studies displayed large heterogeneity in terms of imaging test, laboratory parameters and clinical-demographic data included. Most models were based on imaging data, in particular CT scans or chest X-rays images. C-Reactive protein, leukocyte count, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocytes and platelets counts were found to be the laboratory biomarkers most frequently included in COVID-19 related AI models.

The present study aimed at evaluating the impact of the lockdown during the pandemic on mental health adopting both a longitudinal and a cross-sectional design. Accordingly, the study investigated general psychopathology a few weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak (T0) and during lockdown (T1), and the associations between lockdown-related environmental conditions, self-perceived worsening in daily living and psychopathology. Methods 130 subjects (aged 18C60 years) were included in the longitudinal design, and an additional subsample of 541 subjects was recruited for the in-lockdown evaluation. Socio-demographic data and the Brief Symptom Inventory were collected both at T0 and T1. Moreover, at T1 an online survey was administered for the evaluation of lockdown-related environmental conditions and self-perceived variations in daily living induced by quarantine, along with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Results Longitudinal analysis showed that phobic anxiety and depressive symptoms increased at T1 as compared with T0, whereas interpersonal sensitivity and paranoid ideation decreased. Pre-existing general psychopathology predicted COVID-19-related post-traumatic symptomatology. Cross-sectional analyses underlined that self-perceived deteriorations in various areas of daily living were associated with general and post-traumatic psychopathology, and with several lockdown-related conditions, especially economic damage.

In anticipation of ventilator shortages and limited ICU bed capacity, hospital operations prioritized the development of prognostic tools to predict clinical deterioration. However, early experience from frontline physicians observed that some patients developed unanticipated deterioration after having relatively stable periods, attesting to the uncertainty of clinical trajectories among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Prediction tools that incorporate clinical variables at one time-point, usually on hospital presentation, are suboptimal for patients with dynamic changes and evolving clinical trajectories. Therefore, our study team developed a machine-learning algorithm to predict clinical deterioration among hospitalized COVID-19 patients by extracting clinically meaningful features from complex longitudinal laboratory and vital sign values during the early period of hospitalization with an emphasis on informative missing-ness. To incorporate the evolution of the disease and clinical practice over the course of the pandemic, we utilized a time-dependent cross-validation strategy for model development. Finally, we validated our prediction model on an external validation cohort of COVID-19 patients served in a demographically distinct population from the training cohort. The main finding of our study is the identification of risk profiles of early, late and no clinical deterioration during the course of hospitalization. While risk prediction models that include simple predictors at ED presentation and clinical judgement are able to identify any deterioration vs. no deterioration, our methodology is able to isolate a particular risk group that remain stable initially but deteriorate at a later stage of the course of hospitalization. We demonstrate the superior predictive performance with the utilization of laboratory and vital sign data during the early period of hospitalization compared to the utilization of data at presentation alone. Our results will allow efficient hospital resource allocation and will motivate research in understanding the late deterioration risk group.","output":"A predictive model of clinical deterioration among hospitalized COVID-19 patients by harnessing hospital course trajectories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, there has been a surge in the prevalence and severity of non-syndromic pediatric overweight (NSPO) in the United States.

Yet, African-American adolescent females, a subgroup of the population disparately impacted by NSPO, are less likely to engage in regular physical activity. Although multidimensional global self-concept has been identified as a possible predictor of physical activity engagement, dimensional linkage with physical activity engagement among members of this subgroup has yet to be established. This secondary analysis of data from N = 312 urban dwelling African-American adolescent females sought to evaluate the contribution that selected dimensions of global self-concept had on engagement in vigorous physical activity. Findings from a 3-Model hierarchical regression analysis found that in addition to socioeconomic position, several social desirability and competence dimensions of global self-concept were significant predictive contributors to physical activity engagement among members of the study cohort.

Method PROTECT is an innovative online study (www.protect.org.uk) in adults aged 50 and over in the UK, Participants complete annual cognitive assessment and health measures including the PHQ\\\\9 and GAD\\\\7. Participants were divided into three cohorts (Normal Cognition, Stage 2 Early AD and Stage 3 Early AD, based on the FDA framework) using baseline data from the cognitive assessment battery. This analysis utilised data from a total of 5301 participants followed annually over the last 5 years, including the year of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. It also utilises the newly published FLAME composite cognitive measure that has shown sensitivity to cognitive decline.

The three mechanisms are: 1) The lateral ankle mechanism, an active modulation of ankle inversion/eversion in stance; 2) The foot placement mechanism, an active shift of the swing foot placement; and 3) The push-off mechanism, an active modulation of the ankle plantarflexion angle during double stance. Here we seek to determine whether there are changes in neural control of balance when walking at different cadences and speeds. Twenty-one healthy young adults walked on a self-paced treadmill while immersed in a 3D virtual reality cave, and periodically received balance perturbations (bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation) eliciting a perceived fall to the side. Subjects were instructed to match two cadences specified by a metronome, 110bpm (High) and 80bpm (Low), which led to faster and slower gait speeds, respectively. The results indicate that subjects altered the use of the balance mechanisms at different cadences. The lateral ankle mechanism was used more in the Low condition, while the foot placement mechanism was used more in the High condition. There was no difference in the use of the push-off mechanism between cadence conditions. These results suggest that neural control of balance is altered when gait characteristics such as cadence change, suggesting a flexible balance response that is sensitive to the constraints of the gait cycle. We speculate that the use of the balance mechanisms may be a factor resulting in well-known characteristics of gait in populations with compromised balance control, such as slower gait speed in older adults or higher cadence in people with Parkinsons disease.","output":"Walking cadence affects the recruitment of the medial-lateral balance mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: To explore 1) associations between suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, hand washing, smoking status, e-cigarette use, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use and 2) whether COVID-19 has prompted smoking and vaping quit attempts, and more smoking inside the home. Design: Cross-sectional household surveys of a representative sample of the population in England from April-May 2020. Participants: The sample included 3,285 adults aged []18 years. Measurements: Participants who reported they definitely or think they had coronavirus were classified as having a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning home, before eating, before preparing foods or before touching their face. They were also asked whether, due to COVID-19, they had i) attempted to quit smoking, ii) attempted to quit vaping, and iii) changed the amount they smoke inside the home. Findings: Odds of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were significantly greater among current smokers (20.9%, adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]=1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.04-1.73) and long-term (>1-year) ex-smokers (16.1%, ORadj=1.33, 95%CI=1.05-1.68) than never smokers (14.5%). Recent (<1-year) ex-smokers had non-significantly greater odds of suspected infection (22.2%, ORadj=1.50, 95%CI=0.85-2.53, Bayes factor=0.55-1.17). Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out large differences in suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection by NRT use and medium differences by e-cigarette use. With the exception of hand washing before face touching, engagement in hand washing behaviours was high (>85%) regardless of nicotine use.

METHODS: Retrospective single-centre study of 85 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and PE admitted to the Emergency Department (ED). The diagnostic accuracy of each above-mentioned prognostic score was calculated post hoc, and their discriminative power was evaluated through an AUC curve. RESULTS: Among the 85 patients, all-cause death occurred within 7 days for 6 patients (7.1%) and within 30 days for 14 patients (16.5%). Despite being older and having a higher percentage of altered mental status on presentation, non-survivors patients did not differ from survivors regarding comorbidities, traditional risk factors for venous thromboembolism and signs and symptoms at the ED presentation. Each risk stratification tool had modest discriminative power for 7-day mortality (AUC range, 0.601-0.730) with slightly lower discrimination for 30-day mortality (AUC range, 0.543-0.638).

In a 28-hour double-blind randomized crossover study, we investigated to what extent caffeine disturbs slow-wave sleep (SWS) and delays circadian timing in teenagers. Following a 6-day ambulatory phase of caffeine abstinence and fixed sleep-wake-cycles, 18 male teenagers (14-17 years old) ingested 80 mg caffeine vs. placebo in the laboratory four hours prior to an electro-encephalographically (EEG) monitored nighttime sleep episode. Data were analyzed using both frequentist and Bayesian statistics. The analyses suggest that subjective sleepiness is reduced after caffeine compared to placebo. However, we did not observe a substantial influence of the given dose neither on subjective sleep quality nor on SWS, but rather a high inter-individual variability in caffeine-induced SWS changes. Exploratory analyses suggest that particularly those individuals with a higher level of SWS during placebo reduced SWS in response to caffeine. Regarding salivary melatonin onsets, caffeine-induced delays were not evident at group level, and only observed in participants exposed to a higher caffeine dose relative to individual bodyweight (i.e., a dose >1.3mg/kg). Together, the results suggest that 80 mg caffeine are sufficient to induce alertness at a subjective level. However, particularly teenagers with a strong need for deep sleep might pay for these subjective benefits by a loss of SWS during the night.

This resulted in a high rate of mortality, injury, and population displacement with a collapse of the health care system. Furthermore, it was complicated by the emergence of, COVID-19 as a global pandemic which made the population of these countries strive under unusual conditions to tackle both the pandemic and the ongoing wars. The objectives of this study were to determine the impacts and influence of armed conflicts on the epidemiology of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) within these war-torn countries and outline the needed strategies to combat the spread of the pandemic and its upcoming consequences. Methods: The official and public data regarding the dynamics of armed conflict and the spread, of SARS-COV-19 in Libya, Syria, and Yemen were collected from all available sources. Starting from the early emergence of the COVID-19 in each country until the end of December 2020. Datasets were analyzed through a set of statistical techniques and the weekly resolved data were used to probe the link between the intensity levels of the armed conflict and the spread of the pandemic. Results; Data indicated that there is an increase in the intensity of violence levels at an early stage from March to August reached up to two folds in the three countries particularly in Libya. In this violent period, few cases of COVID-19 were reported ranging from 5-53 cases/day. From September to December, a significant decline in the level of the armed conflict was accompanied by steep upsurges in the number of reported COVID-19 cases reached up to 500 cases/day. The highest accumulative cases of COVID-19 were reported in Libya, Syria, and Yemen respectively. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that the armed conflict has provided an opportunity for SARS-COV-19 to spread. At the early weeks of the pandemic that coincided with high levels of the armed conflict few cases were officially reported indicating a vast undercount, which may suggest a hidden mitigating spread at an early stage. Then the pandemic increased immensely as the armed conflict decline to reach the highest by December. A full-blown transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic in these countries is expected. Therefore, urgent national and international strategies should be implemented to combat the pandemic and its upcoming consequences.","output":"The impact of armed conflict on the epidemiological situation of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Libya, Syria, and Yemen."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is widely acknowledged that the experiences of frontline primary health care professionals during COVID-19 are important to understand how they respond and act under situations of pandemic as the gatekeepers in primary health care system. School nurses are primary health care professionals who lead health care in schools and practice in a holistic manner to address the needs of schoolchildren and school personnel. There is rising mental health concerns of frontline health care professionals with anxiety and panic disorders, somatic symptoms and feeling isolated. No studies use a qualitative study approach to document community frontline school nursing professionals experiences and challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, understanding the school nurses experiences and challenges to fight against COVID-19 in the communities is important. PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the experiences of school nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. METHODS: A qualitative study design adopted the principles of thematic analysis. Nineteen school nurses were recruited to participate in individual semi-structured interviews and shared their roles and responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: Three themes indicated the school nurses expand professional responsibilities to fight against COVID-19 emerged from the data analysis. These were Managing Stress, Navigating the School Through the Pandemic, and Raising the Profile of the School Nurse Professional. DISCUSSION: Findings reveal the important role of school nursing professionals in minimising the community-wide risk posed by pandemics and the need to integrate them into planning and implementation of school health policies and guidelines in the primary health care system.

We aimed to investigate whether exogenous l-fucose could be an enteral nutritional supplement to protect intestinal barrier function. The effect of l-fucose on the restoration of epithelial barrier function in both the DSS-induced colitis mouse model and LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells was investigated, and the impact on fucosylation of epithelial cells was examined. The severity of DSS-induced colitis was significantly reduced by l-fucose. Restoration of epithelial barrier function by l-fucose was detected. Direct l-fucose-mediated protection of tight junctions was observed in Caco-2 cells. Moreover, exogenous l-fucose promoted the exogenous metabolic pathway of l-fucose, and fucosylation of epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, knockout of the FUT2 gene restrained fucosylation and the protective effect of l-fucose on barrier function. The severity of colitis was not improved by l-fucose in Fut2 knockout mice. Therefore we conclude that exogenous l-fucose protects intestinal barrier function and relieves intestinal inflammation via upregulation of FUT2-mediated fucosylation of intestinal epithelial cells.","output":"Exogenous l-fucose protects the intestinal mucosal barrier depending on upregulation of FUT2-mediated fucosylation of intestinal epithelial cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guidance is given on ways to reduce the risk of transmission in such circumstances, which includes: additional handwashing and use of hand sanitiser, working side-by-side, or facing away from each other rather than face-to-face if possible, keeping face-to-face contact to 15 minutes or less wherever possible, keeping teams of workers together (cohorting), keeping teams as small as possible, and frequently cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces that are touched regularly Biggs highlights the role that youngstock can play in the epidemiology of TB and the importance of maintaining disease control to prevent the current situation resulting in further disease spread [ ]I would like to thank OVs for their dedication and professionalism during this difficult period in their role as official vets and in their vital task of helping to maintain animal welfare on farms","output":"Andrew soldan, veterinary director of the APHA, responds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia have been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which was caused by a novel coronavirus that had not been previously identified (1).

In most of the studies published GAPD, ACTB or 18S rRNA have been used as a single reference gene without prior verification of their expression stability. Normalization of the data using unstable controls can result in erroneous conclusions, especially when only one reference gene is used. RESULTS: In this study the transcription levels of 8 commonly used reference genes (ACTB, GAPD, Histone H2A, TBP, HPRT1, SDHA, YWHAZ and 18S rRNA) were determined at different preimplantation stages (2-cell, 8-cell, blastocyst and hatched blastocyst) in order to select the most stable genes to normalize quantitative data within different preimplantation embryo stages. CONCLUSION: Using the geNorm application YWHAZ, GAPD and SDHA were found to be the most stable genes across the examined embryonic stages, while the commonly used ACTB was shown to be highly regulated. We recommend the use of the geometric mean of those 3 reference genes as an accurate normalization factor, which allows small expression differences to be reliably measured.","output":"Selection of reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR in bovine preimplantation embryos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In\\\\hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a major public health problem with significant mortality. Rapid cardiopulmonary resuscitation and early defibrillation is extremely connected to patient outcome. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of a basic life support and defibrillation course in improving knowledge in IHCA management. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study recruiting healthcare personnel working at Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana, Pisa, Italy. Study consisted in the administration of two questionnaires before and after BLS-D course. The course was structured as an informative meeting and it was held according to European Resuscitation Council guidelines. RESULTS: 78 participants completed pre- and post-course questionnaires. Only 31.9% of the participants had taken part in a BLS-D before our study. After the course, we found a significative increase in the percentage of participants that evaluated their skills adequate in IHCA management (17.9% vs 42.3%; p < 0.01) and in the correct use of defibrillator (38.8% vs 67.9% p < 0.001). However, 51.3% of respondents still consider their preparation not entirely appropriate after the course. Even more, we observed a significant increase in the number of corrected responses after the course, especially about sequence performed in case of absent vital sign, CPR maneuvers and use of defibrillator. CONCLUSIONS: The training course resulted in significant increase in the level of knowledge about the general management of IHCA in hospital staff. Therefore, a simple intervention such as an informative meetings improved significantly the knowledge about IHCA and, consequently, can lead to a reduction of morbidity and mortality.

Twelve male sprinters received 2 experimental warm-ups: (a) RE (50% heart rate reserve, 2 minutes  5 sets, 1-minute rest interval) with BFR (occlusion pressure: 1.3  resting systolic blood pressure) warm-up, namely RE-BFR; and (b) RE without BFR warm-up, namely RE. Isokinetic strength or 60-m sprint performance was assessed after a 5-minute recovery from each experimental warm-up. All subjects completed 4 exercise trials in a counterbalanced order: (a) RE-BFR-strength; (b) RE-strength; (c) RE-BFR-sprint; and (d) RE-sprint. Muscle activation (during RE), blood lactate (BLa) (pre- and post-REs), heart rate (HR), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) (pre- and post-REs and at a 5-minute recovery) were determined during each experimental warm-up. The isokinetic knee flexor strength and the hamstring-quadriceps (H:Q) ratio observed for the RE-BFR warm-up were significantly higher than those observed for the RE warm-up (p < 0.05). However, no differences (p > 0.05) in the isokinetic knee extensor strength and 60-m sprint performance were observed between the 2 warm-ups. Running exercise-BFR warm-up induced a higher level of vastus lateralis and biceps femoris muscle activation than did RE warm-up (p < 0.05). Furthermore, RE-BFR warm-up induced higher HR, RPE, and BLa values than did RE warm-up after RE and at a 5-minute recovery (p < 0.05). These results suggest that RE-BFR warm-up may augment physiological responses and improve the H:Q ratio and isokinetic knee flexor strength. Thus, RE-BFR warm-up may be considered a practical warm-up strategy for promoting muscle strength and reducing the risk of hamstring injury in male sprinters.","output":"Effects of Running Exercise Combined With Blood Flow Restriction on Strength and Sprint Performance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effects of the outbreak of the coronavirus on our health, our economy, and our societies are being seen and felt around the planet.

METHOD: A systematic literature review is conducted on scientific publications in English language. Articles are eligible if they report a study on user factors affecting ride-sharing use and/or barriers preventing ride-sharing implementation; ride-sharing online platforms in these articles are also recorded and are further explored through their official websites. A database is built that organizes articles per author, year and location, summarizes online platform attributes, and groups user factors associated with the likelihood to ride-share. FINDINGS: The review shows that the term ride-sharing is used in the literature for both profit and non-profit ride-sharing services.

In addition to exploring the demographic and academic factors of the students, it is necessary to identify other attitudes and perceptions that may influence the students patient-centered attitude and inclination toward communication skill learning. This study aimed to assess patient-centered attitudes among dental students in Korea and identify the association between the students characteristics and empathy, communication skill learning attitude, and patient-centered attitude. METHODS: Data were collected via a cross-sectional online survey, and 312 dental students were included in the analyses. The study participants completed the PatientCPractitioner Orientation Scale (PPOS), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS). Analyses were performed using independent samples t-tests, hierarchical multi-variable regression, and ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey test. RESULTS: The students tend to be moderately patient-oriented toward the sharing subscale of PPOS score (M = 3.78, standard deviation [SD] = 0.54) and slightly more patient-centered toward the caring subscale of PPOS score (M = 4.41, SD = 0.52) of patient-centered attitudes.

The proportions of seroconverted employees working in COVID-19 geriatrics and rehabilitation (G&R) wards (32.3%) and non-COVID-19 G&R wards (12.3%) were higher compared to office workers (4.9%) at the last visit. Only nursing assistants had a significantly higher risk of seroconversion compared to office workers (11.7% vs 4.9%; P = .006). Significant risk factors for seroconversion included the use of public transportation (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.25-2.03), known community exposure to severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (2.80; 95% CI, 2.22-3.54), working in a ward with a nosocomial COVID outbreak (2.93; 95% CI, 2.27-3.79), and working in a COVID-19 G&R ward (3.47; 95% CI, 2.45-4.91) or a non-COVID-19 G&R ward (1.96; 95% CI, 1.46-2.63). We observed an association between reported use of respirators and lower risk of seroconversion (0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.96). CONCLUSION: Additional preventive measures should be implemented to protect employees in G&R wards. Randomized trials on the protective effect of respirators are urgently needed.","output":"Severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroconversion and occupational exposure of employees at a Swiss university hospital: A large longitudinal cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to the quarantine of many residents in their homes worldwide. Some of these people might develop mental health problems, and many solutions have been put in place to address the mental health issues of patients and health professionals affected by the disease. However, not much attention has been given to international students studying in China. The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the mental health status of international students from Changsha city, China. Materials and Methods: A WeChat-based survey program comprised of questions on demographic information gender, grade year, duration and status of quarantine, duration of sleep, worries about graduation, being able to go to school and presence or absence of a sense of security;as well as questions from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory(STAI). Results: The prevalence of depression was 59.4% and the prevalence of anxiety was 37.8%. The STAI-Y1 STATE scores had a mean value (mean) of 41.42, standard deviation (S.D) of 10.89 and STAI-Y2 TRAIT scores had a mean value (mean) of 41.85, standard deviation (S.D) of 11.13. The risk factors of anxiety or depression were Sleep duration, worrying about graduation in varying degrees, School time, and feeling secure in varying degrees. Higher the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score and higher Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score and higher STAI-Y1 STATE scores were associated with higher STAI-Y2 TRAIT scores.

Vaccine development itself, however, will not be enough given that a sufficient amount of people will need to be vaccinated for widespread immunity. Vaccine hesitancy is on the rise, varies across countries, and is associated with conspiratorial worldview. Given the rise in COVID-19-related conspiracy theories, we aimed to examine the levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its association with beliefs on the origin of the novel coronavirus in a cross-cultural study. METHODS: We conducted an online survey in the UK (N = 1088) and Turkey (N = 3936), and gathered information on participants' willingness to vaccinate for a potential COVID-19 vaccine, beliefs on the origin of the novel coronavirus, and several behavioural and demographic predictors (such as anxiety, risk perception, government satisfaction levels) that influence vaccination and origin beliefs. RESULTS: In all, 31% of the participants in Turkey and 14% in the UK were unsure about getting themselves vaccinated for a COVID-19 vaccine. In both countries, 3% of the participants rejected to be vaccinated. Also, 54% of the participants in Turkey and 63% in the UK believed in the natural origin of the novel coronavirus. Believing in the natural origin significantly increased the odds of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results point at a concerning level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, especially in Turkey, and suggest that wider communication of the scientific consensus on the origin of the novel coronavirus with the public may help future campaigns targeting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is associated with beliefs on the origin of the novel coronavirus in the UK and Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate change is severely affecting the availability of water and its quality.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All CCP data from our first day of collection on March 26th through July 7th, 2020 are included in this retrospective analysis. Donor and donation data were extracted from NYBC electronic databases. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was initially performed by the NY State Department of Health, and later by NYBC using Ortho and Abbott platforms. RESULTS: CCP donor age and ABO distributions were consistent with reported lower COVID-19 susceptibility in O blood types. CCP versus whole blood donors had similar on-site deferrals, but higher post-donation deferral rates. CCP versus routine plasmapheresis donations had higher vasovagal reactions but similar product rejection rates. Changes in antibody (Ab) test platforms resulted in significant changes in the percent of donors regarded as antibody positive. Donor correlates with higher anti-spike total Ig S/CO ratios were Hispanic ethnicity, overweight body mass index, and longer symptom duration; and with higher anti-nucleocapsid IgG S/CO ratios were male gender, older age, Hispanic ethnicity, and fewer days between symptom onset and first donation. DISCUSSION: We identify donor characteristics not previously reported to correlate with Ab titer.

While global attention to attacks on health workers has increased significantly over the past decade, gaps in research on the lived experiences of frontline staff persist. This study draws on perspectives of frontline health workers in Yemen to understand the impact of the ongoing conflict on their personal and professional lives. Forty-three facility-based health worker interviews, and 6 focus group discussions with community-based health workers and midwives were conducted in Sana'a, Aden and Taiz governorates at the peak of the Yemen conflict. Data were analysed using content analysis methods. Findings highlight the extent and range of violence confronting health workers in Yemen as well as the coping strategies they use to attenuate the impact of acute and chronic stressors resulting from conflict. We find that the complex security situation C characterized by multiple parties to the conflict, politicization of humanitarian aid and constraints in humanitarian access C was coupled with everyday stressors that prevented health workers from carrying out their work. Participants reported sporadic attacks by armed civilians, tensions with patients, and harassment at checkpoints. Working conditions were dire, and participants reported chronic suspension of salaries as well as serious shortages of essential supplies and medicines. Themes specific to coping centered around fatalism and religious motivation, resourcefulness and innovation, and sense of duty and patriotism. Our findings demonstrate that health workers experience substantial stress and face various pressures while delivering lifesaving services in Yemen. While they exhibit considerable resilience and coping, they have needs that remain largely unaddressed. Accordingly, the humanitarian community should direct more attention to responding to the mental health and psychosocial needs of health workers, while actively working to ameliorate the conditions in which they work.","output":"Providing care under extreme adversity: The impact of the Yemen conflict on the personal and professional lives of health workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to COVID-19, a vast number of visualizations have been created to communicate information to the public.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and usability of a family member and a clinician completed home evaluation process using an adapted commercial MagicPlan mobile application (MPMA) and laser distance measurer (LDM). SETTING: An acute inpatient rehabilitation unit and homes in the community. METHODS: MPMA allows users to create floor plans (FPs), which may include virtually inserted pieces of durable medical equipment (DME). The MPMA with an LDM allows users to virtually demonstrate that ordered DME will fit within the measured environments. After training with an online educational module, the family member of someone on the acute inpatient unit (lay participant) went home to measure room dimensions and to create FPs using the MPMA and LDM. After completing the task, lay participants returned the FPs for review by clinicians responsible for ordering DME. RESULTS: Forty-three lay participants and nine clinicians finished the study. Clinicians were satisfied with 75% of the FPs created by the lay participants using version 2 of the educational module. The lay participants and clinicians both thought the MPMA is useful and recommended its use. CONCLUSION: The MPMA with an LDM can be used to virtually complete a home evaluation and to evaluate for the appropriateness of various considered DME.

Variables consistently included were: ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), uterine artery Doppler, pregnancy-associated plasma protein (PAPP-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF). Almost all models had significant concern about risk of bias. Apparent model performance (i.e. in the development dataset) was highest in models developed for use later in pregnancy and including maternal characteristics, and ultrasound and biochemical variables, but few were internally validated and none were externally validated.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the surgical approach on the postoperative morbidities of both minor and major liver resections. METHODS In this multi-institutional study, all patients who underwent open or laparoscopic hepatectomies for hepatocellular adenomas between 1989 and 2013 in 27 European centers were retrospectively reviewed. A multiple imputation model was constructed to manage missing variables. Comparisons of both the overall rate and the types of complications between open and laparoscopic hepatectomy were performed after propensity score adjustment (via the standardized mortality ratio weighting method) on the factors that influenced the choice of the surgical approach. RESULTS The laparoscopic approach was selected in 208 (38%) of the 533 included patients. There were 194 (93%) women. The median age was 38.9 years. After the application of multiple imputation, 208 patients who underwent laparoscopic operations were compared with 216 patients who underwent laparotomic operations. After adjustment, there were 20 (9.6%) major liver resections in the laparoscopy group and 17 (7.9%) in the open group. The conversion rate was 6.3%. The two surgical approaches exhibited similar postoperative morbidity rates and severities. Laparoscopic resection was associated with significantly less blood loss (93 vs. 196 ml, p < 0.001), a less frequent need for pedicle clamping (21 vs. 40%, p = 0.002), a reduced need for transfusion (8 vs. 24 red blood cells units, p < 0.001), and a shorter hospital stay (5 vs. 7 days, p < 0.001).

Identification of GIs in bacterial genomes is an important task since many of them represent inserts that may contribute to bacterial evolution and pathogenesis. In order to characterize and distinguish GIs from rest of the genome, binary classification of islands based on n-gram frequency distribution have been performed. It consists of testing the agreement of islands n-gram frequency distributions with the complete genome and backbone sequence. In addition, a statistic based on the maximal order Markov model is used to identify significantly overrepresented and underrepresented n-grams in islands. The results may be used as a basis for Zipf-like analysis suggesting that some of the n-grams are overrepresented in a subset of islands and underrepresented in the backbone, or vice versa, thus complementing the binary classification. The method is applied to strain-specific regions in the Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933 genome (O-islands), resulting in two groups of O-islands with different n-gram characteristics.

Many biomarkers have been suggested using large observational datasets but sample timing is crucial to ensure prognostic relevance. The DISCOVER study prospectively recruited patients with COVID-19 admitted to a UK hospital and analysed a panel of putative prognostic biomarkers on the admission blood sample to identify markers of poor outcome. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with proven or clinicoradiological suspected COVID-19 were consented. Admission bloods were extracted from the clinical laboratory. A panel of biomarkers (interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), Krebs von den Lungen 6, troponin, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, B-type natriuretic peptide, procalcitonin) were performed in addition to routinely performed markers (C reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio). Age, National Early Warning Score (NEWS2), CURB-65 and radiographic severity score on initial chest radiograph were included as comparators. All biomarkers were tested in logistic regression against a composite outcome of non-invasive ventilation, intensive care admission or death, with area under the curve (AUC) (figures calculated). RESULTS: 187 patients had 28-day outcomes at the time of analysis. CRP (AUC: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.78), lymphocyte count (AUC: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.72) and other routine markers did not predict the primary outcome. IL-6 (AUC: 0.77, 0.65 to 0.88) and suPAR (AUC: 0.81, 0.72 to 0.88) showed some promise, but simple clinical features alone such as NEWS2 score (AUC: 0.70, 0.60 to 0.79) or age (AUC: 0.70, 0.62 to 0.77) performed nearly as well. DISCUSSION: Admission blood biomarkers have only moderate predictive value for predicting COVID-19 outcomes, while simple clinical features such as age and NEWS2 score outperform many biomarkers. IL-6 and suPAR had the best performance, and further studies should focus on the additive value of these biomarkers to routine care.","output":"Predicting outcomes of COVID-19 from admission biomarkers: a prospective UK cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) with the Watchman device is FDA approved for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who have an appropriate indication. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a same-day discharge protocol (SDDP) was employed to improve resource utilization, relieve hospital occupation, and reduce the possible risk of in-hospital virus transmission. OBJECTIVES We sought to analyze the safety, feasibility, and cost effectiveness for SDDP in patients receiving LAAO. METHODS A prospective analysis of 142 consecutive patients, 119 treated prior to SDDP and 23 who underwent SDDP following LAAO with cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA)-guided pre-procedural planning and intracardiac echocardiogram (ICE). Procedures were performed in a single, large academic hospital in the United States. In-hospital and 45-day procedural success, adverse events, length of procedure, and length-of-stay were evaluated. RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics including mean CHA2DS2VASc scores and mean HAS-BLED scores were similar in both groups. All procedures were successful. There was no significant difference in rates of procedural complications or in-hospital adverse events. The mean procedure time in the SDDP group was 11 minutes longer than in the conventional group (62.1  5.9 vs 51.1  21; P=.01). Outcomes at 45-day follow-up were similar. SDDP was associated with a reduced length of stay compared with conventional strategy and a 15% reduction in total costs. CONCLUSIONS Same-day discharge strategy for LAAO appears safe, feasible and could become the new standard approach for LAAO. A protocol including CTA pre-procedural planning, ICE-guided deployment and conscious sedation reduces hospital occupation and lowers costs.","output":"Safety, Efficacy, and Cost-Effectiveness of Same-Day Discharge for Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying globally, more and more people are pinning their hopes on the development of vaccines.

We assessed SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold value (Ct) from the first diagnostic nasalCpharyngeal swab of symptomatic index cases and which demographic or clinical characteristics among cases and contacts are associated with transmission risk within households. METHODS: This is a retrospective prevalence study on secondary SARS-CoV-2 cases (SC) among the household contacts of symptomatic adult index cases randomly sampled from all the SARS-CoV-2-positive diagnostic nasopharyngeal swabs analyzed at our regional referral hospital (Amedeo di Savoia Hospital, Turin, Italy) in March, 2020. Index cases underwent a telephone survey to collect their demographic and clinical data and all their household contacts. The Ct value of RdRp gene from the first diagnostic swab of index cases was recorded and index cases were grouped according to Ct tertiles (A < first tertile, first  B  second tertile, C  second tertile). Post hoc analysis was performed in SC as well as contacts that did not undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing but developed compatible signs and symptoms. Non-parametric tests and generalized linear models were run. RESULTS: Index (n = 72) and contact (n = 164) median age was 54 (48C63) and 32 (20C56) years, respectively. A total of 60, 50, and 54 subjects were contacts of group A, B, and C index cases, respectively; 35.9% of contacts were SC. Twenty-four further subjects (14.6%) met the criteria for symptom-based likely positive SC. The secondary attack rate was 36.0% (28.6C43.4), assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days and a maximum infectious period of 20 days. SC prevalence differed between Ct groups (53.3% A, 32.0% B, 20.4% C; p < 0.001). No difference in SC was found according to sex, presence of signs/symptoms, and COVID-19 severity of index cases, or according to contacts sex and number per household. The age of both index cases [aOR 4.52 (1.2C17.0) for 60 vs. 45 years old] and contacts [aOR 3.66 (1.3C10.6) for 60 vs. 45years old] and the Ct of the index [aOR 0.17 (0.07C0.4) for Ct  31.8 vs. Ct < 24.4] independently associated with SC risk. Sensitivity analysis including symptoms-based likely positive SC supported all the previous results. CONCLUSION: In confined transmission settings such as households, PCR Ct values may inform on the contagiousness of infected subjects and age may modulate transmission/contagion risk.","output":"Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 Contagiousness in Household Contacts of Symptomatic Adult Index Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The publisher regrets that this article has been temporarily removed.

Using a system of differential equations, we define four groups of individuals in a population: susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered. We show that a larger number of initially infected individuals might not only bring the influenza season to an end sooner but also reduce the epidemic size.

The percentage of tests that return a positive result is a metric currently used both as a benchmark of testing adequacy and for assessing the viral spread. However, since the former is a prerequisite for the latter, the interpretation is often conflicting, especially during times of testing scaling-up, or during phases of increasing viral spread. We propose as a benchmark for COVID-19 testing effectiveness a simple metric that creates a link between the cases detected and tests performed, with specific observable outcomes that are actively being monitored in most countries, such as the number of new Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and the number of deaths in the community. This new metric, named \\"Severity Detection Rate\\", or SDR, represents the current number of daily needs for new ICU admissions, per 100 cases detected (t-i) days ago, per 10,000 tests performed (t-i) days ago. Based on the announced COVID-19 monitoring data in Greece from May 2020 until end of January 2021, we show that beyond a threshold of daily testing number, SDR reaches a plateau of weak variability that begins to reflect testing adequacy. Because of this stabilization, it was possible to predict with great accuracy the daily needs for new ICU admissions, 12 days ahead of each testing data point, over a period of 6 months that included the second wave of the pandemic in the country, with Pearson r = 0.99 (p = 10^-180), RMSE = 4,34.

The broad-spectrum inhibitors cathepsin inhibitor III and E-64d gave comparable dose-dependent inhibition of Moloney MLV Env and VSV G pseudotypes, suggesting that the decrease did not involve the envelope protein. Whereas, CA-074 Me gave a biphasic response that differentiated between Moloney MLV Env and VSV G at low concentrations, at which the drug is highly selective for cathepsin B, but was similar for both glycoproteins at higher concentrations, at which CA-074 Me inhibits other cathepsins. Moloney MLV infection was lower on cathepsin B knockout fibroblasts than wild-type cells, whereas VSV G infection was not reduced on the B-/- cells. Taken together, these results support the notion that cathepsin B acts at an envelope-dependent step while another cathepsin acts at an envelope-independent step, such as uncoating or viral-DNA synthesis. Virus binding was not affected by CA-074 Me, whereas syncytium induction was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with cathepsin B involvement in membrane fusion. Western blot analysis revealed specific cathepsin B cleavage of SU in vitro, while TM and CA remained intact. Infection could be enhanced by preincubation of Moloney MLV with cathepsin B, consistent with SU cleavage potentiating infection. These data suggested that during infection of NIH 3T3 cells, endocytosis brings Moloney MLV to early lysosomes, where the virus encounters cellular proteases, including cathepsin B, that cleave SU.","output":"Host cell cathepsins potentiate Moloney murine leukemia virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Different esters were found potential against microorganisms, and could be a better choice to solve the multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogenic global issue due to their improved biological and pharmacokinetic properties.

Here, we studied the ratios of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rates (d N/d S) in protein-coding genes of human RNA and DNA viruses and mammals. Among the 21 RNA viruses studied, 18 showed a genome-average d N/d S from 0.01 to 0.10, indicating that over 90% of nonsynonymous mutations are eliminated by negative selection. Only HIV-1 showed a d N/d S (0.31) higher than that (0.22) in mammalian genes. By comparing the d N/d S values among genes in the same genome and among species or strains, we found that both positive selection and population size play significant roles in the d N/d S variation among genes and species. Indeed, even in flaviviruses and picornaviruses, which showed the lowest ratios among the 21 species studied, positive selection appears to have contributed significantly to d N/d S We found the view that positive selection occurs much more frequently in influenza A subtype H3N2 than subtype H1N1 holds only for the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, but not for other genes. Moreover, we found no support for the view that vector-borne RNA viruses have lower d N/d S ratios than non-vector-borne viruses.

We tested the feasibility of chest X-ray (CXR)-based radiomics metrics to develop machine-learning algorithms for predicting patients with poor outcomes. METHODS: In this Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant, retrospective study, we evaluated CXRs performed around the time of admission from 167 COVID-19 patients. Of the 167 patients, 68 (40.72%) required intensive care during their stay, 45 (26.95%) required intubation, and 25 (14.97%) died. Lung opacities were manually segmented using ITK-SNAP (open-source software). CaPTk (open-source software) was used to perform 2D radiomics analysis. RESULTS: Of all the algorithms considered, the AdaBoost classifier performed the best with AUC = 0.72 to predict the need for intubation, AUC = 0.71 to predict death, and AUC = 0.61 to predict the need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). AdaBoost had similar performance with ElasticNet in predicting the need for admission to ICU. Analysis of the key radiomic metrics that drive model prediction and performance showed the importance of first-order texture metrics compared to other radiomics panel metrics. Using a Venn-diagram analysis, two first-order texture metrics and one second-order texture metric that consistently played an important role in driving model performance in all three outcome predictions were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the quantitative nature and reliability of radiomic metrics, they can be used prospectively as prognostic markers to individualize treatment plans for COVID-19 patients and also assist with healthcare resource management.

METHODS: A deep learning convolutional neural network was trained to assess fundus photographs and predict SD OCT global RNFL thickness measurements. The model was then tested on an independent sample of eyes that had longitudinal follow-up with both fundus photos and SD OCT scans. The ability to detect eyes that had statistically significant slopes of SD OCT change was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The repeatability of RNFL thickness predictions was investigated by measurements obtained from multiple photos that had been acquired during the same day. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between change in predicted RNFL thickness from photos and change in SD OCT RNFL thickness over time. RESULTS: The test sample consisted of 33,466 pairs of fundus photos and SD OCTs collected over 7,125 visits from 1,147 eyes of 717 subjects. Eyes in the test sample were followed for an average of 5.3  3.3 years, with an average of 6.2  3.8 visits. There was a significant correlation between change over time in predicted and observed RNFL thickness (r = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70 C 0.80; P < 0.001). RNFL predictions had ROC curve area of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83 C 0.88) to discriminate progressors from non-progressors. For detecting fast progressors (slope faster than 2m/year), the ROC curve area was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94 C 0.98) with sensitivity of 97% for 80% specificity, and 85% for 90% specificity.

METHODS We searched PubMed and Web of Science up through 15 June 2020 and selected peer-reviewed studies that reported effects of controlled interventions that aimed to improve physicians' sickness certification practice and used SA or RTW among patients as outcome measures. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effect models. RESULTS Of the 1399 identified publications, 12 studies covering 9 interventions were assessed as relevant and included in the review. Most (70%) were from the Netherlands, two had a controlled, and seven a randomized controlled study design. All interventions included some type of training of physicians, and two interventions also included IT-support. Regarding the outcomes of SA/RTW, 30 different effect measures were used. In the meta-analyses, no statistically significant effect in favor of the interventions was observed for having any RTW (i.e. first, partial, or full) nor full RTW. CONCLUSIONS The individual studies showed that physicians' sickness certification practice might be influenced by interventions in both the intended and non-intended direction, however, no statistically significant effect was indicated by the meta-analysis. The included studies varied considerably concerning intervention content and effect measures.KEY POINTSThe knowledge is very limited regarding the content of interventions directed to physician's sickness certification practiceThe identified interventions included some type of training of physicians, and some of them also included IT-support for physiciansThere was a great heterogeneity among the interventions concerning effect measures used regarding return to work among patientsThe individual studies showed that physicians' sickness certification practice might be influenced by interventions in both intended and non-intended directions, however, the overall meta-analysis did not indicate an effect.","output":"Interventions regarding physicians' sickness certification practice - a systematic literature review with meta-analyses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To examine the role of medical, economic and social inequalities affecting the prevalence of COVID-19 in Turkey. Methods: This paper clarifies the medical and socio-economic factors affecting the prevalence of COVID-19 by using clinical and survey data in a binary probit model (BPM). Socio-economic factors affect the prevalence of COVID-19 to different degrees. Socio-economic variables are associated with risk of infection and can increase exposure to and mortality from COVID-19. Results: The factors that increase the probability that a person will get COVID-19 are gender (males have a 9.4% higher probability), income, household work status, interacting with a COVID-19 case (31.4% higher), using public transportation (6.97% higher), and visiting a hospital (35.7% higher probability for individuals who visited a hospital) or a mosque (15.1% higher). The factors that decrease the probability of testing positive are smoking (14.3% lower for smokers), being employed, having a university education compared to no education (24.7% lower), and wearing gloves (15.4% lower). Conclusion: In the case of Turkey, the estimations of the BPM show that economic and social variables are important factors for determining COVID-19 prevalence. Inequalities in socio-economic variables affect the prevalence to different degrees. Disparities in education and poverty are more important than being employed or being a smoker for the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Impact of Socioeconomic Inequalities on the Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Understanding the end-of-life psychosocial needs of cancer patients at home is a knowledge gap. This study describes the trajectory of psychosocial symptoms in the last six months of life among cancer decedents who were receiving home care. METHODS Observational population-based cohort study of cancer decedents who were receiving home care services between 2007 and 2014. Decedents had to have at least 1 home care assessment in the last six months of life for inclusion. Outcomes were the presence of psychosocial symptoms (i.e. anxiety, loneliness, depression, social decline, caregiver distress, and cognitive decline) at each week before death. RESULTS Our cohort included 27,295 unique cancer decedents (30,368 assessments), of which 58% died in hospital. Fifty-six percent were older than 74 and 47% were female. The prevalence of all symptoms increased approaching death, except loneliness. Social decline (48% to 78%) was the most prevalent psychosocial symptom, though loneliness was reported in less than 10% of the cohort. Caregiver distress rose over time from 15% to 27%. A third of the cohort reported issues with cognitive impairment. Multivariate regression showed that physical symptoms such as uncontrolled pain, impairment in Independent Activities of Daily Living, and a high level of health instability all significantly worsened the odds of having a psychosocial symptom in the last 3 months of life. CONCLUSION In this large home care cancer cohort, trajectories of psychosocial symptoms worsened close to death. Physical symptoms, such as uncontrolled pain, were associated with having worse psychosocial symptoms at end of life. This article is protected by copyright.

The decision whether or not to get vaccinated has so far been left to the individual citizens. However, there are good reasons, both in theory as well as in practice, to believe that the willingness to get vaccinated might not be sufficiently high to achieve herd immunity. A policy of mandatory vaccination could ensure high levels of vaccination coverage, but its legitimacy is doubtful. We investigate the willingness to get vaccinated and the reasons for an acceptance (or rejection) of a policy of mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 in June and July 2020 in Germany based on a representative real time survey, a random sub-sample (SOEP-CoV) of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our results show that about 70 percent of adults in Germany would voluntarily get vaccinated against the coronavirus if a vaccine without side effects was available. About half of residents of Germany are in favor, and half against, a policy of mandatory vaccination. The approval rate for mandatory vaccination is significantly higher among those who would get vaccinated voluntarily (around 60 percent) than among those who would not get vaccinated voluntarily (27 percent). The individual willingness to get vaccinated and acceptance of a policy of mandatory vaccination correlates systematically with socio-demographic and psychological characteristics of the respondents. We conclude that as far as peoples declared intentions are concerned, herd immunity could be reached without a policy of mandatory vaccination, but that such a policy might be found acceptable too, were it to become necessary.","output":"Attitudes on voluntary and mandatory vaccination against COVID-19: Evidence from Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cytokine release syndrome with elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels is associated with multiorgan damage and death in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVES: To update data a living systematic review of the literature concerning the efficacy and toxicity of the IL-6 receptor antagonist, tocilizumab, in COVID-19 patients. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus up, preprint servers and Google from October 8, 2020 till February 24, 2021. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies at low or moderate risk of bias. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients. INTERVENTIONS: Tocilizumab versus placebo or standard of care. METHODS: We pooled crude risk ratios (RRs) of RCTs with random effects model and evaluated inconsistency between studies with I(2). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Of 1600 citations, 8 RCTs and 28 cohorts were eligible. The 8 RCTs, at low risk of bias, with 6311 patients examined the effect of tocilizumab on short-term mortality; pooled RR was 0.91 (95%CI 0.78, 1.07, I(2) = 25%). Only the REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY trials with the majority of their patients on concomitant corticosteroids, showed lower 30-day mortality with tocilizumab use, RR 0.74 (95%CI 0.59, 0.93) and 0.89 (95%CI 0.81, 0.97), respectively. Seven RCTs, with 5391 patients examined the effect of tocilizumab on risk of mechanical ventilation; pooled RR was 0.84 (95% CI 0.76, 0.93), I(2) = 0%, with a corresponding number needed to treat of 20 (95%CI 14.3C33.3). Eight RCTs, with 5,340 patients, examined the effect of tocilizumab on a composite of poor outcome; pooled RR was 0.82 (95% CI 0.76, 0.90, I(2) = 3%). Data from the RCTs showed a lower risk of infections and no higher risk of serious adverse events with tocilizumab; pooled RR 0.67 (95%CI 0.45, 0.99, eight RCTs) and 0.85 (95%CI 0.63, 1.16, seven RCTs), respectively. Among 28 cohorts with 15484 patients, the pooled adjusted RR for mortality was 0.53 (95%CI 0.43, 0.67, I(2) = 76%). CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative high certainty evidence shows that tocilizumab reduces the risk of mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Moderate certainty evidence shows that tocilizumab reduces the risk of poor outcome and the risk of secondary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Vaccination coverage is suboptimal in inflammatory bowel disease population. It is of paramount importance to ensure an effective and rapid vaccination program with the adherence of the largest number of well-informed patients. AIMS: We assessed the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among inflammatory bowel disease patients. METHODS: We performed a survey as part of routine practice, between January 8th and February 22nd, 2021. All consecutive adult patients followed at Nancy University Hospital for inflammatory bowel disease were included. Patients completed a self-administered, structured, paper-based questionnaire. Demographic data, medical history, knowledge, and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination were collected. RESULTS: Among the 104 patients who responded to the survey, 57 patients (54.8%) had intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine efficacy, social responsibility, herd immunity, and desire to return to normal life were associated with self-reported willingness to receive a vaccine (20.2%, 20.2%, 11.5%, and 15.4%, respectively). Unknown long-term safety, risk of adverse reaction to vaccine and concern that the vaccine is being developed too quickly were the most commonly reported reasons for non-uptake (27.9%, 15.4%, and 12.5%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Half of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease would like to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. This rate is similar to that reported in the French general population.

In this study, developments in WRULD amongst students in the period 2004-2014 were investigated. Our findings can be a benchmark for future studies, in particular when there are major societal changes as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Differences in time (academic year), how long students have been studying (year of studying), relations with computer time and societal changes were points of interest. METHODS: 2254 students (average age 20.0 years) responded to a questionnaire on WRULD. Students experiencing complaints were further questioned about the severity of complaints and associated body locations. RESULTS: The average percentage of students experiencing complaints was 57%. The highest prevalence rates and severity scores were found in the first and last recorded academic years. The neck, shoulder, back and wrist were most often indicated. The prevalence of complaints raised from the 1st (49%) to the 4th (75%) year of studying. Two seriousness measures showed highest scores in the 5th/6th/7th year of studying. Relations were found between both the prevalence and seriousness of complaints with reported computer time. CONCLUSIONS: After an initial decreasing trend from the academic year 2006/2007 to 2010/2011 there was an increase in WRULD amongst students from 2010/2011 to 2013/2014. Limiting financial and study time factors may have played a role. Structural attention for WRULD prevention and risk factors seems to be effective in reducing prevalence and severity of WRULD.

Yet, the primary testing tool, the RT-qPCR based testing, is notoriously known for its low sensitivity, i.e. high risk of missed detection of carriers. Quantifying the false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-qPCR test at the community settings and its dependence on patient demographic and disease progression is therefore key in designing and refining strategies for disease spread prevention. Methods Analyzing 843,917 test results of 521,696 patients, we identified false-negative (FN) and true-positive (TP) results as negative and positive results preceded by a COVID-19 diagnosis and followed by a later positive test. Regression analyses were used to determine associations of false-negative results with time of sampling after diagnosis, patient demographics and viral loads based on RT-qPCR Ct values of the next positive tests. Findings The overall FNR was 22.8%, which is consistent with previous studies. Yet, this rate was much lower at the first 5 days following diagnosis (10.7%) and only increased in later dates. Furthermore, the FNR was strongly associated with demographics, with odds ratio of 1.74 (95% CI: 1.58-1.9) for women over men and 2.54 (95% CI: 2.39-2.69) for a 20 versus a 50 year old patient. Finally, FNR was associated with viral loads (p-value 0.002), with a difference of 1.1 (95% CI: 0.60-1.57) between the average Ct of the N gene in a positive test following a false-negative compared to a positive test following a true-positive. Interpretation Our results show that in the first few days following diagnosis, when results are critical for quarantine decisions, RT-qPCR testing is more reliable than previously reported. Yet the reliability of the test result is reduced in later days as well as for women and younger patients, where the viral loads are typically lower.

As a result of the pandemic, many older adults are now experiencing an increased and unprecedented amount of psychological stress. Physical activity has been found to be an evidence-based means of combating stress among older adults to promote their quality of life. Studies have demonstrated that those who are physically active experience fewer issues in regard to their mental health, specifically depression and anxiety disorders. Engagement in physical activity may exert a protective influence over stress inducing events and future mental health outcomes. Due to exercise being inexpensive, non-invasive, and effective even via incremental increases in activity level, physical activity interventions should be investigated as a therapy for reducing stress for older adults during the current pandemic. METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and SportDiscus) will be searched to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity or exercise programs as a psychological stress management tool in adults 50 years of age or older. Only peer-reviewed and published journal articles will be reviewed. Post-intervention psychological stress measures in comparison to baseline stress will be the primary outcome of interest. All studies will be assessed for bias using Cochranes risk of bias tool. A random effects meta-analysis will be investigated if sufficient evidence of homogenous research exists and the heterogeneity of effect sizes will be tabulated. DISCUSSION: This review will determine the effectiveness of various physical activity interventions for the treatment of psychological stress among the older adult population. This knowledge will help inform care aides, clinicians, family members, and older adults themselves of the most effective physical activity interventions in dealing with stress which is relevant to the ongoing pandemic.

This study also aims to assess the effect on rectal radiation dose of prostate-rectum separation in various anatomic planes. Methods and Materials Seventy-two consecutive prostate cancer patients undergoing conventionally fractionated pencil beam scanning proton radiation therapy with and without hydrogel placement were compared. Magnetic resonance images taken after hydrogel placement measured prostate-rectum separation and were correlated to rectal dosing and rectal toxicity. Univariate analysis of clinical variables and radiation dosing was conducted using nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test with continuity correction between groups (hydrogel spacer vs controls). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient assessed relationships between the various anatomic dimensions of perirectal space and rectal radiation dosing. Results Fifty-one patients had hydrogel placement before therapy and 21 did not. There was a 42.2% reduction in rectal dosing (mL3 rectum) in hydrogel patients (P < .001). Increasing midline sagittal lift resulted in a greater mitigation of total rectal dose (P = .031). The degree of prostate surface area coverage on coronal plane did not correlate with further reductions in rectal radiation dose (P = .673). Patients who had PEG hydrogels placed reported more rectal side effects during treatment compared with those patients who did not (35.3% vs 9.5%, P = .061). At median 9.5-month follow-up, there was no difference in reporting of grade 2 rectal toxicity between the 2 groups (7.7% vs 7.1%, P = .145). Conclusions Polyethylene glycol hydrogel placement before pencil proton beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer reduced rectal radiation dose. The most important factor reducing total rectal dose was the degree of sagittal midline separation created by the PEG hydrogel.

This sentiment analysis helped to compute metric variables. The I-score represents the extent of portrayals of Muslims in a particular news story. The next step is to calculate the canonical correlation between video transcripts and their respective responses, explaining the relationship between news portrayal and hate speech.

Beliefs regarding (quitting) smoking and (consequences of) the coronavirus are described and associations with motivation to quit due to the coronavirus are reported. RESULTS: While 67.7% of the smokers indicated that the coronavirus did not influence the number of cigarettes smoked per day, 18.5% smoked less cigarettes and 13.8% smoked more cigarettes per day due to the coronavirus. One-third of the smokers were more motivated to quit smoking due to the coronavirus. Motivation to quit due to the coronavirus was positively associated with beliefs about the coronavirus as a serious threat, being at high risk of catching the coronavirus and developing severe illness, smokers being at higher risk than non-smokers, quitting smoking to reduce complaints, the social environment endorsing quitting, and perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of smokers may be receptive to smoking cessation advice due to COVID-19.

The worldwide pandemic caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has led to an unprecedented burden on hospital structures, posing new challenges in terms of reshaping healthcare services. At the same time, the so-called lockdown restrictions have decreased overall mobility, thereby challenging the traditional concept of clinical examination. Moreover, the need for security for both patients and healthcare personnel has posed a further limitation to face-to-face meeting. Telemedicine has provided a valuable solution for such issues, allowing the evaluation of oral and maxillofacial surgery patients through technological interfaces, restricting physical consultations to cases with high clinical priority, intercepting suspects, and maintaining contact with discharged patients. Thanks to the experience gained during the previous wave of infections, the purpose of this study was to present a reorganization of clinical services for oral and maxillofacial surgery in order to help cope with the latest COVID-19 resurgence. Materials and methods. Using commonly available software for telecommunications and online meetings, the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the University Hospital of Udine has reshaped the organization of healthcare services, with telemedicine central to the continuity of assistance, while at the same time minimizing the risk of exposure for both patients and operators. Additionally, the high number of patients evaluated through telemedicine improved our ability to define signs and symptoms of diseases using informatic tools, thus allowing the introduction of the concept of telesemiology. Results. During our previous lockdown experience, between March and April 2020, 78 patients were evaluated using teleconsultation. All outpatient examinations were rescheduled and translated into a virtual platform, allowing each patient to undergo evaluation in the most appropriate setting. Special attention was paid to the follow-up of oncological patients. The rehabilitation team represented a crucial element in maintaining contact with more complex patients in this crucial time. Conclusions. This study was based on our previous lockdown experience C a situation that many will be facing again over the coming months.

In order to improve the subsequent control of COVID-19, it is essential to conduct a study on measuring and predicting the scale of the outbreak in the future. METHODS: This paper uses rolling mechanism and grid search to find the best fractional order of Fractional Order Accumulation Grey Model (FGM). Buffer level is proposed based on the general form of weakening buffer operator to measure the effect of government control measurements on the epidemic. And the buffer level is associated with the Government Response Stringency index and the Mobility Index. RESULTS: Firstly, the model proposed in this paper dominates the ARIMA model which has been widely used in predicting the confirmed COVID-19 cases. Secondly, in the process of using the buffer level to modify the FGM, this paper finds that government measurements require the active cooperation of the public and often have a time lag when they are effective. Only when government increase its stringency and the public observe the order can the spread of COVID-19 be slowed down. If there is only the controlling measure and the public does not react actively, it will not slow down the epidemic. Thirdly, according to the Mobility Index and Government Response Stringency Index in December, this paper predicts the cumulative confirmed cases of the end of January in different scenarios according to different buffer levels. The study suggests that the world should continue to maintain high vigilance and take corresponding control measures for the outbreak of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Governments control measures and publics abidance are both important in this battle with COVID-19. Governments control measures have time-lag effect and the time lag is about 9 days. When the government increases its stringency and the public cooperates with the government, we must consider the weaken buffer operator with proper buffer level in the prediction process. These prediction methods can be considered in the prediction of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the future or the trend of other epidemics.","output":"Forecasting the Trend of COVID-19 Considering the Impacts of Public Health Interventions: An Application of FGM and Buffer Level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge, once acquired, cannot easily be reversed In theory, of course, knowledge can be lost when everyone who possesses it dies and there are no stored-up copies in books or models If important knowledge is sufficiently diffused and accessible, however, it becomes increasingly unlikely that any invention will ever be \\"lost \\" Hence, although wars and natural catastrophes can disrupt markets, commercial life, and the international economy, they rarely cause much erosion of the knowledge base that made an economy prosperous and productive in the first place Market economies and the international division of labor, once disrupted, can be repaired fairly quickly and economies can bounce back--if the suitable institutions such as law and order, peace, and effective contract enforcement are in place","output":"Why Our Knowledge Economy Can Survive the New Age of Pestilence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the genus Betacoronavirus and the Coronaviridiae family responsible for infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and more recently, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

Here we review the literature regarding the mechanism of inflammasome activation by CoV infection, the role of the inflammasome in ARDS, ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) as well as the potential mechanism by which the inflammasome may contribute to the damaging effects of inflammation in the cardiac, renal, digestive, and nervous systems in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The Inflammasome in Times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solar evaporation, which enables water purification without consuming fossil fuel, has been considered the most promising strategy to address global drinkable water scarcity.

It has long been recognised that some patients have such significant clinical and/or risk needs that those needs cannot be adequately met within standard service delivery models, resulting in a pressing need to consider the best models for this group of people. This paper shares a protocol for a mixed methods study that aims to understand: the profile and history of service users described as having complex needs; the decision-making processes by clinicians that lead to complex needs categorisation; service users and carers experience of service use; and, associated economic impact. This protocol describes a comprehensive evaluation that aims to inform an evidence-based service delivery model for people with complex needs. Methods We will use a mixed methods design, combining quantitative and qualitative methods using in-depth descriptive and inferential analysis of patient records, written medical notes and in-depth interviews with service users, carers, and clinicians. The study will include five components: (1) a quantitative description and analysis of the demographic clinical characteristics of the patient group; (2) an economic evaluation of alternative patient pathways; (3) semi-structured interviews about service user and carer experiences; (4) using data from components 1-3 to co-produce vignettes jointly with relevant stakeholders involved in the care of service users with complex mental health needs; and, (5) semi-structured interviews about clinical decision-making by clinicians in relation to this patient group, using the vignettes as example case studies. Discussion The studys key outcomes will be to: examine the resource use and cost-impact associated with alternative care pathways to the NHS and other sectors of the economy (including social care); explore patient health and non-health outcomes associated with alternative care pathways; and, gain an understanding of a complex service user group and how treatment decisions are made to inform consistent and person-centred future service delivery.","output":"COMplex mental health PAThways (COMPAT) Study: a mixed methods study to inform an evidence-based service delivery model for people with complex needs: Study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this piece I argue that the pandemic with its emphasis on social distancing as a desirable civic norm can reconfigure popular understanding of mature female singlehood in India- a condition that is often described in the language of lacks and social failures The pandemic, I argue, has reaffirmed the everyday practices of upper middle-class professional women (ages 50C60 years) lending them as positive agentic subjects who are invested in self-actualization and an appreciation of intimate solitude Overall, by specifically focusing on subjectivities and social aspirations of my interlocutors during the pandemic, I illuminate ways in which middle aged selfhood is lived in all its fragility, ambivalence and emergent possibilities ? 2020 Elsevier Inc","output":"Living solo at midlife: Can the pandemic de-stigmatize living alone in India?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intense competition for resources to combat COVID-19 has greatly reduced access to health care for patients with other diseases.

A minimally invasive surgical (MIS) approach offers several advantages to an open approach (O-IDS), especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic, but data regarding outcomes are limited. We sought to compare the surgical and oncologic outcomes of MIS and O-IDS in patients (pts) with advanced EOC. All consecutive patients with stages III to IV EOC who underwent NAC followed by IDS from 2008-2018 at 3 tertiary care centers were included in this retrospective cohort study. Demographic, clinical, and pathologic factors were abstracted from electronic medical records. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed on a Kaplan-Meier estimator using the log-rank method, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for univariate and multivariate survival analyses. [Display omitted] A total of 415 pts underwent IDS through MIS (n=122;robotic = 78, laparoscopic = 44), or O-IDS (n=293). There were no statistically significant differences between age at diagnosis (O-IDS 63.2, MIS 65.3;p=0.1), stage (p=0.3), and grade (p=0.06). There were also no differences between CA-125 levels measured at diagnosis (O-IDS 3145 U/mL, MIS 2247 U/mL;p=0.2) or after completion of NACT (O-IDS 251.7 U/mL, MIS 179.1 U/mL;p=0.4) between the 2 groups. MIS was completed without conversion in 84 of 122 patients (68.8%), with most conversions occurring in the robotic group. Patients undergoing MIS had significantly fewer complex surgeries, with 81% of the cases categorized as low complexity when scored using the Aletti SCS, compared to 64% of open surgeries (p<0.001). Patients undergoing open surgeries had significantly higher estimated blood loss (EBL;326.2cc vs 181.5cc;p<0.001) and intraoperative transfusion rate (25% vs 4%;p<0.001). These patients also had a longer hospital length of stay (5.9 days vs 2.2 days;p<0.001) as well as 30-day postoperative complication rate (43% vs 20%, p<0.001). There were no observed differences between the 2 groups in terms of operative time (191.1 minutes vs 196.3 minutes;p=0.5) and 30-day hospital readmission rates (10% vs 6%;p=0.2). With regard to surgical cytoreduction, patients undergoing MIS had significantly higher rates of both R0 (66% vs 46%;p<0.001) and optimal, or R0/R1 (93% vs 84%;p=0.02) debulking rates. Patients undergoing open surgery trended towards having a higher rate of recurrence at 24 months after diagnosis, but this difference did not reach significance (70% vs 60%;p=0.06). Finally, there were no differences in the 2 groups in terms of PFS or OS (Figure 2). Median PFS was 15.1 months for O-IDS and 18.2 months for MIS (p=0.051). Median OS was 36.7 months for O-IDS and 40.9 months for MIS (p=0.5). MIS is a feasible and potentially effective mode of IDS after NAC in patients with advanced EOC. Surgical outcomes appear to be advantageous in MIS compared with O-IDS, and oncologic outcomes appear to be no different. Further investigation of robotic MIS compared with laparoscopic MIS for IDS is warranted.

Frontal EEG patterns are reported to be a characteristic finding in COVID-19 encephalopathy. Although several reports of EEG abnormalities are available, there is lack of clarity about typical findings. METHODS: Research databases were queried with the terms \\"COVID\\" OR \\"coronavirus\\" OR \\"SARS\\" AND \\"EEG\\". Available data was analyzed from 617 patients with EEG findings reported in 84 studies. RESULTS: The median age was 61.3 years (IQR 45-69, 33.3 % female). Common EEG indications were altered mental status (61.7 %), seizure-like events (31.2 %), and cardiac arrest (3.5 %). Abnormal EEG findings (n = 543, 88.0 %) were sub-classified into three groups: (1) Background abnormalities: diffuse slowing (n = 423, 68.6 %), focal slowing (n = 105, 17.0 %), and absent posterior dominant rhythm (n = 63, 10.2 %). (2) Periodic and rhythmic EEG patterns: generalized periodic discharges (n = 35, 5.7 %), lateralized/multifocal periodic discharges (n = 24, 3.9 %), generalized rhythmic activity (n = 32, 5.2 %). (3) Epileptiform changes: focal (n = 35, 5.7 %), generalized (n = 27, 4.4 %), seizures/status epilepticus (n = 34, 5.5 %). Frontal EEG patterns comprised of approximately a third of all findings. In studies that utilized continuous EEG, 96.8 % (n = 243) of the 251 patients were reported to have abnormalities compared to 85.0 % (n = 311) patients who did not undergo continuous EEG monitoring (&#967;2 = 22.8, p =< 0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: EEG abnormalities are common in COVID-19 related encephalopathy and correlates with disease severity, preexisting neurological conditions including epilepsy and prolonged EEG monitoring.

To promote physical activity (PA) effectively, it is necessary to consider structural influences. Previous research has shown the relevance of the built environment. However, sex/gender differences have yet not been considered. The aim of this systematic review was to identify built environmental determinants of PA by taking sex/gender into account. METHODS A systematic literature search was carried out using six electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, SportDiscus, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Knowledge) to identify studies analyzing the effect of changes in the built environment on PA, taking sex/gender into account. To be included, studies had to be based on quantitative data and a longitudinal study design. Changes in the built environment had to be objectively assessed. The methodological quality of the studies was examined using the QualSyst tool for examining risk of bias. RESULTS In total, 36 studies published since 2000 were included in this review. The data synthesis revealed that the majority of reviewed studies found the built environment to be a determinant of PA behavior for both, males and females, in a similar way. Creating a new infrastructure for walking, cycling, and public transportation showed a positive effect on PA behavior. Findings were most consistent for the availability of public transport, which was positively associated with overall PA and walking. The improvement of walking and cycling infrastructure had no effect on the overall level of PA, but it attracted more users and had a positive effect on active transportation. In women, the availability of public transport, safe cycling lanes, housing density, and the distance to daily destinations proved to be more relevant with regard to their PA behavior. In men, street network characteristics and road environment, such as intersection connectivity, local road density, and the presence of dead-end roads, were more important determinants of PA. CONCLUSION This review sheds light on the relevance of the built environment on PA. By focusing on sex/gender differences, a new aspect was addressed that should be further analyzed in future research and considered by urban planners and other practitioners.","output":"Effects of the built environment on physical activity: a systematic review of longitudinal studies taking sex/gender into account."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be transmitted from organ donor to recipient, but details of transmission events are not widely published.

The four transfected cell lines shown to express pAPN at their membrane became sensitive to infection. Two of these cell lines were found to be defective for the production of viral particles. This suggests that other factor(s) than pAPN expression may be involved in the production of infectious virions. The pAPN-transfected cells were also tested for their susceptibility to several viruses which have a close antigenic relationship to TGEV. So far, we failed to evidence permissivity to the feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus FIPV and canine coronavirus CCV.

This study found that dogs spontaneously generalized within a 10-fold concentration range lower than the training stimulus. Further, dogs could be trained to discriminate between concentrations within that 10-fold range. However, discrimination training did not affect dogs spontaneous generalization to the odor concentration unless discrimination training occurred in compound with generalization testing, suggesting that relative stimulus control of the target and non-target concentrations might be important in determining whether dogs will respond. ABSTRACT: Despite dogs widespread use as detection systems, little is known about how dogs generalize to variations of an odorants concentration. Further, it is unclear whether dogs can be trained to discriminate between similar concentration variations of an odorant. Four dogs were trained to an odorant (0.01 air dilution of isoamyl acetate) in an air-dilution olfactometer, and we assessed spontaneous generalization to a range of concentrations lower than the training stimulus (Generalization Test 1). Dogs generalized to odors within a 10-fold range of the training odorant. Next, we conducted discrimination training to suppress responses to concentrations lower than a concentration dogs showed initial responding towards in Generalization Test 1 (0.0025 air dilution). Dogs successfully discriminated between 0.0025 and 0.01, exceeding 90% accuracy. However, when a second generalization test was conducted (Generalization Test 2), responding at the 0.0025 concentration immediately recovered and was no different than in Generalization Test 1. Dogs were then tested in another generalization test (Compound Discrimination and Generalization) in which generalization probes were embedded within discrimination trials, and dogs showed suppression of responding to the 0.0025 concentration and lower concentrations in this preparation. These data suggest dogs show limited spontaneous generalization across odor concentration and that dogs can be trained to discriminate between similar concentrations of the same odorant. Stimulus control, however, may depend on the negative stimulus, suggesting olfactory concentration generalization may depend on relative stimulus control. These results highlight the importance of considering odor concentration as a dimension for generalization in canine olfactory research.","output":"Stimulus Control of Odorant Concentration: Pilot Study of Generalization and Discrimination of Odor Concentration in Canines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Healthcare workers (HCW's) who have contracted the disease while working in the hospital may have a deep psychological impact in the form of depression and anxiety, along with the stress of passing the infection to their family members.

Two 2-dose mRNA vaccines, mRNA-1273 from Moderna and BNT162b2 from Pfizer-BioNTech, received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020 for persons aged 18 years and aged 16 years, respectively. A 1-dose viral vector vaccine (Ad26.COV2 from Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) received EUA in February 2021 for persons aged 18 years (3). The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine received FDA approval for persons aged 16 years on August 23, 2021 (4). Current guidelines from FDA and CDC recommend vaccination of eligible persons with one of these three products, without preference for any specific vaccine (4,5). To assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) of these three products in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization, CDC and collaborators conducted a case-control analysis among 3,689 adults aged 18 years who were hospitalized at 21 U.S. hospitals across 18 states during March 11-August 15, 2021. An additional analysis compared serum antibody levels (anti-spike immunoglobulin G [IgG] and anti-receptor binding domain [RBD] IgG) to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among 100 healthy volunteers enrolled at three hospitals 2-6 weeks after full vaccination with the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Patients with immunocompromising conditions were excluded. VE against COVID-19 hospitalizations was higher for the Moderna vaccine (93%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 91%-95%) than for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (88%; 95% CI = 85%-91%) (p = 0.011); VE for both mRNA vaccines was higher than that for the Janssen vaccine (71%; 95% CI = 56%-81%) (all p<0.001). Protection for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine declined 4 months after vaccination. Postvaccination anti-spike IgG and anti-RBD IgG levels were significantly lower in persons vaccinated with the Janssen vaccine than the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.

The aim of the research is to assess nurses level of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and their sense of self-efficacy, and to learn what coping strategies they use. METHODOLOGY/METHODS: The study was carried out online and based on the diagnostic poll method, using an original survey questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES 10C40), the Mini-COPE questionnaire (0C3), and the Perceived Stress Scale PSS-10 (0C40). The respondent group was made up of nurses (n = 220) who provide health services in inpatient and outpatient health care institutions in the northeastern region of Poland. The statistical analysis was performed using the STATISTICA 13.0 package (StatSoft). The distribution of variables was checked with Shapiro-Wilk tests. The MannCWhitney U test was used to compare two independent samples, while the KruskalCWallis test was used to compare more samples. The adopted statistical significance level was p < 0.05. Multivariate regression analysis was applied to determine which factors were related to the level of stress. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 43.3 years. The vast majority were women (96.4). The mean work experience of the nurses was over 20 years (58.2%). A total of 62.3% worked directly with patients in hospitals, including 11.8% respondents working at COVID-19 units and 37.7% working at primary care institutions. The analyses show that the respondents represented a high level of stress (PSS-10 C 20.9), related to their work experience as a nurse ( ?0.250, p = 0.014), the number of hours worked a month ( 0.156, p = 0.015), and self-assessed health status ( ?0.145, p = 0.037). They declared an average sense of self-efficacy (GSES C 29.1), which significantly depended on the nurses places of employment (p = 0.044). Out of stress coping strategies (Mini-COPE), the younger nurses mentioned venting (p = 0.010), instrumental support (p = 0.011), sense of humour (p = 0.013) and self-blame (0.031). Practice nurses also chose the strategy of behavioral disengagement (p = 0.032), and nurse managers chose the strategy of planning (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to implement some strategies to protect nurses mental health and to take extensive prevention measures in critical situations. Special attention should be given to nurses who are younger and have shorter work experience. It is also important to monitor nurses working time and health status, and those who work at outpatient health care institutions should be given more support and information.","output":"Stress coping strategies used by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism on Underrepresented Minority (URM) students pursuing higher education in the STEM fields. Given the ongoing pandemic and the wave of protests in response to a series of police brutalities and systemic racism, URM students were thrown into uncharted territory. We reached out to a group of Black and Latino students who were already engaged in STEM. We began surveys and interviews by asking participants how they were and how their family and communities were doing. Next, participants answered questions about academic progress, challenges, and what support would be helpful. Our framework was based on a mixed-methods approach that draws on the work of Michael Patton (Qualitative Research & Evaluation Methods: Integrating Theory and Practice, 2014) and Veronica Thomas (American Journal of Evaluation, 2016, 38 (1), 7C28). Qualitative data from interviews were collected to capture perceptions, experiences, and recommendations of the study participants. Survey data were collected to reach as many students as possible and to provide numerical self-assessments of student experience, progression, and obstacles. All qualitative data were coded thematically using Atlas. ti, with the goal of illuminating emerging themes, and quantitative data were reviewed using descriptive statistics. Themes emerging from both data sets were compared, contrasted, and integrated in order to develop consistent findings that would enhance URM student perseverance and persistence in the face of confounding adversities. This study shows that ILSAMP COVID-19 Study participants maintained a commitment to pursuing a career in STEM. The findings of this study also indicate that the participants are stressed by their immediate circumstances and by the ongoing racism of U.S. society. These students ask for additional financial, academic, and networking support during the disruptions caused by the pandemic. More specifically, students request continued advising and connection with STEM professionals who can help them envision and enact a pathway to their own careers in STEM during this tumultuous period.

However, it could be difficult to rapidly identify by human inspection anomalous area in CT images belonging to the COVID-19 disease. Hence, it becomes necessary the exploitation of suitable automatic algorithms able to quick and precisely identify the disease, possibly by using few labeled input data, because large amounts of CT scans are not usually available for the COVID-19 disease. The method proposed in this paper is based on the exploitation of the compact and meaningful hidden representation provided by a Deep Denoising Convolutional Autoencoder (DDCAE). Specifically, the proposed DDCAE, trained on some target CT scans in an unsupervised way, is used to build up a robust statistical representation generating a target histogram. A suitable statistical distance measures how this target histogram is far from a companion histogram evaluated on an unknown test scan: if this distance is greater of a threshold, the test image is labeled as anomaly, i.e. the scan belongs to a patient affected by COVID-19 disease. Some experimental results and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods show the effectiveness of the proposed approach reaching a top accuracy of 100% and similar high values for other metrics. In conclusion, by using a statistical representation of the hidden features provided by DDCAEs, the developed architecture is able to differentiate COVID-19 from normal and pneumonia scans with high reliability and at low computational cost.","output":"A novel unsupervised approach based on the hidden features of Deep Denoising Autoencoders for COVID-19 disease detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common problems in healthcare and are typically related to patient, provider, and socioeconomic factors.

The World Health Organization estimates that the prevalence of disabling hearing loss will increase to over 900 million people by 2050. Many cases of congenital hearing loss are triggered by viral infections during different stages of pregnancy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which viruses induce hearing loss are not sufficiently explored, especially cases that are of embryonic origins. The present review first describes the cellular and molecular characteristics of the auditory system development at early stages of embryogenesis. These developmental hallmarks, which initiate upon axial specification of the otic placode as the primary root of the inner ear morphogenesis, involve the stage-specific regulation of several molecules and pathways, such as retinoic acid signaling, Sonic hedgehog, and Wnt. Different RNA and DNA viruses contributing to congenital and acquired hearing loss are then discussed in terms of their potential effects on the expression of molecules that control the formation of the auditory and vestibular compartments following otic vesicle differentiation. Among these viruses, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus appear to have the most effect upon initial molecular determinants of inner ear development. Moreover, of the molecules governing the inner ear development at initial stages, SOX2, FGFR3, and CDKN1B are more affected by viruses causing either congenital or acquired hearing loss. Abnormalities in the function or expression of these molecules influence processes like cochlear development and production of inner ear hair and supporting cells. Nevertheless, because most of such virusChost interactions were studied in unrelated tissues, further validations are needed to confirm whether these viruses can mediate the same effects in physiologically relevant models simulating otic vesicle specification and growth.","output":"Embryonic Origins of Virus-Induced Hearing Loss: Overview of Molecular Etiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gaze control is a substitution for disabled people to play computer games.

Samples were tested for multiple pathogens.A high incidence (27/81, 33%) of co-infection in children with COVID-19 was revealed. The most frequent co-infected pathogen was mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP, 20/81, 25%), followed by virus (6/81, 7%), and bacteria (4/81, 5%). No significant difference in clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, or hospital stay was observed between the patients with co-infections and those with monomicrobial, only lower in white blood cell counts (CI: 5.54aa0.36 vs SI: 7.38aa0.37, Pa=a.002), neutrophil counts (CI: 2.20aa0.20 vs SI: 2.92aa0.23, Pa=a.024) and lymphocyte counts (CI: 2.72aa0.024 vs SI: 3.87aa0.28, Pa=a.006).

This study, then, examined the ability of personal and environmental variables to predict telemedicine adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 230 physicians practicing in the U.S. completed questions concerning personal and environmental characteristics, as well as telemedicine use at three time points: pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated future use. Associations between use and characteristics were determined to identify factors important for telemedicine use. Physicians reported that telemedicine accounted for 3.72% of clinical work prior to the pandemic, 46.03% during the pandemic, and predicted 25.44% after the pandemic ends. Physicians within hospitals reported less increase in telemedicine use during the pandemic than within group practice (p = 0.016) and less increase in use at hospitals compared to academic medical centers (p = 0.027) and group practice (p = 0.008). Greater telemedicine use was associated with more years in practice (p = 0.009), supportive organizational policies (p = 0.001), organizational encouragement (p = 0.003), expectations of greater patient volume (p = 0.003), and perceived higher quality of patient care (p = 0.032). Characteristics such as gender, number of physicians, and level of telemedicine training were not significant predictors. Organizations interested in supporting physicians to adopt telemedicine should encourage its use and create policies supporting its use. More senior physicians had a greater degree of telemedicine uptake, while training programs did not predict use, suggesting that efforts to develop telemedicine competency in younger physicians may be ineffective and should be re-examined.","output":"Changes in Physician Telemedicine Use during COVID-19: Effects of Practice Setting, Demographics, Training, and Organizational Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ayurved is a holistic science which mainly emphasizes on the preventive aspect of diseases and ill-health The concept of communicable disease is mentioned under the concept of Janapadhodhwamsa Rasayan therapy plays a very key role in the prevention of communicable diseases An attempt has been made to establish a co-relation between the Ayurvedic concept and the current most prevelant communicable diseases and their categorization under the pranavaha srotas, Annavaha srotas, Udakvaha srotas, Rasa and Rak-tavaha srotas In the present scenario, increased urbanization and modified lifestyle has led to derangement of agni This deranged agni has led to compromised immunity, which itself serves as a cause and provoking factor for many infectious diseases In todays context, the whole world is facing the communicable and infectious pandemic, termed Covid-19 No any specific treatment modality is been established till date In the view of lack of any treatment modality and vaccine availability, focus is been given on enhancing the immunity and maintaining good health status is been laid By maintaining good immunity and health, we can protect ourselves from this infectious disease and also prognosis of the patients will also be good, who are with co-morbid conditions Thus now emphasis is laid to improve the immunity by techniques such as Rasayan Chikitsa","output":"Efficacy of Rasayan in the prevention of communicable diseases (Janapadhodhwamsa)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Qualitative studies have identified a diverse array of motivations for purchasing items within video games through chance-based mechanisms (i.e., loot boxes).

Shortage of testing kits and Intensive-Care-Unit (ICU) beds for critical patients have become a norm in most developing countries. This has prompted the need to rapidly identify the COVID-19 patients to stop the spread of the virus and also to find critical patients. The latter is imperative for determining the state of critically ill patients as quickly as possible. This will lower the number of deaths from the infection. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based smartphone application for the early prognosis of COVID-19 infected patients and also predict their mortality risk using their symptoms. Moreover, we heuristically identified the most important symptoms necessary for making such predictions. We have successfully reduced the number of features by almost half for the prognosis and by more than a third for forecasting the mortality risk, compared to the contemporary studies.

Multiple infection control techniques and strategies simultaneously (bundling) may offer the best opportunity to reduce the morbidity and mortality toll of HAIs. Most of these infection control strategies will more than pay for themselves by saving the medical costs associated with nosocomial infections.

This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats. Environmental management through ecosystem services has a relevant role in exposing and spreading infectious diseases, reduction of pollutants, and control of climatic factors. Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, they can have an additive and enhancing role in viral diseases. Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported. Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19. Some climatic factors have been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Yet, it is not well established if climatic factors might have a cause-effect relationship to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. So far, positive as well as negative indirect environmental impacts have been reported, with negative impacts greater and more persistent. Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases. We recommend smart technology to collect data remotely, the implementation of \\"one health\\" approach between public health physicians and veterinarians, and the use of biodegradable medical supplies in future epidemic threats.","output":"Environment and COVID-19: Pollutants, impacts, dissemination, management and recommendations for facing future epidemic threats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of women who gave birth in a US hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 has a similar pattern of infection, clinical symptoms, and chest imaging findings to influenza pneumonia. In this retrospective study, we analysed clinical and chest CT data of 24 patients with COVID-19 and 79 patients with influenza pneumonia. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the temperature, systolic pressure, cough and sputum production could distinguish COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the clinical features are 0.783 and 0.747, and the AUC value is 0.819. Univariate analysis demonstrates that nine CT features, central-peripheral distribution, superior-inferior distribution, anterior-posterior distribution, patches of GGO, GGO nodule, vascular enlargement in GGO, air bronchogram, bronchiectasis within focus, interlobular septal thickening, could distinguish COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the CT features are 0.750 and 0.962, and the AUC value is 0.927. Finally, a multivariate logistic regression model combined the variables from the clinical variables and CT features models was made. The combined model contained six features: systolic blood pressure, sputum production, vascular enlargement in the GGO, GGO nodule, central-peripheral distribution and bronchiectasis within focus. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the combined features are 0.87 and 0.96, and the AUC value is 0.961.

We present a novel application of the eTEP access technique for the repair of ventral and incisional hernias. METHODS Retrospective review of consecutive laparoscopic retromuscular hernia repair cases utilizing the eTEP access approach from five hernia centers between August 2015 and October 2016 was conducted. Patient demographics, hernia characteristics, operative details, perioperative complications, and quality of life outcomes utilizing the Carolina's Comfort Scale (CCS) were included in our data analysis. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients with mean age of 54.9 years, mean BMI of 31.1 kg/m2, and median ASA of 2.0 were included in this analysis. Thirty-four percent of patients had a prior ventral or incisional hernia repair. Average mesh area of 634.4 cm2 was used for an average defect area of 132.1 cm2. Mean operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay were 218.9 min, 52.6 mL, and 1.8 days, respectively. There was one conversion to intraperitoneal mesh placement and one conversion to open retromuscular mesh placement. Postoperative complications consisted of seroma (n = 2) and trocar site dehiscence (n = 1). Comparison of mean pre- and postoperative CCS scores found significant improvements in pain (68%, p < 0.007) and movement limitations (87%, p < 0.004) at 6-month follow-up. There were no readmissions within 30 days and one hernia recurrence at mean follow-up of 332  122 days. CONCLUSIONS Our initial multicenter evaluation of the eTEP access technique for ventral and incisional hernias has found the approach feasible and effective. This novel approach offers flexible port set-up optimal for laparoscopic closure of defects, along with wide mesh coverage in the retromuscular space with minimal transfascial fixation.","output":"A novel approach using the enhanced-view totally extraperitoneal (eTEP) technique for laparoscopic retromuscular hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: A mobile app, BlueIce, was codesigned with young people with a history of self-harm to provide them with more accessible and available evidence-based support at times of distress.

These errors often occur while inheriting patients from a different geography or a long history of medical illnesses. Keeping a broad differential diagnosis, understanding changes in health and illness over time with appropriate evaluation of available laboratory and imaging data is critical to creating and appraising interventions for individuals, families and populations. Initial errors in diagnostic and therapeutic plans can be detrimental to overall outcome in critically ill patients which is even more apparent in the elderly. Case Report: A 70-year-old woman presented with fever, shortness of breath, malaise and dry cough. She was noted to be hypoxemic requiring high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). Her past history included recent diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) based on left sided acute vision loss for which she was on oral prednisone and methotrexate without pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis. Her antibody panel was noted to be negative except for elevated ESR and CRP. She was found to be negative for Sars-CoV-2. Bilateral temporal artery biopsies did not reveal GCA (Figure 1). Her respiratory failure progressed into severe ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. BAL was positive for pneumocystis stain and pneumocystis culture. She was initiated on appropriate treatment for pneumocystis pneumonia and ARDS. Her ICU course was further complicated by new left sided hemiparesis and MRI showed temporal and occipital infarcts. TEE revealed immobile vegetation on all 3 aortic valve leaflets concerning for non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. After initiation of anticoagulation, the patient developed spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding and progressed to multi-organ failure. Her family decided to transition her care to comfort only, and the patient succumbed to her illness. Discussion: Acute vision loss in elderly requires a thorough work up including cerebrovascular events, autoimmune and local ocular causes. A significant anchoring bias towards GCA in the absence of American College of Rheumatology's qualifying criteria for GCA led to initiation of high dose steroids and immunosuppression. Further addition of F-flurodeoxyglucose PET with temporal artery biopsy is shown to increase diagnostic fidelity in doubtful cases. Early evaluation for embolic events with an echocardiogram could have avoided development of PCP ARDS and fulminant embolic strokes in this patient. In addition, it is recommended that all patients on prednisone 20 mg daily for more than 30 days should receive PCP prophylaxis.","output":"Amaurosis fugax leading to anchoring bias"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By combining the resource-and capabilities-based view and agency theory, this paper offers a framework within which to examine the nature of dynamic capabilities in family firms, and how they are affected by the ownership, governance and management structures. We focus on technology-based innovation capabilities, differentiating between sensing, seizing and transforming capabilities. We expand the analysis of family involvement, defined as the family firm owner's ability to influence firm behavior, identifying three distinct structures that underpin decision-making power and control capacity in family firms: the capital structure, the governance and management structure of the business; and the governance structure of the family itself. The empirical research was carried out on a sample of 748 family firms from the Spanish tourism industry. We find that the effects of these dimensions of family involvement on dynamic capabilities are asymmetric. A concentrated ownership structure with a high degree of family control and a substantial share of family wealth committed to the business are shown to have a negative effect. The management structure is shown to be the key body for fostering the accumulation of dynamic capabilities, although a high level of family involvement in the top management team and having a family member as CEO represent major barriers to this process. On the other hand, the board of directors and its composition appear not to be relevant structural elements. The most powerful structural factor in facilitating the development of innovation capabilities is the existence of an effective family board and the implementation of family management instruments. These mechanisms help to mitigate the negative effects of a family-controlled ownership and management structure. The findings represent a significant contribution to the literature on family firms, innovation management and corporate governance.","output":"Effects of ownership structure and corporate and family governance on dynamic capabilities in family firms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Acute suppurative thyroiditis is a rare disease of thyroid gland.

The clinically-proven protease inhibitor Camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. However, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate metabolites and potential viral resistance have not been analyzed. Moreover, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate in human lung tissue remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: We used recombinant TMPRSS2, reporter particles bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or authentic SARS-CoV-2 to assess inhibition of TMPRSS2 and viral entry, respectively, by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA. FINDINGS: We show that several TMPRSS2-related proteases activate SARS-CoV-2 and that two, TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS13, are robustly expressed in the upper respiratory tract. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by Camostat mesylate. The Camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to Camostat mesylate. In contrast, both inhibitors exhibited similar antiviral activity and this correlated with the rapid conversion of Camostat mesylate into GBPA in the presence of serum. Finally, Camostat mesylate and GBPA blocked SARS-CoV-2 spread in human lung tissue ex vivo and the related protease inhibitor Nafamostat mesylate exerted augmented antiviral activity. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 and closely related proteases for spread in the upper respiratory tract and that spread in the human lung can be blocked by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA.

We examined differences between female and male caregivers on ACEs, COVID stress/disruption, and mental health (distress, anxiety, substance use, and posttraumatic stress). Main and interactive effects of ACEs and COVID stress/disruption on each mental health outcome were examined. Female caregivers reported higher COVID stress/disruption, more ACEs, and greater distress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms compared to male caregivers. Among female caregivers, higher COVID stress/disruption and more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) independently predicted all mental health outcomes, consistent with a stress accumulation model. Among male caregivers, a pattern of interactions between COVID stress/disruption and ACEs suggested that the effects of COVID stress/disruption on mental health was stronger for those with higher ACEs, especially for substance use, consistent with a stress sensitization model. Higher levels of stress and mental health difficulties among female caregivers suggests a disproportionate burden due to pandemic-related disruption compared to male caregivers. Findings speak to the disparate effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of female compared to male caregivers, and the role of pre-existing vulnerabilities in shaping current adaptation.","output":"The disparate impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of female and male caregivers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A questionnaire on COVID-19-related thrombosis in patients hospitalized before Aug 31, 2020, was sent to 399 hospitals throughout Japan.

There is little to no evidence on the accuracy of commercially available deep learning-based CAD in different populations, including patients with smear-negative tuberculosis and people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, PLWH). METHODS: We collected CXRs and individual patient data (IPD) from studies evaluating CAD in patients self-referring for tuberculosis symptoms with culture or nucleic acid amplification testing as the reference. We reanalyzed CXRs with three CAD programs (CAD4TB version (v) 6, Lunit v3.1.0.0, and qXR v2). We estimated sensitivity and specificity within each study and pooled using IPD meta-analysis. We used multivariable meta-regression to identify characteristics modifying accuracy. RESULTS: We included CXRs and IPD of 3727/3967 participants from 4/7 eligible studies. 17% (621/3727) were PLWH. 17% (645/3727) had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis. Despite using the same threshold score for classifying CXR in every study, sensitivity and specificity varied from study to study. The software had similar unadjusted accuracy (at 90% pooled sensitivity, pooled specificities were: CAD4TBv6, 56.9% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 51.7C61.9]; Lunit, 54.1% [95% CI: 44.6C63.3]; qXRv2, 60.5% [95% CI: 51.7C68.6]). Adjusted absolute differences in pooled sensitivity between PLWH and HIV-uninfected participants were: CAD4TBv6, ?13.4% [?21.1, ?6.9]; Lunit, +2.2% [?3.6, +6.3]; qXRv2: ?13.4% [?21.5, ?6.6]; between smear-negative and smear-positive tuberculosis was: were CAD4TBv6, ?12.3% [?19.5, ?6.1]; Lunit, ?17.2% [?24.6, ?10.5]; qXRv2, ?16.6% [?24.4, ?9.9].

Methods: COVID-19 has hampered outpatient and elective services and surgeries throughout the world. During the national lockdown imposed in March in India, outpatient services were suspended in our institute, leading to a tremendous backlog of pediatric patients with cataract. Since the delay in surgery in pediatric cataract can cause amblyopia, our institute had resumed pediatric cataract surgeries in June 2020 at the time of Unlock-1 in the country. Results: We have discussed the percentage of reduction in pediatric cataract surgeries in 2020 during the Unlock 1, 2, 3, and 4, as compared to the number of surgeries done by the pediatric ophthalmology unit in the same months last year. We had introduced triage and telemedicine in our department. We have discussed the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative protocol followed in our institute for children with pediatric cataract, and also the measures which can be taken for the safety of patients and staff.

Mycophenolic acid inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. This study examined the effect of a non-polymer TiO(2) thin filmCcoated stent with mycophenolic acid in a porcine coronary overstretch restenosis model. Methods: Thirty coronary arteries in 15 pigs were randomized into three groups in which the coronary arteries were treated with a TiO(2) filmCcoated stent with mycophenolic acid (NTM, n = 10), everolimus-eluting stent with biodegradable polymer (EES, n = 10), or TiO(2) filmCcoated stent (NT, n = 10). A histopathologic analysis was performed 28 days after the stenting. Results: There were no significant intergroup differences in injury score, internal elastic lamina area, or inflammation score. Percent area stenosis was significantly smaller in the NTM and EES groups than in the NT group (36.1  13.63% vs. 31.6  7.74% vs. 45.5  18.96%, respectively, p = 0.0003).

Given the significant global demand to provide telehealth services, it is important to explore patient receptiveness toward this alternative service model, particularly from regions where it has yet to be implemented. We conducted a cross-sectional study to understand the views and willingness of patients toward the use of telehealth for cancer genetic counseling. A survey was completed by 160 patients of the National Cancer Centre Singapore, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The study found that 95.6% (n = 153/160) of participants did not have prior telehealth experience. Most participants were willing or neutral toward having genetic counseling by phone (n = 114/160, 71.3%) and video (n = 106/160, 66.3%). However, majority prefer in-person appointments for first (n = 127/160, 79.4%) and follow-up (n = 97/160, 60.6%) visits over telehealth. Majority agreed that a phone/video consultation would meet most of their needs but voiced concerns regarding privacy and sharing of information (n = 79/160, 49.4% for phone; n = 74/160, 46.3% for video) and whether their emotional needs could be met (n = 61/160, 38.1%).

SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by serological and virological tests. Plasma neutralizing responses were assessed against replicative virus and pseudoviral particles. Multiple regression and non-parametric tests were used to analyze dependence of parameters. The magnitude of neutralizing titers significantly increased with disease severity. Hospitalized individuals developed higher titers compared to mild-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, which together showed titers below the detection limit in 50% of cases. Longitudinal analysis confirmed the strong differences in neutralizing titers between non-hospitalized and hospitalized participants and showed rapid kinetics of appearance of neutralizing antibodies (50% and 80% of maximal activity reached after 11 and 17 days after symptoms onset, respectively) in hospitalized patients. No significant impact of age, gender or treatment on the neutralizing titers was observed in this limited cohort.

However, due to the intrinsic random fluctuations of the viral signal in the wastewater (due to e.g., dilution; transport and fate processes in sewer system; variation in the number of persons discharging; variations in virus excretion and water consumption per day) the subsequent prevalence analysis may result in misleading conclusions. It is thus helpful to apply data filtering techniques to reduce the noise in the signal. In this paper we investigate 13 smoothing algorithms applied to the virus signals monitored in four wastewater treatment plants in Austria. The parameters of the algorithms have been defined by an optimization procedure aiming for performance metrics. The results are further investigated by means of a cluster analysis. While all algorithms are in principle applicable, SPLINE, Generalized Additive Model and Friedman Super Smoother are recognized as superior methods in this context (with the latter two having a tendency to over-smoothing).

METHODS: Seventy-seven patients consecutively hospitalized for COVID-19 in a geriatric unit were included. Intervention groups were participants regularly supplemented with vitamin D over the preceding year (Group 1), and those supplemented with vitamin D after COVID-19 diagnosis (Group 2). The comparator group involved participants having received no vitamin D supplements (Group 3). Outcomes were 14-day mortality and highest (worst) score on the ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI) measured during COVID-19 acute phase. Potential confounders were age, gender, functional abilities, undernutrition, cancer, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, glycated hemoglobin, number of acute health issues at admission, hospital use of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and pharmacological treatments of respiratory disorders. RESULTS: The three groups (n = 77; mean  SD, 88  5years; 49% women) were similar at baseline (except for woman proportion, p = 0.02), as were the treatments used for COVID-19. In Group 1 (n = 29), 93.1% of COVID-19 participants survived at day 14, compared to 81.2% survivors in Group 2 (n = 16) (p = 0.33) and 68.7% survivors in Group 3 (n = 32) (p = 0.02). While considering Group 3 as reference (hazard ratio (HR) = 1), the fully-adjusted HR for 14-day mortality was HR = 0.07 (p = 0.017) for Group 1 and HR = 0.37 (p = 0.28) for Group 2. Group 1 had longer survival time than Group 3 (log-rank p = 0.015), although there was no difference between Groups 2 and 3 (log-rank p = 0.32).

Although, many aspects of disease is still under the observation. Therefore, in this study retrospectively was investigated the data on patients discharged from Georgian hospitals between February and June. According to Georgian regulation, all patients with confirmed COVID-19 should be hospitalized. The data sources were hospitalization registry and the standardized case report forms. In this descriptive study, epidemiological characteristics of 500 COVID-19 cases confirmed with PCR tests were analyzed. Among variables were: gender, age and geographic distribution, disease characteristics, underlying health conditions, test-related features, etc. Majority of patients (72.0%) were admitted to hospitals by the ambulance. The mean age of the patients was 43 years. The sex distribution was merely the same for both genders (49.4% male and 50.6% female). The most common symptoms were fever (82.4%, 95% CI 78.4-85.9), fatigue (49.6%, 95% CI 44.7-54.5), and cough (38.3%, 95% CI 33.6-43.1). The proportion of asymptomatic cases during the PCR testing were 16.6%. More than one symptom was observed in 57.6% of patients. Most common underlying health conditions were cardiovascular diseases (21.8%), diabetes (7.6%), kidney disease (3.6%), chronic lung disease (2.4%), cancer (2.2%), and chronic hepatitis (1.8%). Disease severity significantly differ among cases. Of those without comorbidity conditions, 94% had mild severity. However, among those with comorbidity conditions 35% were sever or critical. 50% of patients were reported as obese. The proportion of severe or critical patients was higher with BMI-18.5-24.9 and BMI 30. The case-fatality rate was 2.6%, with majority of deaths among aged 70. The severity of illness was strongly associated with comorbidity conditions and BMI. These findings are important to contribute and improve evidence-based knowledge for the novel coronavirus.

BSIs are one of the most frequent lethal conditions that are managed in intensive care units (ICUs). In the case of septic shock, immune deficiency, and delayed treatment, even with adequate antimicrobial therapy and/or source control, the outcomes are often unfavorable. Methods: this review article summarizes the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of BSIs with a particular focus on ICU acquired BSIs (ICU-BSIs), which are usually caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. For this reason, their antimicrobial resistance patterns and therapeutic options have also been compiled. Results: ICU-acquired BSIs prevail in 5C7% of ICU patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosae are the pathogens most often responsible for MDR infections. MDR Enterobacteriaceae have seen their prevalence increase from 6.2% (1997C2000) to 15.8% (2013C2016) in recent years. Conclusions: Considering that prevention and treatment of sepsis is nowadays considered a global health priority by the World Health Organization, it is our obligation to invest more resources into solving or reducing the spread of these unfaithful infections. It is relevant to identify patients with risk factors that make them more susceptible to BSIs, to guarantee earlier molecular or microbiological diagnoses, and more rapidly appropriate treatment by using de-escalation strategies where possible.","output":"Blood Stream Infections from MDR Bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our previous in vitro comparative study on a feline coronavirus (FCoV) pair, differing only in the intactness of their ORF3abc regions, showed that the truncated ORF3abc plays an important role in the efficient macrophage/monocyte tropism of type II feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV).

This has created a large backlog of work and upstaging of disease with consequent increases in risk and cost of treatment and potential for worse long-term outcomes. As countries emerge from lockdown but with COVID-19 endemic in society, precautions remain that restrict 'normal' practice. In this article, we propose a methodology for restructuring services for patients with HVD and provide recommendations pertaining to frequency of follow-up and use of echocardiography at present. It will be almost impossible to practice exactly as we did prior to the pandemic; thus, it is essential to prioritise patients with the greatest clinical need, such as those with symptomatic severe HVD. Local procedural waiting times will need to be considered, in addition to usual clinical characteristics in determining whether patients requiring intervention would be better suited having surgical or transcatheter treatment. We present guidance on the identification of stable patients with HVD that could have follow-up deferred safely and suggest certain patients that could be discharged from follow-up if waiting lists are triaged with appropriate clinical input.

Many viruses and bacteria that once caused catastrophic pandemics (e.g., smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, and diphtheria) are either eradicated or effectively controlled through routine vaccination programs. Nonetheless, vaccine manufacturing remains incredibly challenging. Viruses exhibiting high antigenic diversity and high mutation rates cannot be fairly contested using traditional vaccine production methods and complexities surrounding the manufacturing processes, which impose significant limitations. Virus\\\\like particles (VLPs) are recombinantly produced viral structures that exhibit immunoprotective traits of native viruses but are noninfectious. Several VLPs that compositionally match a given natural virus have been developed and licensed as vaccines. Expansively, a plethora of studies now confirms that VLPs can be designed to safely present heterologous antigens from a variety of pathogens unrelated to the chosen carrier VLPs. Owing to this design versatility, VLPs offer technological opportunities to modernize vaccine supply and disease response through rational bioengineering. These opportunities are greatly enhanced with the application of synthetic biology, the redesign and construction of novel biological entities. This review outlines how synthetic biology is currently applied to engineer VLP functions and manufacturing process. Current and developing technologies for the identification of novel target\\\\specific antigens and their usefulness for rational engineering of VLP functions (e.g., presentation of structurally diverse antigens, enhanced antigen immunogenicity, and improved vaccine stability) are described.

Among other advantages, the proposed modeling framework enables proper characterization of the interplay between the intrinsic aspects of a social process (e.g., the appeal of a political movement) and the social dynamics which are its realization; this characterization is key to successful social process prediction. The utility of the modeling methodology is illustrated through a case study involving the global SARS epidemic of 2002-2003.

Screening and early detection are needed to identify those who need help and to improve treatment outcomes. Nowadays, especially with the arrival of the COVID-19 outbreak, assessment is increasingly conducted online, resulting in the need for brief online screening measures. The aim of the current study was to examine the reliability and different sources of validity evidence of a new web-based screening questionnaire for emotional disorder symptoms, the DetectaWeb-Distress Scale, which assesses mood (major depression and dysthymic disorder), anxiety (separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, social phobia, panic disorder/agoraphobia, and specific phobia), obsessiveCcompulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidality (suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts), and global distress. A total of 1,499 participants (aged 8C18) completed the DetectaWeb-Distress Scale and specific questionnaires for emotional disorder symptoms, suicidal behaviors, and well-being through a web-based survey. Results indicated that a structural model of 10 correlated factors fits reasonably better in comparison to the remaining models; measurement invariance for age and gender; good internal consistency (McDonald's  ranging from 0.65 to 0.94); and significant positive correlation with other measures of anxiety, depression, PTSD, or distress, and negative correlation with well-being measures, displaying support for convergent-discriminant validity.

With this commentary we want to further elaborate this suggestion, because we noticed specific signatures in microbiota affected by the Anthropocene. RESULTS: Here, we discuss this based on a review of available literature and our own research targeting exemplarily the plant microbiome. It is not only crucial for plants themselves but also linked to planetary health. We suggest that different human activities are commonly linked to a shift of diversity and evenness of the plant microbiota, which is also characterized by a decrease of host specificity, and an increase of r-strategic microbes, pathogens, and hypermutators. The resistome, anchored in the microbiome, follows this shift by an increase of specific antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanisms as well as an increase of plasmid-associated resistance genes. This typical microbiome signature of the Anthropocene is often associated with dysbiosis and loss of resilience, and leads to frequent pathogen outbreaks. Although several of these observations are already confirmed by meta-studies, this issue requires more attention in upcoming microbiome studies.

OBJECTIVE.-: To accurately reflect the preexisting diseases and pathologic conditions of decedents with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection through autopsy. DESIGN.-: Comprehensive data from 135 autopsy evaluations of COVID-19-positive decedents is presented, including histologic assessment. Postmortem examinations were performed by 36 pathologists at 19 medical centers or forensic institutions in the United States and Brazil. Data from each autopsy were collected through the online submission of multiple-choice and open-ended survey responses.

DESIGN: Registry-based cohort study with prospective data collection. SETTING: Admissions to Swedish ICUs from 6 March to 6 May 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs. EXPOSURES: Baseline characteristics, intensive care treatments and organ failures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and death. RESULTS: We identified 1563 patients with complete 30-day follow-up. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%. Median age was 61 [52 to 69], Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 [46 to 59] and 62.5% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 [75.0 to 140.6] mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate-to-severe acute respiratory failure. Age, male sex [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.5 (1.1 to 2.2)], SAPS III score [aOR 1.3 (1.2 to 1.4)], severe respiratory failure [aOR 3.0 (2.0 to 4.7)], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy [aOR 1.4 (1.0 to 1.9)] and continuous renal replacement therapy [aOR 2.1 (1.5 to 3.0)] were associated with increased mortality.

However, the provision of easy and regular access to DR screening programs is currently being challenged by the increasing prevalence of diabetes. One proposed solution is to extend the screening interval for patients at low risk for progression of retinopathy. To date, most providers of screening programs have hesitated to implement a strategy of extended intervals due to the lack of data on whether adherence and safety are compromised when retinal examinations occur less frequently. In the study reported here, we investigated adherence to the screening program and progression of retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes participating in a DR screening program with extended intervals. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who attended a screening program for DR. The patients were consecutively placed into a low-risk patient cohort with no retinopathy or into an intermediate-risk patient cohort with mild retinopathy (each cohort n = 500). Screening intervals were 36 months for the low-risk cohort and 18 months for the intermediate-risk cohort. RESULTS: The 1000 subjects enrolled in the study had a median age of 68 (interquartile range 12) years and 60.4% were men. At the follow-up screening visit, data on 102 subjects were not included in the analysis of adherence rate due to death, severe systemic illness, other concurrent eye disease or migration. Among the 898 remaining subjects, adherence to the screening program was 93.7% (413/443) in the 36-month group and 98.3% (449/455) in the 18-month group (p < 0.0001). Non-adherence decreased with increasing age (odds ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.888C0.954, p = 0.0005). At follow-up, 65 subjects showed progression of retinopathy; none had worse than moderate retinopathy. Risk factors for DR and treatment for hyperglycemia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia were compared among subjects in the low-risk cohort: non-adherent subjects did not differ from their adherent counterparts without progression of DR, but the former had a shorter duration of diabetes and higher diastolic blood pressure than adherent subjects with progression of DR (4.5 vs. 7.5 years, p = 0.007; and 80 vs. 75 mmHg, p = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that screening DR at extended intervals can be achieved with high adherence rates without compromising patient safety. However, younger subjects and those at higher risk of progression may require extra attention.","output":"Screening for Diabetic Retinopathy with Extended Intervals, Safe and Without Compromising Adherence: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the COVID-19 epidemic quickly under control in China within the early months of 2020, importing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the country now poses great challenges in epidemic control and prevention.

METHODS A single-center retrospective study was conducted to enroll the COVID-19 patients in isolation ward of the only designated hospital to receive COVID-19 patients (the Fourth People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) when the authors were assigned by the Ningxia Health Commission as experts from January 20, 2020 to March 15, 2020. According to the antiviral regimen, the patients were divided into conventional antiviral group and unconventional antiviral group. The conventional antiviral group received -interferon combined with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/R). The unconventional antiviral group was given -interferon combined with LPV/R and Abidor or Ribavirin or Chloroquine. The patients were divided into mild (13 cases), ordinary (45 cases), severe (14 cases) and critical (1 case) types. The clinical data, length of hospital stay, the first 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid negative recovery time, cost of hospitalization, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive reversal after 14 days of discharge, and the combination of hormones and antibiotics were collected. The differences in blood routine, liver function, blood lipid level and adverse reactions of antiviral drugs during hospitalization were compared between the two groups at 1, 3 and 7 days after admission and 1 and 3 months after discharge. RESULTS (1) General information: a total of 75 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted, and 73 patients were eventually enrolled, including 47 cases in the conventional antiviral group and 26 cases in the unconventional antiviral group. Patients with different clinical classification were analyzed, the higher the clinical classification and the patients' age, the higher the proportion of primary diseases and the cost of treatment, and the longer the length of hospital stay. Compared with conventional antiviral group, in unconventional antiviral group the percentage of severe and critical patients were higher [34.6% (9/26) vs. 10.6% (5/47), 3.8% (1/26) vs. 0 (0/47)], the length of hospital stay (days: 16.15.6 vs. 11.63.3), first nucleic acid negative recovery time (days: 12.44.5 vs. 10.03.5) were longer, and hospitalization cost was higher [Yuan: 11 984.2 (9 000.6, 24 424.7) vs. 8 140.4 (6 715.7,9 707.7)], with statistically significant differences (all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in gender, age, proportion of patients with primary diseases and nucleic acid positive reversal rate after 14 days of discharge between the unconventional and conventional antiviral groups (all P > 0.05). (2) Laboratory tests: during the hospitalization, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), total bilirubin (TBil) and three acyl glycerin (TG) levels were first increased and then reduced, lymphocyte count (LYM) was first decreased and then increased in two groups. In the unconventional antiviral group, WBC [(6.532.78)109/L], PLT [(250.7796.12)109/L], and TG [(1.940.96) mol/L] all reached their peak values at 7 days after admission. TBil peaked at 3 days after admission, which was (23.6912.14) mol/L, and LYM reached the peak 1 month after discharge, which was (1.820.50)109/L; however, there was no statistical significance among the above indicators between two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total cholesterol (TC) between the two groups at each time point. (3) The ratio of combined use of hormones in the non-antiviral group was significantly higher than that in the conventional antiviral group [26.9% (7/26) vs. 4.3% (2/47), P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS Age and associated primary diseases are related to the severity of COVID-19 patients. Unconventional antiviral treatment regimens are mostly used for severe COVID-19 patients whose ucleic acid did not turn negative for a long time. Individual antiviral therapy can be used based on the patients' response and tolerance to drugs.","output":"[Clinical efficacy and safety of different antiviral regimens in patients with coronavirus disease 2019]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computer network systems are often subject to several types of attacks. For example the distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack introduces an excessive traffic load to a web server to make it unusable. A popular method for detecting attacks is to use the sequence of source IP addresses to detect possible anomalies. With the aim of predicting the next IP address, the Probability Density Function of the IP address sequence is estimated. Prediction of source IP address in the future access to the server is meant to detect anomalous requests. In other words, during an access to the server, only predicted IP addresses are permitted and all others are blocked. The approaches used to estimate the Probability Density Function of IP addresses range from the sequence of IP addresses seen previously and stored in a database to address clustering, normally used by combining the K-Means algorithm. Instead, in this paper we consider the sequence of IP addresses as a numerical sequence and develop the nonlinear analysis of the numerical sequence. We used nonlinear analysis based on Volterras Kerners and Hammersteins models. The experiments carried out with datasets of source IP address sequences show that the prediction errors obtained with Hammerstein models are smaller than those obtained both with the Volterra Kernels and with the sequence clustering by means of the K-Means algorithm.","output":"A Novel Big Data Analytics Approach for Supporting Cyber Attack Detection via Non-linear Analytic Prediction of IP Addresses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Current guidelines consider that bariatric surgery is relatively contraindicated in elderly adults (aged60 years). The objective of this study was to evaluate obesity-related morbidity after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) according to whether patients were aged60 years or<60 years. METHODS Forty-two patients aged60 years (the elderly group) were matched 1:2 with 84 patients aged<60 (the control group). The primary objective was to compare weight change and the remission rate of co-morbidities in the 2 groups after 24 months of follow-up. The secondary endpoints were short-term and midterm postoperative outcomes (operating time, the frequency of conversion to laparotomy, the length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, mortality, and the SG failure rate). RESULTS No significant differences were observed between the elderly and control groups in terms of the mean operating time (83 minutes in both groups; P = .90), length of stay (3.2 versus 3.4 days, respectively; P = .51), morbidity rate (4.7% versus 9.5%, P = .35), or mortality rate (0% in both groups). The mean excess weight loss was significantly lower in the elderly group than in the control group at 12 months (56.2% versus 71.4%, respectively; P<.01) and 24 months (51.8% versus 73.5%, P<.01). Similar statistically significant differences were observed between the elderly group and control group for remission of metabolic syndrome (95% versus 90%, respectively; P = .55), type 2 diabetes mellitus (87% versus 71%, respectively; P = .13), hypertension (81% versus 77%, respectively; P = .71), and dyslipidemia (94% versus 74%, respectively; P = .09) at 24 months after SG. CONCLUSION Results support the safety and efficacy of SG for morbid obesity in patients aged60 years. In contrast to weight loss, the long-term morbidity rate and remission of obesity-related co-morbidities were similar in the participants aged60 years and those aged<60 years.","output":"Is sleeve gastrectomy still contraindicated for patients aged60 years?

Alternative methods are suggested, although the clinimetric properties are sparse. This study investigated the concurrent validity and the intrarater reliability of two ultrasound-based methods for assessing patellar tendon stiffness. Methods: Patellar tendon stiffness was assessed in 17 healthy adults with (a) the dynamometer and B-mode ultrasonography method (DBUS) and (b) the strain elastography method. Correlations between the two methods were analysed using Kendall's Tau-b. The relative reliability of both methods was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The absolute reliability was presented by Bland-Altman plots, standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimum detectable change (MDC). Results: No correlation was found between the two methods, irrespective of reference tissue in strain elastography (Kendall's Tau-b Hoffa = -0.01 (p = 1.00), Kendall's Tau-b subcutis = 0.04 (p = 0.87)). Tracking of the tendon elongation in the DBUS method had good to excellent relative reliability (ICC = 0.95 (95% confidence interval - CI: 0.85-0.98)) and high absolute reliability (SEM = 0.04 mm (1%), MDC = 0.11 mm (3%)). The strain elastography method had good to excellent relative reliability, regardless of reference tissue (ICC Hoffa = 0.95 (95% CI: 0.86-0.98), ICC subcutis = 0.94 (95% CI: 0.82-0.98)), but low absolute reliability (SEM Hoffa = 0.06 (20%), MDC Hoffa = 0.18 (60%), SEM subcutis = 0.12 (41%), MDC subcutis = 0.32 (110%)). Conclusions: No concurrent validity existed for DBUS and strain elastography, suggesting that the two methods measure different tendon properties. The overall reliability for the DBUS method was high, but the absolute reliability was low for strain elastography stiffness ratios. Therefore, the strain elastography method may not be recommended for tracking differences in patellar tendon stiffness in healthy adults.","output":"Concurrent validity and intrarater reliability of two ultrasound-based methods for assessing patellar tendon stiffness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To study the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on surgical care in the Russian Federation.

The main working hypothesis of the study: during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of hospitalizations to general surgical departments decreases, but the hospital and postoperative mortality for any reason increases both in emergency and elective surgery. RESULTS During the pandemic, the number of hospitalizations of patients with surgical diseases decreased by 21.0%. At the same time, there was a significant increase in mortality among the entire population of patients in surgical hospitals. Surgical activity decreased, but the share of minimally invasive operations increased and there was no predicted increase in the share of late treatment in emergency surgery. The percentage of planned operations decreased by 40.8%, and the increase of postoperative mortality was registered at the same time. CONCLUSION The presented data may be valuable for surgical care managers in emergency situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recently, a combination of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) with Toll-like receptor agonists (TLR-P) was proposed as a new standard to generate superior cytokine-producing DCs with high migratory capacity. Here, we compare TLR-P DCs with conventional DCs matured only with the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1? (CDCs), focussing on the interaction of resulting DCs with CD8(+) T-cells. TLR-P matured DCs showed elevated expression of activation markers such as CD80 and CD83 compared to CDCs, together with a significantly higher migration capacity. Secretion of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12 was highest after 16 h in TLR-P DCs, and only TLR-P DCs secreted active IL-12p70. TLR-P DCs as well as CDCs successfully primed multifunctional CD8(+) T-cells from na?ve precursors specific for the peptide antigens Melan-A, NLGN4X, and PTP with comparable priming efficacy and T-cell receptor avidity. CD8(+) T-cells primed by TLR-P DCs showed significantly elevated expression of the integrin VLA-4 and a trend for higher T-cell numbers after expansion. In contrast, TLR-P DCs displayed a substantially reduced capability to cross-present CMVpp65 protein antigen to pp65-specific T cells, an effect that was dose-dependent on PGE(2) during DC maturation and reproducible with several responder T-cell lines. In conclusion, TLR-P matured DCs might be optimal presenters of antigens not requiring processing such as short peptides. However, PGE(2) seems less favorable for maturation of DCs intended to process and cross-present more complex vaccine antigens such as lysates, proteins or long peptides.

We conducted a second prospective randomized, controlled trial to further establish the real-world clinical utility of a novel assay that objectively identifies potentially serious DDIs in real-world patients. Re-recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) from our first randomized, controlled, simulated-patients study on DDIs, we experimentally introduced a definitive, urine-based mass spectrometry test intervention that the physicians could use when caring for their eligible patients. Patients were eligible if taking four or more prescription medications or suspected of taking other non-prescribed substances with potential medication interactions. The primary outcome was whether DDI testing changed clinical care. We explored a secondary outcome to see if the change in practice improved symptoms in patients with potential DDIs. A total of 169 control and 162 intervention patients were enrolled in the study, and their medical records were abstracted. In real-world patients, intervention physicians identified and/or treated a DDI at 3.0x the rate in their patient population compared to controls (21.6% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.001). Intervention physicians were more likely to discontinue or adjust the interacting agent compared to controls (62.9% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.001), and patient-reported symptoms also significantly declined (29.6% vs. 20.1%, p = 0.045). These results were nearly identical to concurrent measurements that used simulated patients, wherein intervention was more likely to both make a DDI diagnosis (56.3% vs. 21.6%, p < 0.001) and stop the interacting medications (58.3% versus 26.6%, p < 0.001).

A primary clinical outcome of 30-day mortality was also assessed. METHODS: The TTE service across two hospitals was reconfigured to maximise access to inpatient scanning. All TTEs of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients over a 3-week period were included in the study. All patients were followed up until at least day 30 after their scan at which point the primary clinical outcome of mortality was recorded. Comparative analysis based on mortality was conducted for all TTE results, biochemical markers and demographics. RESULTS: 27 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 had a TTE within the inclusion window. Mortality comparative analysis showed the deceased group were significantly older (mean 68.4, SD 11.9 vs 60.5, SD 13.0, p=0.03) and more commonly reported fatigue in their presenting symptoms (29.6% vs 71.4%, p=0.01).

However, the systematic structural recognition and recovery of macromolecules captured by cryo-ET are difficult due to high structural complexity and imaging limits. Deep learning based subtomogram classification have played critical roles for such tasks. As supervised approaches, however, their performance relies on sufficient and laborious annotation on a large training dataset. Results: To alleviate this major labeling burden, we proposed a Hybrid Active Learning (HAL) framework for querying subtomograms for labelling from a large unlabeled subtomogram pool. Firstly, HAL adopts uncertainty sampling to select the subtomograms that have the most uncertain predictions. Moreover, to mitigate the sampling bias caused by such strategy, a discriminator is introduced to judge if a certain subtomogram is labeled or unlabeled and subsequently the model queries the subtomogram that have higher probabilities to be unlabeled. Additionally, HAL introduces a subset sampling strategy to improve the diversity of the query set, so that the information overlap is decreased between the queried batches and the algorithmic efficiency is improved. Our experiments on subtomogram classification tasks using both simulated and real data demonstrate that we can achieve comparable testing performance (on average only 3% accuracy drop) by using less than 30% of the labeled subtomograms, which shows a very promising result for subtomogram classification task with limited labeling resources.","output":"Active Learning to Classify Macromolecular Structures in situ for Less Supervision in Cryo-Electron Tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the clinical practice of Chinese respiratory therapists (RTs) participating in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and summarize the experience and role of RTs in the treatment of pandemic infectious diseases.

The survey questionnaire included the basic work of RTs, the specific work of the treatment for COVID-19 patients and problems encountered at work. RESULTS A total of 126 questionnaires were issued and 40 valid questionnaires were collected from RTs who treated COVID-19 patients at 22 COVID-19 designated hospitals in 8 provinces and municipalities. This included 7 hospitals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic. In their medical team, RTs accounted for 2.9% (1.5%, 6.7%) of medical staff, the working experience of the RTs was about (6.25.4) years, the ratio of RTs to beds was about 1:11 (1:5, 1:26), and 85.0% (34/40) of RTs were transferred from other hospitals. 97.5% (39/40) of RTs were involved in formulating individual respiratory care strategies in their medical teams, and they were all involved in the evaluation of respiratory care and decision-making as well as the early identification of deterioration of respiratory function. All RTs [100% (40/40)] indicated that they would actively monitor patients' respiratory status, increase the means and frequency of the monitoring, implement standardized oxygen therapy, prevent ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI), and standardize the management of artificial airway. However, less than 50% of RTs had carried out stress and strain, transpulmonary pressure, partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2), end-expiratory lung volume, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and other respiratory function monitoring. 85% of RTs conducted training and education related to respiratory care and formulated relevant standard operating procedures for their medical teams. More than 90% of RTs led the implementation of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC), pulmonary protective mechanical ventilation, prone ventilation, pulmonary rehabilitation, airway management, transfer of critical patients, and other respiratory treatment.

SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: n = 56 overweight/obese adults with moderate-severe TBI. DESIGN: The GLB-TBI is a 12-month group- and community-based program to promote healthy eating and physical activity. The BHG-TBI is a 12-month group- and community-based program to promote general brain health, designed as an active control condition matched on time, structure, and perceived benefit to the GLB-TBI. In a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of the GLB-TBI for weight loss, participants used a group-specific mHealth app providing daily tips customized according to their intervention allocation. MAIN MEASURES: Compliance (percentage of daily prompts read and completed) and participant-reported satisfaction and usability. RESULTS: In conjunction with relevant stakeholders, we developed the content and structure of the GLB-TBI and BHG-TBI apps based on core curriculum components. We incorporated cognitive strategies (app notifications) to address potential cognitive impairment common after TBI. Both apps delivered brief daily educational and motivational \\"tips\\" derived directly from their respective curricula. Daily use of the apps varied greatly across participants, with most participants who used the apps completing 10% to 50% of daily content. Participants found the apps to be easy to use, but only some found them helpful. App use was substantially different for those who participated in the intervention during (2020) versus before (2019) the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Although enhancing an intensive lifestyle intervention with mHealth technology may be helpful, further refinement is needed to optimize the frequency and delivery methods of mHealth content. Although one might expect remote app use to have been higher during the pandemic, we observed the opposite, potentially due to less hands-on training and ongoing support to use the app and/or general technology fatigue with social distancing.","output":"Feasibility and Pilot Testing of Mobile Health Apps to Supplement 2 Healthy Lifestyle Interventions in Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genome and transcriptional pattern of a newly identified respiratory variant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus were analyzed and compared with those of classical enterotropic transmissible gastroenteritis virus. The transcriptional patterns of the two viruses indicated that differences occurred in RNAs 1 and 2(S) and that RNA 3 was absent in the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) variant. The smaller RNA 2(S) of PRCV was due to a 681-nucleotide (nt) deletion after base 62 of the PRCV peplomer or spike (S) gene. The PRCV S gene still retained information for the 16-amino-acid signal peptide and the first 6 amino acid residues at the N terminus of the mature S protein, but the adjacent 227 residues were deleted. Two additional deletions (3 and 5 nt) were detected in the PRCV genome downstream of the S gene. The 3-nt deletion occurred in a noncoding region; however, the 5-nt deletion shortened the potential open reading frame A polypeptide from 72 to 53 amino acid residues. Significantly, a C-to-T substitution was detected in the last base position of the transcription recognition sequence upstream of open reading frame A, which rendered RNA 3 nondetectable in PRCV-infected cell cultures.","output":"Genetic analysis of porcine respiratory coronavirus, an attenuated variant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most frequent primary large-vessel vasculitis in individuals older than 50. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are considered the cornerstone of treatment. GC therapy is usually tapered over months according to clinical symptoms and inflammatory marker levels. Considering the high rate of GC-related adverse events in these older individuals, immunosuppressive treatments and biologic agents have been proposed as add-on therapies. Methotrexate was considered an alternative option, but its clinical impact was limited. Other immunosuppressants failed to demonstrate a significant favourable benefit/risk ratio. The approval of tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitor brought significant improvement. Indeed, tocilizumab had a noticeable effect on cumulative GCs dose and relapse prevention. After the improvement in pathophysiological knowledge, other targeted therapies have been proposed, with anti-IL-12/23, anti-IL-17, anti-IL-1, anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, Janus kinase inhibitors or anti-granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor therapies. These therapies are currently under evaluation. Interestingly, mavrilimumab, ustekinumab and, to a lesser extent, abatacept have shown promising results in phase 2 randomised controlled trials.

The aim of this paper is to share with all the vascular community the protocol developed by the USL (Unit Sanitaria Locale) Toscana Centro for the reorganization of the Vascular Surgery Unit during the COVID-19 emergency, hoping to help other institutions to face the emergency during the hard weeks coming. METHODS: The USL Toscana Centro is a public Italian health care institution including four districts (Empoli, Florence, Pistoia, Prato) with 13 different hospitals, serving more than 1,500,000 people in a 5000 km2 area. The USL adopted a protocol of reorganization of the Vascular Surgery Unit during the first difficult weeks of the epidemic, consisting in the creation of a Vascular Hub for urgent cases, with a profound reorganization of activities, wards, surgical operators, operating blocks, and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. RESULTS: All 13 hospitals are now COVID-19 as the first days of April passed. The San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence) has more than 80 COVID-19 patients in different settings (ICU, medical and surgical ward), which at the time of writing is almost one-third of the total hospital capacity (80/260 beds). It has been identified as the Surgical Hub for urgent vascular COVID-19 cases. Therefore, the elective surgical and office activities were reduced by 30% and 80%, respectively, and reserved to priority cases. A corner of the whole operating block, well separate from the remaining operating rooms, was rapidly converted into one operating room and six ICU beds dedicated to COVID patients. The COVID-19 surgical path now includes an emergency room for suspected COVID-19 patients directly connected to an elevator for the transfer of COVID patients in the COVID operating block and dedicated COVID-19 ward and ICU beds. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid modification of hospital settings, a certain \\"flexibility\\" of the medical personnel, a stepwise shutdown of vascular surgical and office activity, and the necessity of a strong leadership are mandatory to cope with the tsunami of the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"The Italian USL Toscana Centro model of a vascular hub responding to the COVID-19 emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Researchers reflect on sociocultural aspects of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and critically analyze the epidemic's effects on pregnant mothers and their babies.

In this study, we demonstrate that the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus E can physically interact, via a putative peripheral domain, with M. Deletion of this domain resulted in a drastic reduction in the incorporation of M into virus-like particles. Immunofluorescent staining of cells coexpressing M and E supports that E interacts with M and relocates M to the same subcellular compartments that E resides in. E was retained in the pre-Golgi membranes, prior to being translocated to the Golgi apparatus and the secretory vesicles; M was observed to exhibit similar localization and translocation profiles as E when coexpressed with E. Deletion studies identified the C-terminal 6-residue RDKLYS as the endoplasmic reticulum retention signal of E, and site-directed mutagenesis of the ?4 lysine residue to glutamine resulted in the accumulation of E in the Golgi apparatus. The third domain of E that plays a crucial role in virus budding is a putative transmembrane domain present at the N-terminal region, because deletion of the domain resulted in a free distribution of the mutant protein and in dysfunctional viral assembly.","output":"The Missing Link in Coronavirus Assembly: RETENTION OF THE AVIAN CORONAVIRUS INFECTIOUS BRONCHITIS VIRUS ENVELOPE PROTEIN IN THE PRE-GOLGI COMPARTMENTS AND PHYSICAL INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ENVELOPE AND MEMBRANE PROTEINS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Yingjiang County, which is on the ChinaCMyanmar border, is the main focus for malaria elimination in China.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has attracted the attention of the whole world. Our study aimed to describe illness progression and risk profiles for mortality in non-survivors. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 155 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and focused on 18 non-survivors among them. Briefly, we compared the dynamic profile of biochemical and immune parameters and drew an epidemiological and clinical picture of disease progression from disease onset to death in non-survivors. The survival status of the cohort was indicated by a KaplanCMeier curve. Results. Of the non-survivors, the median age was 73.5 years, and the proportion of males was 72.2%. Five and 13 patients were hospital-acquired and community-acquired infection of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The interval between disease onset and diagnosis was 8.5 days (IQR, [4C11]). With the deterioration of disease, most patients experienced consecutive changes in biochemical parameters, including lymphopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinemia, as well as elevated D-dimer and procalcitonin. Regarding the immune dysregulation, patients exhibited significantly decreased T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, including CD3(+)T, CD3(+)CD4(+)Th, and CD3(+)CD8(+)Tc cells. By the end of the disease, most patients suffered from severe complications, including ARDS (17/18; 94.4%), acute cardiac injury (10/18; 55.6%), acute kidney injury (7/18; 38.9%), shock (6/18; 33.3%), gastrointestinal bleeding (1/18; 5.6%), as well as perforation of intestine (1/18; 5.6%). All patients died within 45 days after the initial hospital admission with a median survivor time of 13.5 days (IQR, 8C17). Conclusions. Our data show that patients experienced consecutive changes in biochemical and immune parameters with the deterioration of the disease, indicating the necessity of early intervention.","output":"Novel Insights Into Illness Progression and Risk Profiles for Mortality in Non-survivors of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mucosal surfaces represent the major site of entry of many pathogens, and major challenges in vaccine development include safety and stability in a suitable dosage form. Micro- and nanocarrier-based delivery systems as nasal vaccines induce humoral, cellular, and mucosal immunity. The nasal route of vaccination could also offer immunity at several distant mucosal sites (oral, rectal, vaginal, and pulmonary), which is considered a simplified and cost-effective mode of vaccination with enhanced patient compliance. Most of the nasal vaccine delivery systems in the form of microparticulates, nanoparticulates, and liposomes are currently under development and prove to offer immunity in animal models. The importance and potential of the nasal route of administration for vaccines is unexplored, and this chapter outlines the opportunities, challenges, and potential delivery solutions to facilitate the development of improved nasal vaccines for infectious diseases.","output":"Nasal Vaccine Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper attempts to construct an anatomical structure around key constituents in the International Financial System (IFS) in comparison with anatomical features of the human body. The IFS is a conglomeration of financial systemsencompassing financial and monetary activitiesthat are so intertwined that the fragility of a system, affects the stability of the IFS. Similarly, the human body system is a compendium of sub-systems working together to ensure the body functions effectively. The human body and IFS are both products of a complicated intertwined formation of sub-systems. Thus, analogies are made between the structure and functions of key constituents in the IFS, and vital organs and components in seven (7) systems of the human bodycirculatory, respiratory, digestive, nervous, skeletal, integumentary, and respiratory systems. The contextual structure of this paper is twofold: (1) making analogies between constituents of the IFS and components of the human body system, (2) positing supporting evidence to the analogies through occurrences from select global financial crises, and a global pandemic. The global financial crises are: The Great Depression (1929-1939), The International Debt Crisis (1982-1989), The Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1999), and The Great Recession (2007-2009).

This extension incorporates the transmission due to pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Furthermore, this model also captures the spread of the disease due to the movement of people to/from different administrative boundaries within a country. The model describes the probabilistic rise in the number of confirmed cases due to the concomitant effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple compartments. The associated parameters in the model can help architect the public health policy and operational management of the pandemic. For instance, this model demonstrates that increasing the testing for symptomatic patients does not have any major effect on the progression of the pandemic, but testing rate of the asymptomatic population has an extremely crucial role to play. The model is executed using the data obtained for the state of Chhattisgarh in the Republic of India. The model is shown to have significantly better predictive capability than the other epidemiological models. This model can be readily applied to any administrative boundary (state or country). Moreover, this model can be applied for any other epidemic as well.","output":"A Generalized Epidemiological Model for COVID-19 with Dynamic and Asymptomatic Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of general population lockdown implemented in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic needs to be evaluated. We describe here a longitudinal study on the mental health of adults in France. METHODS: We did a secondary analysis of a web-based cohort, initially set up to study home and leisure injuries, in order to measure the consequences of the national lockdown implemented in France from 17 March 2020 to 11 May 2020, and to assess potential vulnerability and resilience factors. Eligible participants were invited to answer an online questionnaire designed to assess their living conditions and health during lockdown. Comparisons were done with answers provided 4.8 years earlier on average. RESULTS: On 15th April 2020, we sent email invitations to 9598 participants recruited between November 2014 and December 2019 and 1237 volunteers took part in the study by completing the online questionnaire. The proportion of those with anxiety symptoms markedly increased from 17.3 to 20.1%. The average self-rated level of mental health decreased from 7.77 to 7.58. Women, the elderly and the youngest appeared to be more vulnerable. A small living space (less than 30 m(2)) was associated with an increase in depression symptoms (PHQ-9 score), and poorer self-rated physical health at recruitment was associated with an increase in anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score). On the contrary, the average self-rated level of physical health markedly increased from 7.44 to 7.94 between recruitment and lockdown, and the proportion of those who reported a level of 9 or 10 jumped from 25.7% at recruitment to 43.1% during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health deteriorated during lockdown in France during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. Overall, self-rated physical health improved but those who experienced a worse physical health were more likely to report anxiety symptoms.","output":"A longitudinal study of mental health before and during COVID-19 lockdown in the French population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: A high incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) is reported in patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19). Neutrophils may contribute to this through a process referred to as immunothrombosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of neutrophil subpopulations in blood preceding the development of COVID\\\\19 associated PE. METHODS: We studied COVID\\\\19 patients admitted to the ICU of our tertiary hospital between 19\\\\03\\\\2020 and 17\\\\05\\\\2020. Point\\\\of\\\\care fully automated flow cytometry was performed prior to ICU admission, measuring the neutrophil activation/maturation markers CD10, CD11b, CD16 and CD62L. Neutrophil receptor expression was compared between patients who did or did not develop PE (as diagnosed on CT angiography) during or after their ICU stay. RESULTS: Among 25 eligible ICU patients, 22 subjects were included for analysis, of whom nine developed PE.

However, due to extensive peripheral metabolism by aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), only a fraction of the levodopa dose reaches the brain unchanged. Thus, by preventing levodopa metabolism and increasing the availability of levodopa for uptake into the brain, the inhibition of COMT would be beneficial in Parkinsons disease. Although nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors have been used in the treatment of Parkinsons disease, efforts have been made to discover non-nitrocatechol inhibitors. In the present study, the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one scaffold was selected for the design and synthesis of non-nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors since the COMT inhibitory potential of this class has been illustrated. Using COMT obtained from porcine liver, it was shown that a synthetic series of ten 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones are in vitro inhibitors with IC(50) values ranging from 4.55 to 19.8 M. Although these compounds are not highly potent inhibitors, they may act as leads for the development of non-nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors. Such compounds would be appropriate for the treatment of Parkinsons disease. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: 3-Hydroxypyridin-4-ones have been synthesised and evaluated as non-nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors.

The CE program was a 2.5 to 2.67 contact hour webinar delivered in July 2020, October 2020, and February 2021. Content included COVID-19 prevention, diagnosis, and management and was updated before the second and third webinars. Changes in content and webinar audience participation in the question and answer portion were reflected in the CE credit awarded. Preactivity and postactivity knowledge, competence, and confidence levels were assessed among activity completers. Changes between the preactivity and postactivity evaluation were compared. A total of 2,901 learners were included in the analysis, of whom 91.6% were NPs. Overall, baseline knowledge of COVID-19 transmission, diagnosis, and treatment was low. Substantial improvements in knowledge, competence, and confidence were reported from baseline to postactivity evaluation, with increases of 47-73% overall. Furthermore, learner confidence in identifying patients at risk for severe COVID-19 and counseling patients on prevention and transmission significantly increased. Despite plans to implement strategies to improve COVID-19 management, several barriers to uptake were identified. The rapid development of a COVID-19 CE program resulted in substantial gains in NP knowledge related to prevention, diagnosis, and management, with possible implications for nearly 68,000 patient encounters per month.","output":"Measuring the impact of a COVID-19 continuing education program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Takotsubo Syndrome (TTS) is a condition of transient left ventricular dysfunction that is typically triggered by emotional or physical stress.

The main findings of this article allow the community to develop a new strategy to protect the environment against the hazardous effects of disinfectants. Therefore, we use the \\"toxicity calculated ratio (TC ratio)\\" that refers to the fold increase or decrease in the toxicities reported in the literature (NOEC, LOEC, LC50 and EC50) relative to the WHO-recommended dose of HP and HC. The calculated TC ratios are valuable for policy makers to formulate the regulations to prevent disinfectant exposure in the environment. Our results were collected via PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis) guidelines and showed that the TC ratios are from the single digits to several thousand-fold lower than the HP and HC recommended dose, which means these disinfectants are potentially dangerous to non-target organisms. The results also showed that HP and HC are toxic to the growth and reproduction of non-target organisms. Therefore, we recommend policymakers formulate protocols for critical assessment and monitoring of the environment-especially on non-target organisms in water bodies located in and around disinfectant-exposed areas to safeguard the environment in the future.","output":"Outdoor disinfectant sprays for the prevention of COVID-19: Are they safe for the environment?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic caused by COVID-19 affects our lives in all aspects.

There are however some countries and cities which appear to have contained the pandemic. Common to these countries are environmental factors including the levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and ambient salinity. METHOD: PM2.5 and ambient salinity were assessed in a number of cities, differentially affected by Covid-19 infection. The cities chosen to be assessed were divided into two groups. The first group included cities having significantly high rates of Covid-19 infection, while the second group consisted of coastal cities or small island countries, all of which have low rates of Covid-19 infection. Minimum and maximum levels of PM2.5 were obtained from the Air Quality Index, one month before and one month after statutory lockdown. Salinity levels were obtained from a study that assessed chloride ion wet deposition, a surrogate for ambient salinity. RESULTS: One month prior to the statutory national lock-down or mandatory restrictions, there appear to be high levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 67.4 - 118.7 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to lower levels in countries that have contained the infection (min-max 45.6 - 79.8) (p<0.046). One month after national restrictions there still appeared to be higher levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 51 - 90.5 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to countries that have contained the infection (min-max 42.7 - 69.5 AQI) but this was not statistically significant. There seemed to be an inverse relationship between Covid-19 infection and ambient salinity levels. Countries that were spared high Covid-19 infection rates, besides their geographical isolation, also have higher ambient salinity levels (124 - 617mgCl/m2/TAG) compared to salinity levels noted in countries with high Covid-19 rates of infection (28.4 - 162. mgCl/m2/TAG) (p<0.003). CONCLUSION: High levels of PM2.5 in the presence of low ambient salinity may increase the risk of Covid-19 infection in the population. Addressing these two environmental factors may attenuate the severity of the pandemic.

CVD risk scores underestimate risk in this population as CVD is driven by clustering of traditional and non-traditional risk factors, which lead to prognostic pathological changes in cardiovascular structure and function. While exercise may mitigate CVD in this population, evidence is limited, and physical activity levels and patient activation towards exercise and self-management are low. This pilot study will assess the feasibility of delivering a structured, home-based exercise intervention in a population of KTRs at increased cardiometabolic risk and evaluate the putative effects on cardiovascular structural and functional changes, cardiorespiratory fitness, quality of life, patient activation, healthcare utilisation and engagement with the prescribed exercise programme. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Fifty KTRs will be randomised 1:1 to: (1) the intervention; a 12week, home-based combined resistance and aerobic exercise intervention; or (2) the control; usual care. Intervention participants will have one introductory session for instruction and practice of the recommended exercises prior to receiving an exercise diary, dumbbells, resistance bands and access to instructional videos. The study will evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, randomisation, retention, assessment procedures and the intervention implementation. Outcomes, to be assessed prior to randomisation and postintervention, include: cardiac structure and function with stress perfusion cardiac MRI, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, blood biomarkers of cardiometabolic health, quality of life and patient activation.

However, their diagnostic potential as a chest CT imaging parameter has only rarely been exploited. The purpose of this study is to develop a robust method for automated lung vessel segmentation and morphology analysis and apply it to a large chest CT dataset. METHODS In total, 509 non-enhanced chest CTs (NECTs) and 563 CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPAs) were included. Sub-groups were patients with healthy lungs (group_NORM, n = 634) and those RT-PCR-positive for Influenza A/B (group_INF, n = 159) and SARS-CoV-2 (group_COV, n = 279). A lung vessel segmentation algorithm (LVSA) based on traditional image processing was developed, validated with a point-of-interest approach, and applied to a large clinical dataset. Total blood vessel volume in lung (TBV) and the blood vessel volume percentage (BV%) of three blood vessel size types were calculated and compared between groups: small (BV5%, cross-sectional area < 5 mm2), medium (BV5-10%, 5-10 mm2) and large (BV10%, >10 mm2). RESULTS Sensitivity of the LVSA was 84.6% (95 %CI: 73.9-95.3) for NECTs and 92.8% (95 %CI: 90.8-94.7) for CTPAs. In viral pneumonia, besides an increased TBV, the main finding was a significantly decreased BV5% in group_COV (n = 14%) and group_INF (n = 15%) compared to group_NORM (n = 18%) [p < 0.001]. At the same time, BV10% was increased (group_COV n = 15% and group_INF n = 14% vs. group_NORM n = 11%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION In COVID-19 and Influenza, the blood vessel volume is redistributed from small to large vessels in the lung.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed records of 96 adult patients who underwent lung transplantation at our institution between August 2008 and January 2016. Time-to-tracheostomy was defined based on timing of the procedure: \\"early\\" if less than 3 days or \\"late\\" if 3 or more days after lung transplantation. RESULTS Forty-nine patients (51%) underwent tracheostomy 3.2  1.8 days after lung transplantation. Among these patients, 21 patients (42.9%) underwent early tracheostomy and 28 patients (57.1%) underwent late tracheostomy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that preoperative performance status was a significant predictor for tracheostomy (p = 0.006, odds ratio 2.72). Patients in the early tracheostomy group began walking (p = 0.003) and oral feeding (p = 0.0006) earlier and had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.04) and shorter length of intensive care unit (p = 0.01) and hospital stay (p = 0.04) than patients in the late tracheostomy group. No significant differences in postoperative walking (p = 0.06), oral feeding (p = 0.17), or length of hospital stay (p = 0.37) were observed between patients who underwent early tracheostomy and those who did not undergo tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS Early tracheostomy following lung transplantation decreased both intensive care and hospital stay, due to improved postoperative recovery, even in patients with poor preoperative conditions.

METHODS: Consecutive patients with nonsevere COVID-19 were retrospectively included. Asymptomatic patients with normal body temperature and no evidence of pneumonia throughout the disease course were classified in the asymptomatic group. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was repeated every two to five days after the first follow-up RT-PCR assay. Negative conversion was defined as two consecutive negative results of RT-PCR assays within a 24-h interval. Rebound of threshold cycle (Ct) value was defined as negative from the single RT-PCR assay and positive from the following assay. RESULTS: Among a total of 396 patients [age, 42.5 (25.0C55.0) years; males, 35.6%], 68 (17.2%) and 328 (82.8%) patients were in the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups, respectively.

Sustainable industrial relations processes are considered in shaping the flexibility of the labour market in 15 European Union Member States from 2009 to 2018.

A five-step quantitative MCDA method is formulated using published data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The results indicate that the TOPSIS method is an appropriate approach for measuring labour market flexibility internationally. Moreover, in relation to workforce phenomena, the findings show that the method offers the possibility of examining the impact of particular factors related to social and employment policies of a country in terms of sustainable development and socioeconomic growth. The lack of precision tools to forecast the development of national and transnational labour marketsparticularly during the COVID-19 erahighlights the importance of such a method for workforce planners and policymakers.

Currently, it has been revealed that patients with underlying disease, especially those with kidney disease are more prone to develop complications. Some studies associate kidney transplantation as a risk factor for COVID-19 progression; however, epidemiologic data that demonstrate this are amazingly rare. Considering the importance of the topic, we report on six kidney transplant recipients (median age 47 [41-55]) with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. The most common admission presentations were fever (83.3%), dyspnea, and myalgia. At baseline, immunosuppressive therapy was ceased, prednisolone dose was increased, and all patients received antiviral treatment including hydroxychloroquine and umifenovir. After a median follow-up of 11.5 days from admission, six patients (100%) developed acute kidney injury (AKI), 50% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and two patients (33.3%) deceased as a result of deterioration in respiratory status. Overall, these findings demonstrate that respiratory involvement may be a risk indicator of in-hospital mortality in kidney recipients with COVID-19. In addition, AKI development in kidney recipients with COVID-19 is of utmost importance given the higher AKI occurrence in these patients compared with others. Therefore, more intensive attention should be paid to kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 progression in kidney transplant recipients: a single-center case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For over 35 years since Mosmann and Coffman proposed the seminal \\"type 1 T helper (Th1)/type 2 T helper (Th2)\\" hypothesis in 1986, the immunological community has appreciated that na?ve CD4 T cells need to make important decisions upon their activation, namely to differentiate towards a Th1, Th2, Th17 (interleukin-17-producing T helper), follicular T helper (Tfh), or regulatory T cell (Treg) fate to orchestrate a variety of adaptive immune responses. The major molecular underpinnings of the Th1/Th2 effector fate choice had been initially characterized using excellent reductionist in vitro culture systems, through which the transcription factors T-bet and GATA3 were identified as the master regulators for the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. However, Th1/Th2 cell differentiation and their cellular heterogeneity are usually determined by a combinatorial expression of multiple transcription factors, particularly in vivo, where dendritic cell (DC) and innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets can also influence T helper lineage choices. In addition, inflammatory cytokines that are capable of inducing Th17 cell differentiation are also found to be induced during typical Th1- or Th2-related immune responses, resulting in an alternative differentiation pathway, transiting from a Th17 cell phenotype towards Th1 or Th2 cells. In this review, we will discuss the recent advances in the field, focusing on some new players in the transcriptional network, contributions of DCs and ILCs, and alternative differentiation pathways towards understanding the Th1/Th2 effector choice in vivo.","output":"Recent advances in understanding the Th1/Th2 effector choice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: There is limited evidence of work-related transmission in the emerging coronaviral pandemic. We aimed to identify high-risk occupations for early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) local transmission. METHODS: In this observational study, we extracted confirmed COVID-19 cases from governmental investigation reports in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. We followed each country/area for 40 days after its first locally transmitted case, and excluded all imported cases. We defined a possible work-related case as a worker with evidence of close contact with another confirmed case due to work, or an unknown contact history but likely to be infected in the working environment (e.g. an airport taxi driver). We calculated the case number for each occupation, and illustrated the temporal distribution of all possible work-related cases and healthcare worker (HCW) cases. The temporal distribution was further defined as early outbreak (the earliest 10 days of the following period) and late outbreak (11th to 40th days of the following period). RESULTS: We identified 103 possible work-related cases (14.9%) among a total of 690 local transmissions. The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%). Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases). Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals). CONCLUSIONS: Work-related transmission is considerable in early COVID-19 outbreaks, and the elevated risk of infection was not limited to HCW.

Along this line of research, temporal network has come out to be one of the most promising network platforms to investigate. Especially, such network with spatially moving agents has been established to be capable of modelling a number of practical instances. In this paper, we examine the dynamical outcomes of moving agents interacting based upon their physical proximity. For this, we particularly emphasize on the impact of competing interactions among the agents depending on their physical distance. We specifically assume attractive coupling between agents which are staying apart from each other, whereas we adopt repulsive interaction for agents that are sufficiently close in space. With this set-up, we consider two types of coupling configurations, symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving couplings. We encounter variants of collective dynamics ranging from synchronization, inhomogeneous small oscillation to cluster state and extreme events while changing the attractive and repulsive coupling strengths. We have been able to map all these dynamical behaviors in the coupling parameter space. Complete synchronization being the most desired state in absence of repulsive coupling, we present an analytical study for this scenario that agrees well with the numerical results.","output":"Distance dependent competitive interactions in a frustrated network of mobile agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With a certain amount of filtration efficiency with rated flow, the structural design of HEPA filter at present is how to obtain the minimum pressure drop with the corrugation angle (for the type with isolator), the corrugation height (for the type with isolator) or the line height (for the type without isolator), and the passage depth (for both types).","output":"Structural Design of HEPA Filter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To report short-term complications and long-term outcomes of thoracoscopic pericardial window for management of pericardial effusion in dogs.

How are the dynamics of IL-15 and its receptors altered during the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, and how is IL-15 regulated? What is the main finding and its importance? ABSTRACT: Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a myokine in the Interleukin-2 (IL-2) family that is generated in the skeletal muscle during exercise. The functional effect of IL-15 involves muscle regeneration and metabolic regulation in skeletal muscle. Reports have indicated that the mechanism of Interleukin-15 receptor subunit alpha (IL-15RA) regulates IL-15 localization in immune cells. However, the dynamic of IL-15 and its receptors, which regulate the IL-15 pathway in skeletal muscle differentiation, have not yet been clarified. This study investigated the mechanism of IL-15 regulation using a mouse skeletal muscle cell line, C2C12 cells. We found that the mRNA expression of IL-15, Interleukin 2 Receptor Subunit Beta (IL-2RB) (CD122), and Interleukin 2 Receptor Subunit Gamma (IL-2RG) (CD132) increased, but that IL-15RA exhibits different kinetics as differentiation progresses. We also found that IL-15, mainly localized in the cytosol, preassembled with IL-15RA in the cytosol and fused to the plasma membrane. Moreover, IL-15RA increased IL-15 protein levels. Our findings suggest that genes comprising the IL-15 signaling complex are enhanced with the differentiation of myotubes and that IL-15RA regulates the protein kinetics of IL-15 signaling in skeletal muscle.

Because of the state of immunodepression, they are perceived as vulnerable and at high risk of contracting the virus. This may lead to a delay in the health care routine. Objectives: The aim of our study was to assess the routine of patients with rheumatic diseases in the era of covid-19. Methods: We conducted a prospective study after the outbreak of Covid-19 including patients with RD: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Spondylarthritis (SpA). All of them were invited to answer a questionnaire about adherence to protective measures, health services, hospital visits, treatment modalities, as well as the level of satisfaction with the medical support or information received for COVID-19. We also evaluated the post-traumatic state (PTS) with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). A cut-off point fixed at 33 provided the best diagnostic accuracy for PTS. The level of significance was fixed at 0.05. Results: The study included 60 patients with a female predominance (sex ratio=1.7). The mean age was 51.3  13.1 years [18-75] and the mean disease duration was 11.9 5.6 [1-23] years. Forty-two patients had RA and 18 patients had SpA. The majority of respondents were women (63.3%), married (81.7%), with a household size of 3-5 people (67.9%). The mean DASS depression and anxiety subscale was 9.5 7.6 [2-32] and 12.6  8.2 [1-35] respectively. PTS was found in 25% of cases. Twenty-two patients stopped working in the second outbreak. The adherence to protective measures was as follows: compliance with lock-down (92.5%), adherence to stay home warnings (82%), wearing masks (96.3%), social distancing (68%), and washing hands immediately after sneezing (59.3%). Information was mainly sourced from both social media and the Internet in 78.2% of cases. Most of the patients were satisfied with the information provided and only 5 demanded more information about vaccination protocol. Of the patients having direct contact with a person affected with Covid-19 (20%), seven patients experienced symptoms. Three patients were diagnosed with SARS-COV2 and three other patients were hospitalized because of flares. The majority of the respondents (98.2%) had confidence in their own doctors' ability to recognize Covid-19. The majority of patients (91%) were afraid of getting sick and 83.1% feared stigma and discrimination after the infection. Fifty patients did attend their consultation appointment and 13.3% had a phone consultation. About a third of patients (26.7%) of patients experienced a delay in treatment. A positive correlation was found between marital status and the fear of other family members getting Covid-19 (p=0.029). Patients who did not consult experienced more PTS and severe anxiety than those who did not delay hospital visits (p=0.07, p=0.04 respectively). Conclusion: Our study showed that during the outbreak of Covid-19, patients with RD exhibited a high level of protection towards the virus.

Triaging supply is one proposed strategy; however, few data concerning the urgency of transfusion are available to inform planning. This study sought to determine the proportion of red blood cells (RBCs) used for clinically urgent indications. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 5132 RBC units were randomly selected at point of production and distributed into general statewide inventory over a 9-month period. These selected units carried case report forms, for completion at the point of hospital issue for transfusion. Completed forms were returned to the blood service for collation and analysis, capturing information on indication and clinical urgency of supply, including use for potentially deferrable elective surgery. RESULTS Data from 5052 RBC units indicated that 95.6% were transfused. Approximately one-third of transfused units were used to support surgery, one-third for hematology/oncology, and one-third for other medical and miscellaneous indications. Where used for surgery, 25.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.4%-28.0%) were for elective procedures, although urgency of surgery was unknown in 17.1% (95% CI, 15.2%-19.2%) of cases. Supply for nonurgent medical indications and elective surgery only accounted for 9.8% (95% CI, 9.0%-10.6%) of use, with 53.4% (95% CI, 52.0%-54.8%) of RBCs required within 24 hours.

With the development of humanistic attitudes in society, the importance of issues related to the subjective well-being of the individual increases. It is important not only how successful a person is at work or in educational activities, but also how well he/she feels. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the learning environment for university students. The study of the factors of subjective well-being of students expands the instrumental capabilities of psychological support during the pandemic. In the case of a repetition of a similar situation, this knowledge will be useful for helping students, and potentially a wider circle of people, to maintain subjective well-being. Aim. The present research aimed to investigate the subjective well-being of students of psychological and pedagogical directions of universities during the pandemic with an emphasis on its emotional component. Methodology and research methods. The research methodology is based on the subjective approach, which considers a student as an active subject, capable of successfully adapting to the changed conditions of an educational activity. In the course of the research, the authors identified the interrelationships of subjective well-being, its semantic markers and self-organisation to expand the possibilities of diagnosing subjective well-being and maintaining it during the periods of extreme social situations, as well as to use semantic markers for self-analysis. To assess subjective well-being, three methods were applied. Self-assessment of satisfaction with one's condition on a 10-point scale was carried out according to the following parameters: sleep, food, communication with family, communication with friends, studies, hobbies, and mood. The authors employed the scale of subjective well-being (by . Perrudet-Badoux, G. Mendelsohn, J. Chiche, adapted by M. V. Sokolova) and psychosemantic characteristics of the subjective attitude to the situation of distance learning at the university due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess the ability of students to organise themselves in the changed learning conditions, the questionnaire of self-organisation of activities (N. T. Feather  M. J. Bond, adapted by E. Yu. Mandrikova) was used. The study involved 406 students between the ages of 18 and 45 years (383 women and 23 men) studying in the areas of psychology and pedagogy at the University of Tyumen and State Kurgan State University. For statistical analysis of the research data, the Mann-Whitney U Test and correlation analysis were used. Results. It was found that the ability to self-organise leads to higher subjective well-being, and this, in turn, stimulates self-organisation. Semantic markers of subjective well-being associated with educational activities during the pandemic, such as comfortable and uncomfortable, interesting and uninteresting, tired and vigorous, were highlighted. The authors revealed objective parameters associated with self-organisation and subjective well-being, namely sleep disturbances. This can lead to the fact that there is not enough daytime and the student works at night, thereby resulting in the disturbance of night sleep, and consequently - poor self-organisation. Scientific novelty._The parameters of subjective well-being and self-organisation of students in a new, extreme social situation, during the COVID-19 pandemic are considered. Practical significance._The data obtained can be used to develop a strategy for teaching students in a pandemic situation and forced self-isolation, as well as to increase subjective well-being in a new social situation. The research results can be applied in psychodiagnostics for a more complete interpretation of the parameters of subjective well-being, as well as for the use of the identified relationships in the programmes of psychological support for students of psychological and pedagogical specialities. Semantic markers of subjective well-being that have received empirical justification can be employed to create a diagnostic scale. ? 2021 Russian State V cational Pedagogical University.

We aimed to report and explore patients with anti-Ma2 antibody-associated paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome (Ma2-PNS) who frequently exhibit sensorimotor neuropathy (SMN) using a new method of factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD). Clinical data from a case series of eight patients with definite diagnoses were retrospectively reviewed. FAMD conducted further analyses with a comprehensive visualization in R software.

While vascular alterations have been associated with IPF previously, the contribution of lung vasculature during injury resolution and fibrosis is not well understood. To compare the role of endothelial cells (ECs) in resolving and non-resolving models of lung fibrosis, we applied bleomycin intratracheally to young and aged mice. We found that injury in aged mice elicited capillary rarefaction, while injury in young mice resulted in increased capillary density. ECs from the lungs of injured aged mice relative to young mice demonstrated elevated pro-fibrotic and reduced vascular homeostasis gene expression. Among the latter, Nos3 (encoding the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase, eNOS) was transiently upregulated in lung ECs from young but not aged mice following injury. Young mice deficient in eNOS recapitulated the non-resolving lung fibrosis observed in aged animals following injury, suggesting that eNOS directly participates in lung fibrosis resolution. Activation of the NO receptor soluble guanylate cyclase in human lung fibroblasts reduced TGF?-induced pro-fibrotic gene and protein expression. Additionally, loss of eNOS in human lung ECs reduced the suppression of TGF?-induced lung fibroblast activation in 2D and 3D co-cultures. Altogether, our results demonstrate that persistent lung fibrosis in aged mice is accompanied by capillary rarefaction, loss of EC identity, and impaired eNOS expression. Targeting vascular function may thus be critical to promote lung repair and fibrosis resolution in aging and IPF.","output":"Vascular dysfunction in aged mice contributes to persistent lung fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fibrinolysis is an important process in hemostasis responsible for dissolving the clot during wound healing. Plasmin is a central enzyme in this process via its capacity to cleave fibrin. The kinetics of plasmin generation (PG) and inhibition during fibrinolysis have been poorly understood until the recent development of assays to quantify these metrics. The assessment of plasmin kinetics allows for the identification of fibrinolytic dysfunction and better understanding of the relationships between abnormal fibrin dissolution and disease pathogenesis. Additionally, direct measurement of the inhibition of PG by antifibrinolytic medications, such as tranexamic acid, can be a useful tool to assess the risks and effectiveness of antifibrinolytic therapy in hemorrhagic diseases. This review provides an overview of available PG assays to directly measure the kinetics of plasmin formation and inhibition in human and mouse plasmas and focuses on their applications in defining the role of plasmin in diseases, including angioedema, hemophilia, rare bleeding disorders, COVID-19, or diet-induced obesity.

However, this is a new technology, which means that there is significant uncertainty about possible production at a large scale and speed. Vaccines of mRNA work by providing our cells with the genetic code to make viral proteins. Once proteins that do not cause any disease are produced, the body triggers an immune response against the virus, allowing them to develop immunity. mRNA can be used to make any protein theoretically.

The severity of COVID-19 may be influenced by a counterbalance between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV2 cleaves with ACE2 and enters cells leaving an unopposed effect of ACE in the lungs. Both 2D:4D and the ACE I/D polymorphism are covariates of oxygen metabolism. COVID-19 leads to lung damage and a reduction in oxygen saturation of the blood. Here, we examine the interrelationships between 2D:4D, ACE polymorphism, and COVID-19 CFR. Methods National frequencies/rates were obtained for 2D:4D from the BBC Internet study (n = 41), published values of ACE I/II (n = 39), and COVID-19 CFR from three World Health Organization situation reports (n = 41). Results 2D:4D was negatively associated with national ACE I/II frequencies. However, there was a positive relationship between male 2D:4D and CFR (right and left 2D:4D, two, and three situation reports respectively). The relationships between ACE I/II and CFR were non-significant. Relationships between male 2D:4D and CFR's were independent of female 2D:4D and ACE I/II. Conclusions The ACE I/D polymorphism may influence 2D:4D such that ACE II individuals have lower 2D:4D than ACE  individuals. Low 2D:4D and ACE II individuals show efficient oxygen metabolism. Therefore, low 2D:4D and ACE II together may protect against COVID-19 severity. The sex-dependent positive correlation between male 2D:4D and CFR is independent of ACE I/II, suggesting that the sex-dependent variation in the ACE2 gene may also influence the 2D:4D phenotype.","output":"Understanding COVID-19: A hypothesis regarding digit ratio (2D:4D), ACE I/D polymorphism, oxygen metabolism and national case fatality rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article proposes the quality of life (QOL) construct as a framework from which to develop useful indicators to operationalize, measure, and implement the Articles of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).

Neurological complications occur in COVID-19. We aimed to examine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of COVID-19 subjects with neurological complications and determine presence of neuroinflammatory changes implicated in pathogenesis. METHODS. Cross-sectional study of CSF neuroinflammatory profiles from 18 COVID-19 subjects with neurological complications categorized by diagnosis (stroke, encephalopathy, headache) and illness severity (critical, severe, moderate, mild). COVID-19 CSF was compared with CSF from healthy, infectious and neuroinflammatory disorders and stroke controls (n=82). Cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A), inflammation and coagulation markers (high-sensitivity-C Reactive Protein [hsCRP], ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, Factor VIII) and neurofilament light chain (NF-L), were quantified. SARS-CoV2 RNA and SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgA antibodies in CSF were tested with RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS. CSF from COVID-19 subjects showed a paucity of neuroinflammatory changes, absence of pleocytosis or specific increases in pro-inflammatory markers or cytokines (IL-6, ferritin, or D-dimer). Anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies in CSF of COVID-19 subjects (77%) were observed despite no evidence of SARS-CoV2 viral RNA. A similar increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha;, IL-12p70) and IL-10 in CSF of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 stroke subjects was observed compared to controls. CSF-NF-L was elevated in subjects with stroke and critical COVID-19. CSF-hsCRP was present almost exclusively in COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION. The paucity of neuroinflammatory changes in CSF of COVID-19 subjects and lack of SARS-CoV2 RNA do not support the presumed neurovirulence of SARS-CoV2 or neuroinflammation in pathogenesis of neurological complications in COVID-19. Elevated CSF-NF-L indicates neuroaxonal injury in COVID-19 cases.

These measures may impact communication and relationship between nurses, patients and caregivers especially in a complex environment, such as a paediatric setting. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study design was adopted. Reporting followed the COREQ guidelines. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in two wards of a maternal and child health hospital in north-east Italy. Data were collected between September and November 2020. Transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen caregivers and 17 nurses were recruited using convenience sampling.

As a prerequisite to conducting a randomised controlled trial to examine programme effectiveness, this project is evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of implementing and evaluating a PFA training programme (LIVES for Families) for mental health (MH) practitioners to improve their ability to recognise and respond to COVID-19-related psychological distress among their clients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are using a triangulation mixed methods research design; complementary strands of quantitative and qualitative data are being collected in parallel and will be merged at the interpretation phase of the project. The quantitative strand uses a repeated measures design; a consecutive sample of MH practitioners (n=80) providing MH support to young people or their families are being recruited to participate in the LIVES for Families PFA training programme and complete quantitative measures at baseline (pretraining), 2-week and 6-month follow-up time points. The qualitative strand uses fundamental description and semistructured interviews with a subset of practitioners (n=30), as well as managers of MH agencies (n=20). A mixed methods joint display and associated narrative will generate a comprehensive understanding regarding acceptability and feasibility. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board approved the study (project number: 11295). Results will be shared broadly with the policy and practice community through publications, presentations and public webinars. As a brief, evidence-informed intervention, the LIVES for Families PFA training programme is suitable in its mode of delivery across care settings. The outcomes of this study could have international implications for mitigating the MH impacts of viral pandemics.","output":"LIVES for families psychological first aid training programme to address COVID-19 psychological distress: a mixed methods acceptability and feasibility protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the pathogenicity of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strain NH (passage 10, P10) was evaluated We found that PDCoV strain NH is enteropathogenic in 5-day-old pigs Pathogenicity experiments provided a challenge model for studying the protection efficiency of passive immunity In order to investigate the protective efficacy of passive immunity in newborn piglets, pregnant sows were vaccinated with either a PDCoV-inactivated vaccine at the Houhai acupoint (n = 5) or DMEM as a negative control (n = 2) using a prime/boost strategy 20 and 40 days before delivery PDCoV spike (S)-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody (NA) responses were detected in immunized sows and piglets born to immunized sows PDCoV spike (S)-specific sIgA was also detected in the colostrum and milk of immunized sows Five days post-farrowing, piglets were orally challenged with PDCoV strain NH (10(5) TCID50 /piglet) Severe diarrhoea, high levels of viral RNA copies and substantial intestinal villus atrophy were detected in piglets born to unimmunized sows Only 4 of 31 piglets (12 9%) born to immunized sows in the challenge group displayed mild to moderate diarrhoea, lower viral RNA copies and minor intestinal villi damage compared to piglets born to unimmunized sows post-challenge Mock piglets exhibited no typical clinical symptoms The challenge experiment results indicated that the inactivated PDCoV vaccine exhibited 87 1% protective efficacy in the piglets These findings suggest that the inactivated PDCoV vaccine has the potential to be an effective vaccine, providing protection against virulent PDCoV","output":"Pathogenicity of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strain NH and immunization of pregnant sows with an inactivated PDCoV vaccine protects 5-day-old neonatal piglets from virulent challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Aim of our study was to evaluate the outcomes of a consecutive series of patients who were treated with a decompressing colostomy (DC) for acute left-sided colorectal obstruction. METHOD A consecutive series of 100 patients with acute left-sided colorectal obstruction who underwent DC from January 2015 to August 2020 was retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics, etiology of the obstruction, postoperative morbidity- and mortality rates, DC-related complication and stoma reversal rates were evaluated. RESULTS Of the 100 included patients, 64 had malignant- and 36 had benign obstruction. The mean age was 69 years, 42% was male, and the ASA score was 2. Morbidity and mortality rates after DC construction were 20 and 2%, respectively. In 39% of the patients, DC ended up as a permanent stoma and in 61% as bridge to surgery (BtS). DC related complication rate was 32%, with a re-intervention rate of 9%. Elective colorectal resection was performed in 59 cases (59%) with subsequent postoperative morbidity rate of 20%. Stoma reversal rate was 77% for the patients who underwent DC as BtS. Stoma reversal was performed in 66% of the patients with benign obstruction and in 36% for oncological obstruction. CONCLUSION DC as bridge to possible elective resection for acute left-sided colorectal obstruction is an effective strategy with low morbidity and mortality rates and a high stoma reversal rate, especially for benign obstruction. However, DC is less appropriate for patients in whom DC turns out to be a permanent stoma due to a relatively high stoma related complications.","output":"Clinical outcome of decompressing colostomy for acute left-sided colorectal obstruction: a consecutive series of 100 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Direct visualization of the key features of coronavirus genomes can lead to a better understanding of this virus as well as a method to distinguish this type of virus from others.

For example, the life-forms presenting in both unicellular and multicellular formats invite us to rethink microbial existence, organization, growth, pathogenicity, and therapeutics in the 21st century. A view of such populations as parts of single organisms with a loose, distributed multicellular organization, introduced here as a germ-ganism, rather than communities, might open up interesting prospects for diagnostics and therapeutics innovation. This study tested and further contextualized the concept of germ-ganism using solid cultures of bacteria and fungi. Based on our findings and the literature reviewed herein, we propose that germ-ganism has synergy with a systems medicine approach by broadening host-environment interactions from cells and microorganisms to a scale of biological ecosystems. Germ-ganism also brings about the possibility of studying the multilevel impacts of novel therapeutic agents within and across networks of microbial ecosystems. The germ-ganism would lend itself, in the long term, to a veritable biocybernetics system, while in the mid-term, we anticipate it will contribute to new diagnostics and therapeutics. Biosecurity applications would be immensely affected by germ-ganism. Industrial applications of germ-ganism are of interest as a more sustainable alternative to costly solutions such as tampered strains/microorganisms. In conclusion, germ-ganism is informed by lessons from microbiome research and invites rethinking microbial existence, organization, and growth as an organism. Germ-ganism has vast ramifications for understanding pathogenicity, and clinical, biosecurity, and biotechnology applications in the current historical moment of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","output":"Beyond the Microbiome: Germ-ganism?

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcome of kyphoplasty with high-viscosity bone cement for treatment of stage III Kmmell disease without neurologic symptoms. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (11 males and 17 females, aged 57-82 years) with stage III Kmmell disease without neurologic symptoms were admitted to Jiangyin Peoples Hospital from May 2016 to May 2019, in which T11 vertebral body in 6 cases and T12 vertebral body in 14 cases, L1 vertebral body in 5 cases and L2 vertebral body in 3 cases were treated by kyphoplasty with high viscosity bone cement. At 1 day after operation and 1 year after follow up, postoperative pain and improvement of life ability were evaluated by the Visual Analogue Scale and Oswestry Disability Index. The recovery of vertebral height and correction of kyphosis were measured with X-ray films. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Jiangyin Peoples Hospital, approval No. [2017](021). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Totally 28 patients were followed up for 12-22 months. No serious complications such as wound infection or pulmonary embolism were found during treatment. Asymptomatic cement leakage occurred in three patients. Adjacent vertebral fracture was encountered in 1 patient at 3 months after operation, and healed after kyphoplasty. (2) Visual Analogue Scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and kyphotic angle were lower at 1 day and 1 year after operation than those before operation in 28 patients (P < 0.05). The height of anterior, middle and posterior edges of vertebral body at 1 day and 1 year after operation was higher than that before operation (P < 0.05). (3) The results showed that kyphoplasty with high-viscosity bone cement can relieve back pain, improve viability, retain the vertebral body height, reduce kyphosis, and restore spinal alignment, and is an effective method for treatment of stage III Kmmell disease.

Fungicides are widely used to control ShB in agriculture. However, decades of excessive traditional fungicide use have led to environmental pollution and increased pathogen resistance. Generally, plant elicitors are regarded as environmentally friendly biological pesticides that enhance plant disease resistance by triggering plant immunity. Previously, we identified that the plant immune inducer ZhiNengCong (ZNC), a crude extract of the endophyte, has high activity and a strong ability to protect plants against pathogens. Here, we further found that guanine, which had a significant effect on inducing plant resistance to pathogens, might be an active component of ZNC. In our study, guanine activated bursts of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Moreover, guanine-induced plant resistance to pathogens depends on ethylene and jasmonic acid but is independent of the salicylic acid signaling pathway. Most importantly, guanine functions as a new plant elicitor with broad-spectrum resistance to activate plant immunity, providing an efficient and environmentally friendly biological elicitor for bacterial and fungal disease biocontrol.","output":"A Novel Guanine Elicitor Stimulates Immunity in Arabidopsis and Rice by Ethylene and Jasmonic Acid Signaling Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate change poses a huge threat.

This study, based on the extended parallel process model, aims to examine the effect of exposure to climate change-related information on SNSs on the pro-environmental behaviors of individuals. The study examines the mediation effect of fear of victimization from climate change between the exposure to climate change-related information on SNSs and pro-environmental behaviors, including the moderation effect of attention deficit and decision-making self-efficacy with the help of appropriate instruments. A total sample of 406 reliable questionnaires were collected from students using SNSs in China, and data were analyzed through SPSS and AMOS. Results indicate that the exposure to climate change-related information on SNSs has a direct positive effect on users pro-environmental behaviors ( = 0.299, p < 0.01). Fear of victimization from climate change also mediates the relationship between exposure to climate change-related information on SNSs and pro-environmental behaviors ( = 0.149, SE = 0.029, p < 0.01). In addition, attention deficit moderates the relationship of exposure to climate change-related information on SNSs with fear of victimization from climate change ( = ?0.090, p  0.01) and pro-environmental behaviors ( = ?0.090, p  0.05). Similarly, the relationship between fear of victimization from climate change and pro-environmental behaviors is moderated by decision-making self-efficacy ( = 0.267, p  0.01).

We have investigated the actions of JMS-053, a small PTP4A3 inhibitor, in both in vitro and in vivo models of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein subunit 1 (S1SP)-induced endothelial inflammation and acute lung injury. S1SP (10nM) caused a time-dependent endothelial barrier dysfunction in human lung microvascular endothelial cell monolayers that was ameliorated by JMS-053 (12.5M) administered either as pre-treatment (4 hours prior to S1SP) or post-treatment (5 hours after S1SP). In K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, which express the human ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 S1SP, we instilled S1SP intratracheally, post-treated with JMS-053 (10mg/kg i.p. at 1, 24 and 48 hours after S1SP) or vehicle, and investigated molecular, functional and histological outcomes 72 hours later.

Few existing targeted medications are available. Lianhuaqingwen (LH) capsule, a repurposed marketed Chinese herb product, has been proven effective for influenza. PURPOSE: To determine the safety and efficacy of LH capsule in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: We did a prospective multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial on LH capsule in confirmed cases with Covid-19. Patients were randomized to receive usual treatment alone or in combination with LH capsules (4 capsules, thrice daily) for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of symptom (fever, fatigue, coughing) recovery. RESULTS: We included 284 patients (142 each in treatment and control group) in the full-analysis set. The recovery rate was significantly higher in treatment group as compared with control group (91.5% vs. 82.4%, P=0.022). The median time to symptom recovery was markedly shorter in treatment group (median: 7 vs. 10 days, P<0.001).

It takes a fresh approach in terms of how likely Brazil will achieve its Nationally Determined Contributions Commitments in the energy sector. Many countries have implemented national climate policies to accomplish their pledged NDC and contribute to the temperature objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Based on official reports and databases of energy development projections in Brazil and the socioeconomic context, we discuss what can be expected for the future of the Brazilian energy sector, the probability of implementing selected technologies, and the prospects of reaching the NDC targets for 2025 and 2030. In addition, this paper provides an overview of the current stage of development of these technologies, main directions, and bottlenecks in Brazil. Analyses have shown that the Brazilian renewable matrix tends to remain significant, driven by the development of solar and mostly small hydroelectric power sources, as well as different types of biomass. In addition, the system will include the replacement of thermoelectric plants powered by diesel and fuel oil by natural gas plants. The prospects for Brazil's official energy plan for 2027 are aligned with the reference technology scenario, which represents the business as usual scenario. Despite this, low-carbon technologies could be implemented far beyond the NDC's goals, given the abundance of renewable natural resources in the country.","output":"How likely is Brazil to achieve its NDC commitments in the energy sector?

The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements such as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug-biomarker pairing. Chronic exposure to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and increased QT interval from day 6 onwards. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onwards and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results closely mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4-8.. Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials. Furthermore, biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients serum, were identified for negative effects of single drug or polytherapy on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection. The cardiac MPS can predict clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities.

In selected cases, surgical PDA ligation may be required. The timing for PDA ligation may depend upon a variety of factors, with potential clinical implications. We aimed to investigate the impact of different surgical PDA managements on ligation timing and neonatal outcomes. Inborn infants < 32 weeks of gestation and < 1500 g admitted at two tertiary Neonatal Intensive Care Units that underwent PDA ligation between 2007 and 2018 were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study and split into the following groups based on their surgical management: on-site bedside PDA ligation (ONS) vs. referral to an off-site pediatric cardiac surgery (OFS). Neonatal characteristics, surgical timing, and clinical outcomes of the enrolled infants were compared between the groups. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of PDA ligation timing on significantly different outcomes. Seventy-eight neonates (ONS, n = 39; OFS, n = 39) were included. Infants in the ONS group underwent PDA ligation significantly earlier than those in the OFS group (median age 12 vs. 36 days, p < 0.001) with no increase in postoperative mortality and complications. The multivariate analysis revealed a significant association between PDA ligation timing, late-onset sepsis prevalence (OR 1.045, 0.032), and oxygen need at discharge (OR 1.037, p = 0.025). Conclusions: Compared with off-site surgery, on-site bedside ligation allows an earlier surgical closure of PDA, with no apparent increase in mortality or complications. Earlier PDA ligation may contribute to reduced rates of late-onset sepsis and post-discharge home oxygen therapy, with possible cost-benefit implications.

As these conditions are associated with high risk of myocardial dysfunction, we investigated the effects of IFN?3 on 3D fibrin-based engineered human cardiac tissues (\\"cardiobundles\\"). Cardiobundles were fabricated from human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, exposed to 0-20 ng/ml of IFN?3 on culture days 7-14, and assessed for changes in tissue structure, viability, contractile force and calcium transient generation, action potential propagation, cytokine secretion, and expression of select genes and proteins. We found that application of IFN?3 induced a dose-dependent reduction in contractile force generation, deterioration of sarcomeric organization, and cardiomyocyte disarray, without significantly altering cell viability, action potential propagation, or calcium transient amplitude. At molecular level, the IFN?3-induced structural and functional deficits could be attributed to altered balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway (JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1), and reduced expression of myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain-2v, and sarcomeric &#945;-actinin. Application of clinically used JAK/STAT inhibitors, tofacitinib and baricitinib, fully prevented IFN?3-induced cardiomyopathy, confirming the critical roles of this signaling pathway in inflammatory cardiac disease. Taken together, our in vitro studies in engineered myocardial tissues reveal direct adverse effects of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN?3 on human cardiomyocytes and establish the foundation for a potential use of cardiobundle platform in modeling of inflammatory myocardial disease and therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, lupus erythematosus, Chagas disease, and others, as well as viral infections including H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 show increased systemic levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-?3 (IFN?3) and are associated with high risk of heart disease. Here we explored for the first time if chronically elevated levels of IFN?3 can negatively affect structure and function of engineered human heart tissues in vitro. Our studies revealed IFN?3-induced deterioration of myofibrillar organization and contractile force production in human cardiomyocytes, attributed to decreased expression of multiple sarcomeric proteins and upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. FDA-approved JAK inhibitors fully blocked the adverse effects of IFN?3, suggesting a potentially effective strategy against human inflammatory cardiomyopathy.","output":"Loss of sarcomeric proteins via upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling underlies interferon-?3-induced contractile deficit in engineered human myocardium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The frequency of fungal infections is increasing due to immunodeficiency viruses and immunosuppressive drugs.

The conclusion is that the pandemic cannot be approached by standardised analytical techniques, because it, like other wicked problems, represents a unique challenge and because all possible solutions may lead to unknown negative consequences.","output":"The Corona crisis: a wicked problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Common radiological findings of COVID -19 infection include bilateral ground-glass opacities in lower lobes with a peripheral distribution Pleural effusion is considered a rare manifestation of COVID -19 infection We present a 52 years old patient with a three-week history of right-sided pleuritic chest pain, fever, and dyspnea Laboratory investigations revealed high C-reactive protein and ferritin levels and a positive COVID-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab Chest X-ray and Computed tomography (CT) identified a moderate right-sided pleural effusion, which was exudative with mixed cellularity and high Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Histopathology of thoracoscopic pleural biopsy didnt reveal granulomas, malignancy, or any microbiological growth We postulate that having ruled out any other cause the effusion was likely related to the Covid-19 infection Our case highlights that COVID-19 can present with isolated pleural effusions, therefore it should be kept as an etiology of effusions especially if other possible causes have been ruled out","output":"Pleural effusion as an isolated finding in COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has received extensive attention for its neuroprotective effect on the brain. This system comprises endocannabinoids, endocannabinoid receptors, and the corresponding ligands and proteins. The molecular players involved in their regulation and metabolism are potential therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric diseases including anxiety, depression and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD). The inhibitors of two endocannabinoid hydrolases, i.e., fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), have the capacity to increase the level of endocannabinoids indirectly, causing fewer side effects than those associated with direct supplementation of cannabinoids. Their antidepressant and anxiolytic mechanisms are considered to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and regulate synaptic and neural plasticity. In terms of AD/PD, treatment with FAAH/MAGL inhibitors leads to reduction in amyloid -protein deposition and inhibition of the death of dopamine neurons, which are commonly accepted to underlie the pathogenesis of AD and PD, respectively. Inflammation as the cause of depression/anxiety and PD/AD is also the target of FAAH/MAGL inhibitors. In this review, we summarize the application and involvement of FAAH/MAGL inhibitors in related neurological diseases.

The present study examines patterns of the first wave of Covid-19 morbidity in Israel at the macro level, during the period of late February to early June 2020, when the first wave has faded out. The analysis focuses on the significance of four sociodemographic variables: socioeconomic status, population density, rate of elderly population and minority status (Jewish / Arab identity) of the population in cities with 5000 residents or more. Additionally, we take a closer look into the association between morbidity rates and one SES component C home Internet access. METHODS: The article is a cross sectional study of morbidity rates, investigated on a residential community basis. Following the descriptive statistics, we move on to present multivariate analysis to explore associations between these variables and Covid-19 morbidity in Israel. RESULTS: Both the descriptive statistics and regressions show morbidity rates to be positively associated with population density. Socioeconomic status as well as the size of elderly population were both significantly related to morbidity, but only in Jewish communities. Interestingly, the association was inverse in both cases. i.e., the higher the SES the lower the morbidity and the larger the elderly population, the lower the communitys morbidity. Another interesting result is that overall, morbidity rates in Jewish cities were consistently higher than in Arab communities. CONCLUSIONS: We attribute the low morbidity rates in communities with relatively small elderly populations to the exceptionally high fertility rates in ultra-orthodox communities that sustained increased rates of morbidity; the lower morbidity in Arab communities is attributed to several factors, including the spatial Jewish-Arab segregation.","output":"Covid-19 in Israel: socio-demographic characteristics of first wave morbidity in Jewish and Arab communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which is a new enveloped virus that belongs to the Beta coronavirus genus.

However, the contribution of platelet reactivity (PR) to the aetiology of the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 remains unclear. Our aim was to evaluate PR in stable patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized with respiratory symptoms (mainly dyspnoea and dry cough), in comparison with a control group comprised of non-hospitalized healthy controls. METHODS: Observational, case control study that included patients with confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-19 group, n = 60) and healthy individuals matched by age and sex (control group, n = 60). Multiplate electrode aggregometry (MEA) tests were used to assess PR with adenosine diphosphate (MEA-ADP, low PR defined as < 53 AUC), arachidonic acid (MEA-ASPI, low PR < 86 AUC) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide 6 (MEA-TRAP, low PR < 97 AUC) in both groups. RESULTS: The rates of low PR with MEA-ADP were 27.5% in the COVID-19 group and 21.7% in the control group (OR = 1.60, p = 0.20); with MEA-ASPI, the rates were, respectively, 37.5% and 22.5% (OR = 3.67, p < 0.001); and with MEA-TRAP, the incidences were 48.5% and 18.8%, respectively (OR = 9.58, p < 0.001).

Since its outbreak, it has become a global pandemic. During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), however, there is no mature experience or guidance on how to carry out emergency surgery for suspected cases requiring emergency surgical intervention and perioperative safety protection against virus. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for emergency treatment due to \\"3-d abdominal pain aggravated with cessation of exhaust and defecation\\". After improving inspections and laboratory tests, the patient was assessed and diagnosed by the multiple discipline team as \\"strangulation obstruction, pulmonary infection\\". His body temperature was 38.8 C, and the chest computed tomography showed pulmonary infection. Given fever and pneumonia, we could not rule out COVID-19 after consultation by fever clinicians and respiratory experts. Hence, we performed emergency surgery under three-level protection for the suspected case. After surgery, his nucleic acid test for COVID-19 was negative, meaning COVID-19 was excluded, and routine postoperative treatment and nursing was followed. The patient was treated with symptomatic support after the operation. The stomach tube and urinary tube were removed on the 1st d after the operation. The clearing diet was started on the 3rd d after the operation, and the body temperature returned to normal. Flatus and bowel movements were noted on 5th postoperative day. He was discharged after 8 d of hospitalization. The patient was followed up for 4 mo after discharge, no serious complications occurred. A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency room due to \\"abdominal distention, fatigue for 6 d and fever for 13 h\\". After the multiple discipline team evaluation, the patient was diagnosed as \\"intestinal obstruction, abdominal mass, peritonitis and pulmonary infection\\". At that time, the patient's body temperature was 39.6 C, and chest computed tomography indicated pulmonary infection. COVID-19 could not be completely excluded after consultation in the fever outpatient department and respiratory department. Therefore, the patient was treated as a suspected case, and an urgent operation was performed under three-level medical protection. Postoperative nucleic acid test was negative, COVID-19 was excluded, and routine postoperative treatment and nursing were followed. After the operation, the patient received symptomatic and supportive treatment. The gastric tube was removed on the 1st d after the operation, and the urinary tube was removed on the 3rd d after the operation. Enteral nutrition began on the 3rd d after the operation. To date, no serious complications have been found during follow-up after discharge. CONCLUSION: Based on the previous treatment experience, we reviewed the procedures of two cases of suspected COVID-19 emergency surgery and extracted the perioperative protection experience. By referring to the literature and following the regulations on prevention and management of infectious diseases, we have developed a relatively mature and complete emergency surgical workflow for suspected COVID-19 cases and shared perioperative protection and management experience and measures.","output":"Emergency surgical workflow and experience of suspected cases of COVID-19: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various vaccines have been developed recently to protect the population from corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19).

MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional randomized study was conducted in Moscow region from March to May 2020. Two groups were examined for EBV-markers: hospital patients (n = 95) treated for SARS-CoV-2 infection and blood donors (n = 92). RESULTS With equal EBV prevalence the detection of active infection markers in donors (10.9%) was noticeably lower than in SARS-CoV-2 patients (80%). Significant differences in this indicator were also found when patients from subgroups with interstitial pneumonia with the presence (96.6%) and absence (97.2%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal smear were compared with the subgroup of patients with mild COVID-19 (43.3%). The average IgG VCA and IgG EBNA positivity coefficients in donor group were higher than in patient group (p < 0.05). Patients with active EBV infection markers were significantly more likely to have pneumonia, exceeding the reference values of ALT and the relative number of monocytes (odds ratio - 23.6; 3.5; 9.7, respectively). DISCUSSION The present study examined the incidence and analyzed epidemiological features of active EBV infection in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION A significantly higher rate of detection of active EBV infection markers in hospital patients indicates a combined participation SARS-CoV-2 and EBV in the development of interstitial pneumonia.

The most standard diagnostic method is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal and/or an oropharyngeal swab. The high occurrence of false-negative results due to the non-presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the oropharyngeal environment renders this sampling method not ideal. Therefore, a new sampling device is desirable. This proof-of-principle study investigated the possibility to train machine-learning classifiers with an electronic nose (Aeonose) to differentiate between COVID-19-positive and negative persons based on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analysis. METHODS: Between April and June 2020, participants were invited for breath analysis when a swab for RT-PCR was collected. If the RT-PCR resulted negative, the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was checked to confirm the negative result. All participants breathed through the Aeonose for five minutes. This device contains metal-oxide sensors that change in conductivity upon reaction with VOCs in exhaled breath. These conductivity changes are input data for machine learning and used for pattern recognition. The result is a value between ? 1 and + 1, indicating the infection probability. RESULTS: 219 participants were included, 57 of which COVID-19 positive. A sensitivity of 0.86 and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.92 were found. Adding clinical variables to machine-learning classifier via multivariate logistic regression analysis, the NPV improved to 0.96.

We hypothesized that as fas as an adequate oxygen delivery is provided, oxygen consumption, when determined by indirect calorimetry, is not dependent on oxygen delivery in critically ill patients whereas calculated oxygen consumption is associated with artefactual correlation of oxygen consumption and delivery. DESIGN: Oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption and their relationship were analyzed prospectively. Metabolic data gained from both measured and calculated methods were obtained simultaneously before and after volume loading. SETTING: The study was completed in the intensive care unit as part of the management protocol of the patients. PATIENTS: 32 consecutive patients entered the study and were divided into 3 groups according to a clinical condition known to favour oxygen supply dependency: sepsis syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome and acute primary liver failure. INTERVENTION: The rise in oxygen delivery was obtained by colloid infusion (oxygen flux test) performed in hemodynamically and metabolically stable patients. All were mechanically ventilated. No change in therapy was allowed during the test. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Oxygen consumption was simultaneously evaluated by calculation (Fick Principle) and direct measurement using indirect calorimetry. Oxygen delivery was derived from the cardiac output (thermodilution) and arterial content of oxygen. Oxygen supply dependency was considered while observing an increase in oxygen delivery greater than 45 ml/minm(2). Irrespective of patient's clinical diagnosis and outcome, measured oxygen uptake remained unaltered by volume infusion whereas both oxygen delivery and calculated oxygen consumption increased significantly. Arterial lactate level>2 mmol/l and measured oxygen extraction ratio>25% failed to identify oxygen supply dependency when measured data were considered.

According to 2019 MSME reports, the sector contributed 29% to the overall GDP catalyzing socio-economic development. The Covid-19 pandemics have left world economies and business entities to redefine and rethink policy regulations and business models. The pandemic has created socio-economic displacement across business sectors, and no country is free from the socio-economic exclusions that has triggered. The Indian economy has been badly affected by a projection of over a seven percent decline in quarterly GDP in 2021.The coronavirus pandemic has impacted MSME earnings by 20C50 percent, with micro and small organizations being the worst hit due to liquidity crunch.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method called CyclingNet for detecting cycling near misses from video streams generated by a mounted frontal camera on a bike regardless of the camera position, the conditions of the built, the visual conditions and without any restrictions on the riding behaviour. CyclingNet is a deep computer vision model based on convolutional structure embedded with self-attention bidirectional long-short term memory (LSTM) blocks that aim to understand near misses from both sequential images of scenes and their optical flows. The model is trained on scenes of both safe rides and near misses. After 42 hours of training on a single GPU, the model shows high accuracy on the training, testing and validation sets. The model is intended to be used for generating information that can draw significant conclusions regarding cycling behaviour in cities and elsewhere, which could help planners and policy-makers to better understand the requirement of safety measures when designing infrastructure or drawing policies. As for future work, the model can be pipelined with other state-of-the-art classifiers and object detectors simultaneously to understand the causality of near misses based on factors related to interactions of road-users, the built and the natural environments.","output":"CyclingNet: Detecting cycling near misses from video streams in complex urban scenes with deep learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its outbreak in 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 keeps surprising the medical community by evolving diverse immune escape mutations in a rapid and effective manner. To gain deeper insight into mutation frequency and dynamics, we isolated ten ancestral strains of SARS-CoV-2 and performed consecutive serial incubation in ten replications in a suitable and common cell line and subsequently analysed them using RT-qPCR and whole genome sequencing. Along those lines we hoped to gain fundamental insights into the evolutionary capacity of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Our results identified a series of adaptive genetic changes, ranging from unique convergent substitutional mutations and hitherto undescribed insertions. The region coding for spike proved to be a mutational hotspot, evolving a number of mutational changes including the already known substitutions at positions S:484 and S:501. We discuss the evolution of all specific adaptations as well as possible reasons for the seemingly inhomogeneous potential of SARS-CoV-2 in the adaptation to cell culture. The combination of serial passage in vitro with whole genome sequencing uncovers the immense mutational potential of some SARS-CoV-2 strains. The observed genetic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro could not be explained solely by selectively neutral mutations but possibly resulted from the action of directional selection accumulating favourable genetic changes in the evolving variants, along the path of increasing potency of the strain. Competition among a high number of quasi-species in the SARS-CoV-2 in vitro population gene pool may reinforce directional selection and boost the speed of evolutionary change.","output":"The mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in serial passages in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) may lead to job burnout due to this disease in paramedics and hospital guards. In this regard, the present study was conducted to evaluate and compare job burnout due to Covid-19 in paramedics and guards of educational hospitals of Semnan University of Medical Sciences in Semnan, Iran. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study, 129 paramedics and guards of Kowsar and Amir Al-Momenin hospitals were assessed in terms of job burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (1981). The collected data were analyzed using SPSS software. Results: In this study, it was shown that emotional exhaustion was more frequent in female paramedics and male guards with a positive history of Covid-19. Also, in terms of depersonalization, the staff of Kowsar hospital, especially the paramedics, had a higher score compared to Amir Al-Momenin Hospital. Also, a significant relationship was observed between the subscale of lack of personal success and the history of Covid-19 (P<0.05);In those who did not have a history of Covid- 19, the level of this subscale was reported to be lower. Discussion: The results of the present study demonstrated that there is a significant relationship between job burnout and anxiety of coronavirus infection among paramedics and hospital guards;So that the mental and physical abilities of employees, especially in the health sector, have been affected by the outbreak of Covid-19.

Single-step, reagentless detection of the S1 protein is achieved through a binding-induced, concentration-dependent folding of the DNA aptamer that reduces the efficiency of the electron transfer process between the redox tag and the electrode surface and causes a suppression of the resulting amperometric signal. This aptasensor is specific for the target S1 protein with a dissociation constant (K(D)) value of 43  4 nM and a limit of detection of 7 nM. We demonstrate that the target S1 protein can be detected both in a buffer solution and in an artificial viral transport medium widely used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swabs, and that no cross-reactivity is observed in the presence of different, non-target viral proteins.

DESIGN: A hospital-based observational follow-up study. SETTING: Internal Medicine Service of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan, from 26 February 2020 to 30 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, aged 18 years. METHODS: ALC was categorised into low, intermediate and high level and patients were triaged using the standard emergency severity illness score. All patients were followed until the end of hospital admission for the outcome of case fatality and length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 822 patients with COVID-19 were admitted during the study period and 699 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 54.5 years and 67% were males; 50.4% were triaged to low, 42.5% to intermediate and 7.2% to high acuity care. The overall case-fatality rate was 11.6%, with the highest (52%) in high acuity level followed by 16.2% in intermediate and 2% in low acuity care. Acuity level was associated with case fatality, with an HR (95% CI) of 5.0 (2.0 to 12.1) for high versus low acuity care and an HR of 2.7 (1.2, 6.4) for intermediate versus low acuity care, after adjusting for age, sex and common comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and chronic lung disease. Similarly, acuity level was also associated with length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: High and intermediate acuity level is associated with higher case fatality rate and prolonged length of hospital stay in patients admitted with COVID-19. In resource-limited settings where the provision of high acuity care is limited, the intermediate care acuity could serve as a useful strategy to treat relatively less critical patients with COVID-19.","output":"Acuity level of care as a predictor of case fatality and prolonged hospital stay in patients with COVID-19: a hospital-based observational follow-up study from Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract As ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules play important roles in many biological processes including gene expression and regulation, their secondary structures have been the focus of many recent studies.

The in vivo infectivity, acute and subacute pathogenicity, and viral proliferation of the RD114 virus were evaluated by experimental infection of dogs. METHODS: Nine specific pathogen free dogs were divided into three groups, with each group consisting of one female and two male dogs. Dogs were subcutaneously inoculated in the neck with either 1 ml RD114 stock virus (group A), inactivated RD114 virus suspension (group B), or cell culture medium (group C) as a negative control. To assess blood cell counts and biochemical properties, blood samples from each group were collected 5 days before inoculation, just prior to inoculation, and 1, 3, 7 and 10 days post-inoculation. RESULT: During the experimental period of 51 days, none of the dogs inoculated with RD114 virus showed any clinical signs, significant increases in rectal temperature or abnormal blood biochemical characteristics including C-reactive protein when compared with the negative controls. We were not able to re-isolate the RD114 virus from buffy coat cells of group A dogs.

We underscore how time, space, and modality as key facets of the everyday intersect with understandings, procedures, and engagements as components of practice, and how food practices in the pandemic context are transforming, at least temporarily, toward more sustainability. Our mixed-methods data were collected from participants in a local food initiative established in Trento during the first Italian lockdown in Spring 2020, which aimed to connect local producers to consumers more directly. We analyze data from a panel survey conducted with 55 participants of this initiative followed by ten in-depth interviews six months after the lockdown. The findings illustrate that the lockdown encouraged different people to search for good food through the food initiative. Sustainable food practices included more planning and less waste, but in some cases initial interest in the initiative changed back to prevailing industrial supply via supermarkets.

The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programs is, however, significantly threatened by the emergence of new SARS-COV-2 variants that, in addition to being more transmissible than the wild-type (original) strain, may at least partially evade existing vaccines. A two-strain (one wild-type, one variant) and two-group (vaccinated or otherwise) mechanistic mathematical model is designed and used to assess the impact of the vaccine-induced cross-protective efficacy on the spread the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that, in the absence of any co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant, the vaccine-derived herd immunity threshold needed to eliminate the wild-type strain can be achieved if 59% of the US population is fully-vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. This threshold increases to 76% if the wild-type strain is co-circulating with the Alpha variant (a SARS-CoV-2 variant that is 56% more transmissible than the wild-type strain). If the wild-type strain is co-circulating with the Delta variant (which is estimated to be 100% more transmissible than the wild-type strain), up to 82% of the US population needs to be vaccinated with either of the aforementioned vaccines to achieve the vaccine-derived herd immunity. Global sensitivity analysis of the model reveal the following four parameters as the most influential in driving the value of the reproduction number of the variant strain (hence, COVID-19 dynamics) in the US: (a) the infectiousness of the co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant, (b) the proportion of individuals fully vaccinated (using Pfizer or Moderna vaccine) against the wild-type strain, (c) the cross-protective efficacy the vaccines offer against the variant strain and (d) the modification parameter accounting for the reduced infectiousness of fully-vaccinated individuals experiencing breakthrough infection. Specifically, numerical simulations of the model show that future waves or surges of the COVID-19 pandemic can be prevented in the US if the two vaccines offer moderate level of cross-protection against the variant (at least 67%). This study further suggests that a new SARS-CoV-2 variant can cause a significant disease surge in the US if (i) the vaccine coverage against the wild-type strain is low (roughly <66%) (ii) the variant is much more transmissible (e.g., 100% more transmissible), than the wild-type strain, or (iii) the level of cross-protection offered by the vaccine is relatively low (e.g., less than 50%). A new SARS-CoV-2 variant will not cause such surge in the US if it is only moderately more transmissible (e.g., the Alpha variant, which is 56% more transmissible) than the wild-type strain, at least 66% of the population of the US is fully vaccinated, and the three vaccines being deployed in the US (Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson) offer a moderate level of cross-protection against the variant.","output":"Will vaccine-derived protective immunity curtail COVID-19 variants in the US?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was radiolabeled for its nucleic acid component by growth in deembryonated chicken eggs.

The difference is due to the inactivation of 1-3 galactosyl transferase (1-3 GT) genes in catarrhines. Natural antibodies to -gal are therefore developed in catarrhines but not platyrrhines and other mammals. Hypersensitivity reactions are commonly elicited by mosquito and tick vector bites. IgE antibodies against -gal cause food allergy to red meat in persons who have been exposed to tick bites. Three enzymes synthesising the terminal 1-3-linked galactose in -gal, that are homologous to mammalian  and 1-4 GTs but not mammalian 1-3 GTs, were recently identified in the tick vector Ixodes scapularis. IgG and IgM antibodies to -gal are reported to protect against malaria because mosquito-derived sporozoites of malaria parasites express -gal on their surface. This article explores the possibility that the -gal in sporozoites are acquired from glycoconjugates synthesised by mosquitoes rather than through de novo synthesis by sporozoites. METHODS: The presence of proteins homologous to the three identified tick 1-3 GTs and mammalian 1-3 GTs in two important mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, as well as Plasmodium malaria parasites, was investigated by BLASTp analysis to help clarify the source of the -gal on sporozoite surfaces. RESULTS: Anopheles gambiae and Ae. aegypti possessed several different proteins homologous to the three I. scapularis proteins with 1-3 GT activity, but not mammalian 1-3 GTs. The putative mosquito 1-3 GTs possessed conserved protein domains characteristic of glycosyl transferases. However, the genus Plasmodium lacked proteins homologous to the three I. scapularis proteins with 1-3 GT activity and mammalian 1-3 GTs. CONCLUSIONS: The putative 1-3 GTs identified in the two mosquito vectors may synthesise glycoconjugates containing -gal that can be transferred to sporozoite surfaces before they are inoculated into skin during blood feeding. The findings merit further investigation because of their implications for immunity against malaria, hypersensitivity to mosquito bites, primate evolution, and proposals for immunisation against -gal.

Therefore, smartphones may enable data collection from people with progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at high frequencies for a long duration. However, the progressive decline in patients cognitive and functional abilities could also hamper the feasibility of collecting patient-reported outcomes, audio recordings, and location data in the long term. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the completeness of survey data, audio recordings, and passively collected location data from 3 smartphone-based studies of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. METHODS: We analyzed data completeness in three studies: 2 observational cohort studies (study 1: N=22; duration=12 weeks and study 2: N=49; duration=52 weeks) and 1 clinical trial (study 3: N=49; duration=20 weeks). In these studies, participants were asked to complete weekly surveys; weekly audio recordings; and in the background, the app collected sensor data, including location data. For each of the three studies and each of the three data streams, we estimated time-to-discontinuation using the KaplanCMeier method. We identified predictors of app discontinuation using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. We quantified data completeness for both early dropouts and participants who remained engaged for longer. RESULTS: Time-to-discontinuation was shortest in the year-long observational study and longest in the clinical trial. After 3 months in the study, most participants still completed surveys and audio recordings: 77% (17/22) in study 1, 59% (29/49) in study 2, and 96% (22/23) in study 3. After 3 months, passively collected location data were collected for 95% (21/22), 86% (42/49), and 100% (23/23) of the participants. The Cox regression did not provide evidence that demographic characteristics or disease severity at baseline were associated with attrition, although it was somewhat underpowered. The mean data completeness was the highest for passively collected location data. For most participants, data completeness declined over time; mean data completeness was typically lower in the month before participants dropped out. Moreover, data completeness was lower for people who dropped out in the first study month (very few data points) compared with participants who adhered long term (data completeness fluctuating around 75%). CONCLUSIONS: These three studies successfully collected smartphone data longitudinally from a neurodegenerative population. Despite patients progressive physical and cognitive decline, time-to-discontinuation was higher than in typical smartphone studies. Our study provides an important benchmark for participant engagement in a neurodegenerative population. To increase data completeness, collecting passive data (such as location data) and identifying participants who are likely to adhere during the initial phase of a study can be useful.

We aimed to study the epidemiologic characteristics of hospitalized PCR-test positive and negative patients with analysis of in-hospital and post-hospital mortality. We also compare the respiratory disease characteristics between 2019 and 2020. METHODS: The study population consist of 17,691 (MarchCJuly-2020) and 4600 (MarchCJuly-2019) hospitalized patients with respiratory diseases (including COVID-19). The incidence rate, case-fatality rate and survival analysis for overall mortality (in-hospital and post-hospital) were assessed. RESULTS: The incidence and mortality rates for respiratory diseases were 4-fold and 11-fold higher in 2020 compared to 2019 (877.5 vs 228.2 and 11.2 vs 1.2 per 100,000 respectively). The PCR-positive cases (compared to PCR-negative) had 2-fold higher risk of overall mortality. We observed 24% higher risk of death in males compared to females and in older patients compared to younger ones. Patients residing in rural areas had 66% higher risk of death compared to city residents and being treated in a provisional hospital was associated with 1.9-fold increased mortality compared to those who were treated in infectious disease hospitals.

There is an established association between race and severe COVID-19 outcomes in adults in England; however, whether a similar association exists in children is unclear. Objective: To investigate the association between race and childhood COVID-19 testing and hospital outcomes. Design, Setting, Participants: In this cohort study, children (0-18 years of age) from participating family practices in England were identified in the QResearch database between January 24 and November 30, 2020. The QResearch database has individually linked patients with national SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital admission, and mortality data. Exposures: The main characteristic of interest is self-reported race. Other exposures were age, sex, deprivation level, geographic region, household size, and comorbidities (asthma; diabetes; and cardiac, neurologic, and hematologic conditions). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was hospital admission with confirmed COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were SARS-CoV-2-positive test result and any hospital attendance with confirmed COVID-19 and intensive care admission. Results: Of 2a?576a?353 children (mean [SD] age, 9.23 [5.24] years; 48.8% female), 410a?726 (15.9%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 26a?322 (6.4%) tested positive. A total of 1853 children (0.07%) with confirmed COVID-19 attended hospital, 343 (0.01%) were admitted to the hospital, and 73 (0.002%) required intensive care. Testing varied across race. White children had the highest proportion of SARS-CoV-2 tests (223a?701/1a?311a?041 [17.1%]), whereas Asian children (33a?213/243a?545 [13.6%]), Black children (7727/93a?620 [8.3%]), and children of mixed or other races (18a?971/147a?529 [12.9%]) had lower proportions. Compared with White children, Asian children were more likely to have COVID-19 hospital admissions (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.12-2.36), whereas Black children (adjusted OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.90-2.31) and children of mixed or other races (adjusted OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.93-2.10) had comparable hospital admissions. Asian children were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (adjusted OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.07-4.14), and Black children (adjusted OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.08-4.94) and children of mixed or other races (adjusted OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.25-3.65) had longer hospital admissions (&#8805;36 hours).

Our aim was to investigate, using a bench-top model, the effect of different ventilator settings and positions of the exhalation port and nebulizer on the amount of albuterol delivered to a lung simulator. METHODS A lung model simulating spontaneous breathing was connected to a single-limb NIV ventilator, set in bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) with inspiratory/expiratory pressures of 10/5, 15/10, 15/5, and 20/10 cmH2O, or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 5 and 10 cmH2O. Three delivery circuits were tested: a vented mask with the nebulizer directly connected to the mask, and an unvented mask with a leak port placed before and after the nebulizer. Albuterol was collected on a filter placed after the mask and then the delivered amount was measured with infrared spectrophotometry. RESULTS Albuterol delivery during NIV varied between 6.7  0.4% to 37.0  4.3% of the nominal dose. The amount delivered in CPAP and BIPAP modes was similar (22.1  10.1 vs. 24.0  10.0%, p = 0.070). CPAP level did not affect delivery (p = 0.056); in BIPAP with 15/5 cmH2O pressure the delivery was higher compared to 10/5 cmH2O (p = 0.033) and 20/10 cmH2O (p = 0.014). Leak port position had a major effect on delivery in both CPAP and BIPAP, the best performances were obtained with the unvented mask, and the nebulizer placed between the leak port and the mask (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In this model, albuterol delivery was marginally affected by ventilatory settings in NIV, while position of the leak port had a major effect.

We describe a preclinical cadaveric study of a novel full subcostal robotic-assisted technique to overcome these limitations. A total subcostal robotic-assisted radical thymectomy was evaluated on a cadaver model using the da Vinci Xi system. The exploratory procedure was divided in two steps: (a) dissection of the thymus gland, except the left mediastinal epi-diaphragmatic fat pad; (b) dissection of the left diaphragmatic mediastinal fat pad avoiding heart compression while perfectly visualizing the left phrenic nerve. Five different setups were explored based on camera and trocars insertions, patient's positioning and table's settings. Both the tasks were accomplished using the novel technique. The subxiphoid insertion of the camera and the position of two robotic arms about 8 cm distally on the subcostal made the most part of mediastinal dissection straightforward. Left peri-diaphragmatic fat pad can be better visualized and dissected positioning the camera in the left subcostal port shifting the instruments on the right side. This may permit a better control of the left phrenic nerve reducing heart compression. Full subcostal robotic-assisted thymectomy resulted feasible in cadaveric model.

Recruitment will take place in around 40 UK neonatal units. Mothers will be randomised 1:1 to full milk feeds, starting at 60 ml/kg day, or gradual feeds, as per usual local practice. Mother's expressed breast milk will always be the first choice of milk, though will likely be supplemented with formula or donor breast milk in the first few days. Feeding data will be collected until full milk feeds are achieved ( 140 ml/kg/day for 3 consecutive days). The primary outcome is length of infant hospital stay. Additional data will be collected 6 weeks post-discharge. Follow-up at 2 years (corrected gestational age) is planned. The sample size is 2088 infants to detect a between group difference in length of stay of 2 days. Accounting for multiple births, this requires 1700 women to be recruited. Primary analysis will compare the length of hospital stay between groups, adjusting for minimisation variables and accounting for multiple births. DISCUSSION This trial will provide high-quality evidence on feeding practices for preterm infants. Full milk feeds from day of birth could result in infants being discharged sooner.

The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Two similar human coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) are known to cause disease in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well. Observations This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis. Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. Conclusions and Relevance Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms. Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.","output":"Neuropathogenesis and Neurologic Manifestations of the Coronaviruses in the Age of Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The choice of initial therapy in follicular lymphoma can be a key determinant in future therapy, as irreversible toxicities with first line regimens can impact the patient's ability to tolerate future treatment. Minimizing drug exposure will result in less frequent occurrence of significant adverse events and associated treatment costs. In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, there is additional benefit to minimizing the number of patient visits and hospital admissions. Limited information exists related to the outcomes and associated costs of existing treatment sequences. Additionally, treatment administration at different types of clinical sites results in varied reimbursement models, making informed evaluation of clinical and financial evidence challenging. Methods: The current study applies a budget impact model methodology in order to describe the associated impact of treatment selection and sequencing on outcomes and costs in the treatment of relapsed or refractory low-grade follicular lymphoma in first line therapy followed by Consolidation and also in first line therapy to second line therapy. Key model inputs included: Number of treatment cycles, number of days a treatment was received, duration of response (DOR), rate of side effects and associated costs, and total treatment costs, including drugs, medical treatment, laboratory testing and adverse event costs. Treatment outcomes were based on the published literature that summarized the overall response rate, median DOR, and toxicity. Treatment regimen costs were evaluated based on payer pricing, Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC), Average Selling Price (ASP) and Average Wholesale Price (AWP) and modified to adjust for weight-based dosing and negotiate payer reimbursement rates. Associated medical costs for medical treatment and supportive care were estimated using current Medicare fee schedule rates. Included were seven options for first line therapy of follicular lymphoma from 2020 NCCN Guidelines - (Bendamustine + rituximab (BR);Bendamustine + Obinutuzumab (OB);CHOP rituximab (RCHOP);CHOP + Obinutuzumab (OCHOP);CVP+ rituximab (RCVP);CVP + Obinutuzumab (OCVP);Lenalidomide + rituximab (R2)), followed by three for Consolidation (Rituximab maintenance (RM);Obinutuzumab maintenance (O);Radioimmunotherapy (RIT with 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Y90-IT, Zevalin)) and three Second Line therapy options (RIT;Lenalidomide only;Lenalidomide + Obinutuzumab (LO)). Results: The treatment sequence of first line BR followed by Consolidation with RIT Y90 (Zevalin) had the longest predicted DOR (2586 days). The associated treatment sequence costs were $212,485 for BR followed by Y90-IT, compared with $233, 388 for BR followed by rituximab maintenance, which had a predicted DOR of 2478 days. The predicted DOR for treatment sequences starting with OCHOP, OCVP and RCHOP and followed by RIT with Y90-IT was approximately 1000 days less than BR followed by Y90-IT for a cost difference of $4,421, $12,914 and $25,826, respectively. The treatment sequence of first line BR followed by Second Line RIT Y90-IT had the second longest predicted DOR of 2586 days at costs of $212,485, compared to 2778 days for BR followed by LO, at a total sequence costs of $796,695. Conclusion: The use of Y90-IT in Consolidation or Second Line treatment demonstrated desired patient outcomes at one of the lowest cost profiles. Additionally, Y90-IT administration can be completed in only two clinic visits, reducing patient travel and contact, improving safety in an era of COVID-19 precautionary measures and reducing cost.

The current study investigated whether socioeconomic disparities remained in COVID-19 health outcomes under universal health coverage and sought to determine which factor exerted the greatest effect on disparities in COVID-19 outcomes.Methods: This retrospective, observational study included all 7,590 confirmed COVID-19 patients who tested positive in South Korea through May 15, 2020. We used the official medical database, released from the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in South Korea. Socioeconomic status was estimated by insurance type (National Health Insurance Service [NHIS] beneficiaries and Medical Aid [MA] recipients). Incidence (per 1,000,000), mortality rate (per 1,000,000), and case fatality rate were calculated. To determine the factors associated with incidence and case fatality ratio, multivariable logistic regressions were performed at the national and regional levels.Findings: Nationwide, incidence of COVID-19 was 1444 per 1,000,000, mortality rate was 43 per 1,000,000, and case fatality ratio was 30%. MA recipients had higher incidence (4243 vs 136.3), mortality rate (283 vs 36), and case fatality ratio (67 vs 27) than NHIS beneficiaries. After adjustment, older age, male sex, hypertension, higher Charlson comorbidity index score, and region were associated with higher odds of COVID-19 case fatality.Interpretation: We found socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 related health outcomes in incidence and fatality, despite universal health coverage. However, these disparities were not due to socioeconomic status in and of itself, but rather based on the poor underlying health conditions of the vulnerable in universal health coverage environment.Funding: This research did not receive any funding from agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interests.Ethics Approval Statement: The Institutional Review Board of the Seoul Metropolitan Government, Seoul National University, Boramae Medical Center (No. 20200403/07-2020-12/043) approved this study.

The institutional landscape of regional cooperation for health and health research, however, has seen important changes. Recent health emergencies have focussed regional bodies' attention on supporting aspects of national health preparedness and response. The state of national health research systems is a key element of capacity to plan and respond to health needs - raising questions about the roles African regional bodies can or should play in strengthening health research systems. METHODS: We mapped regional organisations involved in health research across Africa and conducted 18 interviews with informants from 15 regional organisations. We investigated the roles, challenges, and opportunities of these bodies in strengthening health research. We deductively coded interview data using themes from established pillars of health research systems - governance, creating resources, research production and use, and financing. We analysed organisations' relevant activities in these areas, how they do this work, and where they perceive impact. RESULTS: Regional organisations with technical foci on health or higher education (versus economic or political remits) were involved in all four areas. Most organisations reported activities in governance and research use. Involvement in governance centred mainly around agenda-setting and policy harmonisation. For organisations involved in creating resources, activities focused on strengthening human resources, but few reported developing research institutions, networks, or infrastructure. Organisations reported more involvement in disseminating than producing research. Generally, few have directly contributed to financing health research. Informants reported gaps in research coordination, infrastructure, and advocacy at regional level. Finally, we found regional bodies' mandates, authority, and collaborations influence their activities in supporting national health research systems. CONCLUSION: Continued strengthening of health research on the African continent requires strategic thinking about the roles, comparative advantages, and capability of regional organisations to facilitate capacity and growth of health research systems.","output":"The Roles of Regional Organisations in Strengthening Health Research Systems in Africa: Activities, Gaps, and Future Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By the end of January, the World Health Organization had declared COVID\\\\19 a global health emergency.","output":"COVID\\\\19: A great disruptor?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The influenza A virus (IAV) causes a respiratory tract infection with approximately 10% of the population infected by the virus each year.

Using confocal intravital microscopy in a mouse model of IAV infection, we observed profound neutrophil recruitment, platelet aggregation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production and thrombin activation within the lung microvasculature in vivo. Importantly, deficiency or antagonism of the protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) reduced platelet aggregation, NET production, and neutrophil recruitment. Critically, inhibition of thrombin or PAR4 protected mice from virus-induced lung tissue damage and edema.

A cross-sectional, web-based survey was deployed during August and September, 2020, to practicing physicians in the 18 states with the largest COVID-19 cases. Among 1,478 responding physicians, 1,017 completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5). First, the PCL-5 was used to compare symptom endorsement between the two physician groups. A greater percentage of frontline than second-line physicians had clinically significant endorsement of PCL-5 symptoms and higher PCL-5 scores. Second, logistic regression and seven nonlinear machine learning (ML) algorithms were leveraged to identify potential predictors of PTSD risk by analyzing variable importance and partial dependence plots. Predictors of PTSD risk included cognitive/psychological measures, occupational characteristics, work experiences, social support, demographics, and workplace characteristics. Importantly, the final ML model random forest, identified patterns of both damaging and protective predictors of PTSD risk among frontline physicians. Key damaging factors included depression, burnout, negative coping, fears of contracting/transmitting COVID-19, perceived stigma, and insufficient resources to treat COVID-19 patients. Protective factors included resilience and support from employers/friends/family/significant others. This study underscores the value of ML algorithms to uncover nonlinear relationships among protective/damaging risk factors for PTSD in frontline physicians, which may better inform interventions to prepare healthcare systems for future epidemics/pandemics.","output":"The Invisible COVID-19 Crisis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Risk Among Frontline Physicians Treating COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the site of semen collection have any influence on the IVF/ICSI cycle outcome?

The outcome of the ICSI/IVF cycles in terms of oocytes, embryos and pregnancy rates according to the approach of semen sample collection (at home or at clinic) was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to samples collected at the clinic, semen samples collected at home had significantly higher mean spermatozoa concentrations (60.7  33.0 million/ml vs. 51.9  36.9 million/ml; P=0.001), higher total sperm counts (156.3113.6 million vs. 138.6131.4 million; P=0.004) and better motility (59.5%  19.6% vs. 55.1%  21.9%; P=0.005).

Several studies have already applied this method by using an exposure and response prevention-inspired serious game to treat patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a mobile cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program would be as effective in treating OCD as traditional offline CBT. In addition, the treatment efficacy in response to mobile CBT for OCD might be associated with increased brain activity within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) tract. METHODS: The digital CBT treatment program for OCD, OCfree, consists of 6 education sessions, 10 quests, and 7 casual games. Information was gathered from 27 patients with OCD (15 offline CBT and 12 OCfree CBT). During the 6-week intervention period, changes in clinical symptoms and brain function activity were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the change in OCD symptoms and depressive symptoms between the two groups. However, the OCfree group showed greater improvement in anxiety symptoms compared to the offline CBT group. Both offline CBT and OCfree CBT increased the functional connectivity within the CSTC tract in all patients with OCD. However, CBT using OCfree showed greater changes in brain connectivity within the thalamus and insula, compared to offline CBT. CONCLUSIONS: OCfree, an OCD treatment app program, was effective in the treatment of drug-na?ve patients with OCD. The treatment effects of OCfree are associated with increased brain connectivity within the CSTC tract.

With the ever-increasing number of COVID-19 patients, it is imperative to explore the factors related to the disease to aid patient management until a definitive vaccine is ready, as the disease is not limited to the respiratory system alone. COVID-19 has been associated with various cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. The infection is severe in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and a systemic inflammatory response due to a cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 cases can lead to acute myocardial infarction. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 56-year-old man with cardiovascular risk factors including coronary artery disease, hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and hyperlipidemia, who had COVID-19-induced pneumonia complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. He subsequently developed myocardial infarction during his hospitalization at our facility. He had a significant contact history for COVID-19. He was managed with emergent cardiac revascularization after COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing from a nasopharyngeal swab as per hospital policy for admitted patients. Apart from dual antiplatelet therapy, tocilizumab therapy was initiated due to the high interleukin-6 levels. His hospitalization was complicated by hemodialysis and failed extubation and intubation, resulting in a tracheostomy. Upon improvement, he was discharged to a long-term facility with a plan for outpatient follow-up.

We retrospectively analyzed 14418 COVID-19 patients in five major medical centers in New York City (NYC), between March 1 and June 12, 2020. Using clustering analysis, four biologically distinct subphenotypes were derived in the development cohort (N = 8199). Importantly, the identified subphenotypes were highly predictive of clinical outcomes (especially 60-day mortality). Sensitivity analyses in the development cohort, and re-derivation and prediction in the internal (N = 3519) and external (N = 3519) validation cohorts confirmed the reproducibility and usability of the subphenotypes. Further analyses showed varying subphenotype prevalence across the peak of the outbreak in NYC. We also found that SDoH specifically influenced mortality outcome in Subphenotype IV, which is associated with older age, worse clinical manifestation, and high comorbidity burden. Our findings may lead to a better understanding of how COVID-19 causes disease in different populations and potentially benefit clinical trial development.

Given the stability, reasonable delivery efficiency, and safety of nanocarriers, there are several barriers in the fulfillment of successful clinical application of these delivery systems. These challenges encouraged drug delivery researchers to establish innovative nanocarriers with longer circulation time, high stability, and high compatibility. Exosomes are extracellular nanometer-sized vesicles released through various cells. These vesicles serve as nanocarriers, possessing great potential to overcome some obstacles encountered in gene and drug delivery due to their natural affinity to recipient cells and the inherent capability to shuttle the genes, lipids, proteins, and RNAs between cells. So far, there has been a lot of valuable research on drug delivery by exosomes, but research on RNA delivery, especially mRNA, is very limited. Since mRNA-based vaccines and therapies have recently gained particular prominence in various diseases, it is essential to find a suitable delivery system due to the large size and destructive nature of these nucleic acids.

However, in the more industrialized countries, physical activity rates are declining, and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic may amplify this scenario. Thus, this study aimed to report the Italian population's physical activity profile living in the North-western regions during the national lockdown. Methods: Physical activity was assessed using the official Italian short form of IPAQ, intended for Social Networking Services (SNS). Participation was voluntary, and people could fill the questionnaire simply by clicking on a specific link. Results: The final sample size was 612 Italians, male and female, equally distributed (49.1% male and 50.9% female). Data showed a percentage of 15.4% of inactive subjects (MET < 700), 61.8% of moderate-active (MET 700-2500), and 22.9% of active people (MET > 2500). Women were more inactive than men (p < 0.01; 57.4% vs 42.6%). Furthermore, participants were classified into four classes of age: 18-29; 30-44; 45-59; and 60-79.

The ability to predict which patients may require mechanical ventilation allows increased acuity of care and targeted interventions to potentially mitigate deterioration. METHODS: We included hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in this single-centre retrospective observational study. Our primary outcome was mechanical ventilation or death within 24 h. As clinical decompensation is more recognisable, but less modifiable, as the prediction window shrinks, we also assessed 4, 8, and 48 h prediction windows. Model features included demographic information, laboratory results, comorbidities, medication administration, and vital signs. We created a Random Forest model, and assessed performance using 10-fold cross-validation. The model was compared with models derived from generalised estimating equations using discrimination. RESULTS: Ninety-three (23%) of 398 patients required mechanical ventilation or died within 14 days of admission. The Random Forest model predicted pending mechanical ventilation with good discrimination (C-statistic=0.858; 95% confidence interval, 0.841-0.874), which is comparable with the discrimination of the generalised estimating equation regression. Vitals sign data including SpO2/FiO2 ratio (Random Forest Feature Importance Z-score=8.56), ventilatory frequency (5.97), and heart rate (5.87) had the highest predictive utility. In our highest-risk cohort, the number of patients needed to identify a single new case was 3.2, and for our second quintile it was 5.0. CONCLUSION: Machine learning techniques can be leveraged to improve the ability to predict which patients with COVID-19 are likely to require mechanical ventilation, identifying unrecognised bellwethers and providing insight into the constellation of accompanying signs of respiratory failure in COVID-19.","output":"Clinically applicable approach for predicting mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this multi-experiment paper was to explore the concept of the minimum effective training dose (METD) required to increase 1-repetition-maximum (1RM) strength in powerlifting (PL) athletes. The METD refers to the least amount of training required to elicit meaningful increases in 1RM strength. A series of five studies utilising mixed methods, were conducted using PL athletes & coaches of all levels in an attempt to better understand the METD for 1RM strength. The studies of this multi-experiment paper are: an interview study with elite PL athletes and highly experienced PL coaches (n = 28), an interview and survey study with PL coaches and PL athletes of all levels (n = 137), two training intervention studies with intermediate-advanced PL athletes (n = 25) and a survey study with competitive PL athletes of different levels (n = 57). PL athletes looking to train with a METD approach can do so by performing ~3C6 working sets of 1C5 repetitions each week, with these sets spread across 1C3 sessions per week per powerlift, using loads above 80% 1RM at a Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of 7.5C9.5 for 6C12 weeks and expect to gain strength. PL athletes who wish to further minimize their time spent training can perform autoregulated single repetition sets at an RPE of 9C9.5 though they should expect that strength gains will be less likely to be meaningful. However, the addition of 2C3 back-off sets at ~80% of the single repetitions load, may produce greater gains over 6 weeks while following a 2-3-1 squat-bench press-deadlift weekly training frequency. When utilizing accessory exercises in the context of METD, PL athletes typically utilize 1C3 accessory exercises per powerlift, at an RPE in the range of 7C9 and utilize a repetition range of ~6C10 repetitions.","output":"The Minimum Effective Training Dose Required for 1RM Strength in Powerlifters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Due to the nature of the profession, dental healthcare workers are exposed to infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the severity of the pandemic presents challenges to dental education institutions worldwide. This study investigated dental students and clinical staff perceptions of health risks and impacts on clinical competence of working in teaching clinics during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A 39-item survey composed of closed and open questions was sent to students and clinical staff of a prominent Australasian dental school. Questions focused on students and clinical staff perceived impact of COVID-19 on their health, clinical safety and dental education. RESULTS: The majority of staff and students perceived their health to be at risk and this increased their stress and impacted clinical performance, particularly for students. The production of aerosols and violation of cross-infection protocols by some students were the main perceived contributors to COVID-19 cross-infection in teaching clinics. Both students and staff considered the closure of teaching clinics would cause extreme impacts on students' clinical competence; however, online case-based discussions and tutorials were suggested as potential alternative teaching methods that could be adopted during that period.

Potential predictors of per-capita coronavirus-related mortality in 200 countries by May 9, 2020 were examined, including age, gender, obesity prevalence, temperature, urbanization, smoking, duration of the outbreak, lockdowns, viral testing, contact-tracing policies, and public mask-wearing norms and policies. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed. In univariate analysis, the prevalence of smoking, per-capita gross domestic product, urbanization, and colder average country temperature were positively associated with coronavirus-related mortality. In a multivariable analysis of 196 countries, the duration of the outbreak in the country, and the proportion of the population aged 60 years or older were positively associated with per-capita mortality, whereas duration of mask-wearing by the public was negatively associated with mortality (all P < 0.001). Obesity and less stringent international travel restrictions were independently associated with mortality in a model which controlled for testing policy. Viral testing policies and levels were not associated with mortality. Internal lockdown was associated with a nonsignificant 2.4% reduction in mortality each week (P = 0.83). The association of contact-tracing policy with mortality was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). In countries with cultural norms or government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased on average by just 16.2% each week, as compared with 61.9% each week in remaining countries.

Albeit not usually perceived as being at high risk for tetanus, the Italian legal framework (Law No. 292 of 1963; Presidential Decree 1301/1965) requires tetanus vaccination (TeV) even for amateur practice. Even though some previous reports have suggested a relatively low adherence towards vaccination practice among basketball player, corresponding knowledge, attitudes and practices towards TeV remain largely unknown. Our study specifically investigated such topics in a total of 270 amateur basketball players participating into an internet-based survey by completing a structured questionnaire. Of them, 73.0% had a proper vaccination status, but a third of respondents (33.3%) exhibited some degree of vaccine hesitancy. The average understanding of TeV and tetanus (79.8% with a potential range 0C100) as well as the risk perception for natural infection (63.9%  26.6) were quite good. Even though unmotivated fears towards TeV were more scarcely reported (14.0%  15.4), they still represented the main reasons for having missed vaccination shots (63.0%). Knowledge status and risk perception for natural infection and TeV were well correlated (R = 0.22 and R = ?0.64, respectively). Appropriate TeV status was more likely in respondents not exhibiting vaccine hesitancy (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.114, 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) 0.059C0.225). In turn, vaccine hesitancy was more frequently reported among individuals of male gender (OR 3.148, 95%CI 1.072C9.244), while better formal education (OR 0.065, 95%CI 0.013C0.319) and working in healthcare settings (OR 0.042, 95%CI 0.007C0.265) were characterized as negative effectors. Vaccinations in athletes represent an often overlooked issue, with a considerable lack of available evidence. The results stress the opportunity for appropriate TeV screening programs among amateur athletes and the potential relevance of interventions aimed at raising the perceived significance of TeV in order to cope with a significant share of vaccine-hesitant athletes.","output":"Tetanus Vaccination Status and Vaccine Hesitancy in Amateur Basketball Players (Italy, 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the cornerstone of the current Internet of Things era. They have limited resources and features, a smaller packet size than other types of networks, and dynamic multi-hop transmission. WSNs can monitor a particular area of interest and are used in many different applications. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, WSNs have been used to measure social distancing/contact tracing among people. However, the major challenge faced by WSN protocols is limited battery energy. Therefore, the whole WSN area is divided into odd clusters using k-means++ clustering to make a majority rule decision to reduce the amount of additional data sent to the base station (or sink) and achieve node energy-saving efficiency. This study proposes an energy-efficient binarized data aggregation (EEBDA) scheme, by which, through a threshold value, the collected sensing data are asserted with binary values. Subsequently, the corresponding cluster head (CH), according to the Hamming weight and the final majority decision, is calculated and sent to the base station (BS). The EEBDA is based on each cluster and divides the entire WSN area into four quadrants. All CHs construct a data-relay transmission link in the same quadrant;the binary value is transferred from the CHs to the sink. The EEBDA adopts a CH rotation scheme to aggregate the data based on the majority results in the cluster. The simulation results demonstrate that the EEBDA can reduce redundant data transmissions, average the energy consumption of nodes in the cluster, and obtain a better network lifetime when compared to the LEACH, LEACH-C, and DEEC algorithms.","output":"Majority Decision Aggregation with Binarized Data in Wireless Sensor Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In its conception, Healthcare Policy was a partnership between the canadian Institutes of Health Research's Institute of Health Services and Policy Research (IHSPR), the Canadian Association of Health Services and Policy Research and Longwoods Publishing.

In total, 28 paired clinical specimens of saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 12 patients at various time points after symptom onset. Each specimen was assayed using reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the BD MAX open system using primers and probes targeting the N-gene. The saliva and nasopharyngeal swab specimens showed 19 and 15 positive results, respectively. No invalid (PCR inhibition) result was observed for any specimen. The qualitative results of each specimen obtained in the period immediately after symptom onset were similar. Three convalescent patients presented saliva-positive results, whereas their nasopharyngeal swabs were negative at four different time points, suggesting that saliva may be superior to nasopharyngeal swabs in terms of obtaining stable assay result of SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, our results suggest that saliva can potentially serve as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs as a specimen for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR.

DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled experimental study. METHODS: Of the 90 patients who underwent rhinoplasty surgery at Kayseri City Hospital, Turkey between October 2017 and December 2018, 79 were included in the study. The patients were assigned to an experimental or control group according to a computer-generated randomization list. The experimental group (n = 36) was educated using a rhinoplasty training guide prior to routine plastic surgery procedures. The control group (n = 35) received only routine plastic surgery procedures. A patient identification form, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Newcastle Satisfaction with Nursing Care Scale, and Visual Analog Scale were used to collect data. Data analysis included the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, Q-Q plot, two-way analysis of variance, Friedman and Mann-Whitney U tests, and Pearson's chi-square. FINDINGS: In the postoperative period, the mean state anxiety inventory score of the experimental group (36.25  9.78) was found to be significantly lower than that of the control group (42.28  9.42) (P < .05). There was no statistically significant difference between the trait anxiety inventory scores of the experimental (39.63  10.20) and control (38.77  6.16) (P > .05) groups.

The ASH Research Collaborative COVID-19 Registry for Hematology was developed to study features and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with underlying blood disorders, such as hematologic malignancies. At the time of this report, data from 250 patients with blood cancers from 74 sites around the world had been entered into the registry.

Viral DMVs are morphologically analogous to DMVs formed during autophagy, but lipids driving their biogenesis are largely unknown. Here we show that production of the lipid phosphatidic acid (PA) by acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) 1 and 2 in the ER is important for DMV biogenesis in viral replication and autophagy. Using DMVs in HCV-replicating cells as model, we found that AGPATs are recruited to and critically contribute to HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication and proper DMV formation. An intracellular PA sensor accumulated at viral DMV formation sites, consistent with elevated levels of PA in fractions of purified DMVs analyzed by lipidomics.

METHODS: This was a proof-of-concept study from a tertiary eye care center in Oakville, Canada. All participants underwent the N95 Qualitative Fit Test with a custom mask fitter secured over an ASTM Level 3 facemask. Participants answered a 1 to 10 Likert scale questionnaire on comfort, ease of use, and feasibility of the custom mask fitter, as well as comfort of a regular facemask. RESULTS: A total of 20 participants were recruited of whom 90% (18/20) successfully passed the Fit Test. The median scores for comfort, ease of use, and everyday feasibility for the custom mask fitter were 3.5, 4.5, and 3.0, respectively, while the median score for comfort of a regular facemask was 8.5. CONCLUSION: A reusable, low-cost, 3D printed custom mask fitter is a potential effective alternative to an N95 respirator amongst ECPs but may require improvement in its design and comfort. This is especially relevant in the context of a limited supply of N95 respirators amidst a global pandemic.","output":"Implementation of a 3D Printed Custom Mask Fitter in an Ophthalmology Setting during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The recent COVID-19 pandemic has forced various workforce industries to work from home. The work-from-home set-up has exposed some workers to some office-related work, typically not included in their jobs, consequently exposing them to an increased risk for developing musculoskeletal pain. Methods We will search PubMed, MEDLINE, and CINAHL for observational studies published between May 2020CJune 2021. This review will include published peer-reviewed studies in the English language. We will include studies that recruited adults aged 20C65 from any work industry reporting on outcomes related to musculoskeletal functions (i.e., pain, disorder, condition, etc.). Two independent reviewers will screen the search results. Two independent reviewers will accomplish risk of bias assessment using the JBI-MAStARI critical appraisal tools. Likewise, data extraction will be performed by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Pooled prevalence estimates will be generated using Revman V.5.2.1, where Forest plots will be generated to determine overall estimates of random-effects and confidence intervals. To quantify heterogeneity, we will index the I2 and X2 p-value. A narrative synthesis summarised into tables and themes will likewise be used to summarize the extracted data.

The curriculum unit integrated science and engineering content and practices to teach ecology, water pollution, and engineering design. We investigated the designed integrated STEM unit's effectiveness in students' science learning outcomes on pre-, post-, and delayed post-assessments. We collected pre-and post-assessment data of students' science learning outcomes for both the baseline group (taught via existing district-adopted curriculum) and an intervention group (taught with integrated life science and engineering curriculum). We used a quasi-experimental research design and examined differences between baseline and intervention groups. We used ANCOVA to explore differences in students' learning in baseline and intervention groups. Furthermore, for students in the intervention group, we conducted repeated-measures ANOVA to investigate knowledge retention. Our analyses also accounted for students' gender and People of Color (POC) status. We conducted multiple regression analyses to explore the relationship between students' gender, POC status, and their learning outcomes. The results indicated that the intervention group students performed significantly better than the students in the baseline group. The repeated measures ANOVA showed that students in the intervention group retained science knowledge after 8 weeks of instruction. Finally, the regression analysis for the baseline group showed that gender and POC status were not significant predictors of their post-assessment scores. However, POC status was a significant predictor of post-assessment scores and knowledge retention for the intervention group.

The aim of the study is to elucidate the characteristics and risk factors of late complications associated with TIVAP implantation via the IJV. METHODS The study included 482 patients who underwent TIVAP implantation for long-term chemotherapy and/or nutritional support between April 2012 and December 2017. Most patients (95.2%) had malignant diseases. Events requiring TIVAP removal were defined as TIVAP-related complications. RESULTS The median TIVAP and global follow-ups were 319 days (IQR 152-661) and 218,971 catheter days, respectively. The 3-year cumulative TIVAP availability rate was 70%. There were 44 complications (incidence of 9.1%; 0.201 complications/1000 catheter days). Infectious, catheter-related, and port-related complications occurred in 21, 14, and 9 patients, respectively with infectious complications occurring earlier and more frequently than catheter- and port-related complications. Multivariate analysis revealed that age < 65 years and presence of non-gastrointestinal diseases were significant unfavorable factors for TIVAP-related complications. Patients with 1 and 2 of these factors had an elevated risk (2.2 and 5.4 times, respectively) compared with those without. CONCLUSIONS Among the late complications associated with TIVAP implantation via the IJV, infectious complications occur earlier and more frequently than catheter- and port-related complications.

Previous preclinical studies demonstrated that intracerebroventricular administration of CGRP caused migraine-like behaviors in mice, but the sites of action in the brain remain unidentified. The cerebellum has the most CGRP binding sites in the central nervous system and is increasingly recognized as both a sensory and motor integration center. The objective of this study was to test whether the cerebellum, particularly the medial cerebellar nuclei (MN), might be a site of CGRP action. In this study, CGRP was directly injected into the right MN of C57BL/6J mice via a cannula. A battery of behavioral tests was done to assess migraine-like behaviors. CGRP caused light aversion measured as decreased time in the light zone even with dim light. The mice also spent more time resting in the dark zone, but not the light, along with decreased rearing and transitions between zones. These behaviors were similar for both sexes. In contrast, significant responses to CGRP were seen only with female mice in the open field assay, von Frey test, and automated squint assay, indicating anxiety, tactile hypersensitivity, and spontaneous pain, respectively. In male mice, the responses had the same trend as females but did not reach statistical significance. No detectable effect of CGRP on gait was observed in either sex. These results suggest that CGRP in the MN causes light aversion in males, while in females, light aversion is accompanied by increased anxiety, tactile hypersensitivity, and spontaneous pain. A caveat is that we cannot exclude contributions from other cerebellar regions in addition to the MN due to diffusion of the injected peptide. These results reveal the cerebellum as a new site of CGRP actions that may contribute to migraine pathophysiology and possibly its prevalence in females.","output":"CGRP Administration into the Cerebellum Evokes Migraine-like Behaviors Predominately in Female Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowing the experiences and feelings of health professionals who have actively worked on the first-line during the first COVID-19 outbreak could help for identifying specific professional duties focused on health assistance objectives.

Methods: Electronic medical records of pts on pem6w + axi between 1 May 2020 & 1 Jun 2021 in two large cancer centers in Scotland were analyzed retrospectively for pts' characteristics, treatment related adverse events (TRAE) and efficacy. Results: Total of 93 pts were identified (Table). At data cut off of 8 Sep 2021, with a median follow-up of 7 months (mo) (interquartile range (IQR) 5 mo;range 0-15 mo), 73 pts (78%) were alive. Clinician assessed radiological response was evaluable in 87 pts. Overall response rate (ORR) including partial response + complete response was noted in 49 pts (56%) with median time to response of 80 days (d). Clinical benefit rate including pts with ORR and stable disease was seen in 72 pts (83%). At data cut off, 24 pts (26%) had progressed with a median time to progression of 117 d (IQR: 85d). Median overall and progression free survival were not reached and follow-up continues. 81 pts (87%) had any grade and 28 pts (30%) had grade 3/4 TRAE. Immune related AE (irAE) of any grade occurred in 60 pts (65%) and grade 3/4 in 19 pts (20%). Common grade 3/4 irAE were transaminitis (10%), colitis (8%), nephritis (2%) and skin (2%). 28 (30%) and 14 pts (15%) respectively required steroids and hospitalisation for irAE with median hospital stay 6 d (range: 2-43 d). 10 pts suffered a second irAE requiring steroids and 5 pts had a second hospital stay with median hospital stay of 6 d. Any grade AE and grade 3/4 AE related to axi occurred in 67 (72%) and 14 pts (15%) respectively. Axi dose was escalated from 5mg to 7mg bd in 12 pts (13%), reduced to 3mg bd in 35 pts (38%) and 2mg bd in 10 pts (11%). 21pts (23%) on Pem and 15pts (16%) on axi discontinued treatment due to TRAE.

Some of these children are at a significant risk of recurrent and prolonged critical illness, with higher morbidity and mortality, making them a unique population described as having chronic critical illness (CCI). To date, pediatric CCI has been understudied and lacks an accepted consensus case definition. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the protocol and methodology used to perform a scoping review that will describe how pediatric CCI has been defined in the literature, including the concept of prolonged PICU admission and the methodologies used to develop any existing definitions. It also aims to describe patient characteristics and outcomes evaluated in the included studies. METHODS: We will search four electronic databases for studies that evaluated children admitted to any PICU identified with CCI. We will also search for studies describing prolonged PICU admission, as this concept is related to pediatric CCI. Furthermore, we will develop a hybrid crowdsourcing and machine learning (ML) methodology to complete citation screening. Screening and data abstraction will be performed by 2 reviewers independently and in duplicate. Data abstraction will include the details of population definitions, demographic and clinical characteristics of children with CCI, and evaluated outcomes. RESULTS: The database search, crowd reviewer recruitment, and ML algorithm development began in March 2021. Citation screening and data abstraction were completed in April 2021. Final data verification is ongoing, with analysis and results anticipated to be completed by fall 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review will describe the existing or suggested definitions of pediatric CCI and important demographic and clinical characteristics of patients to whom these definitions have been applied. This reviews results will help inform the development of a consensus case definition for pediatric CCI and set a priority agenda for future research.

Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are among the most common etiologic agents associated with viral respiratory tract infections in children worldwide. Nevertheless, limited information is available on the spread of infections of these two viruses in northwest Iran. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the frequency of RSV and HPIV-3 and clinical features among Iranian children with confirmed respiratory infections between April 2019 and March 2020. METHODS: 100 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from hospitalized patients (under 5 years old) with ARTI from Tabriz Children's Hospital. Detection of respiratory viruses was performed using the nested RT-PCR method. RESULTS: Respiratory syncytial virus and HPIV-3 were recognized in 18% (18/100) and 2% (2/100) of children, respectively. Ten (55.6%) of the RSV-positive samples were male, while 8 (44.4%) were female. HPIV\\\\3 was found only among 2 male patients (100%). Most patients (61.1%) with RSV infection were less than 12 months old. Additionally, samples that were positive for HPIV-3 were less than 12 months old. RSV infections had occurred mainly during the winter season. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that RSV can be one of the important respiratory pathogens in children in northwestern Iran. However, according to this study, HPIV-3 has a lower prevalence among children in this area than RSV.

In order to ensure the best peri-operative management, anaesthetists caring for these patients should have a thorough understanding of the disorder, and be aware of the individual's peri-operative risk constellation, which depends on the severity and phenotype of OSA, the invasiveness of the surgical procedure, anaesthesia and also the requirement for postoperative opioids.The objective of this review is to educate clinicians in the epidemiology, pathogenesis and diagnosis of OSA in adults and also to highlight specific tasks in the preoperative assessment, namely to select a suitable intra-operative anaesthesia regimen, and manage the extent and duration of postoperative care to facilitate the best peri-operative outcome.","output":"Obstructive sleep apnoea in adults: peri-operative considerations: A narrative review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) utilizing anomalous signal from native S atoms, or other atoms with Z  20, generally requires highly redundant data collected using relatively long-wavelength X-rays. Here, the results from two proteins are presented where the anomalous signal from serendipitously acquired surface-bound Ca atoms with an anomalous data multiplicity of around 10 was utilized to drive de novo structure determination. In both cases, the Ca atoms were acquired from the crystallization solution, and the data-collection strategy was not optimized to exploit the anomalous signal from these scatterers. The X-ray data were collected at 0.98 ? wavelength in one case and at 1.74 ? in the other (the wavelength was optimized for sulfur, but the anomalous signal from calcium was exploited for structure solution). Similarly, using a test case, it is shown that data collected at 1.0 ? wavelength, where the f value for sulfur is 0.28 e, are sufficient for structure determination using intrinsic S atoms from a strongly diffracting crystal. Interestingly, it was also observed that SHELXD was capable of generating a substructure solution from high-exposure data with a completeness of 70% for low-resolution reflections extending to 3.5 ? resolution with relatively low anomalous multiplicity. Considering the fact that many crystallization conditions contain anomalous scatterers such as Cl, Ca, Mn etc., checking for the presence of fortuitous anomalous signal in data from well diffracting crystals could prove useful in either determining the structure de novo or in accurately assigning surface-bound atoms.","output":"The hidden treasure in your data: phasing with unexpected weak anomalous scatterers from routine data sets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Thyroid storm is an endocrine emergency and life-threatening condition discovered in 1926. There is no specific laboratory parameter that can differentiate or distinguish between thyroid storm and primary hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is made on a clinical scoring system, including the BurchCWartofsky point scale and Japanese Thyroid Association scoring system. The management is early diagnosis, immediate initiation of anti-thyroid medications, intensive care monitoring, and prevention of multiorgan failure. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old Pakistani female presented with complaint of headache, vomiting, and generalized weakness for 3 weeks. She had an episode of seizure-like activity at home, and so was rushed to the emergency department. A detailed thyroid examination revealed a soft, nontender gland with no enlargement or bruit and no exophthalmos. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone was extremely low, with high free triiodothyronine and thyroxine. Thyroglobulin was 425 ng/ml (normal reference range  55 ng/ml), and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody was 0.87 IU/L (normal reference range 0C1.75 IU/L). She had high levels of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin hormone on initial presentation. Transvaginal ultrasound showed no intrauterine pregnancy, but an echogenic focus was found adherent to the right ovary with no vascularity. With the chief complaint of headache, she underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain that showed multiple scattered hemorrhagic lesions in supratentorial and infratentorial brain parenchyma that were highly suspicious for metastases. Computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed multiple neoplastic lesions in the lung, liver, spleen, and kidneys. A Tru-Cut liver biopsy showed linear cores of liver tissue with metastatic carcinoma with morphological features consistent with choriocarcinoma. Our patient scored 65 on the BurchCWartofsky point scale. As per the Japanese Thyroid Association scoring system, our patient met the criteria for a definite thyroid storm. She had initiated propranolol to achieve adequate control of her heart rate and dexamethasone. Carbimazole was started to control her thyroid function. Her thyroid function after 2 weeks of treatment showed significant improvement. Methotrexate and etoposide were given for choriocarcinoma. She made a good recovery and was discharged home. She will undergo rehabilitation along with ongoing chemotherapy (methotrexate and etoposide weekly till beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels normalize). Unless her source of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is carefully under control, she will continue to take anti-thyroid medications. CONCLUSION: Choriocarcinoma is not only associated with hyperthyroidism but can induce thyroid storm. Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is directly associated with promoting thyroid dysfunction. Patients with gestational trophoblastic disease should be under close surveillance to prevent thyroid storms.","output":"Metastatic choriocarcinoma in a young woman presenting as thyroid storm: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Patients with immune-mediated diseases treated with CD20 inhibitors may have worse COVID-19 outcomes due to impaired humoral immunity, but differences versus the general population are unknown. METHODS: We identified patients with immune-mediated diseases who received CD20 inhibitors within one year prior to the index date of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 between January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Comparators with COVID-19 were matched up to 5:1 by age, sex, and PCR date. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death in CD20 inhibitor users versus comparators were estimated using Cox regression. RESULTS: We identified 114 cases with COVID-19 who had received CD20 inhibitors for immune-mediated diseases (mean age 55 years, 70% female) and 559 matched comparators with COVID-19 (mean age 54 years, 70% female). CD20 inhibitor-treated cases had higher mortality (aHR 2.16; 95% CI: 1.03 to 4.54) than matched comparators. Risks of hospitalization (aHR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.26) and mechanical ventilation (aHR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.36 to 1.87) were similar. Similar trends were seen in analyses according to type of indication (e.g., rheumatic or neurologic disease) and duration of CD20 inhibitor use (<1 or 1 year), and after excluding patients with interstitial lung disease, cancer, and those on glucocorticoids prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received CD20 inhibitors for immune-mediated diseases prior to COVID-19 had higher mortality following COVID-19 than matched comparators, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate excess risks in CD20 inhibitor users during the ongoing pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Outcomes Among Users of CD20 Inhibitors for Immune-Mediated Diseases: A Comparative Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For health care, the collapse of services, the precarious conditions of workers, and the reproduction of social inequities and inequalities have exacerbated issues such as poverty, hunger, domestic violence, mental health problems, complications due to chronic diseases, and disability, adversely affecting socially vulnerable people, families, and communities Historical challenge of nursing care to alleviate human suffering As a knowledge and practice domain, collective health conceives the health-disease process-determined by historical, social, and cultural processes-as opposed to the primacy of individual biology and the fragmentation of the human being subordinated to the clinic and pathology of organs and systems, depending on the medical model (1) [ ]the WHO (2) has reiterated the importance of nursing staff in the health care system","output":"Challenges for Collective Health in Caring for Socially Vulnerable Individuals, Families, and Communities amidst the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundIn the absence of medical treatment and vaccination, individual behaviours are key to curbing the spread of COVID-19 Here we describe efforts to collect attitudinal and behavioural data and disseminate insights to increase situational awareness and inform interventions MethodsWe developed a rapid data collection and monitoring system based on a cross-national online survey, the COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey Respondent recruitment occurred via targeted Facebook advertisements in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States We investigated how the threat perceptions of COVID-19, the confidence in the preparedness of organisations to deal with the pandemic, and the adoption of preventive and social distancing behaviours are associated with respondents demographic characteristics ResultsWe analysed 71,612 questionnaires collected between March 13-April 19, 2020 We found substantial spatio-temporal heterogeneity across countries at different stages of the pandemic and with different control strategies in place Respondents rapidly adopted the use of face masks when they were not yet mandatory We observed a clear pattern in threat perceptions, sharply increasing from a personal level to national and global levels Although personal threat perceptions were comparatively low, all respondents significantly increased hand hygiene We found gender-specific patterns: women showed higher threat perceptions, lower confidence in the healthcare system, and were more likely to adopt preventive behaviours Finally, we also found that older people perceived higher threat to themselves, while all respondents were strongly concerned about their family ConclusionsRapid population surveys conducted via Facebook allow us to monitor behavioural changes, adoption of protective measures, and compliance with recommended practices As the pandemic progresses and new waves of infections are a threatening reality, timely insights from behavioural and attitudinal data are crucial to guide the decision-making process","output":"Behaviours and attitudes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: insights from a cross-national Facebook survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus 3C-like (3CL) protease is a Cysteine protease. It plays an important role in viral infection and immune escape by not only cleaving the viral polyprotein ORF1ab at 11 sites, but also cleaving the host proteins.

This study systematically investigated the diversity of the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease on the viral polyprotein, and found that the cleavage motif were highly conserved for viruses in the genera of Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus. Strong residue preferences were observed at the neighboring positions of the cleavage sites. A random forest (RF) model was built to predict the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease based on the representation of residues at cleavage site and neighboring positions by amino acid indexes, and the model achieved an AUC of 0.96 in cross-validations. The RF model was further tested on an independent test dataset composed of cleavage sites on host proteins, and achieved an AUC of 0.88 and a prediction precision of 0.80 when considering the accessibility of the cleavage site. Then, 1,079 human proteins were predicted to be cleaved by the 3CL protease by the RF model. These proteins were enriched in pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases and pathogen infection. Finally, a user-friendly online server named 3CLP was built to predict the cleavage sites of the coronavirus 3CL protease based on the RF model.

The Italian government not only isolated the village where he lived, but a few days later put the entire country in lockdown. We have here analyzed the COVID-19 Italian data during the first three months after the outbreak and the effect of lockdown. COVID-19 virus has a high transmission rate and is associated with high fatality rate especially in the older population. The initial reproduction rate of the virus (R0) in Italy was between 2.1 and 3.3 in different Italian regions, with a doubling time between 2.7 and 3.2 days. The number of confirmed cases has now reached 229,000 but after the lockdown R0 is finally below 1. Despite the lockdown, the number of infected and deceased patients in Italy was very high, with a lethality rate higher than in other countries. It is likely that number of cases is underestimating the real since the number of asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic is relatively high.

Methods This single-center observational study included 118 children suffering from various rheumatic diseases and receiving therapy with anti-rheumatic drugs and biological agents. In this research, we analyzed the incidence of CIVID-19 and the frequency of documented contact with SARS-CoV-2 in the period from 01.03.2020 to 11.10.2020 (32 weeks). The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Among 118 children, there were 28 (24%) boys and 90 (76%) girls, average age 10.34.2. 104 (88.2%) patients had different types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), 2 (1.6%) children had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 2 (1.6%) patients had juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), 1 (1%) child had ANCA-associated vasculitis, 6 (5%) patients had familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), 2 (1.6%) children had deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2), 1 (1%) child had TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). In this group of patients 94 (79%) patients were treated with methotrexate, 1 (1%) - azathioprine, 3 (2%) patients received hydroxychloroquine, 6(5%) - mycophenolate mofetil, 4 (3%) - sulfasalazine, 14(11%) children received prednisone, 6(5%) - cyclosporine A. All children included in this study received biological agents for more than 1 year, the distribution of biological agents among patients was as follows: 41(34%) - etanercept, 33(28%) - adalimumab, 24 (20%) - tocilizumab, 7 (6%) - canakinumab, 3 (2%) - abatacept, 4 (3%) - golimumab, 6 (5%) - rituximab. Out of 118 children, 4 (3%) patients had flu-like symptoms and positive results of PCR tests for COVID-19 (1 patient was treated with etanercept, 1 - adalimumab, 1 - tocilizumab, 1 - rituximab), none of the patients had signs of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. 10 (8%) patients had documented contact with COVID-19: among this patients 2 children had flu-like symptoms, positive results of PCR tests and absence of COVID-19 pneumonia (one of this patient was treated with adalimumab, another one - with rituximab), one more patient was treated with tocilizumab and had positive PCR test without any symptoms of COVID-19; other 7 children had negative PCR tests and didnt have any signs of COVID-19. Conclusion Among our patients with various rheumatic diseases treated with biological agents there were no registered severe cases of COVID-19. Over the past period (32 weeks of follow-up) 3% of children with COVID-19 were identified and 8% patients had documented contact with COVID-19, but we suppose it is too early to make conclusions about the degree and severity of COVID-19 among children suffering from rheumatic diseases and receiving various biological agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively studied 50 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy with porcine grafts of small intestinal submucosa (21) or dermal collagen (29). We compared these patients to 100 consecutive controls in whom polypropylene was used, and underwent surgery before (50) or after (50) the cases. The primary outcome was anatomical cure (stage I or less at any compartment). Secondary outcomes were graft related complications, subjective cure and quality of life evaluated by clinical examination, standardized interview and prolapse specific questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS At study closure 129 (86%) patients were available for functional evaluation and 104 (67%) were available for anatomical evaluation. Mean postoperative followup (+/-33 months) and baseline characteristics except age were comparable. The overall anatomical failure rate was comparable (49% vs 34%, p = 0.053) but failures at the vault (21% vs 3%, p <0.01) and posterior compartment (36% vs 19%, p <0.05) were more frequent in the xenograft group. There were 6 reoperations including secondary laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (5) and cystocele repair (1), all confined to the xenograft group (p <0.01). Graft related complications were equally frequent (11%) in the xenograft and polypropylene groups. The reoperation rate for graft related complications was not different (xenograft 3% vs controls 11%, p = 0.20). There were no differences in functional outcome and quality of life between xenografts and controls.

Although the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric populations result in minimal or mild COVID-19 in the acute phase of infection, a small subset of children develop severe and even critical disease in this phase with concomitant inflammation that may benefit from immunomodulation. Therefore, guidance is needed regarding immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of acute pediatric COVID-19. This document does not provide guidance regarding the recently emergent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of pediatric subspecialty physicians and pharmacists with expertise in infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, and critical care medicine was convened. Guidance statements were developed based on best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: The panel devised a framework for considering the use of immunomodulatory therapy based on an assessment of clinical disease severity and degree of multi-organ involvement combined with evidence of hyperinflammation. Additionally, the known rationale for consideration of each immunomodulatory approach and the associated risks and benefits was summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulatory therapy is not recommended for the majority of pediatric patients, who typically develop mild or moderate COVID-19. For children with severe or critical illness, the use of immunomodulatory agents may be beneficial. The risks and benefits of such therapies are variable and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from appropriate specialty services. When available, the panel strongly favors immunomodulatory agent use within the context of clinical trials.

This study aimed to (1) understand how COVID-19 stressors are related to different coping strategies and (2) identify whether coping strategies act as mechanisms accounting for the associations between COVID-19 stressful experiences and mental health problems in pregnancy. Participants were 304 pregnant women from Ontario, Canada. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, and perceived stress were assessed using validated measures. COVID-related stressors (i.e., financial difficulties, social isolation), subjective negative impact of COVID-19, and coping strategies used in response to COVID-19 were assessed by questionnaires. Results indicated that the subjective negative impact of COVID-19 was associated with more dysfunctional coping and less emotion-focused coping, whereas specific COVID-19 stressors, namely financial difficulties and social isolation, were associated with more dysfunctional coping and problem-focused coping. Dysfunctional coping was linked to elevated mental health problems and emotion-focused coping was linked to less mental health problems. Dysfunctional coping and emotion-focused coping partially mediated the effects of specific COVID-19 stressors on mental health outcomes.

Governing boards, administrators, and governments made decisions including eliminating faculty and staff, and programs yet these decisions were rarely inclusive of university stakeholders or innovative. This study's purpose is to examine and compare viewpoints of stakeholders in relation to addressing the financial impact of the pandemic in hopes of capturing innovative and effective pathways for universities. Because the purpose involved describing and comparing these viewpoints, the researcher selected a unique mixed method, Q methodology [Q] for this study. In Q, participants sort statements related to the topic into a grid such that their Q-sort provides a snapshot of their subjectivity. Participants' sorts are grouped empirically into factors, each representing unique viewpoints. Three distinct viewpoints emerged: 1) Focus on teaching mission and students, 2) University as a business, and 3) University as community. Views 1 and 3 were dominated by university faculty while View 2 was dominated by non-faculty including administrators and staff. Q's determination of distinguishing statements within each view provides the ability to compare these views' uniqueness. The three views and consensus among the views represent rejection of decisions to lay off faculty or close programs, among others, in order to balance university finances. The importance of tenured faculty in relationship to shared governance and academic freedom is especially stressed by two of the viewpoints.

There are multiple evidence-based pharmacological and psychosocial treatments for ADHD, and greater service utilization is associated with improved acute and long-term outcomes. However, long-term outcomes are suboptimal as multimodal treatments are often not accessed and most care ends prematurely. This narrative review discusses barriers to engagement for children and adolescents with ADHD and their families as well as interventions to overcome these barriers. Families face a variety of structural and attitudinal barriers, ranging from cost and access to stigma and low self-efficacy to successfully implement change. There are multiple interventions that may enhance engagement with ADHD care including psychoeducation, integration of behavioral services in general medical settings, telehealth as well as specific adaptations to existing ADHD treatments, such as the use of motivational interviewing or shared decision making. Integration of behavioral health into general medical settings and telehealth have been found in controlled studies to increase access by reducing both structural and attitudinal barriers. Adding motivational interviewing, shared decision making and other engagement interventions to evidence-based ADHD treatments has been found to reduce attitudinal barriers that translates into improved participation and satisfaction while enhancing outcomes. However, little is known about how to promote extended engagement with ADHD services even though a chronic care model for ADHD is recommended.","output":"Review of barriers and interventions to promote treatment engagement for pediatric attention deficit hyperactivity disorder care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumonia, a common disease caused by a great diversity of infectious agents is responsible for enormous morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Substantial investment has been made to develop biomarkers for cancer detection, but few have reached routine clinical practice. We aimed to identify novel biomarkers for upper GI cancers which have been sufficiently validated to be ready for evaluation in low-prevalence populations. METHODS We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, and Web of Science for studies published in English from January 2000 to October 2019 (PROSPERO registration CRD42020165005). Reference lists of included studies were assessed. Studies had to report on second measures of diagnostic performance (beyond discovery phase) for biomarkers (single or in panels) used to detect pancreatic, oesophageal, gastric, and biliary tract cancers. We included all designs and excluded studies with less than 50 cases/controls. Data were extracted on types of biomarkers, populations and outcomes. Heterogeneity prevented pooling of outcomes. RESULTS We identified 149 eligible studies, involving 22,264 cancer cases and 49,474 controls. A total of 431 biomarkers were identified (183 microRNAs and other RNAs, 79 autoantibodies and other immunological markers, 119 other proteins, 36 metabolic markers, 6 circulating tumour DNA and 8 other). Over half (n = 231) were reported in pancreatic cancer studies. Only 35 biomarkers had been investigated in at least two studies, with reported outcomes for that individual marker for the same tumour type. Apolipoproteins (apoAII-AT and apoAII-ATQ), and pepsinogens (PGI and PGII) were the most promising biomarkers for pancreatic and gastric cancer, respectively. CONCLUSION Most novel biomarkers for the early detection of upper GI cancers are still at an early stage of matureness. Further evidence is needed on biomarker performance in low-prevalence populations, in addition to implementation and health economic studies, before extensive adoption into clinical practice can be recommended.","output":"Identifying Novel Biomarkers Ready for Evaluation in Low-Prevalence Populations for the Early Detection of Upper Gastrointestinal Cancers: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study investigated the practical clinical consequences of offering surgery for metabolic disease and diabetes as opposed to weight loss. BACKGROUND The terms \\"metabolic\\" and \\"diabetes surgery\\" indicate a surgical approach whose primary intent is the control of metabolic alterations/hyperglycemia in contrast to \\"bariatric surgery,\\" conceived as a mere weight-reduction therapy. METHODS A \\"metabolic surgery\\" program distinct from the \\"bariatric surgery\\" program was recently established at a tertiary US academic medical center. The 2 programs differ in their stated goals but offer the same procedures and use identical eligibility criteria for patients with morbid obesity. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed from a prospective database of 200 consecutive patients who underwent surgery at these units. RESULTS Metabolic surgery patients were older (45.813.4 v 41.811.7, P<0.05), had a lower body mass index (42.47.1 vs 48.69.5 kg/m; P<0.01), and a higher prevalence of being of the male sex (42% vs 26%, P<0.05), having diabetes (62% vs 35%; P<0.01), hypertension (68% vs 52%; P<0.05), dyslipidemia (48% vs 31%; P<0.05), and cardiovascular disease (14% vs 5%; P<0.05). Diabetes was more severe among metabolic surgery patients (higher glycated hemoglobin levels; greater percentage of insulin use). There was no mortality, and there were no differences in perioperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Offering surgery to treat metabolic disease or diabetes rather than as a mere weight-reduction therapy changes demographical and clinical characteristics of surgical candidates.

While SARS-CoV-2 was becoming a global threat, scientists have been accumulating data on the virus at an impressive pace, both in terms of genomic sequences and of three-dimensional structures. On 15 February 2021, from the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in the GISAID resource, we collected 415,673 complete S protein sequences and identified all the mutations occurring in the HR1 fusion core. This is a 21-residue segment, which, in the post-fusion conformation of the protein, gives many strong interactions with the heptad repeat 2, bringing viral and cellular membranes in proximity for fusion. We investigated the frequency and structural effect of novel mutations accumulated over time in such a crucial region for the virus infectivity. Three mutations were quite frequent, occurring in over 0.1% of the total sequences. These were S929T, D936Y, and S949F, all in the N-terminal half of the HR1 fusion core segment and particularly spread in Europe and USA. The most frequent of them, D936Y, was present in 17% of sequences from Finland and 12% of sequences from Sweden. In the post-fusion conformation of the unmutated S protein, D936 is involved in an inter-monomer salt bridge with R1185.

Contacts of infected individuals are asked to quarantine, which can significantly slow down (or prevent) community spread. Contact tracing is particularly effective when infections are detected quickly (e.g., through rapid testing), when contacts are traced with high probability, when the initial number of cases is low, and when social distancing and border restrictions are in place. However, the magnitude of the individual contribution of these factors in reducing epidemic spread and the impact of vaccination in determining contact tracing outputs is not fully understood. We present a delayed differential equation model to investigate how vaccine roll-out and the relaxation of social distancing requirements affect contact tracing practises. We provide an analytical criteria to determine the minimal contact tracing efficiency (defined as the the probability of identifying and quarantining contacts of symptomatic individuals) required to keep an outbreak under control, with respect to the contact rate and vaccination status of the population. Additionally, we consider how delays in outbreak detection and increased case importation rates affect the number of contacts to be traced daily. We show that in vaccinated communities a lower contact tracing efficiency is required to avoid uncontrolled epidemic spread, and delayed outbreak detection and relaxation of border restrictions do not lead to a significantly higher risk of overwhelming contact tracing. We find that investing in testing programs, rather than increasing the contact tracing capacity, has a larger impact in determining whether an outbreak will be controllable. This is because early detection activates contact tracing, which will slow, and eventually reverse exponential growth, while the contact tracing capacity is a threshold that will easily become overwhelmed if exponential growth is not curbed. Finally, we evaluate quarantine effectiveness during vaccine roll-out, by considering the proportion of people that will develop an infection while in isolation in relation to the vaccination status of the population and for different viral variants. We show that quarantine effectiveness decreases with increasing proportion of fully vaccinated individuals, and increases in the presence of more transmissible variants. These results suggest that a cost-effective approach during vaccine roll-out is to establish different quarantine rules for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, where rules should depend on viral trans-missibility.

METHOD: We determined the incidence density of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 reinfection in a cohort of adult SOT recipients initially infected between March 1st, 2020 and March 30th, 2021 and included those with initial infection before or after transplantation. Incidence density was the total cases divided by total days after initial diagnosis with active graft. RESULTS: Of 210 infected recipients, five (2.4%) developed reinfection, including two who had received full mRNA vaccination, but none developed hypoxia. The incidence density for reinfection was 9.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9\\\\22.6) and for primary infection the density was 9.1 (95% CI 7.9C10.5) cases/100,000 patient days.

Availability of front-line targeted therapies for NSCLC demands access to good quality tissue for genomic sequencing and rapid reporting of results. Diagnosis of lung cancer and availability of tissue was delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A pilot study assessing Guardant360? cfDNA-NGS in patients with radiological-suspected advanced-stage lung cancer was performed at an academic cancer centre during COVID-19. Variants were tiered using AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines and discussed at a tumour molecular board. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who commenced targeted treatment based on cfDNA-NGS results without tissue molecular results, predicted to be  10%. RESULTS: Between April 2020-May 2021, 51 patients were enrolled; 49 were evaluable. The median age was 71 years, 43% were never-smokers, 86% had stage IV disease. 80% of evaluable cfDNA-NGS were informative (tumour-derived cfDNA detected). cfDNA-NGS detected 30 (61%) AMP/ASCO/CAP tier 1 variants, including 20 additional tier 1 variants compared to tissue testing. Three patients with non-informative cfDNA-NGS had tier 1 variants identified on tissue testing. Eleven (22%; 95%CI 12%-27%) patients commenced targeted therapy based on cfDNA-NGS results without tissue molecular results, meeting the primary endpoint. Median time to results was shorter for cfDNA-NGS compared to standard-of-care tissue tests (9 versus 25 days, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Blood-first cfDNA-NGS in NSCLC patients increased the breadth and rapidity of detection of actionable variants with high tissue concordance and led to timely treatment decisions.

Most of these studies were small or did not evaluate a broad scope of possible complications. Therefore, a large population-based cohort study was conducted to study the associations between maternal hyperthyroidism and pregnancy and perinatal complications. METHODS: This is a retrospective population-based cohort study utilizing data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project-Nationwide Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS) over 11 years from 2004 to 2014. A cohort of all deliveries between 2004 and 2014 inclusively was created. Within this group, all deliveries to women with hyperthyroidism were the study group (n=16,984), and the remaining deliveries were categorized as non-hyperthyroidism births and comprised the reference group (n=9,079,804). The main outcome measures were pregnancy and perinatal complications. RESULTS: Maternal hyperthyroidism was associated with several pregnancy and perinatal complications, including increased risks of gestational hypertension (aOR 1.236, 95%CI 1.045-1.462, P=0.013) and preeclampsia (aOR 1.190, 95%CI 1.006-1.408, P=0.042).

Similarly, the Omicron spike evaded neutralization by antibodies from convalescent or BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals with 10- to 44-fold higher efficiency than the spike of the Delta variant. Neutralization of the Omicron spike by antibodies induced upon heterologous ChAdOx1/BNT162b2-vaccination or vaccination with three doses of BNT162b2 was more efficient, but the Omicron spike still evaded neutralization more efficiently than the Delta spike.

However, pivotal studies have been conducted in healthy volunteers, while recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantations (allo-HCT) may have different dynamics and patterns of response to the vaccine and data in this cohort is lacking. Methods: Here, we examined longitudinal antibody (AB) titers to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with BNT162b (Comirnaty ?) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine ?) in allo-HCT recipients who had undergone allo-HCT >3months (m) ago and in healthy controls (hospital employers). Serial AB titers (prior to (T0); 1m after 1 st dose (T1); 1m (T2), 3m (T3), 6m (T4) post 2 nd dose) were measured with an in-house developed multiplex Antibody CORonavirus Assay (ABCORA) that measures SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM reactivities against RBD (receptor binding domain), S1 (subunit 1 of the spike protein), S2 (subunit 2 of the spike protein) and N (nucleoprotein), thereby allowing to differentiate immunity after vaccination versus immunity after infection. As neutralization activity correlates well with S1 AB binding, the potency of the AB response was defined as the sum of S1 IgG, IgA and IgM reactivities (cumulative S1 (cS1)). Based on computational methods high neutralization potency was predicted above a cS1 threshold of 17. Results: We enrolled 114 allo-HCT patients (median age 57y (range 18y-74y)) between March 9th 2021 and May 31st 2021 at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. Currently, AB responses at T1, T2, and T3 are available for 99, 95 and 89 patients, respectively. Patients were grouped into those (A) 3-6m post-HCT (T1: n=25 at, T2: n=23, T3: n=20); (B) 6-12m post-HCT (T1: n=13, T2: n=13, T3: n=12); and (C) >12m post-HCT (T1: n=61, T2: n=59, T3: n=57). In addition, AB responses are available for healthy controls (median age 35y (range 23y-64y)) (T1: n=75, T2: n=69, T3: n=48). There were 10 patients and 5 healthy subjects with a reported or detected SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was a statistically significant difference of cS1 AB levels between the 4 groups at T1, T2, and T3 (ANOVA p-values (p) <0.001, respectively, Fig 1) with the lowest AB response in group A (cS1 median value 0.957 at T1, 5.22 at T2, 1.90 at T3) and B (cS1 median value 0.973 at T1, 4.76 at T2, 11.9 at T3) compared to group C (cS1 median value 6.21 at T1, 199 at T2, 76.4 at T3) and healthy controls (cS1 median value 54.9 at T1, 228 at T2, 91.1 at T3). Using a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted on age and gender, we found that patients in groups A and B had significantly lower cS1 levels than groups C and healthy subjects (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.034 of healthy versus groups A, B, C respectively at T2, and p<0.001, p=0.004, p=0.12 at T3), and that preinfected patients had higher cS1 levels at T2 and T3 respectively (p=0.003 and 0.006). The dynamics of the AB response were more diverse in allo-HCT recipients. In a multivariate linear regression analysis (Fig 2) assessing factors associated with humoral immune responses in allo-HCT recipients, we found consistently lower cS1 responses in patients early post-HCT (group A+B (p=0.002)) and higher cS1 levels in those who had been preinfected with SARS-CoV-2 (p=0.012). Patients under immunosuppressive treatment (IST) and those who had relapsed disease post-HCT showed significantly lower cS1 immune responses (p=0.028 and 0.005, respectively). The presence of moderate or severe chronic GVHD was not a statistically significant factor influencing AB levels. This may be explained by (i) the heterogeneity of the condition of chronic GVHD and low patient numbers; (ii) the late time point >12m post-HCT with generally higher AB levels. Consistent with other reports age >65y was also associated with lower cS1 responses (p=0.03). Conclusion: Allo-HCT recipients early post-transplant, those of older age, and those given IST displayed insufficient AB titers to the vaccine. Such knowledge is of critical importance to transplant recipients and their physicians to guide treatment decisions regarding re-vaccination, and social behavior during this pandemic. Monitoring AB development in all allo-HCT recipients and vulnerable patients with other immunocompromising conditions may be crucial to determine those at increased risk for infection and for the timing of booster vaccines.

Evaluation of the 5,599 initially identified search hits by two independent reviewers and a detailed quality assessment resulted in six methodologically adequate cohort studies considering the relationship between psychosocial working conditions and burnout (one study) as well as the burnout core component emotional exhaustion (five studies). RESULTS The results of our systematic review point to a relationship between psychosocial working conditions and the development of emotional exhaustion/burnout. Particularly high job demands seem to play a role in the development of emotional exhaustion. However, strong intercorrelations between workplace factors, as a matter of principle, make the identification of a single psychosocial workplace factor (being associated with an especially high or low risk of burnout) difficult.

The following demographical and clinical features have been analyzed: age, gender, etiology of RD, macular involvement, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and duration of experienced symptoms. RESULTS: Eighty-two subjects (20.51.0 eyes/year) were diagnosed with RD in the pre-COVID-19 period, compared to 12 patients in the COVID-19 period (?41.5%). During the pandemic, patients complained symptoms for a median of 8.5 days (IQR, 1.7C15 days) before the EED consultation, while in the pre-COVID-19 period, they declared they had been symptomatic for 2 days (IQR, 1C4 days) (p=0.037); macula-off RD raised from 56% to 75% and no one reported trauma as a triggering event. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of RD diagnosed in our EED decreased significantly and patients waited longer before asking for an ophthalmologic examination.

However, long-term use of rHuG-CSF is not recommended in cats because of the neutralizing antibody production to rHuG-CSF that affects the drug activity. In addition, a preliminary finding suggests that repeated treatment cycle can also induce cross-neutralizing antibodies to rFeG-CSF, which may potentially affect the homeostasis of endogenous FeG-CSF.","output":"FIV-infected cats respond to short-term rHuG-CSF treatment which results in anti-G-CSF neutralizing antibody production that inactivates drug activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected Latino adults aged 50 and older in California. Among adults aged 50C64, Latinos constitute approximately one-third (32%) of the population, but over half (52%) of COVID-19 cases, and more than two-thirds (64%) of COVID-related deaths as of June 2, 2021. These health disparities are also prevalent among Latinos 65 years and older who constitute 22% of the population, but 40% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 50% of COVID-related deaths. Emergency medical services (EMS) are an essential component of the United States healthcare system and a vital sector in COVID-19 response efforts. Using data from the California Emergency Medical Services Information System (CEMSIS), this study examines racial and ethnic differences in respiratory distress related EMS calls among adults aged 50 and older in all counties except Los Angeles. This study compares the early pandemic period, January to June 2020, to the same time period in 2019. Between January and June 2019, Latinos aged 50 and older had statistically significantly lower odds of respiratory distress related EMS calls compared to Blacks, Asians, and Whites. During the early pandemic period, January to June 2020, Latinos aged 50 and older had statistically significantly lower odds of respiratory distress related EMS calls compared to Blacks but slightly higher odds compared to Whites. Differences by race/ethnicity and region were statistically significant. Understanding EMS health disparities is crucial to inform policies that create a more equitable prehospital care system for the heterogeneous population of middle aged and older adults.","output":"Emergency Medical Service Use Among Latinos Aged 50 and Older in California Counties, Except Los Angeles, During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic Period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital image feature recognition is significant to industrial information applications, such as bioengineering, medical diagnosis, and machinery industry In order to supply an effective and reasonable technology of the severity assessment mission of COVID-19, we propose a new method that identifies rich features of lung infections from a chest CT image, and then assesses the severity of COVID-19 based on the extracted features First, in a chest CT image, the lung contours are corrected for the segmentation of bilateral lungs Then, the lung contours and areas are obtained from the lung regions Next, the coarseness, contrast, roughness, and entropy texture features are extracted to confirm the COVID-19 infected regions, and then the lesion contours are extracted from the infected regions Finally, the texture features and V-descriptors are fused as an assessment descriptor for the COVID-19 severity estimation In the experiments, we show the feature extraction and lung lesion segmentation results based on some typical COVID-19 infected CT images In the lesion contour reconstruction experiments, the performance of V-descriptors is compared with some different methods, and various feature scores indicate that the proposed assessment descriptor reflects the infected ratio and the density feature of the lesions well, which can estimate the severity of COVID-19 infection more accurately IEEE","output":"Severity Assessment of COVID-19 Based on Feature Extraction and V-Descriptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Tumor cells experience hypoxia, acidosis, and hypoglycemia. Metabolic adaptation to a glucose shortage is essential to maintain tumor cell survival because of their high glucose requirement. This study aimed to study the hypothesis that acidosis might promote tumor survival during a glucose shortage and if so, to explore a novel drug targeting metabolic vulnerability to glucose shortage. METHODS Cell survival and bioenergetics metabolism were assessed in lung cancer cell lines. Our in-house small-molecule compounds were screened to identify those that kill cancer cells under low-glucose conditions. Cytotoxicity against non-cancerous cells was also assessed. Tumor growth was evaluated in vivo using a mouse engraft model. RESULTS Acidosis limited the cellular consumption of glucose and ATP, causing tumor cells to enter a metabolically dormant but energetically economic state, which promoted tumor cell survival during glucose deficiency. We identified ESI-09, a previously known exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EAPC) inhibitor, as an anticancer compound that inhibited cancer cells under low-glucose conditions, even when associated with acidosis. Bioenergetic studies showed that independent of EPAC inhibition, ESI-09 was a safer mitochondrial uncoupler than a classical uncoupler and created a futile cycling of mitochondrial respiration leading to decreased ATP production, increased ATP dissipation, and fuel scavenging. Accordingly, ESI-09 exhibited more cytotoxic effects under low-glucose conditions than under normal glucose conditions. ESI-09 was also more effective than actively proliferating cells on quiescent glucose-restricted cells. Cisplatin showed opposite effects. ESI-09 inhibited tumor growth in lung-cancer engraft mice. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the acidosis-induced promotion of tumor survival during glucose shortage and demonstrates that ESI-09 is a novel potent anticancer mitochondrial uncoupler that targets a metabolic vulnerability to glucose shortage even when associated with acidosis. The higher cytotoxicity under lower than normal glucose conditions suggests that ESI-09 is safer than conventional chemotherapy, can target the metabolic vulnerability of tumor cells to low-glucose stress, and is applicable to many cancer cell types.","output":"Anticancer strategy targeting the energy metabolism of tumor cells surviving a low-nutrient acidic microenvironment (R1)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Service-learning is a high-impact educational practice at the core of the undergraduate public health degree at the University of Hawaii at Mnoa (UHM).

Though school aged children are often recognized as driving the transmission of influenza as well as other respiratory viruses, little detailed information is available on the distribution of respiratory infections among children of different ages within this group. Factors other than age including gender and time spent in school may also be important in determining risk of infection but have been little studied in this age group. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study to determine the etiology of influenza like illness (ILI) among 2519 KC12 students during the 2012C13 influenza season. We obtained nasal swabs from students with ILI-related absences. Generalized linear mixed-effect regressions determined associations of outcomes, including ILI and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection, with school grade and other covariates. RESULTS: Overall, 459 swabs were obtained from 552 ILICrelated absences. Respiratory viruses were found in 292 (63.6%) samples. Influenza was found in 189 (41.2%) samples. With influenza B found in 134 (70.9%). Rates of influenza B were significantly higher in grades 1 (10.1, 95% CI 6.8C14.4%), 2 (9.7, 6.6C13.6%), 3 (9.3, 6.3C13.2%), and 4 (9.9, 6.8C13.8%) than in kindergarteners (3.2, 1.5C6.0%). After accounting for grade, sex and self-reported vaccination status, influenza B infection risk was lower among kindergarteners in half-day programs compared to kindergarteners in full-day programs (OR = 0.19; 95% CI 0.08C0.45). CONCLUSIONS: ILI and influenza infection is concentrated in younger schoolchildren. Reduced infection by respiratory viruses is associated with a truncated school day for kindergarteners but this finding requires further investigation in other grades and populations.

When the decision was made to reactivate the surgical practice, several major structural and operational changes were made to the regional surgical practice to optimize efficiencies. Results The structural and operational changes implemented during reactivation resulted in improved utilization of surgical resources including improvement in OR block utilization, increased available OR time, and increased case volumes. Conclusion Surgical and procedural leaders should consider a limited-time deferral of elective surgical cases to implement widespread OR efficiency strategies.

Pathogenesis is promoted by reactive oxygen species accumulating at birth if counter-regulation is inadequate. The flavonol quercetin exerts antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects that may enhance neonatal health. The aim of this work was to study effects of quercetin feeding on metabolic, antioxidative and inflammatory parameters in neonatal calves to investigate whether quercetin could compensate for insufficient colostrum supply. Twenty-eight newborn calves were assigned to two dietary groups fed colostrum or milk-based formula on day 1 and 2 and milk replacer thereafter. From day 2 onwards, 7 calves per diet group were additionally fed quercetin aglycone (50 mg/(kg body weight  day)). Blood samples were taken repeatedly to measure plasma concentrations of flavonols, glucose, lactate, total protein, albumin, urea, non-esterified fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, haptoglobin and serum amyloid A. Trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity, ferric reducing ability of plasma, thiobarbituric acid reactive species and F2-isoprostanes were analyzed to evaluate plasma antioxidative status. Expression of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, interleukin-1, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase mRNA were measured in liver tissue on day 8. Plasma flavonol concentrations were detectable only after quercetin-feeding without differences between colostrum and formula feeding. Plasma glucose, lactate, total protein, immunoglobulins, triglycerides, cholesterol, trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity and thiobarbituric acid reactive species were higher after colostrum feeding. Body temperature, fecal fluidity and plasma concentrations of cortisol and haptoglobin were higher in formula- than in colostrum-fed groups. Hepatic mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor was higher after quercetin feeding and expression of C-reactive protein was higher after formula feeding.

However, the exact mechanisms on how the number and position of branches are determined are still not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of Arl8B, an adaptor molecule between lysosomes and kinesins. In chick retinal ganglion cells, downregulation of Arl8B reduces axon branch density and shifts their location more proximally, while Arl8B overexpression leads to increased density and more distal positions of branches. These alterations correlate with changes in the location and density of lysosomes and autophagosomes along the axon shaft. Diminishing autophagy directly by knockdown of atg7, a key autophagy gene, reduces branch density, while induction of autophagy by rapamycin increases axon branching, indicating that autophagy plays a prominent role in axon branch formation. In vivo, local inactivation of autophagy in the retina using a mouse conditional knockout approach disturbs retino-collicular map formation which is dependent on the formation of interstitial axon branches. These data suggest that Arl8B plays a principal role in the positioning of axon branches by spatially controlling autophagy, thus directly controlling formation of neural connectivity in the brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe formation of interstitial axonal branches plays a prominent role in numerous places of the developing brain during neural circuit establishment. We show here that the GTPase Arl8B controls density and location of interstitial axon branches, and at the same time controls also density and location of the autophagy machinery. Up- or down-regulation of autophagy in vitro promotes or inhibits axon branching. Local disruption of autophagy in vivo disturbs retino-collicular mapping. Our data suggest that Arl8B controls axon branching by controlling locally autophagy. This work is one of the first reports showing a role of autophagy during early neural circuit development and suggests that autophagy in general plays a much more prominent role during brain development than previously anticipated.","output":"The GTPase Arl8B plays a principle role in the positioning of interstitial axon branches by spatially controlling autophagosome and lysosome location"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with diverse clinical manifestations, immune dysfunction, and gut microbiota alterations. The nutritional and biochemical quality of ones diet can influence the intestinal microbiota, which may play a role in the defense mechanisms against potential pathogens, by promoting a wide variety of immuneChost interactions. In the COVID-19 pandemic, besides the development of pharmacological therapies, a healthy balanced diet, rich with food-derived antioxidants, may be a useful strategy. Many studies demonstrated that vitamins and probiotic therapies have positive effects on the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation in COVID-19. The ecology of the gut microbiota in the digestive tract has been linked to the transport function of the host receptor known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that COVID-19 may be related to the gut microbiota. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and its receptor (ACE2), play central roles in modulating the reninCangiotensin system (RAS). In addition, ACE2 has functions that act independently of the RAS. ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS coronavirus, and ACE2 is essential for the expression of neutral amino acid transporters in the gut. In this context, ACE2 modulates innate immunity and influences the composition of the gut microbiota. Malnutrition is one of the leading underlying causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide and, including comorbidities, may be a major cause of worse outcomes and higher mortality among COVID-19 patients.

CONCLUSIONS In contrast to the expected timing of bleeding following intracranial tumour resection, all carmustine wafer patients who experienced haemorrhage presented in a delayed fashion on or after Day 2 post-operatively. The causative factors for universally delayed post-operative haematoma after carmustine wafer insertion are unclear and further studies are required to characterize this phenomenon.","output":"Delayed post-operative haemorrhage after carmustine wafer implantation: a case series from two UK centres."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An increased incidence of lung cancer is well-known among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It is unknown whether interstitial lung abnormalities, early fibrotic changes of the lung, are a risk factor for lung cancer in the general population.The study's objective was to assess whether interstitial lung abnormalities were associated with diagnoses of, and mortality from, lung cancer and other cancers. Data from the AGES-Reykjavik study, a cohort of 5764 elderly Icelanders, were used. Outcome data were ascertained from electronic medical records. Gray's tests, Cox proportional hazards models and proportional subdistribution hazards models were used to analyse associations of interstitial lung abnormalities with lung cancer diagnoses and lung cancer mortality as well as diagnoses and mortality from all cancers.Participants with interstitial lung abnormalities had greater cumulative incidence of lung cancer diagnoses (p<0.001) and lung cancer mortality (p<0.001) than others. Interstitial lung abnormalities were associated with an increased hazard of lung cancer diagnosis (HR=2.77) and lung cancer mortality (HR=2.89) in adjusted Cox models. Associations of interstitial lung abnormalities with all cancers were found in models including lung cancers but not in models excluding lung cancers.People with interstitial lung abnormalities are at increased risk of lung cancer and lung cancer mortality, but not of other cancers. This implies that an association between fibrotic and neoplastic lung diseases of the lung exists from the early stages of lung fibrosis and suggests interstitial lung abnormalities as a risk factor in lung cancer screening efforts.","output":"The Associations of Interstitial Lung Abnormalities with Cancer Diagnoses and Mortality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using a large sample of 1,120 twins, we estimated the heritability of trust using four distinct measures of trust C domain-specific political trust, general self-reported trust, and incentivized behavioral trust and trustworthiness.

Both clinical trials and animal models of type I and type II diabetes have shown that hyperactivity of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) signaling pathways contribute to the development of diabetes and diabetic complications. Of clinical relevance, blockade of the reninCangiotensin system prevents new-onset diabetes and reduces the risk of diabetic complications. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a recently discovered mono-carboxypeptidase and the first homolog of ACE. It is thought to inhibit Ang-II signaling cascades mostly by cleaving Ang-II to generate Ang-(1?7), which effects oppose Ang-II and are mediated by the Mas receptor. The enzyme is present in the kidney, liver, adipose tissue and pancreas. Its expression is elevated in the endocrine pancreas in diabetes and in the early phase during diabetic nephropathy. ACE2 is hypothesized to act in a compensatory manner in both diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Recently, we have shown the presence of the Mas receptor in the mouse pancreas and observed a reduction in Mas receptor immuno-reactivity as well as higher fasting blood glucose levels in ACE2 knockout mice, indicating that these mice may be a new model to study the role of ACE2 in diabetes.

The WRRF receives wastewater from its service area via three main interceptors: the Detroit River Interceptor (DRI), the North Interceptor-East Arm (NIEA), and the Oakwood-Northwest-Wayne County Interceptor (ONWI). A total of 144 untreated wastewater samples were collected (45, 48, and 51 for ONWI, NIEA, and DRI, respectively) at the point of intake into the WRRF. Virus-selective sampling was conducted, and viruses were isolated from wastewater using electropositive NanoCeram column filters. For each sample, an average of 33 L of wastewater was passed through NanoCeram electropositive cartridge filters at an average rate of 11 L/min. Viruses were eluted and concentrated, and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were quantified with RT-qPCR. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 98% of the samples, and measured concentrations were in the range of 4.45104 to 5.30106 genomic copies/L.

A significant aspect of this shift for disability activists and policy makers is ensuring participation in community life for individuals with disabilities living in residential homes. Despite a U.S. government ruling that encourages community participation and provides federal and state funding to realize it, little progress has been made. This study builds on and integrates the expanded model of value creation with relational coordination theory by investigating how the resources and relationships between care providers, adults with disabilities, family members, and community members can be leveraged to create value for residents through meaningful community participation. The purpose of our community case study was to assess and improve the quality of relationships between stakeholder groups, including direct care staff and managers, residents, family members, and the community through an action research intervention. This study took place in a residential group home in a Northeastern US community serving adults with disabilities from acquired brain injury. A pre-test post-test design was used and quantitative assessments of relational coordination were collected through electronic surveys, administered at baseline, and post-intervention. Direct care staff, supervisors, the house manager, and nursing staff completed the survey. Qualitative data were collected through focus groups, change team meetings, and key informant interviews. Direct care staff formed a change team to reflect on their baseline relational coordination data and identified the weak ties between direct care staff, family members, and the community as an area of concern. Staff chose to hold a community-wide open house to provide an opportunity to foster greater understanding among staff, residents, family, and community members. The change team and other staff members coordinated with local schools, business owners, town officials, churches, and neighbors. The event was attended by 50 people, about two-thirds from the community. Following the intervention, there was an increase in staff relational coordination with the community. While statistical significance could not be assessed, the change in staff RC with the community was considered qualitatively significant in that real connections were made with members of the community both directly and afterwards. Despite a small sample size, a residential setting where management was favorable to initiating staff-led interventions, and no comparison or control group, our small pilot study provides tentative evidence that engaging direct care staff in efforts to improve relational coordination with community members may succeed in building relationships that are essential to realizing the goal of greater participation in community life.","output":"Strengthening Community Participation by People With Disabilities in Community-Based Group Homes Through Innovative Action Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adult spinal ependymoma presents a rare low-grade tumor entity.

The results of in vitro experiments confirmed that the antiviral component of H. perforatum was ethyl acetate extraction section (HPE), and results showed that treatment with HPE significantly reduced the relative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression and virus titer of IBV, and reduced positive green immunofluorescence signal of IBV in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells. HPE treatment at doses of 480C120 mg/kg for 5 days, reduced IBV induced injury in the trachea and kidney, moreover, reduced the mRNA expression level of IBV in the trachea and kidney in vivo. The mRNA expression levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-B) significantly decreased, but melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), mitochondrial antiviral signaling gene, interferon alpha (IFN-), and interferon beta (IFN-) mRNA levels significantly increased in vitro and in vivo.

Although significant progress has been made in identifying hate speech in its various forms, prevailing computational approaches have tended to consider it in isolation from the community-based contexts in which it spreads. In this paper, we propose a dynamic network framework to characterize hate communities, focusing on Twitter conversations related to COVID-19 in the United States and the Philippines. While average hate scores remain fairly consistent over time, hate communities grow increasingly organized in March, then slowly disperse in the succeeding months. This pattern is robust to fluctuations in the number of network clusters and average cluster size. Infodemiological analysis demonstrates that in both countries, the spread of hate speech around COVID-19 features similar reproduction rates as other COVID-19 information on Twitter, with spikes in hate speech generation at time points with highest community-level organization of hate speech. Identity analysis further reveals that hate in the US initially targets political figures, then grows predominantly racially charged; in the Philippines, targets of hate consistently remain political over time. Finally, we demonstrate that higher levels of community hate are consistently associated with smaller, more isolated, and highly hierarchical network clusters across both contexts. This suggests potentially shared structural conditions for the effective spread of hate speech in online communities even when functionally targeting distinct identity groups.

One such protein is ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) conserved among vertebrates. Similar to ubiquitin, ISG15 covalently conjugates to lysine residues in substrate proteins in a process called ISGylation. Mice deficient for ISGylation or lacking ISG15 are strongly susceptible to many viral pathogens and several intracellular bacterial pathogens. Although ISG15 was the first UBL discovered after ubiquitin, the mechanisms behind its protective activity are poorly understood. Largely, this stems from a lack of knowledge on the ISG15 substrate repertoire. To unravel the antiviral activity of ISG15, early studies used mass spectrometry-based proteomics in combination with ISG15 pulldown. Despite reporting hundreds of ISG15 substrates, these studies were unable to identify the exact sites of modification, impeding a clear understanding of the molecular consequences of protein ISGylation. More recently, a peptide-based enrichment approach revolutionized the study of ubiquitin allowing untargeted discovery of ubiquitin substrates, including knowledge of their exact modification sites. Shared molecular determinants between ISG15 and ubiquitin allowed to take advantage of this technology for proteome-wide mapping of ISG15 substrates and modification sites. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies on protein ISGylation.

Apart from barrier dysfunction, ARDS is characterized by hyper-inflammation and impaired alveolar fluid clearance (AFC), which foster the development of pulmonary permeability edema and hamper gas exchange. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is an evolutionarily conserved pleiotropic cytokine, involved in host immune defense against pathogens and cancer. TNF exists in both membrane-bound and soluble form and its mainly -but not exclusively- pro-inflammatory and cytolytic actions are mediated by partially overlapping TNFR1 and TNFR2 binding sites situated at the interface between neighboring subunits in the homo-trimer. Whereas TNFR1 signaling can mediate hyper-inflammation and impaired barrier function and AFC in the lungs, ligand stimulation of TNFR2 can protect from ventilation-induced lung injury. Spatially distinct from the TNFR binding sites, TNF harbors within its structure a lectin-like domain that rather protects lung function in ARDS. The lectin-like domain of TNF -mimicked by the 17 residue TIP peptide- represents a physiological mediator of alveolar-capillary barrier protection. and increases AFC in both hydrostatic and permeability pulmonary edema animal models. The TIP peptide directly activates the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) -a key mediator of fluid and blood pressure control- upon binding to its  subunit, which is also a part of the non-selective cation channel (NSC). Activity of the lectin-like domain of TNF is preserved in complexes between TNF and its soluble TNFRs and can be physiologically relevant in pneumonia. Antibody- and soluble TNFR-based therapeutic strategies show considerable success in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, but their chronic use can increase susceptibility to infection. Since the lectin-like domain of TNF does not interfere with TNFs anti-bacterial actions, while exerting protective actions in the alveolar-capillary compartments, it is currently evaluated in clinical trials in ARDS and COVID-19. A more comprehensive knowledge of the precise role of the TNFR binding sites versus the lectin-like domain of TNF in lung injury, tissue hypoxia, repair and remodeling may foster the development of novel therapeutics for ARDS.","output":"Dichotomous Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor in Pulmonary Barrier Function and Alveolar Fluid Clearance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first clinical symptoms focused on the presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been respiratory failure, however accumulating evidence also points to its presentation with neuropsychiatric symptoms, the exact mechanisms of which are not well known By using a computational methodology, we aimed to explain the molecular paths of COVID-19 associated neuropsychiatric symptoms, based on the mimicry of the human protein interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins Methods: Available 11 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins structures have been extracted from Protein DataBank HMI-PRED (Host-Microbe Interaction PREDiction), a recently developed web server for structural PREDiction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between host and any microbial species, was used to find the interface mimicry through which the microbial proteins hijack host binding surfaces Classification of the found interactions was conducted using the PANTHER Classification System Results: Predicted Human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions have been extensively compared with the literature Based on the analysis of the molecular functions, cellular localizations and pathways related to human proteins, SARS-CoV-2 proteins are found to possibly interact with human proteins linked to synaptic vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, axonal transport, neurotransmission, growth factors, mitochondrial and blood-brain barrier elements, in addition to its peripheral interactions with proteins linked to thrombosis, inflammation and metabolic control Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions may lead to the development of delirium, psychosis, seizures, encephalitis, stroke, sensory impairments, peripheral nerve diseases, and autoimmune disorders Our findings are also supported by the previous in vivo and in vitro studies from other viruses Further in vivo and in vitro studies using the proteins that are pointed here, could pave new targets both for avoiding and reversing neuropsychiatric presentations","output":"Neuropsychiatric Symptoms of COVID-19 Explained by SARS-CoV-2 Proteins Mimicry of Human Protein Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 became a serious threat to humankind for the past couple of years.

This review explores the progress in the development of the vaccines, their current status of ongoing clinical research, mechanisms, and regulatory approvals. Many pharmaceutical companies are already in the endgame for manufacturing various vaccines of which some are already being marketed across the globe, while others are yet to get approval for marketing. The primary aim of this review is to compare regulatory accepted vaccines in terms of their composition, doses, regulatory status, and efficacy. The study is conducted by grouping into approved and unapproved vaccines for marketing. Different routes of administration of vaccines along with the efficacy of the routes are also presented in the review. A wide range of database and clinical trial data is reviewed for sorting out the information on different vaccines. Unfortunately, many mutations (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, kappa, omicron etc.) of SARS-CoV-2 have attacked people in very short time, which is the great challenge for investigational vaccines.

The unprecedented plights that have arisen have led nations to devise ethical roadmaps for handling their finite resources. Muslim countries are no exception and must continue to endure the effects of the pandemic, as more waves of infections from new strains are being reported. Given the scarcity of resources available to some countries, it is critical to adopt a roadmap to prioritize these limited resources based on ethical guidelines that are acceptable to Muslim communities. This work describes the concept of ijtihad, a process frequently used by Muslim scholars to develop novel solutions to deal with unprecedented events, such as the recent pandemic. In this manuscript, Islamic perspectives were discussed on social justice and equality and how limited resources can be used in a way consistent with such perspectives. Relying on previous experiences of the Muslim community, such as the plague of Amwas, in which social distancing and quarantine strategies were used effectively to control the disease, and utilizing available guidelines such as Al-Qawaid Al-Fiqhiyyah and Fiqh Al-Nawazel, we propose a practical protocol and roadmap that can be applied in the current crisis.

Digital interventions may modify this influence, although conceptualisation and evidence on psychiatric outcomes is limited. We aimed to conceptualise and appraise evidence on digital QSC (D-QSC) for young people. Methods: Systematic scoping review and meta-analysis, with embedded stakeholder involvement, searching healthcare databases, websites and the grey literature. We included studies that explored QSC within a digital intervention as part of the prevention or treatment of depression and/or anxiety in 14-24-year olds. Findings: 5714 publications were identified and 42 were included. Of these, there were 23,319 participants. D-QSC translated into a five-component conceptual framework: Rapport, Identity and commonality, Valued interpersonal dynamic, Engagement and Responded to and accepted (RIVER). There was a significant decrease in depression (-25.6%, 95% CI [-0.352, -0.160], p<0.0005) and anxiety (-15.1%, 95% CI [-0.251, -0.051], p<0.0005). Heterogeneity was high. Literature and stakeholder evidence showcased D-QSCs importance in the prevention and treatment of depression, though evidence was weaker for anxiety. Stakeholder insights highlighted that demographic, dynamic and environmental factors, including blended care, may influence D-QSC experiences and outcomes. Interpretation: D-QSC is an important and under-considered component for depression and anxiety outcomes. Whilst more research is required, the RIVER conceptual framework can inform standardised measures for D-QSC. These measures can be used in the development and evaluation of digital interventions for mental health, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, where necessary support will be increasingly provided in online spaces.

In order to prevent severe infection, these patients are vaccinated after their stem cell transplantation with childhood immunization vaccines. Timing of this vaccination is important in order to be effective and obtain proper immune response. Postponement of vaccination would lead to better immune response but would also cause longer-lasting risk of infection. This review describes available data on the timing of vaccination and its vaccine responses. Optimal timing of vaccination might require an individualized approach per patient. ABSTRACT: Consensus on timing of post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) vaccination is currently lacking and is therefore assessed in this review. PubMed was searched systematically for articles concerning vaccination post-HSCT and included a basis in predefined criteria. To enable comparison, data were extracted and tables were constructed per vaccine, displaying vaccine response as either seroprotection or seroconversion for allogeneic HSCT (alloHSCT) and autologous HSCT (autoHSCT) separately. A total of 33 studies were included with 1914 patients in total: 1654 alloHSCT recipients and 260 autoHSCT recipients. In alloHSCT recipients, influenza vaccine at 7C48 months post-transplant resulted in responses of 10C97%. After 12 months post-transplant, responses were >45%. Pneumococcal vaccination 3C25 months post-transplant resulted in responses of 43C99%, with the response increasing with time. Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b at 6C17 months post-transplant: 26C100%. Meningococcal vaccination at 12 months post-transplant: 65%.

Often regarded as a rite of passage to desensitize and toughen up new employees and students, psychological harm during medical preparation creates an unsafe working environment resulting in health complications, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, and self-harm. Decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, high turnover rates, and inappropriate patient care are linked to bullying, perpetrating organizational dysfunction. This research study evaluated workplace bullying (prevalence, frequency, and behaviors; associated characteristics; effects on patient care; and awareness and enforcement of antibullying protocols) in nuclear medicine departments and clinical education. Methods: A quantitative single-group correlational analysis was used to survey certified nuclear medicine technologists and students in the Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board email database (n = 20,389). The highest response rate for any individual question was n = 836. Data were collected using the Short Negative Acts Questionnaire along with a researcher-created survey and analyzed using chi-square and central tendencies. Results: Bullying existed in varying degrees (46.8%) within the previous 6 months; predominantly by being ignored, excluded, subjected to repeated reminders of errors, and withholding information affecting their performance. Nuclear medicine professionals are more likely to witness and experience workplace bullying than students and are more likely to be bullied by a fellow technologist. Characteristics, such as gender, age, and occupation, were statistically significant while others, such as race, height, body type, experience, and education showed no significant correlation. Attention to patient care decreased (39.6%) when bullying was present. An 8% variation exists between antibullying policies being enforced/not enforced, with 26% of professionals unaware of antibullying policies at their place of work. Conclusion: Explanations for underreported workplace bullying include fear of retaliation; nonenforcement and lack of awareness of antibullying policies; organizational complacency; and perceived hierarchical power. Recommendations to minimize workplace bullying include adopting and publicizing a descriptive definition, implementing antibullying policies, mediation procedures, and noncompliance penalties. Decreasing incidences of workplace bullying increase employee satisfaction and retention, patient safety, and enhances student success.","output":"Bullying in the Nuclear Medicine Department and Clinical Education."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 has been causing severe loss to the human race. Considering the mode of spread and severity, it is essential to make it a habit to follow various safety precautions such as using sanitizers and masks and maintaining social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Individuals are widely educated about the safety measures against the disease through various modes such as announcements through online or physical awareness campaigns, advertisements in the media and so on. The younger generations today spend considerably more time on mobile phones and games. However, there are very few applications or games aimed to help in practicing safety measures against a pandemic, which is much lesser in the case of Covid-19. Hence, we propose a 2D survival-based game, SurviveCovid-19, aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken for Covid-19 outside their homes by incorporating social distancing and usage of masks and sanitizers in the game. SurviveCovid-19 has been designed as an Android-based mobile game, along with a desktop (browser) version, and has been evaluated through a remote quantitative user survey, with 30 volunteers using the questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model.

An increasing number of clinical trials has been registered to evaluate the effects of TCM in the prevention and therapeutic management of COVID-19. Objective: This study aims to review the existing TCM registered trials, identify promising and available TCM therapies, in order to provide reference for the global management of COVID-19. Methods: : All clinical trials on TCM for COVID-19 registered in eight registry platforms worldwide were searched up to May 14, 2020. The data of registration trend, design, objective, interventions, current status, and relevant information were reviewed and summarized. Supportive information on the progress, results and potential value of the included registered trials were searched and reviewed from databases and official websites. Results: : 161 TCM trials registered in three registries from January 26 to May 14 were included. 94 (58.4%) were randomized controlled trials, followed by controlled clinical trials (25, 15.5%), single-arm clinical studies (18, 11.2%) and others (24, 14.9%). 114 trials (70.8%) assessed therapeutic effects;while the remaining were for prevention, rehabilitation, and TCM syndrome epidemiology. The three most evaluated TCM interventions were Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in the preparation forms of formulae decoction/granule (41.7%), Chinese patent medicine (24.8%) and Chinese herbal-derived injections (8.1%). The common outcomes in therapeutic trials were symptoms and signs (65.8%), time to viral clearance on PCR (50.9%), and improvement in CT images (43.9%). 78 trials (48.4%) had started recruiting and six trials (3.7%) had completed recruiting. Among the TCM interventions identified from the registered trials, the following are worthy of attention and may have the potential feasibility of being evaluated and then used worldwide due to their rigorous design, previous evidence and availability: for prevention in high-risk populations or suspected cases, moxibustion, Huoxiang Zhengqi pill and Jinye Baidu granule could be considered;for treatment, Qingfei Paidu decoction or granules in mild, moderate and severe cases, Huashi Baidu decoction, Lianhua Qingwen caplsule, Toujie Quwen granule and Xiyanping injection in mild and moderate cases, and Xuebijing injection in severe cases could be considered. For rehabilitation of cured patients, the effect of Tai Chi and Liuzijue on the patients lung function and quality of life deserves attention. Conclusion: A series of promising potentially effective TCM interventions including CHM formulae, Chinese patent medicines, herbal-derived injections and non-drug therapies have been identified in clinical practice and are being evaluated by registered clinical trials. Available and applicable interventions within relevant trials are worthy of worldwide attention and application, in order to contribute to the global management of COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"How can traditional Chinese medicine contribute to the therapeutic approach in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

The objective of this overview of systematic reviews is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current evidence on prognosis of COVID\\\\19 in pregnant women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used Living OVerview of Evidence (LOVE) platform for COVID\\\\19, which continually retrieves studies from 46 data sources (including Pubmed/MEDLINE, Embase, other electronic databases, clinical trials registries, preprint repositories, among other sources relevant to COVID\\\\19), mapping them into PICO questions. The search covered the period from the inception date of each database to September 13, 2020. We included systematic reviews assessing outcomes of pregnant women with COVID\\\\19 and/or their newborns. Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts, assessed full\\\\texts to select the studies that met the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and appraised the risk of bias of each included systematic review. We measured the overlap of primary studies included among the selected systematic reviews by building a matrix of evidence, calculating the corrected covered area, and assessing the level of overlapping for every pair of systematic reviews. RESULTS: Our search yielded 1132 references. 52 systematic reviews met inclusion criteria and were included in this overview. Only one review had a low risk of bias, three had an unclear risk of bias, and 48 had a high risk of bias. Most of the included reviews were highly overlapped among each other. In the included reviews, rates of maternal death varied from 0% to 11.1%, admission to intensive care from 2.1% to 28.5%, preterm deliveries before 37 weeks from 14.3% to 61.2%, and cesarean delivery from 48.3% to 100%. Regarding neonatal outcomes, neonatal death varied from 0% to 11.7% while the estimated infection status of the newborn varied between 0% and 11.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Only one of 52 systematic reviews had a low risk of bias. Results were heterogenous and the overlap of primary studies was frequently very high between pairs of systematic reviews.

Increased levels of M2 alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cells, as well as induction in metalloproteases expression and collagen and laminin degradation, suggested that the previous viral infection was under resolution, correlating with enhanced susceptibility to plague. Surprisingly, postexposure prophylaxis treatment with the recommended drugs revealed that ciprofloxacin was superior to doxycycline in mice recovering from influenza infection.

Methods: We performed a retrospective study in Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 14, 2020, to Mar 15, 2020, China. Data were retrieved including demographic and clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcome data. Patients were classified into the discharged group and undischarged group by the 4-week outcomes from admission. Difference analysis and correlation analysis were performed between the two groups. Results: A total of 37 patients were enrolled in the study, including 27 cancer survivors in routine follow-up. Breast cancer (18.9%) was the most frequent cancer type, and common symptoms included cough (54.1%), fever (48.6%), and fatigue (27%). Lymphocytopenia and hypoproteinemia were much frequent in patients who had received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery within the past month. However, the concentration of D-dimer (median: 3.75 vs 0.43, P =0.010) and fibrin degradation products (median: 23.60 vs 1.80, P =0.002) were evidently increased in this population compared with cancer survivors.

However, the use of REEs in wastewater treatment could mean increased human exposure to lanthanides (Ln) through wastewater effluent discharge to the environment or through water reuse. Information on the toxicity of lanthanides is scarce and, where available, there are conflicting views. Using in vitro bioassays, we assessed lanthanide toxicity by evaluating four relevant endpoints: the change in mitochondrial membrane potential (m), intracellular adenosine triphosphate (I-ATP), genotoxicity, and cell viability. At less than 5000 mol-Ln3+/L, lanthanides increased the m, while above 5000 mol-Ln3+/L, the m level plummeted. The measure of I-ATP indicated constant levels of ATP up to 250 mol-Ln3+/L, above which the I-ATP decreased steadily; the concentration of La, Ce, Gd, and Lu that triggered half of the cells to become ATP-inactive is 794, 1505, 1488, 1115 mol-Ln3+/L, respectively. Although La and Lu accelerated cell death in shorter studies (24 h), chronic studies using three cell growth cycles showed cell recovery. Lanthanides exhibited antagonistic toxicity at less than 1000 mol-Ln3+/L. However, the introduction of heavy REEs in a solution amplified lanthanide toxicity.

We show that, while the efficacy of any individual control was highly variable among scenarios, the combination of universal mask-wearing and distancing of at least 1~m reduced the median risk of initial infection in the susceptible person by 99\\\\% relative to a close (0.5~m), unmasked conversation. Increasing ventilation rates by 4~air changes per hour led to further reductions in the median risk of infection by more than 70\\\\% if the two people were distanced by 2~m or more. The combination of face masks, distancing, and increased ventilation reduced the risk of infection by more than 98\\\\% in more than 95\\\\% of scenarios. These findings suggest that layering controls is highly effective for reducing transmission of airborne pathogens and will be critical for curbing outbreaks of novel viruses in the future.","output":"High efficacy of layered controls for reducing transmission of airborne pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The quantitative analysis of andrographolides in Andrographis paniculata plant materials is essential for pharmaceutical factories. This analysis cannot be done for all samples due to the conventional process using the extraction and HPLC methods requires a long analysis time and sample destruction. Therefore, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was employed to classify the class of A. paniculata and to determine the content of two active ingredients, andrographolide (AP1) and dehydroandrographolide (AP3) in A. paniculata, rapidly and non-destructively. One hundred twenty dried powder samples were obtained from aerial parts, branches, leaves, and branches mixed with leaves. The NIR absorption scans were collected from a broad spectral region (1000C2500 nm). Then, the scanned samples were extracted and analyzed for their AP1 and AP3 contents using an HPLC reference method. The success classification model based on AP1 level was developed using the second derivative pretreated NIR spectra of the entire wavelength region using the Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) method. The NIR calibration models were developed and tested for quantitative analysis with 50 independent samples. The models were identified for the analysis of the AP1 content with excellent performance (correlation coefficient (R) = 0.98; standard error of validation (SEV) = 0.24%) and for the analysis of the AP3 content at a good level of efficiency (R = 0.93; SEV = 0.15%). This study showed that NIR spectroscopic method offers rapid analysis for the selection of A. paniculata that meets the requirement in bioactive amount.

We estimate that 256 million individuals-77% of the population-live in households that have lost income during the pandemic. Attempts to cope with this loss are exacerbated by food insecurity and an inability to access medicine and staple foods. Finally, we find that student-teacher contact has dropped from a pre-COVID-19 rate of 96% to just 17% among households with school-aged children.

Emergency departments (ED) represent an important site of eye care. We analyzed patterns of ED visits at an eye-specific ED since the declaration of the public health crisis. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective, cross-sectional single center study, medical records of 6744 patients who presented to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear ED between March 1st and April 30th in 2018, 2019, and 2020 were studied. The primary outcome measures were total volume of ED visits, proportion of urgent ED visits, and proportion of surgical visits. Results: Overall, the median number of daily visits to the ED decreased by 18 visits per day since the declaration of public health guidelines (interquartile range, 9-24, p < 0.001). This accounted for a 32% decrease in the total volume of ED visits in 2020 compared to prior years during the study period (p < 0.001). There was a 9% increase in the proportion of primary diagnoses considered urgent (p = 0.002). The proportion of visits requiring urgent surgery increased by 39% (p = 0.004). Conclusion: The total number of eye-specific ED visits dropped compared to prior years while the proportion of urgent visits increased.

This study aimed to predict language outcomes at 2 years corrected gestational age (CGA) for children born preterm. METHODS: We analysed data from 89 preterm neonates (median GA 29 weeks) who underwent diffusion MRI (dMRI) at term-equivalent age and language assessment at 2 years CGA using the Bayley-III. Feature selection and a random forests classifier were used to differentiate typical versus delayed (Bayley-III language composite score <85) language development. RESULTS: The model achieved balanced accuracy: 91%, sensitivity: 86%, and specificity: 96%. The probability of language delay at 2 years CGA is increased with: increasing values of peak width of skeletonized fractional anisotropy (PSFA), radial diffusivity (PSRD), and axial diffusivity (PSAD) derived from dMRI; among twins; and after an incomplete course of, or no exposure to, antenatal corticosteroids. Female sex and breastfeeding during the neonatal period reduced the risk of language delay. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of perinatal clinical information and MRI features leads to accurate prediction of preterm infants who are likely to develop language deficits in early childhood. This model could potentially enable stratification of preterm children at risk of language dysfunction who may benefit from targeted early interventions. IMPACT: A combination of clinical perinatal factors and neonatal DTI measures of white matter microstructure leads to accurate prediction of language outcome at 2 years corrected gestational age following preterm birth.

For JanuaryCApril 2020 period, time series of daily average inhalable gaseous pollutants ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), together climate variables (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation rate, atmospheric pressure field and Planetary Boundary Layer) were analyzed. In spite of being considered primarily transmitted by indoor bioaerosols droplets and infected surfaces or direct human-to-human personal contacts, it seems that high levels of urban air pollution, and climate conditions have a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 diffusion. Exhibited positive correlations of ambient ozone levels and negative correlations of NO2 with the increased rates of COVID-19 infections (Total number, Daily New positive and Total Deaths cases), can be attributed to airborne bioaerosols distribution. The results show positive correlation of daily averaged O3 with air temperature and inversely correlations with relative humidity and precipitation rates. Viral genome contains distinctive features, including a unique N-terminal fragment within the spike protein, which allows coronavirus attachment on ambient air pollutants. At this moment it is not clear if through airborne diffusion, in the presence of outdoor and indoor aerosols, this protein spike of the new COVID-19 is involved in the infectious agent transmission from a reservoir to a susceptible host during the highest nosocomial outbreak in some agglomerated industrialized urban areas like Milan is. Also, in spite of collected data for cold season (winter-early spring) period, when usually ozone levels have lower values than in summer, the findings of this study support possibility as O3 can acts as a COVID-19 virus incubator.

METHODS 246 patients were enrolled into COVID-19 cohort and 120 patients into influenza cohort. All data were collected and analysed retrospectively. The variables under focus included demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia and comparison were made with influenza pneumonia. RESULTS The COVID-19 cohort included 53.25% female and 46.75% male. Their main symptom was fever; while 28.05% of patients had only initially fever; 21.54% of them remained feverless. After excluding prior kidney diseases, some patients showed abnormal urinalysis (32.11%), elevated blood creatinine (15.04%) and blood urea nitrogen (19.11%). Typical CT features included ground glass opacity, consolidation and band opacity, which could present as characteristic 'bat wing sign'. Our data showed that male, aged 65 or above, smoking, with comorbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, would experience more severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In comparison, COVID-19 cohort showed significantly higher incidence of clustering; the influenza cohort showed higher rate of fever. Both cohorts showed reduced lymphocyte numbers; however, 6 influenza patients showed lymphocytes increased, which was statistical significant compared with COVID-19 cohort. Also, influenza cohort displayed higher white blood cell counts and PCT values. CONCLUSION There is no significant gender difference in the incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia.

BACKGROUND Survivorship of critical illness has been identified as a challenge for the 21st Century. Whilst the use of the term 'survivorship' is now common in critical care, it has been borrowed from the cancer literature where the discourse on what survivorship means in a cancer context is ongoing and remains largely descriptive. In the absence of a theoretical understanding, the term 'survivorship' is often used in critical illness in a generic way, limiting our understanding of what survivorship is. The current COVID-19 pandemic adds to an urgency of understanding what intensive care unit (ICU) survivorship might mean, given the emerging long-term consequences of this patient cohort. We set out to explore how survivorship after critical illness is being conceptualised and what the implications might be for clinical practice and research. DESIGN Integrated systematic literature review. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. PRISMA guidelines were followed and a PRISMA checklist for reporting systematic reviews completed. RESULTS The three main themes around which the reviewed studies were organised are: (a) healthcare system; (b) ICU survivors' families; and (c) ICU survivor's identity. These three themes feed into an overarching core theme of 'ICU Survivorship Experiences'. These themes map our current knowledge of what happens when a patient survives a critical illness and where we are in understanding ICU survivorship. CONCLUSION We mapped in this systematic review the different pieces of the jigsaw that emerge following critical illness to understand and see the bigger picture of what happens after patients survive critical illness. It is evident that existing research has mapped these connections, but what we have not managed to do yet is defining what survivorship is theoretically. We offer a preliminary definition of survivorship as a process but are aware that this definition needs to be developed further with patients and families.","output":"Theorising survivorship after intensive care: A systematic review of patient and family experiences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) mimetic peptides 4F and 6F can be a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce blood and gut bioactive lipids, proinflammatory effects of endotoxin (LPS) and aberrant activation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) as instigators of increased risk for cardiometabolic disease in chronic treated HIV. METHODS: We used two humanized murine models of chronic treated HIV infection (n = 109 mice) and gut explants from HIV infected (n = 10) persons to determine whether Tg6F and 4F attenuate in vivo and ex vivo increased blood and gut bioactive lipids (measured by mass spectrometry) and intestinal protein levels of COX-2 (measured by immunoassays) in chronic treated HIV. RESULTS: In these models of HIV, when compared to HIV-1 infected mice on antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone, oral Tg6F in combination with ART attenuated increases in plasma and gut bioactive lipids (and particularly COX lipids) and intestinal COX-2. 4F and Tg6F also reduced ex vivo production of COX-2 protein and associated secretion of bioactive lipids in gut explants from HIV-1 infected persons treated with LPS. CONCLUSION: ApoA-I mimetics favorably impact the proinflammatory effects of LPS, COX-2 and production of bioactive lipids that collectively drive gut and systemic inflammation in chronic treated HIV. Given prior experimental evidence that the proinflammatory effects of LPS, COX-2 and gut dysfunction contribute to cardiometabolic syndrome in chronic HIV, apoA-I mimetic peptides may be a novel therapy to treat cardiometabolic syndrome in chronic HIV.","output":"ApoA-I mimetics favorably impact cyclooxygenase 2 and bioactive lipids that may contribute to cardiometabolic syndrome in chronic treated HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has profound negative impacts on people's lives, but little is known on its effect on household food insecurity (HFI) in poor setting resources. This study assessed changes in HFI during the pandemic and examined the interlinkages between HFI with child feeding practices and coping strategies. DESIGN: A longitudinal survey in December 2019 (in-person) and August 2020 (by phone). SETTING: Community-based individuals from 26 blocks in 2 districts in Uttar Pradesh, India. PARTICIPANTS: Mothers with children <2 years (n=569). MAIN OUTCOMES AND ANALYSES: We measured HFI by using the HFI Access Scale and examined the changes in HFI during the pandemic using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. We then assessed child feeding practices and coping strategies by HFI status using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: HFI increased sharply from 21% in December 2019 to 80% in August 2020, with 62% households changing the status from food secure to insecure over this period. Children in newly or consistently food-insecure households were less likely to consume a diverse diet (adjusted OR, AOR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95 and AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.12, respectively) compared with those in food-secure households. Households with consistent food insecurity were more likely to engage in coping strategies such as reducing other essential non-food expenditures (AOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.24), borrowing money to buy food (AOR 4.3, 95% CI 2.31 to 7.95) or selling jewellery (AOR 5.0, 95% CI 1.74 to 14.27) to obtain foods. Similar findings were observed for newly food-insecure households. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown measures posed a significant risk to HFI which in turn had implications for child feeding practices and coping strategies.

Despite available prevention methods through the HPV vaccine and two screening modalities, women continue to die from cervical cancer worldwide.

Low screening rates among WLH further exacerbate their already high risk of developing cervical cancer due to immunosuppression. This study explores WLHs current cervical cancer knowledge, screening barriers and facilitators, and sources of health information. METHODS: Focus group discussions were conducted with 39 WLH aged 21 years old or older, who resided in the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Emergent themes were classified and organized into overarching domains and assembled with representative quotations. RESULTS: The women had limited knowledge of HPV and the cervical cancer screening guidelines for WLH. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has amplified screening barriers due to decreased accessibility to usual medical appointment and cervical cancer screenings. Screening facilitators included knowing someone diagnosed with cervical cancer and provider recommendations. WLH indicated that they obtained health information through in-person education (providers, peer groups) and written literature. Due to the pandemic, they also had to increasingly rely on remote and technology-based communication channels such as the internet, social media, television, radio, email, and short message service (SMS) text messaging.

The closure of one or more toll stations of the network often causes a sharp decrease in freeway performance. Therefore, measuring the probability and consequences of vulnerability to identify critical parts in the network is crucial for road emergency management. Most existing techniques only measure the consequences of node closure and rarely consider the probability of node closure owing to the lack of an extensive historical database; moreover, they ignore highways outside the study area, which can lead to errors in topological analysis and traffic distribution. Furthermore, the negative effects produced by the operation of freeway tunnels in vulnerability assessment have been neglected. In this study, a framework for freeway vulnerability assessment that considers both the probability and consequences of vulnerability is proposed, based on the perspective of network cascade failure analysis. The cascade failure analysis is conducted using an improved coupled map lattice model, developed by considering the negative effects of tunnels and optimizing the rules of local traffic redistribution. The perturbation threshold and propagation time step of network cascade failure are captured to reflect the probabilities and consequences of vulnerability. A nodal vulnerability index is established based on risk assessment, and a hierarchical clustering method is used to identify the vulnerability classification of critical nodes. The freeway network of Fuzhou in China is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Specifically, the toll stations in the study area are classified into five clusters of vulnerability: extremely high, high, medium, low, and extremely low. Approximately 31% of the toll stations were classified as the high or extremely high cluster, and three extremely vulnerable freeway sections requiring different precautions were identified. The proposed network vulnerability analysis method provides a new perspective to examine the vulnerability of freeway networks.","output":"Vulnerability assessment of freeway network considering the probabilities and consequences from a perspective based on network cascade failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision of palliative care for patients with palliative care needs emerges as a necessity more than ever. Most are managed in primary care by their family physicians (FP). This study aimed to understand the perspectives of specialist and trainee FPs about their role in palliative care. Methods: we conducted a double focus-group study consisting of two separate online focus-groups, one with FP specialists (n = 9) and one with FP trainees (n = 10). Results: FPs already gather two fundamental skills for the provision of palliative care: the capacity to identify patients needs beyond physical symptoms and the recognition that the patient belongs to a familiar, psychosocial, and even spiritual environment. They perceive their role in palliative care to be four-fold: early identification of patients with palliative care needs, initial treatment, symptom management, and patient advocacy. Participants recognized the need for palliative care training and provided suggestions for training programs. Conclusion: FPs share a holistic approach and identify multiple roles they can play in palliative care, from screening to care and advocacy. Organizational barriers must be addressed. Short training programs that combine theory, practice, and experiential learning may further the potential for FPs to contribute to palliative care.","output":"Family Physicians Perspectives on Their Role in Palliative Care: A Double Focus Group in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We implemented preprocedure severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing for cancer patients.

Data were collected from 145 students and 31 teachers in two Hong Kong higher education institutions. The findings show that teachers were generally more negative about online teaching and learning than students, but such negative views should be reconsidered as students positively evaluated teachers efforts to various degrees. It is suggested that during future online learning experiences (1) teachers and students set up expectations together to evaluate online interactions, (2) teachers should not be overly concerned about the potential embarrassment of using camera for class activities, and (3) teachers pay more attention to feedback delivery. Understanding these gaps will provide teachers with insights into more strategic communication and planning to manage the expectations and optimise the online experience for both parties. ? 2022 Elsevier Ltd","output":"A co-orientation analysis of teachers and students perceptions of online teaching and learning in Hong Kong higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the characteristics of 30-day readmission after hospitalization with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVES: To examine the rate, timing, causes, predictors and outcomes of 30-day readmission after COVID-19 hospitalization. METHODS: From 13 March to 9 April 2020, all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and discharged alive were included in this retrospective observational study. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of 30-day readmission, and a restricted cubic spline function was utilized to assess the linearity of the association between continuous predictors and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: A total of 1062 patients were included in the analysis, with a median follow-up time of 62 days. The mean age of patients was 56.5 years, and 40.5% were women. At the end of the study, a total of 48 (4.5%) patients were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, and a median time to readmission was 5 days. The most common primary diagnosis of 30-day readmission was a hypoxic respiratory failure (68.8%) followed by thromboembolism (12.5%) and sepsis (6.3%). The patients with a peak serum creatinine level of &#8805;1.29 mg/dL during the index hospitalization, compared to those with a creatinine of <1.29 mg/dL, had 2.4 times increased risk of 30-day readmission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.23-4.74). The mortality rate during the readmission was 22.9%. CONCLUSION: With 4.5% of the thirty-day readmission rate, COVID-19 survivors were readmitted early after hospital discharge, mainly due to morbidities of COVID-19. One in five readmitted COVID-19 survivors died during their readmission.","output":"Assessment of thirty-day readmission rate, timing, causes and predictors after hospitalization with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship has caused over 634 cases as of February 20, 2020.

The current case illustrates that the cost of inaction can be higher in the future. The perspective article proposes a dedicated, government-sponsored agency developing anti-viral leads against all potentially dangerous pathogen species. AREAS COVERED The author explores the methods of computational drug screening and in-silico synthesis and proposes a specialized government-sponsored agency focusing on leads and functioning in collaboration with a network of labs, pharma, biotech firms, and academia, in order to test each lead against multiple viral species. The agency will employ artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to cut the costs further. The algorithms are expected to receive continuous feedback from the network of partners conducting the tests. EXPERT OPINION The author proposes a bionic principle, emulating antibody response by producing a combinatorial diversity of high q uality generic antiviral leads, suitable for multiple potentially emerging species. The availability of multiple pre-tested agents and an even greater number of combinations would reduce the impact of the next outbreak. The methodologies developed in this effort are likely to find utility in the design of chronic disease therapeutics.","output":"A public-private partnership for the express development of antiviral leads: a perspective view."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disruption of antioxidant defense has been demonstrated in severe acute respiratory syndrome due to SARS-CoV infection. Selenium plays a major role in decreasing the ROS produced in response to various viral infections. Selenoprotein enzymes are essential in combating oxidative stress caused due to excessive generation of ROS. Selenium also has a role in inhibiting the activation of NF-B, thus alleviating inflammation. In viral infections, selenoproteins have also been found to inhibit type I interferon responses, modulate T cell proliferation and oxidative burst in macrophages, and inhibit viral transcriptional activators. Potential virally encoded selenoproteins have been identified by computational analysis in different viral genomes like HIV-1, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and hepatitis C virus. This review discusses the role and the possible mechanisms of selenium, selenoproteins, and virally encoded selenoproteins in the pathogenicity of viral infections. Identification of potential selenoproteins in the COVID 19 genome by computational tools will give insights further into their role in the pathogenesis of viral infections.","output":"Selenium to selenoproteins C role in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetic mapping sprung in the last decade of the 20th century with the development of statistical procedures putting classical models of genetic effects together with molecular biology techniques. It eventually became clear that those models, originally developed to serve other purposes, implied limitations at different stages of the analyses-disclosing loci, measuring their effects and providing additional parameters for adequate biological/medical interpretations. The present paper is aimed to ponder whether it is realistic and worth to try and further amend classical models of genetic effects or it proves more sensible to undertake alternative theoretical strategies instead. In order to further feed into that debate, mathematical developments for gene-environment interaction stemming from the classical models of genetic effects are here revised and brought up-to-date with the prospects present-day available data bestow, particularly in the context of precision medicine. Those developments strengthen the methodology required to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Gene-Environment Interaction in the Era of Precision Medicine -- Fix the Potholes or Start Building a New Road?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiomyocytes are the chief cell type in the heart, and are central to the pathogenesis of many cardiac diseases. Increasing recognition of its cellular, molecular, and functional heterogeneity prompted us to review the latest advancements in cardiac health and disease at single-cell resolution. RECENT FINDINGS: Single-cell RNA profiling of cardiac lineage commitment events uncovered immense heterogeneity amongst ostensibly homogeneous cell populations. Classic cardiac transcription factors and new regulatory genes exhibit cell subtype-specific and temporally controlled expression patterns that serve the phenotypic changes in development, disease progression, and regeneration. Dissection of dynamically changing cell-cell communications and cardiac cell plasticity offers new opportunities in disease intervention and cardiac repair. Finally, updates in research models, platforms, and pipelines are continuously increasing the efficiency and reliability in data generation and interpretation. Transcriptional profiling of cardiac lineage cells, especially cardiomyocytes, has tremendously enriched our knowledge of the cellular milieu and the transcriptional network in the heart. Implementing technical standards and interrogating underexplored research areas will further our understanding of this organ and increase the likelihood of finding tractable therapeutic targets.","output":"Transcriptional Profiling of Single Cardiomyocytes in Health and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSince the emergence of the SARS COV-19 pandemic, multiple extrapulmonary manifestations of the virus have been reported from around the world. Cardiovascular complications including arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 have been described in multiple studies. Our aim was to review various case reports detailing the new onset of heart block in COVID-19 patients and to summarise the clinical course of these patients. MethodsWe systematically reviewed all reports published and indexed in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase between March 2020 to May 2021, analyzing the relation between the demographics of the patients, pre-existing comorbidities, and the progression of heart block in patients infected with COVID-19. ResultsWe identified and included in this study 30 relevant articles describing 49 COVID-19 patients with heart block. Among them, 69.3% (n=34) of patients suffered from at least one comorbidity. 36.73% (n=18) of the patients showed spontaneous resolution of the heart block. Conversely, 63.26% (n=31) of the patients had persistent heart block, out of which 16.33% (n=8) and 42.86% (n=21) were implanted with a temporary and permanent pacemaker respectively. The reported mortality rate was 22.45% (n=11) during hospitalization. We noted that 45.45% (n=5) of the patients who died had complete heart block. 24.49% (n=12) of the patients in the studies we reviewed were suspected of having myocarditis. However, none were confirmed with MRI or cardiac biopsy. ConclusionsAdditional research is necessary to unearth the mechanism of development of heart block in COVID-19 patients as well as its implications on the clinical course and prognosis. Physicians must be aware of the importance of monitoring patients hospitalized for COVID-19 for arrhythmias including heart blocks, especially in the presence of comorbidities. Early detection can improve the prognosis of the patient.","output":"Heart Block in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on immunosuppressive and biologic therapies were largely excluded from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 messenger RNA vaccine trials. METHODS: We evaluated adverse events (AE) after messenger RNA vaccination in 246 adults with IBD participating in a longitudinal vaccine registry. RESULTS: In general, AE frequency was similar to that reported in the general population. AEs were more common among younger patients and those with previous COVID-19. AEs were less common in individuals receiving advanced therapies with biologics or small-molecule inhibitors. DISCUSSION: Those with IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases can be reassured that the AE risk is likely not increased, and may be reduced, while on advanced therapies.","output":"Adverse Events After SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination Among Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease"}]`),k={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:T},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},O={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",O,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(k,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/5.md","filePath":"doctor/5.md"}'),V={name:"doctor/5.md"},z=Object.assign(V,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(R)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
