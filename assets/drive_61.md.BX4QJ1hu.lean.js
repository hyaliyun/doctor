In the past ten years, numerous studies had shown that infected subjects have a significantly higher incidence of mental and physical health problems and are more prone to exhibiting the adverse effects of various diseases. Methods A cross-sectional internet study was performed on a population of 4,499 Toxoplasma-free and 786 Toxoplasma-infected subjects and looked for factors which positively or negatively affect the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and likelihood of a severe course of Covid-19. Results Logistic regression and partial Kendall correlation controlled for sex, age, and size of the place of residence showed that latent toxoplasmosis had the strongest effect on the risk of infection (OR = 150) before sport (OR = 130), and borreliosis (127). It also had the strongest effect on the risk of severe course of infection (Tau = 0146), before autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, male sex, keeping a cat, being overweight, borreliosis, higher age, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Toxoplasmosis augmented the adverse effects of other risk factors but was not the proximal cause of the effect of cat keeping (in the form of higher likelihood of Covid infection and higher severity of the course of infection), which was observed especially in a subset of Toxoplasma-infected subjects (Tau = 0153). Effects of keeping a cat were detected only in subjects from multi-member families, suggesting that a cat could a vector for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within a family. Conclussions Toxoplasmosis is currently not considered a risk factor for Covid-19 and Toxoplasma-infected subjects are neither informed about their higher risks nor prioritised in vaccination programs.

We studied circulating and nasopharyngeal monocytes and DCs in healthy individuals and in patients with mild respiratory infections (primarily influenza A virus, IAV). As compared to healthy controls (HCs), patients with acute IAV infection displayed reduced DC but increased intermediate monocytes frequencies in blood, and an accumulation of most monocyte and DC subsets in the nasopharynx. IAV patients had more mature monocytes and DCs in the nasopharynx, and higher levels of TNF, IL-6 and IFN in plasma and the nasopharynx.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) play an emerging and important role in the interplay between viruses and host cells. Although the impact of host miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2 infection has been predicted, experimental data are still missing. This study started by a bioinformatics prediction of cellular miRNAs potentially targeting viral RNAs; then, a number of criteria also based on experimental evidence and virus biology were applied, giving rise to eight promising binding miRNAs. Their interaction with viral sequences was experimentally validated by transfecting luciferase-based reporter plasmids carrying viral target sequences or their inverted sequences into the lung A549 cell line. Transfection of the reporter plasmids resulted in a reduction of luciferase activity for five out of the eight potential binding sites, suggesting responsiveness to endogenously expressed miRNAs. Co-transfection of the reporter plasmids along with miRNA mimics led to a further and strong reduction of luciferase activity, validating the interaction between miR-219a-2-3p, miR-30c-5p, miR-378d, miR-29a-3p, miR-15b-5p, and viral sequences. miR-15b was also able to repress plasmid-driven Spike expression. Intriguingly, the viral target sequences are fully conserved in more recent variants such as United Kingdom variant B.1.1.7 and South Africa 501Y.V2.

We report on the safety and clinical findings of a portable magnetic resonance imager (MRI) in a cohort of ICU patients who had Covid 19 with suspected neurologic injury. METHODS: This is a prospective, non-randomized, observational study at one institution utilizing portable MRI in patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, known as Covid-19. Patients selected for imaging had any of the following: 1) unexplained encephalopathy or coma, 2) seizures, 3) focal neurologic deficit, and 4) abnormal head CT. Imaging was performed in each patient's ICU room with a portable, self-shielding, 0.064 Tesla (T) MRI. RESULTS: Among 19 patients, a total of 20 MRI scans in seven ICUs were acquired between April 13 and April 23, 2020. No adverse events to patients or staff from MRI acquisition were reported. In 12 patients, abnormal findings were seen, which included increased fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal (n = 12), hemorrhage (n = 3), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) positivity (n = 3). Imaging led to a change in clinical management in five patients, including 3 lumbar punctures, a resumption of anticoagulation therapy, and one previously unplanned move to palliative care. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first report on the use of a novel, portable, self-shielding MRI to image patients.

To analyze progress in organizational structures, mechanisms, strategies, and enabling factors and barriers towards gender mainstreaming (GM) in health in Guatemala, Guyana, and Peru, given GMs role in addressing gender inequalities in health as a key structural driver of health equity. METHODS. Data was obtained through a grey literature review of laws, policies, and/or program documents and semi-structured qualitative interviews with 37 informants. Analysis was based on a theoretical framework including 7 categories considered essential to advance GM in the health sector. RESULTS. Despite significant efforts and accumulated experiences of GM in health, structural barriers include: wider societal challenges of transforming gender unequal power relations; health system complexity combined with the low technical, political, and financial capacity of institutional structures tasked with GM; and limited coordination with (often weak) National Womens Machineries (NWMs). In some contexts, barriers are compounded by limited understanding of basic concepts underlying GM (at times exacerbated by misunderstandings related to intersectionality and/or engagement with men) and the absence of indicators to measure GMs concrete results and impact. CONCLUSIONS. Successful GM requires a more strategic and transformational agenda, developed and implemented in coordination with NWMs and civil society and with reference to external bodies (e.g. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women) to go beyond process, with clearer distinction between gender sensitivity and gender transformation, and definition of expected results and indicators to measure advances.

Histopathological staining and transmission electron microscopy observation revealed that LYC ameliorated CRS-induced hippocampal microstructural and ultrastructural damage. Furthermore, LYC alleviated CRS-induced oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities. LYC also improved CRS-induced hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction by recovering mitochondrial membrane potential, and complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) and II (succinate dehydrogenase) activities. Moreover, LYC reduced CRS-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and decreased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end-labeled positive cells. Additionally, western blot analysis demonstrated that LYC inhibited CRS-induced activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Correlation analysis indicated that ROS levels, JNK activation, and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were positively correlated. Further investigation of the underlying mechanisms revealed that the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine inhibited CRS-induced JNK activation. Furthermore, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 relieved CRS-induced hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and learning and memory dysfunction.

METHODS: All SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive persons from April 16 to December 31, 2020 with a PCR-positive swab 14 days after the first-positive antibody test were investigated for evidence of reinfection. Viral genome sequencing was conducted for paired viral specimens to confirm reinfection. Incidence of reinfection was compared to incidence of infection in the complement cohort of those who were antibody-negative. FINDINGS: Among 43,044 antibody-positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0C34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab 14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56C0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Meanwhile, in the complement cohort of 149,923 antibody-negative persons followed for a median of 17.0 weeks (range: 0C45.6), incidence rate of infection was estimated at 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22C14.14). Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at 95.2% (95% CI: 94.1C96.0%). Reinfections were less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact tracing. INTERPRETATION: Reinfection is rare in the young and international population of Qatar. Natural infection appears to elicit strong protection against reinfection with an efficacy ~95% for at least seven months.

CD6 is a glycoprotein expressed on mature T lymphocytes which is a crucial regulator of the T-cell activation. Itolizumab is a humanised antibody targeting CD6. Nonclinical and clinical data in autoimmune diseases indicate that it lowers multiple cytokines primarily involving the Th1/Th17 pathway. The primary objective of this study was to assess the impact of itolizumab in arresting the lung function deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Secondary objectives included safety, duration of ventilation, 14-day mortality and evaluation of interleukin 6 concentration. Methods: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 received itolizumab in combination with other therapies included in the national protocol for COVID-19. Results: Seventy critical, severe or moderate patients were treated with itolizumab in 10 Cuban hospitals. Median age was 68, and 94% had comorbidities. After 72 h, most patients improved the PO2/FiO2 ratio and reduced FiO2 requirements. Ventilation time was 8 days for critical and 1 day for severe cases. Ten patients had related adverse events while 3 subjects developed related serious events. In 30 patients, interleukin 6 decreased in individuals with high level and did not change in those with lower concentration. Fourteen-day lethality rate was 4% and 18% for moderate and severe patients, respectively. The proportion of moderate or severe patients with ventilation or death at day 14 was 9.8%. Time to treatment, neurological manifestations and biomarkers such as NLR were significantly associated with higher lethality.

Despite profound health consequences, the impacts of diarrhea-causing microbes on the evolutionary history of host species are largely unknown. We investigated patterns of genetic variation in mammalian Guanylate Cyclase-C (GC-C), an intestinal receptor frequently targeted by bacterial enterotoxins, to determine how hosts might adapt in response to diarrheal infections. Under normal conditions, GC-C interacts with endogenous guanylin peptides to promote water secretion in the intestine, but signaling can be hijacked by bacterially-encoded heat-stable enterotoxins (STa) during infection, which leads to overstimulation of GC-C and diarrhea. Phylogenetic analysis in mammals revealed evidence of recurrent positive selection in the GC-C ligand-binding domain in primates and bats, consistent with selective pressures to evade interactions with STa. Using in vitro assays and transgenic intestinal organoids to model STa-mediated diarrhea, we show that GC-C diversification in these lineages results in substantial variation in toxin susceptibility. In bats, we observe a unique pattern of compensatory coevolution in the endogenous GC-C ligand uroguanylin, reflecting intense bouts of positive selection at the receptor-ligand interface. These findings demonstrate control of water physiology as a previously unrecognized interface for genetic conflict and reveal diarrheal pathogens as a source of selective pressure among diverse mammals.","output":"Conflicts with diarrheal pathogens trigger rapid evolution of an intestinal signaling axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical trials represent an essential component of improving treatment for substance use disorders (SUD).

Beside regular emergency care, rapid detection and isolation of COVID-19 cases are obligatory for prevention of internal viral transmission and efficient medical staff protection. METHODS: In this study a model of risk stratification for suspected SARS-CoV?2 and COVID-19 cases was developed on the basis of epidemiologic criteria of the Robert-Koch Institute including five risk categories (RC). The model was implemented in a hospital of basic and regular care level. By combination of risk categories with specific isolation, hygienic and personal protection procedures all areas of the ED were restructured. In a retrospective study all inpatient cases (n = 491) were re-evaluated during a 4-week interval (26 MarchC26 April 2020). RESULTS: In the study population 25 SARS-CoV?2 positive cases (5.2%) were identified. These cases were categorized according to the risk stratification model as follows: RC Iconfirmed SARS-CoV?2 infection 36% (n = 9), RC IIreasonable suspected cases 32% (n = 8), RC IIIdifferential diagnostic cases 12% (n = 3), RC IVlow probability 8% (n = 2) and RC Vno evidence 12% (n = 3). No viral transmission was detected during the whole period within medical staff and patients of the ED. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of COVID-19 risk categories within the ED permits central control of important hygienic processes with respect to SARS-CoV?2 infection probability. By continuous re-evaluation of case definitions local outbreaks can be used to adapt criteria within the risk categories. Risk stratification of COVID-19 cases allows for a strict separation of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 emergencies and thus ensures effective infection prevention of medical staff and patients.","output":"Risikostratifizierung von Notf?llen w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie in der Zentralen Notaufnahme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although COVID-19 is considered to be primarily a respiratory disease, SARS-CoV-2 affects multiple organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS) Yet, there is no consensus whether the virus can infect the brain, or what the consequences of CNS infection are Here, we used three independent approaches to probe the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brain First, using human brain organoids, we observed clear evidence of infection with accompanying metabolic changes in the infected and neighboring neurons However, no evidence for the type I interferon responses was detected We demonstrate that neuronal infection can be prevented either by blocking ACE2 with antibodies or by administering cerebrospinal fluid from a COVID-19 patient Second, using mice overexpressing human ACE2, we demonstrate in vivo that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, but not respiratory infection, is associated with mortality Finally, in brain autopsy from patients who died of COVID-19, we detect SARS-CoV-2 in the cortical neurons, and note pathologic features associated with infection with minimal immune cell infiltrates These results provide evidence for the neuroinvasive capacity of SARS-CoV2, and an unexpected consequence of direct infection of neurons by SARS-CoV-2","output":"Neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 in human and mouse brain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory virus infections are one of the major causes of acute respiratory disease or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

It has been shown that chondroitin sulfate interferes with the progression of structural changes in joint tissues and is used in the management of patients with osteoarthritis. METHODS This review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the mechanisms of action of chondroitin sulfate that may explain the beneficial effects of the drug and examines the evidence for clinical efficacy of oral chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis. Data included in the review were derived from a literature search in PubMed. Literature searches were performed in PubMed using the search terms 'chondroitin sulfate', 'pharmaceutical-grade', 'osteoarthritis', 'randomized clinical trials', 'humans'. The MEDLINE database was searched from January 1996 through August 2012 for all randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and review articles of chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis. RESULTS Chondroitin sulfate exerts in vitro a beneficial effect on the metabolism of different cell lines: chondrocytes, synoviocytes and cells from subchondral bone, all involved in osteoarthritis. It increases type II collagen and proteoglycan synthesis in human articular chondrocytes and is able to reduce the production of some pro-inflammatory factors and proteases, to reduce the cellular death process, and improve the anabolic/catabolic balance of the extracellular cartilage matrix (ECM). Clinical trials have reported a beneficial effect of chondroitin sulfate on pain and function. The structure-modifying effects of chondroitin sulfate have been reported and analyzed in recent meta-analyses. The results in knee osteoarthritis demonstrate a small but significant reduction in the rate of decline in joint space width. Because chondroitin sulfate quality of several nutraceuticals has been found to be poor, it is recommended that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate is used rather than food supplements in the treatment of OA. Chondroitin sulfate is recommended by several guidelines from international societies in the management of knee and hip OA. Furthermore, its safety profile is favorable when compared with many other therapies used in OA.

Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment and clinical outcome data were collected, and predictors of the duration of viral shedding were explored through multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The medical staff with COVID-19 presented mild clinical symptoms and showed a low frequency of abnormal laboratory indicators. All the medical staff were cured and discharged, of whom 96 (68.6%) were female, 39 (27.9%) had underlying diseases, the median age was 36.0 years, and 104 (74.3%) were infected whilst working in hospital.

DESIGN: We developed and disseminated a survey, which included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), to all general and integrated plastic surgery residents in their clinical years of training at the University of California, San Francisco. Statistical analysis of the survey responses was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Post-hoc analysis was performed using the Bonferroni-corrected Dunn test.

We explore these possibly differential immune responses across the disease spectrum.MethodsA multicentre prospective study was undertaken via a SARS-CoV-2 delayed case identification programme (08 May-11 July 2020). Matched samples were tested for anti-NP and anti-RBD (utilising an inhouse double-antigen bridged assay), reactivity expressed as test/cut-off binding ratios (BR) and results compared. A multivariate linear regression model analysed age, sex, symptomatology, PCR positivity, anti-NP, and anti-RBD BRs. Participants were followed up for possible reinfection.Results902 individuals underwent matched testing;109 were SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab positive. Anti-NP, anti-RBD immunoassay agreement was 87.5% (95% CI 85.3C89.6), with BRs strongly correlated (R=0.75). PCR confirmed cases were more frequently identified by anti-RBD (sensitivity 108/109, 99.1%, 95% CI 95.0C100.0) than anti-NP (102/109, 93.6%, 95% CI 87.2C97.4). Anti-RBD identified an additional 83/325 (25.5%) cases in those seronegative for anti-NP. Presence of anti-NP (p&lt;0.0001), fever (p=0.005), or anosmia (p=0.002) were all significantly associated with an increased anti-RBD BR. Age was associated with reduced anti-RBD BR (p=0.052).

Higher BRs are seen in symptomatic individuals with significantly higher levels seen in those with fever and anosmia. The degree of discordant results (12.5%) limits the use of anti-NP as a stand-alone for delayed case finding programmes.

IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: To achieve the best outcomes for patients, nurse leaders should be involved in policy forums at all levels of government to ensure nurses can influence health policy.","output":"Examining the UK Covid-19 mortality paradox: Pandemic preparedness, healthcare expenditure, and the nursing workforce"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was a worldwide pandemic with international health emergencies and great challenges; health care personnel shortage and physician burnout is a potential major challenge that should be planned and managed; especially in those countries with a high COVID-19 occurrence. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess the attitudes of 3rd-year anesthesiology residents toward an independent one month-length clinical care course for patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A closed self-administered questionnaire was developed to assess the attitudes of 3rd-year clinical anesthesiology residents. A self-administered closed questionnaire was developed. Cronbachs alpha was calculated to measure the reliability of the questionnaire; added with a factor analysis process. RESULTS: All 19 clinical anesthesiology residents took part in the study, with a 100% response rate. Cronbachs alpha for the reliability of the questionnaire was 0.678. The eigenvalue for 8 factors was equal to 1; however, further assessment led us to 7 factors. CONCLUSIONS: This one-month period could improve the competencies of the 3rd year clinical anesthesiology residents based on their viewpoints. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing health and social problem worldwide, 3rd-year anesthesiology residents could help the health system to recover health care delivery faults regarding manpower; a promising point for crisis preparedness in the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, there were many constructive results for the clinical anesthesiology residents regarding their training and clinical service delivery.","output":"Attitudes of the Third-Year Clinical Anesthesiology Residents Toward an Independent Clinical Practice Rotation in COVID-19 Pandemic in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Infection screening tools classically define fever as 38.0C (100.4F). Frail older adults may not mount the same febrile response to systemic infection as younger or healthier individuals. We evaluate temperature trends among nursing home (NH) residents undergoing diagnostic SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 testing and describe the diagnostic accuracy of temperature measurements for predicting test\\\\confirmed SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study evaluating diagnostic accuracy of preCSARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 testing temperature changes. SETTING: Two separate NH cohorts tested diagnostically (e.g., for symptoms) for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. PARTICIPANTS Veterans residing in Veterans Affairs (VA) managed NHs and residents in a private national chain of community NHs. MEASUREMENTS: For both cohorts, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and Youden's index with different temperature cutoffs for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 polymerase chain reaction results. RESULTS: The VA cohort consisted of 1,301 residents in 134 facilities from March 1, 2020, to May 14, 2020, with 25% confirmed for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. The community cohort included 3,368 residents spread across 282 facilities from February 18, 2020, to June 9, 2020, and 42% were confirmed for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. The VA cohort was younger, less White, and mostly male. A temperature testing threshold of 37.2C has better sensitivity for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, 76% and 34% in the VA and community NH, respectively, versus 38.0C with 43% and 12% sensitivity, respectively. CONCLUSION: A definition of 38.0C for fever in NH screening tools should be lowered to improve predictive accuracy for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. Stakeholders should carefully consider the impact of adopting lower testing thresholds on testing availability, cost, and burden on staff and residents. Temperatures alone have relatively low sensitivity/specificity, and we advocate any threshold be used as part of a screening tool, along with other signs and symptoms of infection.","output":"Temperature Screening for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in Nursing Homes: Evidence from Two National Cohorts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on health professionals, in terms of work changes and mental health. METHOD: 1) Cross-sectional study and 2) longitudinal prospective study on health professionals who worked directly with patients affected by COVID-19 pandemic during the period between March-June 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Barcelona. Baseline (July-November 2020) and follow-up (November 2020-March 2021) data were collected. Data related to the job and toxic habits were collected with ad hoc questionnaires, and data related to perceived stress, post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: In the baseline group (cross-sectional study), 90 professionals participated, 76% nurses. More than a third were on sick leave or took drugs to manage stress. Half of smokers increased tobacco use, and one in 5 increased alcohol consumption. Habitual shift change is significantly associated with depression, professional profile with anxiety, and perceived stress with age. In the longitudinal prospective study, the follow-up group (n = 64) shows high levels of stress and anxiety, which are maintained or even significantly increased over time.

MATERIALS/METHODS Using the electronic medical record, we extracted encounter data and corresponding patient information the 6 months prior to and 6 months of COVID-enabled virtual visits (10/1/2019-3/22/2020 versus 3/23/2020-9/1/2020) at a large tertiary cancer center. Encounters during COVID were categorized as in-person or virtual visits. Descriptive and univariate analysis was conducted on the characteristics of patient populations during the pre-COVID period to establish baseline demographics and compare to the during COVID period. Examined demographic variables included race, ethnicity, age, sex, marital status, preferred language, insurance status and tumor characteristics including disease site. Univariate and multivariable (MVA) logistic regression examined patient demographic and disease characteristics associated with virtual visit use. RESULTS We analyzed 4,974 total encounters, (2,287 pre-COVID and 2,687 during COVID), among 3,960 total patients. All (100%) pre-COVID encounters were in-person whereas during COVID, 21% of encounters were via virtual visits. Overall, there were no differences identified in pre- versus during COVID patient characteristics. However, we found significant differences in patient characteristics for in-person versus virtual encounters during COVID. On MVA, virtual visit use was less common among patients of minority race (white n = 321 versus black n = 100 and other n = 35, OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.94, P = 0.014) and not married (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-1.00, P = 0.048). Patients diagnosed with head and neck (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.96, P = 0.030), breast (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20-0.60, P = < 0.001), GI/abdominal (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16-0.62, P = 0.001) or hematologic malignancy (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.84, P = 0.029), were less likely to use virtual visits relative to patients with genitourinary malignancy. CONCLUSION While the patient populations were similar prior to and during COVID, when controlling for available variables, we found significant differences in virtual visit use by patient characteristics, including race and marital status as well as disease characteristics. Further study is needed to elucidate additional factors that underlie these differences in virtual visit utilization; health equity should be considered when implementing virtual visits.

The purpose of this study is to determine if there is C. acnes present on the incision scalpel in patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty despite extensive skin preparation techniques to prevent wound contamination. Methods The authors collected a consecutive case series of patients meeting inclusion criteria. Patients were included if they underwent either primary or revision shoulder arthroplasty at the tertiary-care hospital with the senior author during the study period. Culture swab samples, testing for presence of C. acnes, were collected from 17 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty with a single, fellowship-trained surgeon between November 2019 and March 2020. Culture reports were recorded as positive or negative after 21 days. Institutional Review Board approval of the study protocol was obtained. The null hypothesis was that there would be no cases with knife blades culture positive for C. acnes. Results 17 patients were identified and fit inclusion criteria. There were 12 males (mean age 64.3y, range 48y-79y) and 5 females (mean age 69.8y, range 59y-79y). Two patients (11.8%) were found to have C. acnes growth on the skin knife. Both patients were males over the age of 70 undergoing primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty with no history of previous shoulder infections. Conclusion The presence of C. acnes on the skin blade in 2 patients validates concerns that there is C. acnes present in dermal tissue despite extensive attention to eradication of these microbes. There was a high rate of C. acnes contamination on scalpel blades used for initial skin incisions and the authors conclude that there is value in discarding these blades from the surgical field.","output":"Is There Value in the Routine Practice of Discarding the Incision Scalpel From the Surgical Field to Prevent Deep Wound Contamination with C. acnes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Par ses impacts de court terme comme par les changements structured qu'elle annonce, la crise du Covid-19 modifie profond&nent les perspectives de Taction climatique Elle rend probable Tatteinte du pic des emissions mondiales en 2019 et devrait faire gagner, par les baisses d'emission induites, quelques ann&s face au mouve- ment inexorable de Thorloge climatique Mais franchir ce pic ne signifie en aucune faon gagner la ba- taille face au r&hauffement climatique Une fois le pic depasse, il conviendra de renforcer Taction pour ramener le cumul des Emissions a un niveau compatible avec un r&hauffement inferieur a 2 C, voire 1,5 C d'ici la fin du siecle Les changements structu- rels que la crise sanitaire va impulser, tant dans les organisations productives que dans les attentes societales, devraient mieux armer les societes post-Covid-19 pour gfrer la crise climatique Mais ces changements ne sont ni garantis ni irreversibles Avec le temps, le risque subsiste que le monde post-Covid-19 abaisse la garde, qu'il soit frappe cTune sorte d'amnesie collective A Tanalyse en trois actes de Charles Rosenberg sur Tepidemie, il conviendrait peut-etre d'en ajouter un quatrieme: celui caract- risant le fonctionnement social une fois les traces de Tepidmie effaces Il ne faudrait pas que cet acte 4 laisse se propager une amn&ie collective qui serait le reflet de Tinsouciance dans laquelle se rassurait la societe au debut de Tacte 1 Dans les societes amne- siques, seule la repetition des catastrophes contraint la society a agir face a Turgence climatique ? 2020 Futuribles All rights reserved","output":"Covid-19: Causes, impacts et strategies La grande peur de Tan 2020Le bug du coronavirus et le grand confinement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the trend of global aging, people are paying more and more attention to the health of the elderly and the improvement of green open spaces. However, few studies have focused on strategies to improve green spaces in response to this trend. Especially, with the outbreak of COVID-19, an urgent need to develop a sustainable system strategy to improve the health of the elderly in residential communities in old districts has emerged. Traditional improvement strategies based on current situation evaluation often focus on the most prominent practical problems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to provide theoretical research and practical improvement strategies for green open spaces in old downtown residential communities to improve the health and well-being of the elderly. In response to this problem, this research proposes an alternative method based on causality (FDM-DANP-mV model), by extracting 23 green open space elements that affect the health of the elderly and dividing them into three dimensions, to form a preliminary evaluation framework. On this basis, the more effective and feasible standard elements are screened out, and the influence relationship behind the elements is clarified. Then, the sustainable development strategy is systematically discussed in three practical cases. This allows for the analysis of the present situation to not only identify the current significant problems but also to capture the source of the influence behind the real problems based on the clarification of the dominant influence relationship. The actual value of this study is to provide a key design decision basis for the improvement of the green open spaces in old downtown residential communities, aiming at avoiding waste to the greatest extent under the premise of limited resources and gradually promoting the improvement of the urban built environment to promote the health and well-being of the elderly.","output":"Exploring Strategies for Improving Green Open Spaces in Old Downtown Residential Communities from the Perspective of Public Health to Enhance the Health and Well-Being of the Aged"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Taiwan suffered from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003.

Demographic, comorbidity and laboratory determinants of death and of ICU admission were explored in all Danish hospitalised patients. METHODS: National health registries were used to identify all hospitalized patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. We obtained demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and laboratory results on admission and explored prognostic factors for death using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression and competing risk survival analysis. RESULTS: Among 2431 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 between February 27 and July 8 (median age 69 years [IQR 53C80], 54.1% males), 359 (14.8%) needed admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 455 (18.7%) died within 30 days of follow-up. The seven-day cumulative incidence of ICU admission was lower for females (7.9%) than for males (16.7%), (p < 0.001). Age, high CCI, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, creatinine, lymphopenia, neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia within 24-h of admission were independently associated with death within the first week in the multivariate analysis. Conditional upon surviving the first week, male sex, age, high CCI, elevated CRP, LDH, creatinine, urea and neutrophil count were independently associated with death within 30 days. Males presented with more pronounced laboratory abnormalities on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, male sex, comorbidity, higher levels of systemic inflammation and cell-turnover were independent factors for mortality. Age was the strongest predictor for death, moderate to high level of comorbidity were associated with a nearly two-fold increase in mortality. Mortality was significantly higher in males after surviving the first week.

Myocardial inflammation is known to occur with SARS-CoV-2. Different screening approaches for detection of myocarditis have been reported. The Big Ten Conference requires comprehensive cardiac testing including cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging for all athletes with COVID-19, allowing comparison of screening approaches. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of myocarditis in athletes with COVID-19 and compare screening strategies for safe return to play. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Big Ten COVID-19 Cardiac Registry principal investigators were surveyed for aggregate observational data from March 1, 2020, through December 15, 2020, on athletes with COVID-19. For athletes with myocarditis, presence of cardiac symptoms and details of cardiac testing were recorded. Myocarditis was categorized as clinical or subclinical based on the presence of cardiac symptoms and CMR findings. Subclinical myocarditis classified as probable or possible myocarditis based on other testing abnormalities. Myocarditis prevalence across universities was determined. The utility of different screening strategies was evaluated. EXPOSURES: SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction testing. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Myocarditis via cardiovascular diagnostic testing. RESULTS: Representing 13 universities, cardiovascular testing was performed in 1597 athletes (964 men [60.4%]). Thirty-seven (including 27 men) were diagnosed with COVID-19 myocarditis (overall 2.3%; range per program, 0%-7.6%); 9 had clinical myocarditis and 28 had subclinical myocarditis. If cardiac testing was based on cardiac symptoms alone, only 5 athletes would have been detected (detected prevalence, 0.31%). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for all athletes yielded a 7.4-fold increase in detection of myocarditis (clinical and subclinical). Follow-up CMR imaging performed in 27 (73.0%) demonstrated resolution of T2 elevation in all (100%) and late gadolinium enhancement in 11 (40.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of 1597 US competitive athletes with CMR screening after COVID-19 infection, 37 athletes (2.3%) were diagnosed with clinical and subclinical myocarditis. Variability was observed in prevalence across universities, and testing protocols were closely tied to the detection of myocarditis. Variable ascertainment and unknown implications of CMR findings underscore the need for standardized timing and interpretation of cardiac testing. These unique CMR imaging data provide a more complete understanding of the prevalence of clinical and subclinical myocarditis in college athletes after COVID-19 infection. The role of CMR in routine screening for athletes safe return to play should be explored further.","output":"Prevalence of Clinical and Subclinical Myocarditis in Competitive Athletes With Recent SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Results From the Big Ten COVID-19 Cardiac Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the paper is to understand the impact of the COVID-19 focusing event that resulted in a distinctive response by the Federal government.

While epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported, risk factors underlying the transition from mild to severe disease among patients remain poorly understood. Methods In this retrospective study, we analysed data of 820 confirmed COVID-19 positive patients admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England, between January 1st and April 23rd, 2020, with a majority of cases occurring in March and April. We extracted anonymised demographic data, physiological clinical variables and laboratory results from electronic healthcare records (EHR) and applied multivariate logistic regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosted trees. To evaluate the potential for early risk assessment, we used data available during patients' initial presentation at the emergency department (ED) to predict deterioration to one of three clinical endpoints in the remainder of the hospital stay: A) admission to intensive care, B) need for mechanical ventilation and C) mortality. Based on the trained models, we extracted the most informative clinical features in determining these patient trajectories. Results Considering our inclusion criteria, we have identified 126 of 820 (15%) patients that required intensive care, 62 of 808 (8%) patients needing mechanical ventilation, and 170 of 630 (27%) cases of in-hospital mortality. Our models learned successfully from early clinical data and predicted clinical endpoints with high accuracy, the best model achieving AUC-ROC scores of 0.75 to 0.83 (F1 scores of 0.41 to 0.56). Younger patient age was associated with an increased risk of receiving intensive care and ventilation, but lower risk of mortality. Clinical indicators of a patient's oxygen supply and selected laboratory results were most predictive of COVID-19 patient trajectories. Conclusion Among COVID-19 patients machine learning can aid in the early identification of those with a poor prognosis, using EHR data collected during a patient's first presentation at ED. Patient age and measures of oxygenation status during ED stay are primary indicators of poor patient outcomes.","output":"Early risk assessment for COVID-19 patients from emergency department data using machine learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1.

Methods: We evaluated self-reported infection rates of COVID-19 in three, preexisting, longitudinal, Latinx family cohorts in the San Francisco Bay Area from May through September 2020 (N=383 households, 1,875 people). All households were enrolled during pregnancy and postpartum at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) and UCSF Benioff before the pandemic. For the COVID-19 sub-study, participants responded to a 15-minute telephonic interview where we assessed food consumption patterns, housing and employment status, and history of COVID-19 infection based on community and hospital-based testing. We also evaluated secondhand smoke exposure based on previously collected data. Environmental pollution exposure was determined from census tract residence using California EnviroScreen 2.0 data. Non-parametric tests were used to assess possible associations and multiple logistic regression analyses to determine independent predictors of COVID-19 infection. Results: In the combined Latinx, Eating and Diabetes Cohort (LEAD) and Hispanic, Eating and Nutrition (HEN) cohorts there was a 7.6% household infection rate (14/183) with a lower rate of 3.5% (7/200) in the Telomeres at Birth (TAB) cohort. Larger household size increased risk for infection (OR, 1.43 (95%CI 1.10-1.87)) in the combined LEAD/HEN cohorts and increasing number of children trended towards significance in the TAB cohort (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.98-3.37). Any exposure to secondhand smoke in the household also trended towards increasing risk after adjusting for household size and other exposures (OR 3.20, 95%CI 0.80-12.73) and (OR 4.37, 95% CI 0.80-23.70). We did not find any associations between neighborhood pollution level and COVID-19 infection based on census track and risk of infection. Furthermore, we found weak evidence between dietary exposure and risk of COVID-19 infection after adjusting for possible confounders. Conclusion: Crowding as indicated by household size increases risk for COVID-19 infection in Latinx families. Exposure to any secondhand smoke may also increase risk for COVID-19 through increased coughing and risk for respiratory impairment. Public policy and health interventions need to ensure that multi-unit residential complexes prevent any exposure to secondhand smoke.","output":"Overcrowding and Exposure to Secondhand Smoke Increase Risk for COVID-19 Infection Among Latinx Families in Greater San Francisco Bay Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the impact of COVID\\\\19 on changes in firm value, and the moderating role of firm\\\\level sustainability performance on this relationship.

If we are to learn one economic lesson from the pandemic, arguably it is the perils of an overfocus on short-term allocative efficiency at the price of lack of capacity to deal with uncertain future challenges. In normal times, building spare capacity with 'option value' into health systems may seem inefficient, the costs potentially exceeding the benefits. Yet the fatal weakness of not doing so is that this can leave health systems highly constrained when dealing with unexpected, but ultimately inevitable, shocks-such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue that the pandemic has highlighted the potentially enormous option value of biomedical research infrastructure. We illustrate this with reference to COVID-19 response work supported by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. As the world deals with the fallout from the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression, pressure will soon come to review government expenditure, including research funding. Developing a framework to fully account for option value, and understanding the public appetite to pay for it, should allow us to be better prepared for the next emerging problem.","output":"Lessons from the pandemic on the value of research infrastructure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional screening for COVID-19 typically includes survey questions about symptoms and travel history, as well as temperature measurements.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on urology surgical waiting list in a high-volume hospital. METHODS? An observational descriptive study was designed. All patients included in the urology surgical waiting list of our high-volume center on May 1st 2020 (46 days after the suspension of elective surgery) were analyzed. Baseline variables, priority on the waiting list, main urological disease, type of scheduled surgery, and waiting time were recorded. Other variables recorded were the presence of a urinary catheter, number of accesses to the emergency department, evidence of COVID-19 infection, number of deaths and their cause. The waiting time for each disease was compared with the time to surgery in 2019. RESULTS? A total of 350 patients were included. The mean (SD) time on the waiting list was 97.33 (55.47) days. Priority 1 patients, who normally should undergo surgery within 30 days, were on the waiting list for a mean (SD) time of 60.51 (20.14) days. They were mainly patients with ureteral lithiasis (25.6%), high-risk or muscle-invasive bladder cancer (20.9%) and high-risk prostate cancer (13.9%). The mean waiting time had already significantly exceeded the mean time to surgery in 2019 for radical cystectomy (p=0.04) and URS (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS?

Intravenous (IV) vitamin C administration may reduce the need for vasopressor support and the duration of mechanical ventilations in critically ill patients in hospital. COVID-19 has similar signs and symptoms of ARI. Further studies involving patients with COVID-19, either through administration of oral vitamin C in mild cases or IV vitamin C in critical cases, would be advantageous to examine if it is safe and efficacious. Verdict: Oral vitamin C may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections (ARI) and common cold-induced asthma but no studies have been identified justifying oral vitamin C for the prevention or treatment of coronavirus infections including COVID-19. When taken at onset of ARI, oral vitamin C may reduce the duration of symptoms including fever, chest pain, chills and bodily aches and pains. It may also reduce the incidence of hospital admission and duration of hospital stays. For individuals admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia, vitamin C may improve respiratory function in more severe cases. No major adverse events nor interactions were reported by either method of administration. However, there is an absence of high quality, contemporary clinical research examining this topic.

Three fragments (40-751, 746-1344 and 746-2001 bp) derived from S1 domain produced after the recombinant plasmid (pQE-30/S1) was digested by restriction endonucleases. The three fragments were cloned into pQE-30 and expressed in M15 strains of Escherichia coli. The expression products, designated S1a, S1b and S1c respectively, were purified by Ni affinity chromatography. The immunogenicity was analyzed by Western Blot and ELISA using serologically confirmed sera from SARS patients and the sera from healthy donors was used as control at the same assay.

The impact of social confinement and the interruption of this surgery on the population with obesity has been underestimated, with weight gain and worsened comorbidities. Some candidates for this surgery are exposed to a high risk of mortality linked to the pandemic. Obesity and diabetes are two major risk factors for severe forms of Covid-19. The only currently effective treatment for obesity is metabolic surgery, which confers prompt, lasting benefits. It is thus necessary to resume such surgery.To ensure that this resumption is both gradual and well-founded, we have devised a priority ranking plan. The flow charts we propose will help centres to identify priority patients according to a benefit/risk assessment. Diabetes holds a central place in the decision tree. Resumption patterns will vary from one centre to another according to human, physical and medical resources, and will need adjustment as the epidemic unfolds.Specific informed consent will be required. Screening of patients with obesity should be considered, based on available knowledge. If Covid-19 is suspected, surgery must be postponed. Emphasis must be placed on infection control measures to protect patients and healthcare professionals. Confinement is strongly advocated for patients for the first month post-operatively.

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: A total of 1284 HCP participated (physicians: 31.3%, nursing personnel: 36.6%, paramedical personnel: 11.1%, administrative personnel: 13.2%, supportive personnel: 7.3%). Vaccination rates were 32.9% against measles and mumps, 38.1% against rubella, 5.7% against varicella, 9.2% against hepatitis A, 65.8% against hepatitis B, 31.8% against tetanus-diphtheria, 7.1% against pertussis, 60.2% against influenza, and 80.1% against COVID-19. Susceptibility rates were as follows: 27.8% for measles, 39.6% for mumps, 33.4% for rubella, 22.2% for varicella, 86.3% for hepatitis A, 34.2% for hepatitis B, 68.2% for tetanus-diphtheria, and 92.9% for pertussis. Older HCP had higher susceptibility rates against mumps, rubella, varicella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tetanus-diphtheria, and pertussis (p-values <0.001 for all). Mandatory vaccinations were supported by 81.85% of HCP. CONCLUSIONS: Although most HCPs supported mandatory vaccinations, significant vaccination gaps, and susceptibility rates were recorded. The proportion of susceptible HCP to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella has increased in the past decade, mostly because of reduction in acquired cases of natural illness. Vaccination programs for HCP should be developed.

OBJECTIVES the aim of the present study is to determine the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-hemolytic effects of phenolic fractions from Anchusa azurea Mill. METHODS in this study, various extracts from Anchusa azurea Mill. (AA) using solvents with increasing polarity were prepared. The quantification of polyphenols and flavonoids was determined. The anti-radical activity of the different extracts was evaluated using DPPH and by measuring the inhibition of the oxidative degradation of -carotene. The In vitro antihemolytic effect of the plant extracts is determined (CrE, ChE, AcE and AqE). For each extract, four concentrations were tested: 10.59, 21.18, 42.37, 84.74 g/ml. Vitamin C is used as a standard. Free-radical attack was measured by measuring the HT50 (Half-Hemolysis Time). The anti-inflammatory effect using PMA on mice of the methanolic extract (CrE) was evaluated. RESULTS the quantification of polyphenols and flavonoids showed that ethyl acetate extract (AcE) contains a higher amount of polyphenols. However, chloroform extract (ChE) presents a higher amount of flavonoids. AcE showed an important scavenging activity using the DPPH radical (IC50= 68.35 g/ml). The results showed that AcE also exhibited very great inhibition on the oxidation of -carotene/linoleic acid (84.33%). All extracts increased the HT50 values (Half-Hemolysis Time) in a dose-dependent manner.

SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a facilitates lysosomal targeting of the BORC-ARL8b complex, which mediates trafficking of lysosomes to the vicinity of the plasma membrane, and exocytosis-related SNARE proteins. The Ca2+ channel TRPML3 is required for SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a-mediatd lysosomal exocytosis.

It is characterized by acute onset of diarrhea, fever, depression, and reduced milk yield in adult cattle. Although production loss is a well-known consequence of WD, large-scale studies estimating the effect on milk production are lacking. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of farmer-reported WD on herd-level milk production and milk composition. A cohort study was performed based on reports of herd outbreaks of winter dysentery during a regional epidemic in Norway during the winter of 2011C2012. Reports were made by farmers, and diagnosis was based on a herd outbreak of acute diarrhea in adults. Milk shipment data were retrieved from the dairy company, and information on herd size and milking system were retrieved from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System. We compared milk production in herds with reported outbreaks of WD (n = 224) with all herds in the same area without a reported outbreak (n = 2,093) during the same period. The outcome variable in the analysis was milk volume per cow per day, and the main predictor was whether the herd had a reported outbreak of WD or not. We assessed the effect of WD on milk production by fitting a linear mixed model, adjusting for milk production in the herd before the outbreak. Similarly, we assessed the effect of WD on milk composition using linear regression, adjusting for the levels of milk components before the outbreak. This study estimated a total loss of 51 L/cow during the study period, from 7 d before to 19 d after a reported outbreak. The lowest estimated production was 2 d after the outbreak was reported, when the average milk yield was 19.4 L/cow per day, compared with 23.0 L/cow per day 7 days before notification (i.e., a difference of 3.6 L/cow, or 15%). The effect gradually declined with time. The estimated effect on milk composition was modest, but an increase of 11% in free fatty acids and a small increase in fat/protein ratio indicated that WD might put cows into negative energy balance. Descriptive analysis indicated that herd milk yield was still reduced 4 mo after an outbreak. This cohort study showed that WD causes considerable decreases in milk production, and it alters milk composition. These findings highlight the important negative consequences of WD, and should motivate actions to prevent between-herd spread of bovine coronavirus.","output":"A cohort study of the effect of winter dysentery on herd-level milk production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon Beta-1a (IFN-1-a), an immunomodulatory mediator with antiviral effects, has shown in vivo and in vitro activities especially on coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2.

This study determined overall intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and identified factors that predict intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Canada. Methods: Individuals from research cohorts from the general population of British Columbia aged 25-69 were invited complete an online survey based on validated scales and theoretical frameworks to explore intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Two multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to determine factors associated with intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Of 4,528 respondents, 79.8% intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. In multivariable modeling, respondents who intended to receive the vaccine had higher vaccine attitudinal scores (p <0.001), reported greater influence of direct social norms (p = 0.001), and indirect social norms, including their family physician (p = 0.024), and Provincial Health Officer (p = 0.011). Older individuals (>60 years) were more likely to intend to receive the vaccine, while females (95%CI 0.57,0.93), those with less than high school education (95%CI 0.5,0.76), those who self-identified as non-white ( 95%CI 0.60,0.92), self-identified as Indigenous (95%CI 0.36,0.84) and essential non-health care workers (95%CI 0.59,0.86) had lower adjusted odds of intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: To optimize vaccine coverage, public health should focus on key messages around vaccine safety and benefit, and leverage trusted practitioners for messaging. As certain key populations report a lower intention to vaccinate, there is a need for in-depth education and support for these communities to ensure optimal uptake.","output":"Intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine: Results from a population-based survey in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This issue continues our tradition of advancing family medicine by publishing articles on issues that affect patients and the practice of family medicine, specifically with an emphasis on inequity and the COVID pandemic, which are often intertwined.

SETTING: Academic medical center with nine adult ICUs dedicated to caring for coronavirus disease 2019 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. PATIENTS: Mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia requiring tracheostomy for prolonged ventilatory support. INTERVENTIONS: Adherence to the standard of care for timing of tracheostomy as deemed necessary by the intensivist without delay and utilizing the existing tracheostomy team in performing the needed procedures within 1 day of the request. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred eleven patients with coronavirus disease 2019 received tracheostomy in the month of April 2020. Median time to tracheostomy was 11 days. All procedures were performed percutaneously at bedside under bronchoscopic guidance. Sixty-three percent of patients who received tracheostomy either weaned or discharged alive within 60 days of the procedure. Performing tracheostomy on these patients without delay did not lead to coronavirus disease 2019 viral transmission to the tracheostomy team as evident by lack of symptoms and negative antibody testing.

The objective of the study was to explore the experiences of pregnant young females and their receipt of social support in Soweto, South Africa. An interpretive phenomenological approach was employed to understand and interpret pregnant young womens lived experiences of support networks on their pregnancy care and wellbeing. Data was collected conducting 18 in-depth interviews with young pregnant women. Analysis of the data resulted in the development of two superordinate themes: (1) relationships during pregnancy and (2) network involvement. Each superordinate theme was linked to subthemes that helped explain whether young women had positive or negative experiences of social support during their pregnancy care, and their wellbeing. The sub-themes emanating from the superordinate theme relationships during pregnancy were (a) behavioural response of partner following disclosure of pregnancy, (b) behavioural response of family following disclosure of pregnancy, and (c) sense of emotional security. Accompanying subthemes of the superordinate theme network involvement were (a) emotional and instrumental support, and (b) information support. An interpretation of the young womens experiences has revealed that young womens satisfaction with existing support networks and involvement of the various social networks contributed greatly to the participants having a greater sense of potential parental efficacy and increased acceptance of their pregnancies. Pregnant women who receive sufficient social support from immediate networks have increased potential to embrace and give attention to pregnancy-related changes. This could, in turn, foster positive behavioural outcomes that encourage engaging in good pregnancy care practices and acceptance of motherhood. Focusing on previously unexamined factors that could improve maternal health, such as social support, could improve maternal mortality rates and help achieve reproductive health accessibility universally.","output":"Social Support during pregnancy: A phenomenological exploration of young womens experiences of support networks on pregnancy care and wellbeing in Soweto, South Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate antibiotic use can cause harm and promote antimicrobial resistance, which has been declared a major health challenge by the World Health Organization. In Australian residential aged care facilities (RACFs), the most common indications for antibiotic prescribing are for infections of the urinary tract, respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue. Studies indicate that a high proportion of these prescriptions are non-compliant with best prescribing guidelines. To date, a variety of interventions have been reported to address inappropriate prescribing and overuse of antibiotics but with mixed outcomes. This study aims to identify the impact of a set of sustainable, multimodal interventions in residential aged care targeting three common infection types. METHODS: This protocol details a 20-month stepped-wedge cluster-randomised trial conducted across 18 RACFs (as 18 clusters). A multimodal multi-disciplinary set of interventions, the AMS ENGAGEMENT bundle, will be tailored to meet the identified needs of participating RACFs. The key elements of the intervention bundle include education for nurses and general practitioners, telehealth support and formation of an antimicrobial stewardship team in each facility. Prior to the randomised sequential introduction of the intervention, each site will act as its own control in relation to usual care processes for antibiotic use and stewardship. The primary outcome for this study will be antibiotic consumption measured using defined daily doses ( Cluster-level rates will be calculated using total occupied bed numbers within each RACF during the observation period as the denominator. Results will be expressed as rates per 1000 occupied bed days. An economic analysis will be conducted to compare the costs associated with the intervention to that of usual care. A comprehensive process evaluation will be conducted using the REAIM Framework, to enable learnings from the trial to inform sustainable improvements in this field. DISCUSSION: A structured AMS model of care, incorporating targeted interventions to optimise antimicrobial use in the RACF setting, is urgently needed and will be delivered by our trial. The trial will aim to empower clinicians, residents and families by providing a robust AMS programme to improve antibiotic-related health outcomes.

Methods Patients admitted between April and August 2020 in the CEMETRON ICU were included in the study. Project approved by the Research Ethics Committee. For statistical analysis, the SPSS? program was used. Results 307 patients were admitted to the CEMETRON ICU. 81 (26.4%) non-COVID and 226 (73.6%) diagnosed with COVID. Among the 226 tested positive for COVID, 52.3% and 54.3% had, respectively, an increase in ALT and AST up to three times the upper limit of normal (40-120U/L). Non-COVID patients showed this increase in 20.8% for ALT and 33.3% for AST, being statistically significant (p: <0.005 for both).

Managing tinnitus is notoriously difficult, and access to evidence-based care is limited. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a tinnitus management strategy with the most evidence of effectiveness but is rarely offered to those distressed by tinnitus. The provision of internet-based CBT for tinnitus overcomes accessibility barriers; however, it is not currently readily available in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of internet-based CBT compared with that of weekly monitoring for the management of tinnitus in reducing tinnitus distress; reducing tinnitus-related comorbidities, including tinnitus cognitions, insomnia, anxiety, and depression; and assessing the stability of the intervention effects 2 months after the intervention. METHODS: A 2-arm randomized clinical trial comparing audiologist-guided internet-based CBT (n=79) to a weekly monitoring group (n=79) with a 2-month follow-up assessed the efficacy of internet-based CBT. Eligible participants included adults seeking help for tinnitus. Recruitment was conducted on the web using an open-access website. Participants were randomized via 1:1 allocation, but blinding was not possible. The study was undertaken by English or Spanish speakers on the web. The primary outcome was a change in tinnitus distress as measured using the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary outcome measures included anxiety, depression, insomnia, tinnitus cognition, hearing-related difficulties, and quality of life. RESULTS: Internet-based CBT led to a greater reduction in tinnitus distress (mean 36.57, SD 22) compared with that in weekly monitoring (mean 46.31, SD 20.63; effect size: Cohen d=0.46, 95% CI 0.14-0.77) using an intention-to-treat analysis. For the secondary outcomes, there was a greater reduction in negative tinnitus cognition and insomnia. The results remained stable over the 2-month follow-up period. No important adverse events were observed. Further, 16% (10/158) of participants withdrew, with low overall compliance rates for questionnaire completion of 72.3% (107/148) at T1, 61% (91/148) at T2, and 42% (62/148) at T3. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate and indicate the efficacy of audiologist-delivered internet-based CBT in reducing tinnitus distress in a US population. It was also the first study to offer internet-based CBT in Spanish to accommodate the large Hispanic population in the United States. The results have been encouraging, and further work is indicated in view of making such an intervention applicable to a wider population. Further work is required to improve compliance and attract more Spanish speakers.

Governments spent heavily to reduce poverty and strengthen their legitimacy. Yet, subsidies became financially unsustainable and donors pressed for reforms. This article assesses reform processes in Morocco, Egypt and Iran between 2010 and 2017, thus before sanctions against Iran were further tightened and before the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that even though the three countries had similar approaches to subsidisation, they have used distinct strategies to reduce subsidies and minimise social unrestwith the effect that their respective social contracts developed differently. Morocco tried to preserve its social contract as much as possible;it removed most subsidies, explained the need for reform, engaged in societal dialogue and implemented some compensatory measures, preserving most of its prevailing social contract. Egypt, in contrast, dismantled subsidy schemes more radically, without systematic information and consultation campaigns and offered limited compensation. By using repression and a narrative of collective security, the government transformed the social contract from a provision to a protection pact. Iran replaced subsidies with a more cost-efficient and egalitarian quasi-universal cash transfer scheme, paving the way to a more inclusive social contract. We conclude that the approach that governments used to reform subsidies transformed social contracts in fundamentally different ways and we hypothesize on the degree of intentionality of these differences.","output":"Subsidy Reform and the Transformation of Social Contracts: The Cases of Egypt, Iran and Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The media plays an important role in disseminating facts and knowledge to the public at critical times, and the COVID-19 pandemic is a good example of such a period. This research is devoted to performing a comparative analysis of the representation of topics connected with the pandemic in the internet media of Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. The main goal of the research is to propose a method that would make it possible to analyze the correlation between mass media dynamic indicators and the World Health Organization COVID-19 data. In order to solve the task, three approaches related to the representation of mass media dynamics in numerical formautomatically obtained topics, average sentiment, and dynamic indicatorswere proposed and applied according to a manually selected list of search queries. The results of the analysis indicate similarities and differences in the ways in which the epidemiological situation is reflected in publications in Russia and in Kazakhstan. In particular, the publication activity in both countries correlates with the absolute indicators, such as the daily number of new infections, and the daily number of deaths. However, mass media tend to ignore the positive rate of confirmed cases and the virus reproduction rate. If we consider strictness of quarantine measures, mass media in Russia show a rather high correlation, while in Kazakhstan, the correlation is much lower.

Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (TR-AMs) inhabit a unique niche marked by high oxygen and low glucose. We have recently shown that in contrast to bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), TR-AMs cannot utilize glycolysis and predominantly rely on mitochondrial function for their effector response. It is not known how changes in local oxygen concentration that occur during conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) might affect TR-AM metabolism and function; however, ARDS is associated with progressive loss of TR-AMs, which correlates with the severity of disease and mortality. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia robustly stabilizes HIF-1 in TR-AMs to promote a glycolytic phenotype. Hypoxia altered TR-AM metabolite signatures, cytokine production, and decreased their sensitivity to the inhibition of mitochondrial function. By contrast, hypoxia had minimal effects on BMDM metabolism. The effects of hypoxia on TR-AMs were mimicked by FG-4592, a HIF-1 stabilizer. Treatment with FG-4592 decreased TR-AM death and attenuated acute lung injury in mice.

Here we evaluated a panel of biomarkers to phenotype patients and to define the role of immuno-inflammatory mediators as biomarkers of severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 24 COVID-19 patients on admission to hospital, before any treatment or infusion of intravenous steroids or invasive ventilation. KL-6 IL-6 and C-peptide were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. IL-6 assay was validated for accuracy and precision. The validity of variables used to distinguish severe from mild-to-moderate patients was assessed by areas under curves (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and logistic regression was performed to combine parameters of the two groups. RESULTS: In the severe group, IL-6, CRP and KL-6 concentrations were significantly higher than in mild-to-moderate patients. KL-6, IL-6 and CRP concentrations were directly correlated with each other. ROC curve analysis of the logistic regression model including IL-6, KL-6 and CRP showed the best performance with an AUC of 0.95. CONCLUSIONS: Besides corroborating previous reports of over-expression of IL-6 in severe COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, analytical determination of other mediators showed that IL-6 concentrations were correlated with those of KL-6 and CRP.

Second, we conducted a productivity and impact comparison between the Colombian scientific elite and Nobel Prize laureates in science and economics by means of a stratified random sample 1990C2020 via the composite citation indicator proposed by Ioannidis et al. Findings showed that the Colombian scientific elite has a broader agenda than indexing titles in internationally renowned bibliographic databases.

In response to the COVID-19 epidemic in the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy) a software was developed to standardize data collection and facilitate surveillance of contacts and outbreaks and map the links between bases and contacts. In this paper, we present the results of contact tracing efforts during Phase I of the epidemic (March-April, 2020, mostly under lockdown), including sociodemographic characteristics of contacts who became cases and of the cases who infected one or more contact. Methods A contact tracing website was developed that included components for geolocation and linking of cases and contacts using open source software. Information on community-based confirmed and probable cases and their contacts was centralized on the website. Information on cases came directly from the central case database, information on contacts was collected by telephone interviews following a standard questionnaire. Contacts were followed via telephone, emails, or an app. Results The 2,812 laboratory-diagnosed community cases of COVID-19 had 6,690 community contacts, of whom 890 (13.3%) developed symptoms. Risk of developing symptomatic disease increased with age and was higher in workplace contacts than cohabitants or non-cohabiting family or friends. The greatest risk of transmission to contacts was found for the 14 cases <15 years of age (22.4%); 8 of the 14, who ranged in age from <1 to 11 years) infected 11 of 49 contacts. Overall, 606 outbreaks were identified, 74% of which consisted of only two cases. Discussion The open-source software program permitted the centralized tracking of contacts and rapid identification of links between cases. Workplace contacts were at higher risk of developing symptoms. Although childhood contacts were less likely to become cases, children were more likely to infect household members, perhaps because of the difficulty of successfully isolating children in household settings.","output":"Contact tracing during Phase I of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Province of Trento, Italy: key findings and recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate cerebral amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) changes during a single hemodialysis (HD) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who need maintenance HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 24 patients and 27 healthy subjects were included. The patients underwent neuropsychological tests and took twice resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) (before and after HD). Healthy group had one rs-fMRI. The zALFF based on rs-fMRI was calculated. Paired t and independent t test was applied to compare zALFF among groups. The associations between zALFF and duration of HD, ultrafiltration volume, and neuropsychological tests was calculated by partial correlation. RESULTS: Compared to healthy group, patients before HD showed significant worse performances on digit symbol test (DST) and serial dotting test (SDT). Patients after HD performed DST better than before HD. The patients after HD showed higher zALFF in left putamen than before HD. Multiple regions of both HD groups showed significant lower zALFF than healthy group. The zALFF of left putamen of patients after HD was significant negative correlated with the ultrafiltration volume (Ra?= -0.679). The zALFF in patients before HD exhibited significantly positive or negative correlations with DST and SDT in multiple regions. The zALFF of patients after HD significantly negative correlated with DST in right temporal, positive and negative correlated with ultrafiltration volume in right frontal, left putamen respectively. CONCLUSION: ESRD patients showed changed spontaneous brain activity and cognitive impairments. After a single HD session, patients performed better in neuropsychological test, and spontaneous brain activity changed in left putamen.

Comparisons were made between the COVID-19 period (between January 2020 and June 2020) and control period (between January 2019 and June 2019) in Guangdong province. We used the negative binomial models to explore the associations of deaths during the COVID-19 period, according to the different sex and age strata. RESULTS: The all-cause injury mortality in Guangdong province decreased significantly from 28.65 per 100 000 population during the control period to 23.24 per 100 000 population during COVID-19 pandemic period. Similar results were found in specific injury categories. Mortality of self-harm increased by 139.26% in the 10-14 year group during the COVID-19 period as compared with the control period. Although mortality changes in some groups were not statistically significant, some increases were noteworthy during the COVID-19 period (ie, self-harm, transport injury and falls) in the 70-79 year group. The corresponding increase in mortality rate was 16.83%, 3.32% and 4.92%, respectively.

Circular inference is one such possible impairment, in which excitation-to-inhibition imbalances in the cerebral cortex cause the reverberation and amplification of prior beliefs and sensory information. Recent empirical work has associated circular inference with the clinical dimensions of schizophrenia. Inhibition impairments have also been observed in autism, suggesting that signal reverberation might be present in that condition as well. In this study, we collected data from 21 participants with self-reported diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders and 155 participants with a broad range of autistic traits in an online probabilistic decision-making task (the fisher task). We used previously established Bayesian models to investigate possible associations between autistic traits or autism and circular inference. There was no correlation between prior or likelihood reverberation and autistic traits across the whole sample. Similarly, no differences in any of the circular inference model parameters were found between autistic participants and those with no diagnosis. Furthermore, participants incorporated information from both priors and likelihoods in their decisions, with no relationship between their weights and psychiatric traits, contrary to what common theories for both autism and schizophrenia would suggest. These findings suggest that there is no increased signal reverberation in autism, despite the known presence of excitation-to-inhibition imbalances.

With this method, we have identified a cluster of genes responsible for SARS-CoV-2-fibrosis including its entry receptor ACE2 and epidermal growth factor EGF. Then, we developed Vi-Fi scoring-a novel drug repurposing approach and simultaneously quantified antiviral and antifibrotic activities of the drugs based on their transcriptomic signatures. We revealed the strong dual antifibrotic and antiviral activity of EGFR/ErbB inhibitors. Before the in vitro validation, we have clustered 277 cell lines and revealed distinct COVID-19 transcriptomic signatures of the cells with similar phenotypes that defines their suitability for COVID-19 research. By ERK activity monitoring in living lung cells, we show that the drugs with predicted antifibrotic activity downregulate ERK in the host lung cells. Overall, our study provides novel insights on SARS-CoV-2 dependence on EGFR/ERK signaling and demonstrates the utility of EGFR/ErbB inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Viral fibrotic scoring and drug screen based on MAPK activity uncovers EGFR as a key regulator of COVID-19 fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TB Prevalence Influence on Covid-19 Mortality Tareef Fadhil Raham Consultant Pediatrician; DCH and Arabic Board; MOH - Iraq tareeffadhil@yahoo.com (00964)7901584338 Background : TB latent infection reflected as TB prevalence might give heterogeneous immunity for infection in mechanism like what happen in BCG This study the first to our knowledge, addressing TB prevalence influence and possibly an important predictor for Covid-19 mortality and its findings may help to satisfy world inquiries about diversities dilemma.

Background: The corona pandemic, caused by the novel viral disease COVID-19, has led to excessive strain in health professionals whose general occupational situation in itself is associated with high levels of stress. So far, there is no quantitative data on the stress experience caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in German health professionals and on the consequences of this experience for their commitment to work. METHOD: With a cross-sectional design, German health professionals were asked about their stress experience, health concerns and work commitment. The snapshot survey used self-developed questions plus items of a validated scale measuring work engagement. A convenience sample of health professionals was recruited through social media. The E-Survey reached 1168 valid cases, the majority of which were nurses (80.4 %, n = 855). RESULTS: The evaluation shows that health professionals in direct contact with COVID-19 patients show higher stress levels than participants with no contact and that their main concern is about the health of relatives, friends and family. In addition, it was found that the participants' work commitment decreased parallel to the increase in pandemic-related stress. DISCUSSION: The study shows significant correlations between work demands, stress experience and work engagement. In contrast to earlier studies, the results for work engagement in the sample are relatively low. There is a growing number of international recommendations for reducing work-related stress factors in a pandemic which should now be implemented in Germany on a large scale.

Potentially, reduced out-of-home mobility and lower activity levels among older people may lower their quality of life (QOL). We studied cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of and changes in life-space mobility, active ageing and QOL during COVID-19 social distancing compared to two years before. METHODS: Altogether 809 community-living participants initially aged 75, 80 or 85 years of our active aging study (AGNES) conducted in 2017-2018 took part in the current AGNES-COVID-19 survey in May and June 2020. Outdoor mobility was assessed with the Life-Space Assessment (range 0-120). Active approach to life was assessed with the University of Jyv?skyl? Active Aging Scale (range 0C272), and QOL with the shortened Older Peoples Quality of Life Questionnaire (range13-65; higher scores better for all). Data were analyzed with General Estimating Equations, General Linear Models, and Oneway-ANOVA. RESULTS: Life-space mobility (B -10.8, SE 0.75, p<0.001), the active ageing score (B -24.1, SE 0.88, p<0.001) and the QOL score (B -1.65, SE 0.21, p<0.001) were lower during COVID-19 social distancing vs. two years before. Concurrent life-space mobility and active ageing scores, age and sex explained 48% of QOL at the baseline and 42% during social distancing.

We conduct a multimodal critical discourse analysis of two prominent memes - juxtaposing a 'top-down' process of meme selection and distribution (the sharing of 'The Kung-Flu Kid' meme on Instagram by Donald Trump Jr) with a 'bottom-up' process (the 'Corona-chan' meme that originated on the website 4chan). We situate our study in a growing literature on politicized memes, challenging an emerging consensus that lauds 'bottom-up' memes as a democratizing force enabling resistance to hegemony, inequality and injustice. While we do not reject this characterization outright, we add nuance, showing that racialized memetic discourses around COVID-19 were propagated both from the top-down and from the bottom up. We conclude that memes are particularly powerful communicative tools in racialized discourse because their use of polysemy, humour and cultural reference allows them to subvert the mechanisms that sanction openly racist statements.","output":"COVID-19 and viral anti-Asian racism: A multimodal critical discourse analysis of memes and the racialization of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Among numerous changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most yoga classes have repositioned online.

In this background, liner companies now face the challenge to find suitable sulfur reduction technologies, make reasonable decisions on fleet renewal, and prepare stable operation plans under the highly uncertain shipping market. Considering three sulfur reduction technologies, namely, fuel-switching, scrubber, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) dual-fuel engine, this paper develops a robust optimization model based on two-stage stochastic linear programming (SLP) to formulate a decision plan for container fleet, which can deal with various uncertainties in future: freight demand, ship charter rate, fuel price, retrofit time and Sulfur Emission Control Area (SECA) ratio. The main decision contents include ship acquisition, ship retrofit, ship sale, ship charter, route assignment, and speed optimization. The effectiveness of our plan was verified through a case study on two liner routes from the Far East to Northwest America, operated by COSCO Shipping Lines. The results from SLP model show that large-capacity fuel-switching ships and their LNG dual-fuel engine retrofits should be included in the long-term investment and operation plan; slow-steaming is an important operational decision for ocean liner shipping; if the current SECA boundary is not further expanded or the sulfur emission restrictions not further tightened, the scrubber ship will have no advantage in investment cost and operation. However, considering the probabilities of more flexible scenarios, the results from the robust model suggest that it is beneficial to install scrubber on medium-capacity fuel-switching ships, and carry out more LNG dual-fuel engine retrofits for large-capacity fuel-switching ships. Compared with SLP, this robust strategy greatly reduces sulfur emissions while slightly pushing up carbon emissions.","output":"Container fleet renewal considering multiple sulfur reduction technologies and uncertain markets amidst COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral infections are a leading cause of disease and mortality.

The main known transmission route of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 is through respiratory air droplets. Although recent studies have revealed that the virus is detectable in the throat, blood, urine, anal swabs, tears and even faeces; however, modes of transmission other than respiratory droplets has not been studied much. Knowledge on the presence of the virus in the female genital tract may help determine the risk of sexual transmission as well as the risk of mother-to-child transmission. However, not much data are available yet regarding the presence of the virus in the female genital system. Hence, to explore the presence of the virus in the female genital system and possibility of sexual transmission, a study was conducted where in we tried to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 in cervico-vaginal secretions. METHODS: From July 2020 to September 2020, 35 COVID-19-positive female patients admitted to tertiary care teaching institute of Eastern India, which is now declared dedicated Corona Hospital and Centre of Excellence for COVID-19 care, who consented for the research were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Proper gynaecological history, clinical records along with laboratory findings of the patient was recorded. The possibility of the sexual transmission of the virus from female to her male partner was to be ascertained by testing the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 in the vaginal, cervical secretions by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All 35 COVID-19-positive female patients were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 in their vaginal and cervical secretions by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.

The sequence of the 3 methods will be randomized, with each participant exposed to each method approximately 1 week apart. Acceptability and the preferred 24HR method will be assessed using a questionnaire. Estimates of energy, nutrient, and food group intake and portion sizes from each 24HR method will be compared with the observed intake for each day. Linear mixed models will be used, with 24HR method and method order as fixed effects, to assess differences in the 24HR methods. Reporting bias will be assessed by examining the ratios of reported 24HR intake to observed intake.

Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging is an emerging molecular MRI technique that can detect various metabolites and proteins in vivo. However, the role of CEST imaging for TSC-associated epilepsy has not been assessed. Here, we aim to investigate the feasibility of applying CEST imaging to TSC-associated epilepsy, optimize the CEST acquisition parameters, and provide an analysis method for exploring the dominant molecular contributors to the CEST signal measured. Nine TSC epilepsy patients were scanned on a 3-T MRI system. The CEST saturation frequencies were swept from -6 to 6 ppm with 12 different combinations of saturation power (4, 3, 2 and 1 T) and duration (1000, 700 and 400 ms). Furthermore, a two-stage simulation method based on the seven-pool Bloch-McConnell model was proposed to assess the contribution of each exchangeable pool to the CEST signal in normal-appearing white matter and cortical tubers, which avoided the complexity and uncertainty of full Bloch-McConnell fitting. The results showed that under the optimal saturation duration of 1000 ms, the greatest contrast between tubers and normal tissues occurred around 3, 2.5, 1.75 and 3.5 ppm for B1 of 4, 3, 2 and 1 T, respectively. At the optimal frequency offsets, the CEST values of tubers were significantly higher than those in the normal brain tissues (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the two-stage analysis suggested that the amine pool played a dominant role in yielding the contrast between cortical tubers and normal tissues. These results indicate that CEST MRI may serve as a potentially useful tool for identifying tubers in TSC, and the two-stage analysis method may provide a route for investigating the molecular contributions to the CEST contrast in biological tissues.","output":"Chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging for epilepsy secondary to tuberous sclerosis complex at 3 T: Optimization and analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) has been recognized as a prospective target for the development of novel cancer therapeutics.

PURPOSE: A case of uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management in a pediatric patient with a ventricular assist device awaiting a heart transplant is reported. SUMMARY: A 4-month-old male in heart failure was experiencing uncontrolled hypertension. Because of a lack of hemodynamic stability, he was unable to be listed as a heart transplant candidate. He received multiple antihypertensive agents (calcium channel blockers, ?-blockers, and direct-acting vasodilators) as both intermittent and continuous infusions over the course of several days without achieving normotension. The decision was then made to administer intravenous phentolamine as a continuous infusion to pursue a different mechanism than with traditional antihypertensive agents to achieve hemodynamic stability. Within 8 hours of initiation of the continuous phentolamine infusion, the patient became normotensive and was listed for a heart transplant. The continuous phentolamine infusion was administered over the next 4 days to maintain normotension, and on day 4 the patient underwent successful orthotopic heart transplantation. CONCLUSION: A 4-month-old male in heart failure with a ventricular assist device, experiencing uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management, was successfully treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of phentolamine.","output":"Phentolamine continuous infusion in a pediatric patient with uncontrolled hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is responsible for increased demand for care and patient mortality, resulting in emotional and physical stress for healthcare workers (HCWs).

The approach addresses conceptual, epistemological, and social domains of knowledge, and places emphasis on the epistemological conversations about data acquisitions and transformations in the sciences. The steps of data transformation, which we refer to as data-texts, we argue, unfold the processes of using evidence during knowledge building and reveal the dynamics of scientific practices. Data-texts involve (a) obtaining observations/measurements to become data; (b) selecting and interpreting data to become evidence; (c) using evidence to ascertain patterns and develop models; and (d) utilizing the patterns and models to propose and refine explanations. Throughout the transformations of the EE continuum, there are stages of transition that foster the engagement of learners in negotiations of meaning and collective construction of knowledge. A focus on the EE continuum facilitates the emergence of further insights, both by questioning the nature of the data and its multiple possibilities for change and representations and by reflecting on the nature of the explanations. The shift of emphasis to the epistemics of science holds implications for the design of learning environments that support learners in developing contemporary understandings of the nature and processes of scientific practices.","output":"Data-Texts in the Sciences: The Evidence-Explanation Continuum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe five cases of severe necrotizing vasculitis following the RNA-based vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), including four relapsing anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) vasculitis, 27 days (1C60) after vaccination and one patient with quiescent chronic hepatitis B and de novo polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) 21 days after vaccination.

To the best of our knowledge, there is not any embracing published review about the use of psychotropic drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-systematic literature review. A search in the PubMed database was performed, with the terms 'psychotropic drugs', 'COVID-19', 'psychiatry' and 'pandemic'. Consensus and clinical guidelines about psychotropic drugs and COVID-19 approach, published by scientific societies, governmental entities and drug regulatory agencies were included. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We present the recommendations about the use of psychotropic drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the outpatient and inpatient settings. The treatment of affective bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have now added increased difficulties. Some psychotropic drugs interfere with the pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus infection and they could interact with the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. Some patients will need pharmacological interventions due to the presence of delirium. Smoking cessation changes the serum levels of some psychotropic drugs and may influence their use. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in clinical practice. Psychiatric patients are a vulnerable population and often a careful clinical, laboratorial and electrocardiographic evaluation may be needed, particularly in those diagnosed with COVID-19. The regular treatment of mentally ill patients with COVID-19 presents increased complexity.","output":"Recomendaes sobre a Utilizao de Frmacos Psicotrpicos durante a Pandemia COVID-19./ [Recommendations about the Use of Psychotropic Medications during the COVID-19 Pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as its common causes (e.g., diabetes and obesity), are recognized risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. To explore whether the most common inherited cause of CKD, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), is also an independent risk factor, we studied data from the VA health system and the VA COVID-19-shared resources (e.g., ICD codes, demographics, pre-existing conditions, pre-testing symptoms, and post-testing outcomes). Among 61 COVID-19-positive ADPKD patients, 21 (34.4%) were hospitalized, 10 (16.4%) were admitted to ICU, 4 (6.6%) required ventilator, and 4 (6.6%) died by August 18, 2020. These rates were comparable to patients with other cystic kidney diseases and cystic liver-only diseases. ADPKD was not a significant risk factor for any of the four outcomes in multivariable logistic regression analyses when compared with other cystic kidney diseases and cystic liver-only diseases. In contrast, diabetes was a significant risk factor for hospitalization [OR 2.30 (1.61, 3.30), p<0.001], ICU admission [OR 2.23 (1.47, 3.42), p<0.001], and ventilator requirement [OR 2.20 (1.27, 3.88), p=0.005]. Black race significantly increased the risk for ventilator requirement [OR 2.00 (1.18, 3.44), p=0.011] and mortality [OR 1.60 (1.02, 2.51), p=0.040]. We also examined the outcome of starting dialysis after COVID-19 confirmation. The main risk factor for starting dialysis was CKD [OR 6.37 (2.43, 16.7)] and Black race [OR 3.47 (1.48, 8.1)]. After controlling for CKD, ADPKD did not significantly increase the risk for newly starting dialysis comparing with other cystic kidney diseases and cystic liver-only diseases.

Materials and Methods Active components of Yishen Capsule were obtained using database such as TCMSP and TCMID. UniProt protein database was used to screen and standardize the human-derived targets of the active chemical components. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) targets were obtained from databases such as GeneCards, OMIM, TTD, DisGeNET and DrugBank. A network of \\"Yishen Capsule Components-diabetic nephropathy Targets-Pathways\\" was constructed by analyzing data above to screening out core targets for molecular docking verification. DN is induced by streptozocin in rats after left nephrectomy. Renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) was isolated and cultured under high glucose conditions. Based on these experimental models, key pathway target genes screened by network pharmacology were verified both in vitro and in vivo. Results The main active components of Yishen Capsule in the treatment of DN include quercetin, kaempferol, gallic acid, astragaloside IV, etc. Some key targets (such as AR, AKT1, TP53, ESR1, JUN) and important signal pathways (such as AGE-RAGE, HIF-1 and JAK-STAT signal pathway) were included in the treatment of DN with Yishen Capsule. Molecular docking assay showed that most of the targets have good binding activity with the components of Yishen Capsule. Based on the results of network pharmacology, key target proteins in HIF-1 and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways were selected for experimental verification. Results presented that HIF-1, JAK2, STAT3, TGF- and MCP-1 were increased under high glucose environment. With the treatment of Yishen Capsule, the expression of HIF-1 further increased, while the expression of JAK2, STAT3, MCP-1 and TGF- was decreased. Conclusion This study revealed the mechanism of Yishen Capsule in the treatment of DN, which possesses the characteristics of multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway. Further experiments confirmed that Yishen Capsule interfered with HIF-1 and JAK/STAT signaling pathways to reduce inflammation and fibrosis damage in the kidney tissue of rats with diabetic nephropathy.","output":"Potential Molecular Mechanism of Yishen Capsule in the Treatment of Diabetic Nephropathy Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has emerged as a new threat, not only to Health Care systems but also to citizen's freedom of movement in many developed countries Case summary: We report a suicidal attempt in a destination therapy left ventricular assist device patient, potentially triggered by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown, highlighting the importance of regular and long-term psychological support for this vulnerable population Discussion: The psychological consequences of this pandemic, particularly in chronically ill patients, are yet to be defined","output":"A suicide attempt on a left ventricular assist device patient during COVID-19 pandemic: can we only blame the virus?

Identified strategies included early recognition of the threat and rapid activation of national response protocols led by national leadership; rapid establishment of diagnostic capacity; scale-up of measures for preventing community transmission; and redesigning the triage and treatment systems, mobilizing the necessary resources for clinical care. Facilitators included existing hospital capacity, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak, and strong national leadership despite political changes and population sensitization due to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic. Challenges included sustaining adequate human resources and supplies in high-caseload areas. Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.

Extracts from leaves of the Syzygium jambos (L.) Alston (S. jambos) trees have been proposed to treat cardiovascular diseases and diabetes through unclear mechanisms. We investigated the effects of the S. jambos extract on biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and immune responses in the human endothelial cell line, EA.hy926. METHODS: Leaves of S. jambos were collected, concocted and lyophilized. To study the effects of S. jambos on endothelial cell activation, we used the human endothelial cell line. IL-6 levels were measured using qPCR and ELISA. PDI activity was measured using Insulin Turbidity and Di-E-GSSG assays. CM-H2DCFDA was used to study ROS levels. Migration assay was used to study S. jambos effect on ex vivo human polymorphonuclear and human mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Our results show that incubation of EA.hy926 cells with ET-1 led to a 6.5  1.6 fold increase in IL-6 expression by qPCR, an event that was blocked by S. jambos. Also, we observed that ET-1 increased extracellular protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) activity that was likewise dose-dependently blocked by S. jambos (IC(50) = 14 g/mL). Consistent with these observations, ET-1 stimulated ex vivo human polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell migration that also was dose-dependently blocked by S. jambos. In addition, ET-1 stimulation led to significant increases in ROS production that were sensitive to S. jambos. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the S. jambos extract represents a novel cardiovascular protective pharmacological approach to regulate endothelial cell activation, IL-6 expression, and immune-cell responses.

METHODS: In 2013, five focus groups were conducted with Australian Chinese VFR travellers, exploring topics such as vaccines, face masks, outbreaks and travel health seeking behaviour. Participants were aged 18 years or older and had travelled to China for VFR purposes in the preceding 18 months. Sessions were recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Participants viewed VFR travel as low risk, and underestimated the risks associated with travelling during an outbreak. However, they were generally willing to receive pre-travel vaccination specifically for an outbreak, but not otherwise. Attitudes towards face masks and other infection control measures were mixed. Multiple factors influenced their travel health behaviour, including low risk awareness, misconceptions, and cultural barriers to seeking health care. CONCLUSION: Our research found that Chinese VFR travellers undertake suboptimal precautions related to VFR travel, associated with an underestimation of risks. While they share many characteristics with other VFR travellers, unique cultural health beliefs should be taken into account when developing risk communication and educational interventions as part of a pandemic response.","output":"Travel health seeking behaviours, masks, vaccines and outbreak awareness of Australian Chinese travellers visiting friends and relatives - Implications for control of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND 3C-like protease also called the main protease is an essential enzyme for the completion of the life cycle of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide updated prevalence estimates for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, benefitting from the inclusion of studies published in Chinese. METHODS: Systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar and the Chinese databases SinoMed, WanfangMed, CNKI and CQVIP, for studies conducted between December 2019 and August 2020 on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies published in both English and Chinese were included. RESULTS: Data on the prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD was pooled across 65 studies involving 97,333 health care workers across 21 countries. The pooled prevalence of depression was 21.7% (95% CI, 18.3%-25.2%), of anxiety 22.1% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.3%), and of PTSD 21.5% (95% CI, 10.5%-34.9%). Prevalence estimates are also provided for a mild classification of each disorder. Pooled prevalence estimates of depression and anxiety were highest in studies conducted in the Middle-East (34.6%; 28.9%). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted across covariates, including sampling method and outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis has identified a high prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The purpose of this study was to determine the precision and accuracy of intraoperative LLD and CO measurement with express workflow robotic THA. METHODS: Between February 2018 and December 2019, 30 patients underwent an express workflow robot-assisted primary THA for intraoperative LLD and CO measurements. Postoperative radiographs were used for LLD and CO measurement. In order to examine the accuracy of the robotic system assessment, the absolute difference between the robotic assessments and radiographic evaluations was calculated. RESULTS: Intraoperative robotic measurements reported a mean error of 0.2-0.6 mm for each registration, with no significant difference between them (p = 0.311). The average absolute discrepancies between the robotic and radiographic assessments in the LLD and CO measurements were 1.3  1.5 mm (p = 0.17) and 1.1  0.9 mm (p = 0.11), respectively, while the Pearson's correlation coefficients were 0.69 and 0.71. CONCLUSIONS: An external marker without a femoral array inserted into a screw positioned in the greater trochanter would be an easier and faster method to measure LLD and CO.

The study aimed to estimate the risk of exposure for COVID-19 across various workplace settings in the State of Qatar. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing surveillance data of all workplaces with ten or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. These workplaces were categorized using a mapping table adapted from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 2017 version. The data was then analyzed to estimate and compare the positivity rate as an indicator of the risk of developing COVID-19 infection across various workplace settings in the State of Qatar. ResultsThe highest positivity rate was reported amongst the Construction (40.3%) and the Retail & Wholesale Trade sectors (40.3%) whereas, the lowest positivity rate was attributed to the healthcare workplace setting (11.0%). The private funded sector employees had higher positivity rates than employees of the governmental funded sector. ConclusionThe elevated risk of infection amongst screened workers in Construction and Retail & Wholesale Trade was probably due to Environmental and Educational vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the better containment within healthcare workplace settings can be attributed to the enforcement of infection control and occupational safety measures. These findings underline the importance of appropriately using preventive and surveillance strategies for high-risk workplace settings to mitigate the risk of infection.","output":"COVID-19 Infection Across Workplace Settings in Qatar, a Comparison of COVID-19 Positivity Rates of Screened Workers From March 1st Until July 28th, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess patients Quality of life (QoL) and the burden of their caregivers during Covid-19 pandemic and specifically the impact of two-month lockdown period. Methods: In April 2020, a total of 60 patients and 59 caregivers were administered by phone scales assessing patients' QoL (McGill QoL Questionnaire), general health status (EQ-5D-5L), and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview). The administration was repeated one month after the end of lockdown measures, with the addition of a qualitative questionnaire (COVID-QoL Questionnaire) exploring family reorganization and personal perception of lock down. Results: QoL and perceived health status did not worsen during lockdown, while caregiver burden increased (p = 0.01). Patient's QoL and caregiver burden were inversely correlated at T1 (ZBI total score mildly correlated with Mc Gill existential subscore, p = 0.02, rho = 0.30 and with Mc Gill total score, p = 0.05, rho = 0.265). No significant correlations were found at T2. According to the COVID-QoL questionnaire, caregivers perceived lower family help compared to patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Restricted measures of lockdown period during COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a significant reduction of QoL in our cohort of ALS patients, while caregiver burden significantly increased.

However, the optimal duration of ECMO support and time to lung recovery remain unknown. Description: A 48-year-old Hispanic male without significant past medical history was transferred to a tertiary care high-volume ECMO center on mechanical ventilation after 11 days of progressive shortness of breath due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was transferred heavily sedated, paralyzed, in the prone position, and with lung protective mechanical ventilation settings of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight, tidal volume of 350cc, positive end-expiratory pressure of 14 cm H2O, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 100%. His driving and plateau pressures were 13 and 27 cm H2O, respectively. Three days after intubation, his PO2/FiO2 ratio repeatedly dropped below 80 and he was placed on Vf -Vj ECMO for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). During his ICU course, the patient received adjunctive therapies, including Remdesivir and Dexamethasone. He was extremely encephalopathic, resulting in a failed trial of extubation and requiring tracheostomy placement 14 days after intubation. His ECMO run was complicated by oxygenator failure and emergent exchange of ECMO circuit despite anticoagulation with bivalirudin. His course was complicated by superimposed Enterobacter pneumonia and he was treated with antibiotics. After 38 days of VV ECMO support, he showed improvement in compliance and gas exchange, indicating lung recovery. The patient was weaned successfully from ECMO and remained on mechanical ventilation for almost 30 days after decannulation. The ICU team carried out aggressive physical therapy, the patient was weaned off mechanical ventilation, his tracheostomy was decannulated, and he was discharged on 2L O2. CT at the time of discharge showed improved aeration of both lungs with residual lung fibrosis and bronchiectasis (Figure 1). Discussion: ARDS remains the most common indication for long-term ECMO support, which is frequently complicated by severe deconditioning, secondary infection, and vascular complications. In a stratified analysis of 127 patients who received ECMO support for respiratory failure, patient survival was 52% after being on ECMO for more than 20 days.1 Despite multiple complications, including superimposed infection and oxygenator failure, our patient showed recovery from his ARDS. He was eventually extubated and discharged from the hospital, indicating ECMO as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.

It is considered the most common pediatric cancerous brain tumor. Precise and timely diagnosis of pediatric MB and its four subtypes (defined by the World Health Organization (WHO)) is essential to decide the appropriate follow-up plan and suitable treatments to prevent its progression and reduce mortality rates. Histopathology is the gold standard modality for the diagnosis of MB and its subtypes, but manual diagnosis via a pathologist is very complicated, needs excessive time, and is subjective to the pathologists expertise and skills, which may lead to variability in the diagnosis or misdiagnosis. The main purpose of the paper is to propose a time-efficient and reliable computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), namely MB-AI-His, for the automatic diagnosis of pediatric MB and its subtypes from histopathological images. The main challenge in this work is the lack of datasets available for the diagnosis of pediatric MB and its four subtypes and the limited related work. Related studies are based on either textural analysis or deep learning (DL) feature extraction methods. These studies used individual features to perform the classification task. However, MB-AI-His combines the benefits of DL techniques and textural analysis feature extraction methods through a cascaded manner. First, it uses three DL convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including DenseNet-201, MobileNet, and ResNet-50 CNNs to extract spatial DL features. Next, it extracts time-frequency features from the spatial DL features based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which is a textural analysis method. Finally, MB-AI-His fuses the three spatial-time-frequency features generated from the three CNNs and DWT using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and principal component analysis (PCA) to produce a time-efficient CADx system. MB-AI-His merges the privileges of different CNN architectures. MB-AI-His has a binary classification level for classifying among normal and abnormal MB images, and a multi-classification level to classify among the four subtypes of MB. The results of MB-AI-His show that it is accurate and reliable for both the binary and multi-class classification levels. It is also a time-efficient system as both the PCA and DCT methods have efficiently reduced the training execution time. The performance of MB-AI-His is compared with related CADx systems, and the comparison verified the powerfulness of MB-AI-His and its outperforming results. Therefore, it can support pathologists in the accurate and reliable diagnosis of MB and its subtypes from histopathological images. It can also reduce the time and cost of the diagnosis procedure which will correspondingly lead to lower death rates.","output":"MB-AI-His: Histopathological Diagnosis of Pediatric Medulloblastoma and its Subtypes via AI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a rare, life-threatening complication of Kawasaki disease (KD). Early recognition and treatment of MAS are very important, but sometimes it is difficult to distinguish MAS from a severe form of KD. DATA SOURCES A PubMed search was performed in Clinical Queries using the key terms \\"macrophage activation syndrome or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)\\" and \\"Kawasaki disease\\". RESULTS KD patients with MAS show high intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance and coronary complications. Mortality is also as high as MAS in other diseases. Persistent fever greater than 10 days is highly associated with development of MAS in KD. Splenomegaly is observed in more than two-thirds of KD patients with MAS. Thrombocytopenia is often the earliest laboratory finding of MAS. Hyperferritinemia is highly specific and sensitive for detecting MAS in KD; so, ferritin levels should be checked if there are unexplained clinical exacerbations in KD patients. Given the under-recognition of MAS in KD, it is prudent to consider resistant KD as occult/subclinical MAS. Many KD patients with MAS have good outcomes on immune modulators. However, if KD patients fulfill the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, they may undergo longer and more intensive treatment than needed. CONCLUSIONS The possible existence of MAS should be taken into account when a KD patient shows persistent fever, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, or IVIG resistance. The under-diagnosis of MAS in patients with KD is an important issue to be addressed.

The program components are: protocol-based hypertension treatment using a standardized algorithm; team-based collaborative care; health provider education; health coaching sessions; home blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure audit; and feedback. METHODS: Using a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation design, we will evaluate clinical and implementation outcomes of the multicomponent program in Guatemala over an 18-month period. Through a cluster randomized trial, we will randomly assign 18 health districts to the intervention arm and 18 to enhanced usual care across five departments, enrolling 44 participants per health district and 1584 participants in total. The clinical outcomes are (1) the difference in the proportion of patients with controlled hypertension (< 130/80 mmHg) between the intervention and control groups at 18 months and (2) the net change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline to 18 months.

For these reasons it represents the prime target for Covid-19 vaccines. In recent months, variants of this protein have started to emerge. Their ability to reduce or evade recognition by S-targeting antibodies poses a threat to immunological treatments and raises concerns for their consequences on vaccine efficacy. To develop a model able to predict the potential impact of S-protein mutations on antibody binding sites, we performed unbiased multi-microsecond molecular dynamics of several glycosylated S-protein variants and applied a straightforward structure-dynamics-energy based strategy to predict potential changes in immunogenic regions on each variant. We recover known epitopes on the reference D614G sequence. By comparing our results, obtained on isolated S-proteins in solution, to recently published data on antibody binding and reactivity in new S variants, we directly show that modifications in the S-protein consistently translate into the loss of potentially immunoreactive regions. Our findings can thus be qualitatively reconnected to the experimentally characterized decreased ability of some of the Abs elicited against the dominant S-sequence to recognize variants. While based on the study of SARS-CoV-2 spike variants, our computational epitope-prediction strategy is portable and could be applied to study immunoreactivity in mutants of proteins of interest whose structures have been characterized, helping the development/selection of vaccines and antibodies able to control emerging variants.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Mutations and Escape from Antibodies: A Computational Model of Epitope Loss in Variants of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work aimed to formulate intranasal insulin fast-dissolving films for treatment of anosmia in patients post COVID-19 infection.

Objective: This study explores the impact of COVID-19, how frequent lockdown, and online learning have affected the mental health of the students of medical college. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the medical students of Karachi, in September 2021, in Jinnah Medical and Dental College. A total of 312 medical students were enrolled in the study. Out of which 208 were females and 104 were males. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to assess the mental health of students of medical college. Results: The results of the study revealed that a total of 312 medical students were enrolled in the study;belonging to the age group of (18-25) years. Approximately 104 (66 %) of female students experienced depression, 44 (21%) anxiety, and 60 (28%) stress. Hence gender and year of study of the participants were found to be significant (p-value<0.05). The odds of first-year students showed high levels of anxiety as compared to final-year students (OR = 1.679, 95% CI [1.202-2.634], P = 0.002).

This information would be beneficial to adequately reorganize outpatient clinics and hospitals to provide the highest possible level of orthopaedic care to our patients in a safe and efficient manner. METHODS: A literature search was performed for relevant research articles. In addition, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the EU CDC and other government health agency websites were searched for any relevant information. In particular, interest was paid to strategies and advise on managing the orthopaedic patient flow during outpatient clinics as well as surgical procedures including the necessary safety measures, while still providing a high-quality patient experience. The obtained information is provided as a narrative review. RESULTS: There was not any specific literature concerning the organization of an outpatient clinic and surgical activities and the particular challenges in dealing with a high-volume practice, in the afterwave of a pandemic. CONCLUSION: As the COVID-19 crisis has abruptly halted most of the orthopaedic activities both in the outpatient clinic and the operating room, a progressive start-up scenario needs to be planned. The exact timing largely depends on factors outside of our control. After restrictions will be lifted, clinical and surgical volume will progressively increase.

There are few data on human coronavirus infections among individuals living with HIV. In this study we probed the role of pneumococcal coinfections with seasonal CoVs among children living with and without HIV hospitalized for pneumonia. We also described the prevalence and clinical manifestations of these infections. A total of 39,836 children who participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of a 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV9) were followed for lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations until 2 years of age. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected at the time of hospitalization and were screened by PCR for four seasonal CoVs. The frequency of CoV-associated pneumonia was higher in children living with HIV (19.9%) than in those without HIV (7.6%, P < 0.001). Serial CoV infections were detected in children living with HIV. The case fatality risk among children with CoV-associated pneumonia was higher in those living with HIV (30.4%) than without HIV (2.9%, P = 0.001). C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were elevated in 36.8% (&#8805;40 mg/liter) and 64.7% (&#8805;0.5 ng/ml), respectively, of the fatal cases living with HIV. Among children without HIV, there was a 64.0% (95% CI: 22.9% to 83.2%) lower incidence of CoV-associated pneumonia hospitalizations among PCV9 recipients compared to placebo recipients. These data suggest that Streptococcus pneumoniae infections might have a role in the development of pneumonia associated with endemic CoVs, that PCV may prevent pediatric CoV-associated hospitalization, and that children living with HIV with CoV infections develop more severe outcomes.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 may cause severe hospitalization, but little is known about the role of secondary bacterial infection in these severe cases, beyond the observation of high levels of reported inflammatory markers, associated with bacterial infection, such as procalcitonin. We did a secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized trial of PCV to examine its impact on human CoV infections before the pandemic. We found that both children living with and without HIV randomized to receive PCV had evidence of less hospitalization due to seasonal CoV, suggesting that pneumococcal coinfection may play a role in severe hospitalized CoV infections.","output":"Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Protection against Coronavirus-Associated Pneumonia Hospitalization in Children Living with and without HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of voids in tall buildings on the surrounding wind environment. With the development of modular technology, there has been a new method of building high-rise buildings. Currently, more and more high-rise buildings often use void spaces to reduce the wind resistance and utilize wind turbines by using wind power to create sky gardens. In this study, CFD (computer fluid dynamic) technology was used to simulate the wind environment around the buildings. The research focuses on the size, distribution and quantity of the concavity, which usually is defined as sky gardens. It is found that when the area of the opening is the same, the more number of opening, the more strengthened and distributed vertical wind velocity behind the building can be. The wind shadow area at the pedestrian height is further reduced. For holes distribution, the optimum ratio of the spacing between concavities to the void size for wind environment of tall buildings ranges from 1 to 3, which can disperse the surrounding heat in more efficiency and weaken the wind velocity in the lowest level.

We also shed light on the possible effects of therapeutic modalities of COVID-19 on breast cancer outcomes. Briefly, we conclude that breast cancer patients are more susceptible for COVID-19 in comparison with their normal counterparts. Women are more resistant for the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. Increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are being correlated with occurrence and severity of COVID-19, but higher expression of ACE2 and lower expression of TMPRSS2 are prognostic markers for overall and disease free survival in breast cancer. The ACE2 inhibitors and ibuprofen therapies for COVID-19 treatment may aggravate the clinical condition of the breast cancer patients through chemo-resistance and metastasis. Most of the available therapeutic modalities for COVID-19 were also found to exert positive effects on breast cancer outcomes. Besides drugs in clinical trend, TMPRSS2 inhibitors, estrogen supplementation, androgen deprivation and DPP-IV inhibitors may also be used to treat breast cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 transmits from person to person through several routes, mainly via respiratory droplets, which makes it difficult to contain its spread into the community. Here, we provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: Direct person-to-person respiratory transmission has rapidly amplified the spread of coronavirus. In the absence of any clinically proven treatment options, the current clinical management of COVID-19 includes symptom management, infection prevention and control measures, optimized supportive care, and intensive care support in severe or critical illness. Developing an effective vaccine is now a leading research priority. Some vaccines have already been approved by the regulatory authorities for the prevention of COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: General prevention and protection measures regarding the containment and management of the second or third waves are necessary to minimize the risk of infection. Until now, four vaccines reported variable efficacies of between 62C95%, and two of them (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) received FDA emergency use authorization.

The present study utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how trait self-control and its neural mechanisms predict overeating tendencies in young adults during the pandemic. Data on trait self-control, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) were collected before COVID-19 (September 2019, T1), and data on overeating were collected during COVID-19 (February 2020, T2). Whole-brain regression analyses (N = 538) revealed that higher trait self-control was associated with higher ALFF in the right dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, VLPFC) and the left anterior insula, and lower ALFF in the left fusiform gyrus and precuneus. With the DLPFC, fusiform gyrus and precuneus as seed regions, trait selfcontrol was associated with decreased connectivity of the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, temporal pole, and insula, and increased connectivity between the right VLPFC and anterior cerebellum. Longitudinal mediation models showed that trait self-control (T1) negatively predicted overeating (T2), and the mediating effects of the fusiform gyrus, DLPFC, and VLPFC were moderated by sex. The present study reveals that the brain networks for trait self-control are mainly involved in cognitive and executive control and incentive and emotional processing, demonstrating the longitudinal benefits of trait self-control in alleviating disordered eating behaviors during the pandemic.

Growth in the use of elective surgery in private hospitals fell with some indication of increased waiting times in public hospitals, and evidence of doctors spending more of their time in public hospitals rather than in private practice. Private hospitals profitability declined, share prices of for-profit private hospital operators fell, and there is evidence of reduced capacity and a fall in long-term investment in the private hospital sector.

In the case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), droplet spread can occur from symptomatic as well as pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has therefore recently recommended home-made cloth face coverings for use by the general public in areas of significant community-based transmission. Because medical masks and N95 respirators are in short supply, these are to be reserved for healthcare workers. There is, however, little information on the effectiveness of home-made face coverings in reducing droplet dissemination. Here, we ascertained the performance of ten different fabrics, ranging from cotton to silk, in blocking high velocity droplets, using a 3-layered commercial medical mask as a benchmark material. We also assessed their breathability and ability to soak water. We reason that the materials should be as breathable as possible, without compromising blocking efficiency, to reduce air flow through the sides of the mask since such flow would defeat the purpose of the mask. We found that most home fabrics substantially block droplets, even as a single layer. With two layers, blocking performance can reach that of surgical mask without significantly compromising breathability. Furthermore, we observed that home fabrics are hydrophilic to varying degrees, and hence soak water. In contrast, medical masks are hydrophobic, and tend to repel water. Incoming droplets are thus soaked and 'held back' by home fabrics, which might offer an as of yet untapped and understudied advantage of home-made cloth masks.

A 2-radiographer mobile radiography team is required to perform bedside Chest X-rays (CXR) for these patients. Hospital guidelines require both radiographers to be in full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) throughout the image acquisition process and the mobile radiographic unit needs to be disinfected twice after each case. This affects the efficiency of the procedure and an increase usage of limited PPE resources. This study aims to explore the feasibility of performing mobile chest radiography with the mobile radiographic unit in a \\"clean\\" zone of the hospital ward. METHODS: An anthropomorphic body phantom was used during the test. With the mobile radiographic unit placed in a \\"clean\\" zone, the phantom and the mobile radiographic unit was segregated by the room door with a clear glass panel. The test was carried out with the room door open and closed. Integrated radiation level and patient dose were measured. A consultant radiologist was invited to review and score all the images acquired using a Barco Medical Grade workstation. The Absolute Visual Grading Analysis (VGA) scoring system was used to score these images. RESULTS: A VGA score of 4 was given to all the 40 test images, suggesting that there is no significant differences in the image quality of the images acquired using the 2 different methods. Radiation exposure received by the patient at the highest kV setting through the glass is comparable to the regular CXR on patient without glass panel at 90 kV, suggesting that there is no significant increase in patient dose. CONCLUSION: The result suggests that acquiring CXR with the X-ray beam attenuating through a glass panel is a safe and feasible way of performing CXR for COVID-19 patients in the newly converted COVID wards. This will allow the mobile radiographic unit as well as one radiographer to be completely segregated from the patient. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This new method of acquiring CXR in an isolation facility set up requires a 2-Radiographer mobile radiography team, and is applicable only for patients who are generally well and not presented with any mobility issues. It is also important to note that a clear glass panel must be present in the barriers set up for segregation between the \\"clean\\" zone and patient zone in order to use this new method of acquiring CXR.","output":"Initial data from an experiment to implement a safe procedure to perform PA erect chest radiographs for COVID-19 patients with a mobile radiographic system in a \\"clean\\" zone of the hospital ward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The yield of repeat catheter angiography in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who have negative initial catheter and computed tomography (CT) angiograms is not well understood.

METHODS From January 1, 2005, until September 1, 2010, we instituted a prospective protocol in which patients with SAH documented by noncontrast CT (NCCT) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) xanthochromia and negative initial catheter and CT angiograms were evaluated with repeat catheter angiography 7 days and 3 months after presentation to assess for causative vascular abnormalities. RESULTS Seventy-two patients were included, with a mean age of 53.1 years (median, 53.5 years; range, 19-88 years). Forty-six patients were female (63.9%) and 26 male (36.1%). Thirty-nine patients had nonperimesencephalic SAH (54.2%), 29 patients had perimesencephalic SAH (40.3%), and 4 patients had CSF xanthochromia (5.5%). The first repeat catheter angiogram performed 7 days after presentation demonstrated a causative vascular abnormality in 3 patients (yield of 4.2%), 2 of which had nonperimesencephalic SAH (yield of 5.1%), and 1 had perimesencephalic SAH (yield of 3.4%). The second repeat catheter angiogram performed in 43 patients (59.7%) did not demonstrate any causative vascular abnormalities.

The new approach was implemented into the course and the research was conducted into the subjective satisfaction of the users of the environment. The first research was conducted in 2018 into the users satisfaction with the course which was taught using traditional methods, and the second research was conducted in 2019 into the users satisfaction with the new online course. The idea of the creator of the online course was to keep the contents and the scope of the subject as much similar as possible to create two groups of users, i.e. the first, using the traditional approaches, and the second with the modern technology-enabled class. With this intention, the Blackboard class was created, and the users were taught by using blended learning methodology. The research focused merely on personal satisfaction with the course within the intention of positive psychology, i.e. focusing on potential issues regarding personal satisfaction. It did not focus on the differences in the performance of the students as there is a lot of research into this aspect. However, it focused on the individual satisfaction and personal feelings of the users while using blended learning platforms in the context of ubiquitous computing. The findings are that the users expressed their satisfaction regarding easily accessible materials and varied learning environment; however, the dissatisfaction was created by increased screen time and reduces social contacts. The findings are very important for educators who use various mobile platforms and eLearning environments as they should be aware of the reservations of the users of these tools.","output":"The use of technology in the learning environment for business communication: applied linguistics of business communication from the positive psychology perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third virus that caused coronavirus-related outbreaks over the past 20 years.

Besides respiratory complications in patients with COVID-19, clinical characterization of severe infection cases showed several other comorbidities, including multiple organ failure, and septic shock. To better understand the systemic pathogenesis of COVID-19, we interrogated the virus's presence in the peripheral blood cells, which might provide a form of trafficking or hiding to the virus. By analyzing >2 billion sequence reads of high-throughput transcriptome sequence data from 180 samples of patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection or healthy controls collected from 6 studies, we found evidence of traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in two samples from two independent studies. In contrast, the viral RNA was abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the same patients. We also devised a viral spike-to-actin RNA normalization as a metric to compare across various samples and minimize errors caused by intersample variability in total human RNA abundance.

The aim of this QIP was to reduce turnaround times by 25% thereby reducing financial implications of theatre idle time. METHODS: Baseline data was obtained from electronic theatre record system Galaxy for the period October 2019 to February 2020. TAT (Time from the last patient going to recovery and the next one coming into the theatre) was measured and a period average was established. This QIP mapped processes and conducted interviews, to identify issues contributing to longer turnaround times. Interventions were then constructed and implemented over 6 weeks. RESULTS: One of preventable causes of delay identified from staff interviews and personal observations was inadequate patient preparation by the ward. Preintervention percentage theatre utilisation was 86% and turnaround times was 51.7 minutes. A PDSA cycle was initiated focusing on advanced warning (30 minutes prior to the end of the previous surgery) from theatres to wards and advanced preparation from wards, using a newly designed ward-based checklist. After the first PDSA cycle there has been an improvement in TAT to 42.8 minutes, a decrease of 18.2%. Whilst this did not meet our goal of a 25% reduction, this remains significant. Unfortunately due to COVID -19 the second cycle has been delayed.

Unfortunately, the City has an outdated electronic control system and a small, corps of traffic agents oversees the execution of mobile speed controls. Under the part of Partnership for Healthy Cities, the city implemented a speed reduction policy to strengthen the existing speed management by measuring speeds. The observation points were established from the sampling of 567 avenues segments according to their level of danger and # of traffic lights. 74 observation points were selected. The final sample (1,572,879 observations) obtained a representative balance of the vehicular circulation arteries according to the territory's geographical zones. 92.1% of the vehicles that circulate on the avenues respect the speed limits while 7.9% exceed the speed limit. In passenger transport and trucks, the average number of exceeding the speed limits more than doubled. During COVID-19 lockdowns, the vehicles that exceeded the maximum speed reached 9.1%. As movement and mobility changed in Buenos Aires due to COVID-19, they used this opportunity to reduce the speed limits and add cycling lanes. At the start of 2020, there were 300,000 daily trips by bicycle and during lockdown, trips rose between 24% and 114%. It is expected that by next year they will be 500,000 per day. 17 km of bicycle lanes were built in two of the largest avenues in the city and the speed limit was reduced to 50 km/h on these avenues. In addition, it was detected that both avenues were the ones on which the most trips were carried out outside the formal network of bicycle lanes, which is 250 kilometers long. On journeys that are made outside this circuit, the risk of a road accident increases by 86%. The planning process must carry out, even when in an emergency.

LPS is recognised by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in innate immunity. Here, we showed that LPS binds to multiple hydrophobic pockets spanning both the S1 and S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. LPS binds to the S2 pocket with a lower affinity compared to S1, suggesting its possible role as an intermediate in the TLR4 cascade. Congruently, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) activation in vitro is strongly boosted by S2. In vivo, however, a boosting effect is observed for both S1 and S2, with the former potentially facilitated by proteolysis. Collectively, our study suggests the S protein may act as a delivery system for LPS in host innate immune pathways.

It acts as a primary contact site to entrap microbes and facilitates their removal from the respiratory tract via the coordinated beating of motile cilia. The major components of airway mucus are heavily O-glycosylated mucin glycoproteins, divided into gel-forming mucins and transmembrane mucins. The gel-forming mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B are the primary structural components of airway mucus, and they enable efficient clearance of pathogens by mucociliary clearance. MUC5B is constitutively expressed in the healthy airway, whereas MUC5AC is upregulated in response to inflammatory challenge. MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16 are the three major transmembrane mucins of the respiratory tracts which prevent microbial invasion, can act as releasable decoy receptors, and activate intracellular signal transduction pathways. Pathogens have evolved virulence factors such as adhesins that facilitate interaction with specific mucins and mucin glycans, for example, terminal sialic acids. Mucin expression and glycosylation are dependent on the inflammatory state of the respiratory tract and are directly regulated by proinflammatory cytokines and microbial ligands. Gender and age also impact mucin glycosylation and expression through the female sex hormone estradiol and age-related downregulation of mucin production. Here, we discuss what is currently known about the role of respiratory mucins and their glycans during bacterial and viral infections of the airways and their relevance for the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

As such various pricing approaches have been proposed, but none treat the uncertainty in catastrophe occurrences and interest rates in a sufficiently flexible and statistically reliable way within a unifying asset pricing framework. Consequently, little is known empirically about the expected risk-premia of CAT bonds. The primary contribution of this paper is to present a unified Bayesian CAT bond pricing framework based on uncertainty quantification of catastrophes and interest rates. Our framework allows for complex beliefs about catastrophe risks to capture the distinct and common patterns in catastrophe occurrences, and when combined with stochastic interest rates, yields a unified asset pricing approach with informative expected risk premia. Specifically, using a modified collective risk model -- Dirichlet Prior-Hierarchical Bayesian Collective Risk Model (DP-HBCRM) framework -- we model catastrophe risk via a model-based clustering approach. Interest rate risk is modeled as a CIR process under the Bayesian approach. As a consequence of casting CAT pricing models into our framework, we evaluate the price and expected risk premia of various CAT bond contracts corresponding to clustering of catastrophe risk profiles. Numerical experiments show how these clusters reveal how CAT bond prices and expected risk premia relate to claim frequency and loss severity.","output":"A Unified Bayesian Framework for Pricing Catastrophe Bond Derivatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospital areas is of a particular concern, since the close interaction between health care personnel and patients diagnosed with COVID-19, which allows virus to be easily spread between them and subsequently to their families and communities.

Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage - in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control - should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme. In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction. Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.","output":"Informations relatives aux psychotropes et  leurs adaptations ventuelles pour les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques en France pendant l'pidmie  SARS-CoV-2./ [Informations on psychotropics and their adaptations for patients suffering from mental disorders in France during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world has been challenged by SARS CoV-2, a new virus causing pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, with common symptoms of COVID-19 in pediatric patients including both respiratory and GI symptoms.

The content discussed at each bedside during rounds was inconsistent, contributing to the irregular achievement of established FCR checklist items. METHODS: Using a scheduling tool with a prioritization algorithm and set time allotment/patient, we implemented schedule-based family-centered rounds (SBFCR) on a pediatric acute care unit. Primary outcome metrics included RN attendance and participation. We tracked rounding checklist compliance, parent presence on rounds, and adherence to the schedule. Surveys provided information on provider and family satisfaction. Perceived impact on teaching was the balancing measure because the structure discouraged spending extra time at the cost of team tardiness for the next patient. RESULTS: We created a schedule for 95% workweek days, with the rounding order kept for 93%. Mean RN attendance increased from 69% to 87% and participation increased from 48% to 80% with SBFCR (P < 0.001 for each). FCR checklist compliance increased from 60% to 94% (P < 0.001). Families felt more informed and able to attend; their presence at rounds rose from 66% to 85% (P < 0.001). Most faculty and trainees felt SBFCR was efficient and observed increased teaching with SBFCR. CONCLUSIONS: SBFCR provides an organizational framework for increased RN attendance and participation as well as greater family presence during rounds.

We experienced severe cerebral infarction caused by paradoxical CO2 embolism during laparoscopic liver resection with injury of the hepatic vessels despite the absence of a right-to-left systemic shunt. CASE REPORT A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in the right hepatic lobe secondary to alcoholic liver disease. We planned the laparoscopy-assisted liver resection. During the surgery, the root of the right hepatic vein was injured. A 1.5-cm hole was accidentally made in the right hepatic vein, while mobilizing the right hepatic lobe laparoscopically. End-tidal CO2 dropped from 39 to 15.5 mmHg, and systemic blood pressure dropped from 121 to 45 mmHg, returning to normal with the administration of inotropes. The transesophageal echocardiography revealed numerous bubbles in the left atrium and ventricle. The Bispectral Index monitoring system showed low brain activity, suggesting cerebral infarction due to paradoxical gas embolism. The hepatectomy was completed by conversion to open laparotomy. The patient went into a coma and suffered quadriplegia after surgery, despite the cooling of his head and the administration of Thiamylal. Brain MRI revealed cerebral infarction in the broad area of the cerebral cortex right side predominantly, with poor blood flow confirmed by the brain perfusion single-photon emission CT.

Methods: This research investigated how own (actor) and partner psychological and financial stress about the pandemic were associated with alcohol consumption, high-intensity drinking frequency, coping motives, and alcohol-related problems in a sample of 118 couples during the month of July 2020. We also explored whether own (actor) and partner effects were moderated by gender. Results: Results using indistinguishable Actor-partner interdependence models (APIMs) demonstrated that own psychological stress was associated with higher scores on all drinking indices, and own financial stress was associated with higher coping motives and alcohol-related problems. Partner psychological and financial stress was related to own greater endorsement of coping motives, and partner financial stress was related to own greater endorsement of alcohol-related problems. In APIMs with mixed-sex couples, men's psychological and financial stress were positively related to both his own and his partner's drinks per week, high-intensity drinking, and coping motives.

Therefore, the signaling pathways governing protein synthesis, autophagy, apoptosis, and the ubiquitin-proteasome were investigated to identify potential mechanisms mediating the acute (24 h) loss of WAT after cecal ligation and puncture as well as the failure to replenish WAT during recovery (day 10). While whole body fat mass was decreased equally in pair-fed control and septic mice at 5 days after cecal ligation and puncture, fat mass remained 35% lower in septic mice at day 10 During sepsis-recovery, protein synthesis in epididymal WAT was increased compared with control values, and this increase was associated with an elevation in eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)2B but no change in mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 activity (eIF4E-binding protein-1 or S6 kinase 1 phosphorylation). Protein breakdown was increased during sepsis-recovery, as evidenced by the elevation in ubiquitin-proteasome activity. Moreover, indexes of autophagy (light chain 3B-II, autophagy-related protein 5/12, and beclin) were increased during sepsis-recovery and associated with increased AMP-activated kinase-dependent Ser555-phosphorylated Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase-1. Apoptosis was increased, as suggested by the increased cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. These changes were associated with increased inflammasome activity (increased NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3; TMS1; and caspase-1 cleavage) and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (increased eIF2 and activating transcription factor-4) and browning (uncoupling protein-1) in epididymal WAT.

(SEM), two of the substantiated face masks (A and B) were examined for silver identification for further confirmation Mask A uses silver and copper ions attached to zeolite particles;the zeolite particles discovered through SEM were approximately 90C200 nm in diameter In mask B, particles of silver and titanium at the 250 nm size were found In conclusion, these certifications or patents are not enough to determine credibility, and stricter regulations by federal agencies on product testing for manufacturers that make claims are necessary to ensure the efficacy of the product advertised,

(tsDMARDs), also known as small molecule inhibitors, represent a breakthrough in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. The tsDMARDs are a large family of small molecules targeting mostly the several types of kinases, which are essential in downstream signaling of pro-inflammatory molecules. This review highlights current challenges associated with the treatment of RA using small molecule inhibitors targeting intracellular JAKs/MAPKs/NF-&#954;B/SYK-BTK signaling pathways. Indeed, we have provided the latest update on development of small molecule inhibitors, their clinical efficacy and safety as a strategy for RA treatment. On the other hand, we have highlighted the risk and adverse effects of tsDMARDs administration including, among others, infections and thromboembolism. Therefore, performance of blood tests or viral infection screening should be recommended before the tsDMARDs administration. Interestingly, recent events of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have demonstrated the potential use of small molecule inhibitors not only in RA treatment, but also in fighting COVID-19 via blocking the viral entry, preventing of hyperimmune activation and reducing cytokine storm. Thus, small molecule inhibitors, targeting wide range of pro-inflammatory singling pathways, may find wider implications not only for the management of RA but also in the controlling of COVID-19.","output":"Small Molecule Inhibitors in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Beyond: Latest Updates and Potential Strategy for Fighting COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We estimate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-reported school enrollment using a sample of 16-to-18-year-old youth from the January 2010 to the December 2020 Current Population Survey (CPS).

A thematic analysis was conducted, and five dominant frames were detected in the context of COVID-19: 1) financial precariousness of womens football; 2) the commercial prioritisation of mens football; 3) practical consideration of the sport (e.g., alterations to national and international competitions); 4) debating the future of womens football and 5) concern for players (e.g., welfare, uncertain working conditions). These frames depart from the past trivialisation and sexualisation of womens sport, demonstrate the increased visibility of womens football, and shift the narrative towards the elite stratum of the game. Most of this reporting was by women journalists, while men were shown to write less than women about womens football.

In South Africa (SA), >2.4 million cases of COVID-19 and >72 000 deaths were recorded between March 2020 and 1 August 2021, affecting the country's 52 districts to various extents. SA has committed to a COVID-19 vaccine roll-out in three phases, prioritising frontline workers, the elderly, people with comorbidities and essential workers. However, additional actions will be necessary to support efficient allocation and equitable access for vulnerable, access-constrained communities. Objectives. To explore various determinants of disease severity, resurgence risk and accessibility in order to aid an equitable, effective vaccine roll-out for SA that would maximise COVID-19 epidemic control by reducing the number of COVID-19 transmissions and resultant deaths, while at the same time reducing the risk of vaccine wastage. Methods. For the 52 districts of SA, 26 COVID-19 indicators such as hospital admissions, deaths in hospital and mobility were ranked and hierarchically clustered with cases to identify which indicators can be used as indicators for severity or resurgence risk. Districts were then ranked using the estimated COVID-19 severity and resurgence risk to assist with prioritisation of vaccine roll-out. Urban and rural accessibility were also explored as factors that could limit vaccine roll-out in hard-to-reach communities. Results. Highly populated urban districts showed the most cases. Districts such as Buffalo City, City of Cape Town and Nelson Mandela Bay experienced very severe first and second waves of the pandemic. Districts with high mobility, population size and density were found to be at highest risk of resurgence. In terms of accessibility, we found that 47.2% of the population are within 5 km of a hospital with 50 beds, and this percentage ranged from 87.0% in City of Cape Town to 0% in Namakwa district. Conclusions. The end goal is to provide equal distribution of vaccines proportional to district populations, which will provide fair protection. Districts with a high risk of resurgence and severity should be prioritised for vaccine roll-out, particularly the major metropolitan areas. We provide recommendations for allocations of different vaccine types for each district that consider levels of access, numbers of doses and cold-chain storage capability.","output":"Guiding equitable prioritisation of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and strategic deployment in South Africa to enhance effectiveness and access to vulnerable communities and prevent waste"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The nasal cycle is the spontaneous congestion and decongestion of nasal mucosa that happens during the day. Classically, 4 types of nasal cycle patterns have been described: (1) classic, (2) parallel, (3) irregular, and (4) acyclic. Hypothalamus has been considered as the central regulator even if several external factors may influence its activity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the presence of a correlation between nasal cycle pattern, nasal cytology and nasal symptoms. METHODS: Thirty healthy volunteers have been enrolled in the study. All subjects completed a Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 questionnaire and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for nasal obstruction. The nasal cycle was studied by means of peak nasal inspiratory flow. Nasal cytology has been used to evaluate the presence of local nasal inflammation. RESULTS: Nineteen subjects showed a parallel nasal cycle pattern, while 11 showed a regular one. A parallel pattern was present in 60% of asymptomatic subjects and in 67% of the symptomatic one (P = 1). VAS for nasal obstruction did not show a significant difference between the 2 patterns of the nasal cycle (P = .398). Seventeen subjects had a normal rhinocytogram, while 13 volunteers showed a neutrophilic rhinitis; 53.8% of the subjects with a neutrophilic rhinitis showed a parallel pattern, while the remaining 46.2% had a regular one. In the case of a normal cytology, 70.6% of the volunteers had a parallel pattern and 29.4% had a regular one. Differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant (P = .575). CONCLUSION: Rhinitis with neutrophils seems to not influence the nasal cycle pattern.

This would allow reducing the susceptibility of risk groups and the cascade of events after SARS-CoV-2 infection, responsible for the clinical picture, triggered by the imbalance towards oxidation, inflammation, and cytokine storm. Possible strategies to follow through the use of substances of food origin would include: a) the promotion of mitophagy to remove dysfunctional mitochondria originating from free radicals, proton imbalance and virus evasion of the immune system; b) the administration of transition metals whose redox activity would lead to their own oxidation and the consequent generation of a reduced environment, which would normalize the oxidative state and the intracellular pH; c) the administration of molecules with demonstrated antioxidant capacity; d) the administration of compounds with anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory activity; e) the administration of immunomodulatory compounds.","output":"Do nutrients and other bioactive molecules from foods have anything to say in the treatment against COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main purpose of the current study is to investigate the perceptions of individuals' living in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic through metaphor analysis.

Although empirical research works to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general population, some groups remain at greater risk for adverse mental health consequences. The purpose of this study is to better understand how COVID-19 experiences, food insecurities, and social support are associated with mental health and well-being for aging populations. METHODS: Data collection began April 1, 2020 and continued through May 22, 2020. Study participants were recruited via website and media promotion and completed an anonymous survey. A sample of adults age 50 years and older (N = 136) were selected for the current analysis. Measures included scales of anxiety, depression, resilience, quality of life, COVID-19 experiences, interdependence, and insecurities. Three stepwise linear regression models were conducted using forward selection were estimated. RESULTS: The first model found food insecurity, community closeness, and COVID-19 experiences predicted 23% of the variance in mental health. The second model found having enough money to meet needs, COVID-19 interdependence, and age predicted 20% of the variance in resilience. The final model found having enough money to meet needs, COVID-19 experiences, community closeness, and information access predicted 45% of the variance in quality of life.

In addition, the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants increases the threat of uncontrolled dissemination and additional antiviral therapies are urgently needed for effective containment. In previous in vitro studies Echinacea purpurea demonstrated strong antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we examined the potential of Echinacea purpurea in preventing and treating respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and in particular, SARS-CoV-2 infections. Methods120 healthy volunteers (m,f, 18 - 75 years) were randomly assigned to Echinacea prevention or control group without any intervention. After a run-in week, participants went through 3 prevention cycles of 2, 2 and 1 months with daily 2400mg Echinacea purpurea extract (Echinaforce(R), EF). The prevention cycles were interrupted by breaks of 1 week. Acute respiratory symptoms were treated with 4000 mg EF for up to 10 days, and their severity assessed via a diary. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs and venous blood samples were routinely collected every month and during acute illnesses for detection and identification of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 via RT-qPCR and serology. ResultsSummarized over all phases of prevention, 21 and 29 samples tested positive for any virus in the EF and control group, of which 5 and 14 samples tested SARS-CoV-2 positive (RR=0.37, Chi-square test, p=0.03). Overall, 10 and 14 symptomatic episodes occurred, of which 5 and 8 were COVID-19 (RR=0.70, Chi-square test, p>0.05). EF treatment when applied during acute episodes significantly reduced the overall virus load by at least 2.12 log10 or approx. 99% (t-test, p<0.05), the time to virus clearance by 8.0 days for all viruses (Wilcoxon test, p=0.02) and by 4.8 days for SARS-CoV-2 (p>0.05) in comparison to control. Finally, EF treatment significantly reduced fever days (1 day vs 11 days, Chi-square test, p=0.003) but not the overall symptom severity. There were fewer COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the EF treatment group (N=0 vs N=2). Discussion/ConclusionEF exhibited antiviral effects and reduced the risk of viral RTIs, including SARS-CoV-2. By substantially reducing virus loads in infected subjects, EF offers a supportive addition to existing mandated treatments like vaccinations. Future confirmatory studies are warranted.

There has been limited investigation into the reliability of this score. We aim to identify intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the mTICI score among endovascular neurosurgeons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four independent endovascular neurosurgeons (raters) reviewed angiograms of 67 patients at 2 time points. &#954; statistics assessed inter- and intrarater reliability and compared raters'-versus-proceduralists' scores. Reliability was also assessed for occlusion location and by dichotomizing modified TICI scores (0-2a versus 2b-3). RESULTS: Interrater reliability was moderate-to-substantial, weighted &#954; = 0.417-0.703, overall &#954; = 0.374 (P < .001). The dichotomized modified TICI score had moderate-to-substantial interrater agreement, &#954; statistics = 0.468-0.715, overall &#954; = 0.582 (P < .001). Intrarater reliability was moderate-to-almost perfect, weighted &#954; = 0.594-0.81. The dichotomized modified TICI score had substantial-to-almost perfect reliability, &#954; = 0.632-0.82. Proceduralists had fair-to-moderate agreement with raters, weighted &#954; = 0.348-0.574, and the dichotomized modified TICI score had fair-to-moderate agreement, &#954; = 0.365-0.544. When proceduralists and raters disagreed, proceduralists' scores were higher in 79.6% of cases. M1 followed by ICA occlusions had the highest agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The modified TICI score is a practical metric for assessing reperfusion after mechanical thrombectomy, though not without limitations. Agreement improved when scores were dichotomized around the clinically relevant threshold of successful revascularization. Interrater reliability improved with time, suggesting that formal training of interventionalists may improve reporting reliability. Agreement of the modified TICI scale is best with M1 and ICA occlusion and becomes less reliable with more distal or posterior circulation occlusions. These findings should be considered when developing research trials.","output":"Reliability of the Modified TICI Score among Endovascular Neurosurgeons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 at the end of 2019 has had a huge impact on people's lives all over the world, and the overwhelmingly negative information about the epidemic has made people panic for the future. This kind of panic spreads and develops through online social networks, and further spreads to the offline environment, which triggers panic buying behavior and has a serious impact on social stability. In order to quantitatively study this behavior, a two-layer propagation model of panic buying behavior under the sudden epidemic is constructed. The model first analyzes the formation process of individual panic from a micro perspective, and then combines the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model to simulate the spread of group behavior. Then, through simulation experiments, the main factors affecting the spread of panic buying behavior are discussed. The experimental results show that: (1) the dissipating speed of individual panics is related to the number of interactions and there is a threshold. When the number of individuals involved in interacting is equal to this threshold, the panic of the group dissipates the fastest, while the dissipation speed is slower when it is far from the threshold; (2) The reasonable external information release time will affect the occurrence of the second panic buying, meaning providing information about the availability of supplies when an escalation of epidemic is announced will help prevent a second panic buying. In addition, when the first panic buying is about to end, if the scale of the second panic buying is to be suppressed, it is better to release positive information after the end of the first panic buying, rather than ahead of the end; and (3) Higher conformity among people escalates panic, resulting in panic buying.

To protect chickens against ILTV infection, chicken-embryo origin (CEO) and tissue-culture origin (TCO) vaccines have been used. However, the transmission of vaccine ILTV from vaccinated- to unvaccinated chickens can cause severe respiratory disease. Previously, host cell responses against virulent ILTV infections were determined by microarray analysis. In this study, a microarray analysis was performed to understand host-vaccine ILTV interactions at the host gene transcription level. RESULTS: The 44 K chicken oligo microarrays were used, and the results were compared to those found in virulent ILTV infection. Total RNAs extracted from vaccine ILTV infected chicken embryo lung cells at 1, 2, 3 and 4 days post infection (dpi), compared to 0 dpi, were subjected to microarray assay using the two color hybridization method. Data analysis using JMP Genomics 5.0 and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) program showed that 213 differentially expressed genes could be grouped into a number of functional categories including tissue development, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular movement, and inflammatory responses. Moreover, 10 possible gene networks were created by the IPA program to show intermolecular connections. Interestingly, of 213 differentially expressed genes, BMP2, C8orf79, F10, and NPY were expressed distinctly in vaccine ILTV infection when compared to virulent ILTV infection.

As a result, some patients were transferred to tertiary referral centers with increased surge capacity and an ability to provide a higher level of care for patients in respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. In general, interhospital transfers have higher disease severity, longer length of stay, and higher mortality. Our study investigated whether patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to a tertiary referral center had higher severity of illness and poorer health outcomes compared to patients who were directly admitted. METHODS: This was a single center, retrospective cohort study of adult patients with COVID-19 who received mechanical ventilation. Demographic and clinical variables were extracted from the electronic medical record for patients admitted and discharged between March 17, 2020 and September 30, 2020. Patients were classified as either directly admitted or admitted via interhospital transfer. Inverse probability weighted regression models were constructed to test the association between transfer status and outcomes, including in-hospital death versus survival to hospital discharge, and number of days from intubation to discharge, adjusting for patient demographic characteristics and severity of illness. RESULTS: Of 1,785 patients admitted to Rush University Medical Center with COIVD-19, 174 (10%) were transferred from another hospital and 1,611 were directly admitted through the emergency department. A total of 119 transfer patients and 183 direct admits required mechanical ventilation. Transfer patients differed from direct admits in being more likely to have English as a preferred language (71% vs 56%,), younger age (median 57 vs 60 years), higher BMI (median, 34 vs 31), and more likely to have received ECMO (12% vs 3%), p&lt;0.01 for each. Overall,150 (42%) transferred patients and 78 (43%) directly admitted patients died prior to discharge, and there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality after adjusting for patient sociodemographic factors and presentation severity. Additionally, there were no significant difference found between days from intubation to discharge between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Although transferred patients may have been sicker on arrival when compared to directly admitted patients, there were no differences in in-hospital mortality or length of stay in this study. These data suggest that interhospital transfer of critically ill patients with COVID-19 can be done safely and effectively.","output":"Interhospital transfer for patients with COVID-19 admitted to an urban academic medical center in Chicago, IL"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present article is being written against the backdrop of the worldwide microeconomic crisis, which has raised a question mark on our very existence.

METHODS A retrospective study employing secondary data from the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Deaths according to cause were extracted and disaggregated into early, late, postneonatal, and 1 to 4-year-old periods. Corrected mortality rates per 1,000 live births and relative risk ratio for the cause of death were calculated. RESULTS There were 34,070 deaths, being 417 (1.2%) from COVID-19 in 2020. COVID-19 mortality was 0.17 per 1000 live births, reaching 0.006 in the early neonatal period, 0.007 in the late neonatal, 0.09 in the postneonatal, and 0.06 in 1 to 4-year-old. Mortality decreased mostly for some diseases that originated in the perinatal period, congenital anomalies, diseases of the respiratory system and external causes, in this order. In 2020, the highest rate was in the early neonatal period, with a fall from 7.2 to 6.5, followed by the postneonatal (3.9 to 3.4) and late neonatal (2.3 to 2.1). Among children aged 1 to 4-year-old, external causes had the highest proportional rate, and diseases of the respiratory system showed the highest decline. CONCLUSION The mortality rate declined from 2017 to 2020, and this variation was higher in the early neonatal period.

DESIGN: Epidemiological study. SETTING: Country-based data from publicly available online databases of international organisations. PARTICIPANTS: The study involved 170 countries/territories, each of which had complete COVID-19 and tuberculosis data, as well as specific health-related estimators (obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The worldwide heterogeneity of the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths per million on 31 December 2020 was analysed by 17 macro-scale estimators around the health-related, socioeconomic, climatic and political factors. In 139 of 170 nations, the best subsets regression was used to investigate all potential models of COVID-19 variations among countries. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to explore the predictive capacity of these variables. The same analysis was applied to the number of deaths per hundred thousand due to tuberculosis, a quite different infectious disease, to validate and control the differences with the proposed models for COVID-19. RESULTS: In the model for the COVID-19 cases (R(2)=0.45), obesity (=0.460), hypertension (=0.214), sunshine (=?0.157) and transparency (=0.147); whereas in the model for COVID-19 deaths (R(2)=0.41), obesity (=0.279), hypertension (=0.285), alcohol consumption (=0.173) and urbanisation (=0.204) were significant factors (p<0.05). Unlike COVID-19, the tuberculosis model contained significant indicators like obesity, undernourishment, air pollution, age, schooling, democracy and Gini Inequality Index.

However, the histopathological characteristics of retrieved thrombi in patients with cancer have not been well studied. This study aimed to assess the histopathological difference between thrombi in patients with and without cancer. METHODS We studied consecutive patients with acute major cerebral artery occlusion who were treated with endovascular therapy between October 2010 and December 2016 in our single-center registry. The retrieved thrombi were histopathologically investigated with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining. The organization and proportions of erythrocyte and fibrin/platelet components were studied using a lattice composed of 1010 squares. RESULTS Of the 180 patients studied, 17 (8 women, age 76.511.5 years) had cancer and 163 (69 women, age 74.111.2 years) did not. Those with cancer had a higher proportion of fibrin/platelets (56.627.4% vs 40.123.9%, p=0.008), a smaller proportion of erythrocytes (42.128.3% vs 57.525.1%, p=0.019), and higher serum D-dimer levels (5.98.2 vs 2.44.3 mg/dL, p=0.005) compared with the non-cancer cases. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the cut-off ratio of fibrin/platelet components related to cancer was 55.7% with a sensitivity of 74.8%, specificity 58.8% and area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.67 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.81), and the cut-off ratio of erythrocyte components was 44.7% with a sensitivity of 71.2%, specificity 58.9% and AUC value of 0.66 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.80).

METHODS: Retrospective observational study of 81 consecutive patients admitted with Covid-19 respiratory infection who underwent MDCT for clinical suspicion of PTE (sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, severe respiratory failure (SRF) not corrected with high O2 flow) and/or raised D-dimer. RESULTS: Of the 81 patients studied [64 (79.01%) men], acute PTE was identified in 22 (27.16%), bilaterally in 13 (59.09%), and 13 (59,09%) showed areas of hypoperfusion. Of the 59 (72.83%) patients without PTE, hypoperfusion was observed in 41 (69.49%) (attributable in one case to pulmonary emphysema). In 18 (22.2%) of the total number of patients, neither PTE nor hypoperfusion were seen. A crazy paving pattern is a risk factor for developing PTE (OR 1.94; 95% CI 0.28-13.57), as are consolidations (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.24-8.48) and septal thickening/bronchiectasis (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.12-17.81). Patients with O2-refractory SRF showed a 6.36-fold higher risk for hypoperfusion on the iodine map.

However, the true prevalence, associated morbidities, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these individuals and their families are not well documented, especially in low- and middle-income countries such as Pakistan. Disease-specific documentation in the form of a collaborative registry is required to better understand this condition and the associated health outcomes. This protocol paper describes the aims and processes for developing the first comprehensive, web-based collaborative registry for Down syndrome in a Pakistani cohort. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the HRQOL, long-term survival, and morbidity of individuals with Down syndrome by using a web-based collaborative registry. METHODS: The registry data collection will be conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital and at the Karachi Down Syndrome Program. Data will be collected by in-person interviews or virtually via telephone or video interviews. Participants of any age and sex with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) will be recruited. After receiving informed consent and assent, a series of tablet-based questionnaires will be administered. The questionnaires aim to assess the sociodemographic background, clinical status, and HRQOL of the participants and their families. Data will be uploaded to a secure cloud server to allow for real-time access to participant responses by the clinicians to plan prompt interventions. Patient safety and confidentiality will be maintained by using multilayer encryption and unique coded patient identifiers. The collected data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0 (IBM Corporation), with the mean and SD of continuous variables being reported. Categorical variables will be analyzed with their percentages being reported and with a P value cutoff of .05. Multivariate regression analysis will be conducted to identify predictors related to the HRQOL in patients with Down syndrome. Survival analysis will be reported using the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: The web-based questionnaire is currently being finalized before the commencement of pilot testing.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of malnutrition and its phenotypic characteristics among lung transplantation (LTx) candidates comparing GLIM to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) criteria. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of all adult patients assessed for LTx in a one-year period. Phenotypic criteria included body mass index (BMI), unintentional loss of weight (LOW) over a 12-month period and fat-free mass index (FFMI) using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Systemic inflammation associated with severe end-stage lung disease met GLIM's etiological criterion. Diagnosis of malnutrition, and its severity, were classified according to each of GLIM and ICD-10. RESULTS Of 130 patients, 112 (86%) had all data to classify malnutrition. Malnutrition prevalence according to GLIM was 59%, which was markedly greater than using ICD-10 criteria (26%). Half of the LTx patients were moderately malnourished using GLIM, compared to 19% using ICD-10. A similar proportion were severely malnourished using GLIM (9%) and ICD-10 (7%). Fat-free mass (FFM) depletion (47% of all patients) was a major contributor to GLIM-malnutrition. Over 60% of LTx patients with GLIM-malnutrition were not detected as malnourished using ICD-10 criteria. CONCLUSION Malnutrition diagnosis using GLIM was higher than using ICD-10 in LTx patients, primarily attributable to the incorporation of quantitative evaluation of FFM depletion. This highlights the utility of the GLIM framework and the importance of including body composition in malnutrition assessment.","output":"A GLIMmer of insight into lung transplant nutrition: Enhanced detection of malnutrition in lung transplant patients using the GLIM criteria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic invades the world.

Cytokines cause inflammation which have been induced the injuries in lung lining.Some observational studies confirmed that Ginkgo Biloba reduced the risk of asthma, sepsis and another respiratory disease as well as it reduced the risk of cigarette smoking on respiratory symptoms. While other evidences suggested the characters of Ginkgo Biloba as an antivirus agent through several mechanisms. Ginkgolic acid (GA) can inhibit the fusion and synthesis of viral proteins, thus, it inhibit the Herpes Simplex Virus type1 (HSV-1), genome replication in Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and the infections of the Zika Virus (ZIKV). Also, it inhibits the wide spectrum of fusion by inhibiting the three types of proteins that have been induced fusion as (Influenza A Virus [IAV], Epstein Barr Virus [EBV], HIV and Ebola Virus [EBOV]).The secondary mechanism of GA targeting inhibition of the DNA and protein synthesis in virus, greatly have been related to its strong effects, even afterward the beginning of the infection, therefore, it potentially treats the acute viral contaminations like (Measles and Coronavirus COVID-19). Additionally, it has been used topically as an effective agent on vigorous lesions including (varicella-zoster virus [VZV], HSV-1 and HSV-2). Ginkgo Biloba may be useful for treating the infected people with coronavirus COVID-19 through its beneficial effect.

It is well-recognized that as a social animal, most humans are deeply embedded both in their cultural milieu and in broader society that extends well beyond close family, including neighborhoods, communities and workplaces. In this article, we study this embeddedness by leveraging urban dwellers social media footprint. Specifically, we define and empirically study the issue of spatio-textual affinity by collecting many millions of geotagged tweets collected from two diverse metropolises within the United States: the Boroughs of New York City, and the County of Los Angeles. Spatio-textual affinity is the intuitive hypothesis that tweets coming from similar locations (spatial affinity) will tend to be topically similar (textual affinity). This simple definition of the problem belies the complexity of measuring it, since (re-tweets notwithstanding) two tweets are never truly identical either spatially or textually. Workable definitions of affinity along both dimensions are required, as are appropriate experimental designs, visualizations and measurements. In addition to providing such definitions and a viable framework for conducting spatio-textual affinity experiments on Twitter data, we provide detailed results illustrating how our framework can be used to compare and contrast two important metropolitan areas from multiple perspectives and granularities.","output":"Measuring spatio-textual affinities in twitter between two urban metropolises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, structured medical training is challenging because the necessary travel for on-site interviews could increase the spread of the disease. Aim: This study was conducted to describe an urgently implemented, web-based interview process for selecting medical residents for the National Residency Matching in Saudi Arabia. Method: A cross-sectional, nationwide survey (appendix 1) was sent to 4,153 residency-nominated applicants in Saudi Arabia to the matching interview for 2020. Results: Among the 510 candidates who responded, 62.2% applied for medical specialties, 20.2% applied for surgical specialties, and 17.6% applied for critical care and emergency specialties. Most respondents (61.2%) never had video conferences. Besides, most respondents (80.2%) had used Zoom to conduct E-interviews, whereas only 15.9% used FaceTime. Among the respondents, 75.7% agreed that their questions regarding the residency programs were adequately answered during the virtual interviews. The top perceived factors that enhanced the experience were the free application, the clarification emails they received from the organizers, and the organizers effective communication. Conversely, what negatively impacted the interviews were the slow and interrupted Internet, the absence of clear instructions, and the lack of previous experience with teleconferencing. Conclusion: Videoconferencing was successfully implemented on an urgent basis during the COVID-19 pandemic in the medical residency application process in Saudi Arabia.

Doctors active in 79 Internal or Vascular clinical centers in 7 countries (China, Czechia, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, and Tunisia) enrolled VTE patients after the maintenance treatment phase. The present report analyzed information, collected in the central database, regarding the baseline characteristics, index events, type and duration of anticoagulant therapy and decision on post-maintenance treatment. From April 2018 to December 2020, 1240 patients were enrolled, 58% with an unprovoked index event. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were used in > 85% of all cases in China, Poland, Portugal, Russia and Czechia, in 52% in Slovakia and in no patient in Tunisia. The maintenance anticoagulation lasted in average approximately 6 months. Altogether, anticoagulation was stopped in 20%, extended in about 50%, regardless of whether the event was unprovoked or provoked and shifted to antithrombotics (mainly sulodexide or aspirin) in the remaining patients. In conclusion, some differences in VTE patient management were found between countries.

We have used a model-based approach to explore the relative impact of alternative dosing regimens proposed in different dosing protocols for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. METHODS: We compared different PK exposures using Monte Carlo simulations based on a previously published population pharmacokinetic model in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, externally validated using both independent data in lupus erythematous patients and recent data in French COVID-19 patients. Clinical efficacy and safety information from COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ were used to contextualize and assess the actual clinical value of the model predictions. RESULTS: Literature and observed clinical data confirm the variability in clinical responses in COVID-19 when treated with the same fixed doses. Confounding factors were identified that should be taken into account for dose recommendation. For 80% of patients, doses higher than 800mg day on D1 followed by 600mg daily on following days might not be needed for being cured. Limited adverse drug reactions have been reported so far for this dosing regimen, most often confounded by co-medications, comorbidities or underlying COVID-19 disease effects. CONCLUSION: Our results were clear indicating the unmet need for characterization of target PK exposures to inform HCQ dosing optimization in COVID-19.

Effective mass screening requires robust and sensitive tests that reliably detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections with a low viral count. Currently, the most accurate tests are based on detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. We developed a method to process COVID-19 specimens that simplifies and increases the sensitivity of viral RNA detection by direct RT-qPCR, performed without RNA purification. In the method, termed Alkaline-Glycol Processing (AG processing), a SARS-CoV-2-containing biological specimen, such as saliva or a swab-collected suspension, is processed at pH 12.2 to 12.8 for 5 min at room temperature. An aliquot of the AG-processed specimen is used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR. AG processing effectively lyses viruses and reduces the effect of inhibitors of RT-PCR that are present in biological specimens. The sensitivity of detecting viral RNA using AG processing is on par with methods that include a viral RNA purification step. One copy of SARS-CoV-2 virus per reaction, equivalent to 300 copies per ml of saliva, is detectable in the AG-processed saliva. The LOD calculated following U.S. FDA guidelines is 600 viral copies per ml of initial saliva specimen. AG processing works with saliva specimens or swab specimens collected into Universal Transport Medium (UTM), is compatible with heat treatment, and was confirmed to work with a range of CDC-approved RT-qPCR products and kits.

The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is regarded as a key target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. In order to develop anti-viral therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to find amino acid pairs that strongly attract each other at the interface of the spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) complex. In order to find hot spot residues, the strongly attracting amino acid pairs at the protein-protein interaction (PPI) interface, we introduce a reliable inter-residue interaction energy calculation method, FMO-DFTB3/D/PCM/3D-SPIEs. In addition to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein/hACE2 complex, the hot spot residues of SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein/hACE2 complex, SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein/antibody complex, and HCoV-NL63 spike glycoprotein/hACE2 complex were obtained using the same FMO method. Following this, a 3D- SPIEs-based interaction map was constructed with hot spot residues for the hACE2/SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein, hACE2/HCoV-NL63 spike glycoprotein, and hACE2/SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein complexes. Finally, the three 3D-SPIEs-based interaction maps were combined and analyzed to find the consensus hot spots among the three complexes. As a result of the analysis, two hot spots were identified between hACE2 and the three spike proteins. Of the two hot spot regions, the second hot spot is important for PPI inhibitors. In particular, E37, K353, G354, and D355 of the hACE2 receptor strongly interact with the spike proteins of coronaviruses.

The model reveals that using both therapies in combination can be very effective in reducing the length of infection, but these synergistic effects decline with a delayed treatment start.

Every individual's lethality to a hypoxia state differs in terms of hypoxia exposure time, dosage units and dependent on the individual's genetic makeup. Most of the proposed markers for CPD were generally aim to distinguish disease samples from normal samples. Although, as per the 2018 GOLD guidelines, clinically useful biomarkers for several cardio pulmonary disease patients in stable condition have yet to be identified. We attempt to address these key issues through the identification of Dynamic Network Biomarkers (DNB) to detect hypoxia induced early warning signals of CPD before the catastrophic deterioration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human microvascular endothelial tissues microarray datasets (GSE11341) of lung and cardiac expose to hypoxia (1% O2) for 3, 24 and 48 h were retrieved from the public repository. The time dependent differentially expressed genes were subjected to tissue specificity and promoter analysis to filtrate the noise levels in the networks and to dissect the tissue specific hypoxia induced genes. These filtered out genes were used to construct the dynamic segmentation networks. The hypoxia induced dynamic differentially expressed genes were validated in the lung and heart tissues of male rats. These rats were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (simulated altitude of 25,000 or PO2 - 282 mm of Hg) progressively for 3, 24 and 48 h. KEY FINDINGS: To identify the temporal key genes regulated in hypoxia, we ranked the dominant genes based on their consolidated topological features from tissue specific networks, time dependent networks and dynamic networks. Overall topological ranking described VEGFA as a single node dynamic hub and strongly communicated with tissue specific genes to carry forward their tissue specific information. We named this type of VEGFAcentric dynamic networks as \\"V-DNBs\\". As a proof of principle, our methodology helped us to identify the V-DNBs specific for lung and cardiac tissues namely V-DNBL and V-DNBC respectively. SIGNIFICANCE: Our experimental studies identified VEGFA, SLC2A3, ADM and ENO2 as the minimum and sufficient candidates of V-DNBL. The dynamic expression patterns could be readily exploited to capture the pre disease state of hypoxia induced pulmonary vascular remodelling. Whereas in V-DNBC the minimum and sufficient candidates are VEGFA, SCL2A3, ADM, NDRG1, ENO2 and BHLHE40. The time dependent single node expansion indicates V-DNBC could also be the pre disease state pathological hallmark for hypoxia-associated cardiovascular remodelling.

METHODS: Seventy-eight residents and 106 staff members, na?ve or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, were recruited in NH in Belgium before immunization with two doses of 30g BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine at day 0 and day 21. Binding antibodies (Ab) to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), spike domains S1 and S2, RBD Ab avidity, and neutralizing Ab against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and B.1.351 were assessed at days 0, 21, 28, and 49. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 na?ve residents had lower Ab responses to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination than na?ve staff. These poor responses involved lower levels of IgG to all spike domains, lower avidity of RBD IgG, and lower levels of Ab neutralizing the vaccine strain. No na?ve resident had detectable neutralizing Ab to the B.1.351 variant. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infected residents had high responses to mRNA vaccination, with Ab levels comparable to infected staff. Cluster analysis revealed that poor vaccine responders not only included na?ve residents but also na?ve staff, emphasizing the heterogeneity of responses to mRNA vaccination in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The poor Ab responses to mRNA vaccination observed in infection na?ve residents and in some na?ve staff members of NH suggest suboptimal protection against breakthrough infection, especially with variants of concern. These data support the administration of a third dose of mRNA vaccine to further improve protection of NH residents against COVID-19.","output":"Poor antibody response to BioNTech/Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 na?ve residents of nursing homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several healthcare systems facing respiratory viral infections outbreaks, like COVID-19, have not been prepared to manage them. Public health mitigation solutions ranging from isolation of infected or suspected cases to implementation of national lockdowns have proven their effectiveness for the outbreak's control. However, the adjustment of public health measures is crucial during transition phases to avoid new outbreaks. To address the need for designing evidence-based strategies, we performed a systematic review to identify healthcare systems interventions, experiences and recommendations that have been used to manage different respiratory viral infections outbreaks in the past. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane were searched to retrieve eligible studies of any study design, published in English until 17 April 2020. Double-blinded screening process was conducted by titles/abstracts and subsequently eligible full texts were read and pertinent data were extracted. When applicable, quality assessment was conducted for the included articles. We performed a narrative synthesis of each implemented public health approaches. RESULTS: We included a total of 24 articles addressing the public health approaches implemented for respiratory viral infections outbreaks for COVID-19, influenza A H1N1, MERS and severe acute respiratory syndrome . The identified approaches are ascribable to two main categories: healthcare system strategies and healthcare provider interventions. The key components of an effective response on respiratory viral outbreaks included the implementation of evidence-based contextual policies, intrahospital management actions, community healthcare facilities, non-pharmaceutical interventions, enhanced surveillance, workplace preventive measures, mental health interventions and communication plans. CONCLUSION: The identified healthcare system strategies applied worldwide to face epidemics or pandemics are a useful knowledge base to inform decision-makers about control measures to be used in the transition phases of COVID-19 and beyond.","output":"How health systems approached respiratory viral pandemics over time: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is characterized by fever and cough, in addition to affecting the lower respiratory tract and being associated with age, comorbidities and a weakened immune system Lymphopenias occur in severe cases and an excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, which would explain the role of the hyperinflammatory response in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of the disease, so we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections, as well as some infections due to viruses, general treatments, specific coronavirus treatments and antiviral treatments should be useful in the fight against COVID-19, the therapeutic agents evaluated included chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, nelfinavir, ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma Yeni koronavirsn (COVID-19) neden oldu?u hastal?k, alt solunum yolunu etkilemesine ve ya?, komorbiditeler ve zay?flam ba?kl?k sistemi ile ili?kili olmas?n?n yan? s?ra ate? ve ?ksrk ile karakterizedir Lenfopeniler ?iddetli vakalarda ortaya kar ve ar? inflamatuar sitokin retimi, COVID-19'un patogenezinde hiperinflamatuar yan?t?n roln aklar Bu virs i?in tedavi olmadnda, hastaln yay?lmas?n? kontrol etmek i?in alternatif y?ntemler bulmaya acil ihtiya? vard?r, bu nedenle koronavirs enfeksiyonlar?yla ilgili tm tedavi se?enekleri ve virslere ba?l? baz? enfeksiyonlar i?in ?evrimi?i bir ara?t?rma yapt?k COVID-19 ile mcadelede genel tedaviler, spesifik koronavirs tedavileri ve antiviral tedaviler yararl? olmal?d?r;de?erlendirilen terap?tik ajanlar aras?nda klorokin / hidroksiklorokin, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, rivabirin, interferonlar, nelfinavir, ivermektin, monoklonal antikorlar ve iyile?en plazma yer almaktad?r [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Turkish Journal of Biochemistry / Turk Biyokimya Dergisi is the property of De Gruyter and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Therapeutic agents currently employed against Covid-19: an effort to control the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction With the outbreak of coronavirus, the number of patients who referred to the pain clinic for follow-up was much higher than before, which coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic However, due to incomplete knowledge regarding the virus and its effects, patients did not follow up to the pain Methods We present case of 8 patients who were treated previously for chronic pain (complete remission) Results During the pandemic, these patients were presented to our center presenting identical pain, that did not respond to the conservative therapy Owing to the symptoms, these patients were screened and tested positive for COVID19 Two of the patients died whereas, symptoms were improved in other patients Conclusion Patients with the history of chronic pain may present relapse as a result of the infection or infection can trigger previous chronic pain among patients with risk factors","output":"Does COVID19 activates previous chronic pain?

The objective of this study was to determine the outcomes of patients treated with bioabsorbable polymer everolimus-eluting (BP-EES; Synergy, Boston Scientific), durable polymer everolimus-eluting (DP-EES; XIENCE, Abbott Vascular), or durable polymer zotarolimus-eluting (DP-ZES; Resolute, Medtronic) stents in routine clinical practice. METHODS All percutaneous coronary intervention cases from 48 hospitals performed after the introduction of the BP-EES stent in 2015 until the first quarter of 2018 were included. Propensity-matched multivariable analysis was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics and procedural variables. After matching, we performed pair-wise comparisons between DP-EES and BP-EES, DP-EES and DP-ZES, and BP-EES and DP-ZES for in-hospital postpercutaneous coronary intervention outcomes. We also evaluated 2-year postdischarge mortality in a subset of patients who could be matched to Medicare data. RESULTS During the study period, 53 724 percutaneous coronary intervention cases were performed. A total of 59% of patients were treated with DP-EES stents, 14% with BP-EES stents, and 27% with DP-ZES stents. Although baseline characteristics of patients differed between stent types, these differences were attenuated after matching. In the matched cohort, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality, stent thrombosis, or postprocedural stroke (a falsification end point) between BP-EES, DP-EES, and DP-ZES. After matching, there was no difference in 2-year postdischarge mortality (DP-EES versus BP-EES hazard ratio 0.91, P=0.50; DP-EES versus DP-ZES hazard ratio 1.03, P=0.77; BP-EES versus DP-ZES hazard ratio 1.20, P=0.29). CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest similar risk-adjusted in-hospital outcomes among drug-eluting stent platforms commonly used in clinical practice. The absence of a difference in 2-year mortality between BP-EES, DP-EES, and DP-ZES suggests that stent choice decisions could be made based on other factors, including durability, availability, and cost.","output":"Comparative Safety of Bioabsorbable Polymer Everolimus-Eluting, Durable Polymer Everolimus-Eluting, and Durable Polymer Zotarolimus-Eluting Stents in Contemporary Clinical Practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experimental psychology research typically employs methods that greatly simplify the real-world conditions within which cognition occurs.

In recent years, technology has advanced to provide a solution to these problems, through the development of affordable high-capability virtual reality (VR) equipment. The application of VR is now increasing rapidly in psychology, but the realism of its avatars, and the extent to which they visually represent real people, is captured poorly in current VR experiments. Here, we demonstrate a user-friendly method for creating photo-realistic avatars of real people and provide a series of studies to demonstrate their psychological characteristics. We show that avatar faces of familiar people are recognised with high accuracy (Study 1), replicate the familiarity advantage typically observed in real-world face matching (Study 2), and show that these avatars produce a similarity-space that corresponds closely with real photographs of the same faces (Study 3).

This study examined the prevalence of psychological distress among smokers following the onset of the pandemic compared with previous years. Methods: Cross-sectional data were used from a representative survey of smokers (18+) in England (n = 2,927) during four months (April to July) in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Adjusted logistic regressions estimated the associations between past-month psychological distress across two time periods (2016/17 and 2020), and age. Weighted proportions, chi-squared statistics and stratified logistic regression models were used to compare the distributions of minimal, moderate and severe distress, respectively, within socio-demographic and smoking characteristic categories in 2016/17 and 2020. Results: The prevalence of moderate and severe distress among past-year smokers was higher in 2020 (moderate: 28.79%, 95%CI 26.11-31.60; OR=2.08, 95%CI 1.34-3.25; severe: 11.04%, 9.30-13.12; OR=2.16, 1.13-4.07) than in 2016/17 (moderate: 20.66%, 19.02-22.43; severe: 8.23%, 7.16-9.47). While there was no overall evidence of an interaction between time period and age, young (16-24 years) and middle-age groups (45-54 years) may have experienced greater increases in moderate and older age groups (65+ years) in severe distress from 2016/17 to 2020. There were also increases in 2020 of moderate distress among those from more disadvantaged social grades and of both moderate and severe distress among women and those with low cigarette addiction. Conclusions: Between April-July 2016/17 and April-July 2020 in England there were increases in both moderate and severe distress among smokers. The distribution of distress differed between 2016/17 and 2020 and represents a widening of established inequalities, with increases in distress among socio-economically disadvantaged groups, women and diverging age groups.","output":"Smoking, distress and COVID-19 in England: cross-sectional population surveys from 2016 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of infectious disease outbreaks on mental health among health care workers is wellestablished Minimal research has focused on health care trainees' well-being, especially during unprecedented events such as the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) Trainees are vulnerable to inherent power and resource differentials, which may exacerbate stress The present study used a mixed methods approach to examine mental health symptoms, perceived safety, and ongoing and desired support among a national sample of psychology interns, psychology intern and postdoctoral trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 400) Participants reported clinically elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms Participants working on-site who felt that their health or safety was at risk reported more anxiety symptoms Most common workplace safety concerns included inadequate protection against risk and face-to-face patient care requirements Trainees desired more support, better communication, more remote work and telehealth options, and flexibility in training requirements Themes also emerged related to supervisor pressure and disregard of trainees' concerns Results have significant implications for the training environment and quality of patient care Increased support of psychology trainees is vital during the current and potential future public health crises ? 2020 American Psychological Association","output":"Giving Psychology Trainees a Voice During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Trainee Mental Health, Perceived Safety, and Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has been widely used since 1980 in enteral feeding of patients that are not able to be fed orally for a long time.

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN 265 patients with PEG who were followed up by the clinical nutrition team of a university hospital between 2010-2018 were evaluated retrospectively. Nutritional Risk Screening-2002 (NRS-2002) test, anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis and laboratory data were used to evaluate the patients' nutritional status. RESULTS The most common indications for PEG were dementia (35.1%), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (22.6%), stroke (15.8%), and cancer (14%). The mean body weight of the patients was increased after PEG (63.512.2 vs 62.012.7 kg). Mid upper arm circumference and calf circumference of the patients increased after PEG (27.52.5 vs 25.43.1 cm and 32.27.9 vs 29.65.9 cm, respectively). Serum albumin of the patients was increased significantly after PEG (3.340.69 g/dL to 3.640.65 g/dL) without any significant change in serum CRP. Subgroup analyses showed a significant increase in the mean serum albumin of patients with dementia after PEG (3.230.67 g/dL to 3.540.58 g/dL).

Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2-expressing cells, whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X-inactivation events. This sex-based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS-coV-2 infection to COVID-19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exist in people. Though the rs4646116 (p.Lys26Arg) allele is found in 1 in 70 Ashkenazi Jewish males, and in 1 in 172 non-Finnish European males, this allele is found at higher frequencies in females. Furthermore, the class of missense ACE2 alleles predicted to affect SARS-CoV-2 binding are found in aggregate among 1.43% and 2.16% of Ashkenazi males and females, respectively, as well as in 0.58% and 1.24% of European males and females outside of Finland. These alleles are rarer in other population groups, and almost absent from East Asians genotyped to date. Though we are aware that full genome-wide and exome-wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 fully, we argue on the basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical SARS-CoV-2 diseases, such as asymptomatic super-spreaders (if any are identified), and in neonatal/paediatric-onset COVID-19 disease. Even relatively rare susceptibility factors (1% or fewer carriers) may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections. A small number of asymptomatic carriers, or a small number of super-spreaders, or a small segment of the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care, can magnify the medical, social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size. The speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes, including efforts to identify genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts.","output":"ACE 2 Coding Variants: A Potential X-linked Risk Factor for COVID-19 Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world reflects upon one year since the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and prepare for and experience surges in cases, it is important to identify the most crucial ethical issues that might lie ahead so that countries are able to plan accordingly Some ethical issues are rather obvious to predict, such as the ethical issues surrounding the use of immunity certificates, contact tracing, and the fair allocation of vaccines globally Yet, the most significant ethical challenge that the world must address in the next year and beyond is to ensure that we learn the ethical lessons of the first year of this pandemic Learning from our collective experiences thus far constitutes our greatest moral obligation Appreciating that decision-making in the context of a pandemic is constrained by unprecedented complexity and uncertainty, beginning in June 2020, an international group of 17 experts in bioethics spanning 15 countries (including low-, middle-, and high-income countries) met virtually to identify what we considered to be the most significant ethical challenges and accompanying lessons faced thus far in the COVID-19 pandemic Once collected, the group met over the course of several virtual meetings to identify challenges and lessons that are analytically distinct in order to identify common ethical themes under which different challenges and lessons could be grouped The result, described in this paper, is what this expert group consider to be the top five ethical lessons from the initial experience with COVID-19 that must be learned","output":"Top five ethical lessons of COVID-19 that the world must learn"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present research investigated a backfiring effect of social interaction on well-being and general confidence in Western populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Little is known about the alveolar pressures, lung volumes, and expiratory flow rates generated by the MIE when used via tracheostomy tube in infants and children. METHODS A high-fidelity mechanical lung model was programmed to simulate infants with tracheostomy tubes. Generated pressures, volumes, and expiratory flows using the MIE device at variable insufflation/exsufflation pressures and times were recorded. The primary measure of interest was maximal expiratory flow (MEF). RESULTS Pressure equilibration across the tracheostomy tube did not occur with insufflation time <1 sec. Longer insufflation time significantly increased measured alveolar pressures, lung volume, and MEF until TLC was reached. Longer exsufflation time did not significantly increase MEF. Higher insufflation pressures resulted in greater lung volumes, with >70% vital capacity attained at insufflation pressures as low as 20 cmH2 O. Though higher insufflation pressures resulted in increased expiratory flow rates, more negative exsufflation pressure had a greater absolute impact on MEF. CONCLUSIONS Using the MIE via tracheostomy tube in an infant lung model, we found that an insufflation time of >1 sec is required for equilibration of insufflation pressure and alveolar pressure. Longer exsufflation time does not significantly alter MEF. Higher insufflation and exsufflation pressures both increased MEF, but greater exsufflation pressure had more substantial impact.","output":"Use of a lung model to assess mechanical in-exsufflator therapy in infants with tracheostomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID 19 pneumonia commonly leads to ARDS.

Higher counts of CD4 and CD8 with Lower Levels of TNF-a, IL2R, IL6, IL8 were observed on patients with good prognosis compared to patients with poor prognosis; -0.57 (pg/mL) (-1.10, -0.04, p = 0.04), (I2 91%, p < 0.001); -579.84 (U/mL) (-930.11, -229.57, p < 0.001), (I2 96%, p < 0.001); -1.49 (pg/mL) (-1.97, -1.01, p < 0.001), (I2 94%, p < 0.001); -0.80 (pg/mL) (-1.21, -0.40, p < 0.001), (I2 79%, p < 0.001); -2.51 (pg/mL) (-3.64, -1.38, p < 0.00001), (I2 98%, p < 0.001) respectively. Meta-regression showed age and hypertension (coefficient: 1.99, and -1.57, p = 0.005, and 0.006) significantly influenced association between IL-6 and poor outcome. CONCLUSION: Elevated immune response to coronavirus occurs in COVID 19 patients. Higher counts of CD4 and CD8 were seen in patients with good prognosis compared to patients with poor prognosis, with Lower levels of TNF-a, IL2R, IL6, IL8, were observed in patients with good prognosis compared to patients with poor prognosis.","output":"Elevated interleukin levels are associated with higher severity and mortality in COVID 19 - A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disorders involving injury to tissue stem cells that ensure normal tissue homeostasis and repair have potential to show unusually devastating clinical consequences. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is one condition where relatively few cytotoxic immune cells target skin stem cells to produce significant morbidity and mortality. By analogy, SARS-CoV-2 is a vector that initially homes to pulmonary stem cells that preferentially express the ACE2 receptor, thus potentially incurring similarly robust pathological consequences. In older individuals, stem cell number and/or function become depleted due to pathways independent of disease-related injury to these subpopulations. Accordingly, pathologic targeting of stem cells in conditions like aGVHD and COVID-19 infection where these cells are already deficient due to the aging process may have dire consequences in elderly individuals. A hypothesis is herein advanced that, as with aGVHD, lung stem cell targeting is a potential co-factor in explaining age-related severity of COVID-19 infection.","output":"COVID-19 and graft-versus-host disease: a tale of two diseases (and why age matters)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Yellow head virus (YHV) is a major agent of disease in farmed penaeid shrimp.

Two different staining methods indicated that the gp116 and gp64 proteins are glycosylated. Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence of ORF3, which encodes a polypeptide of 1666 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 185 713 Da (pI=6.68). Hydropathy analysis of the deduced ORF3 protein sequence identified six potential transmembrane helices and three ectodomains containing multiple sites for potential N-linked and O-linked glycosylation. N-terminal sequence analysis of mature gp116 and gp64 proteins indicated that each was derived from ORF3 by proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein between residues Ala(228) and Thr(229), and Ala(1127) and Leu(1128), located at the C-terminal side of transmembrane helices 3 and 5, respectively. Comparison with the deduced ORF3 protein sequence of Australian gill-associated virus (GAV) indicated 83 % amino acid identity in gp64 and 71 % identity in gp116, which featured two significant sequence deletions near the N terminus.

This case report will describe the rare occurrence of a PLA producing septic shock in a 36-year-old male residing in the United Kingdom following a case of complicated appendicitis. The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with a three-week history of intermittent loose stools, cramping abdominal pain, recurrent fevers, a heart rate of 111 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 94/58 mmHg, and a fever of 40.1 degrees Celsius. Despite prompt broad spectrum antibiotic administration and three liters of fluid resuscitation, the patient remained shocked which led to an ICU admission. A CT scan prior to transfer found a 7 cm x 6 cm x 6 cm lesion representing a liver abscess (LA) as well as gross inflammatory change affecting the distal small bowel. The LA was managed through insertion of a percutaneous drain under ultrasound guidance performed by the interventional radiology team, as well as ongoing IV antibiotics. Following growth of the gut commensal Streptococcus constellatus from the abscess fluid culture, a colonoscopy was performed which found a severely distorted and inflamed terminal ileum with an impassable stricture, raising not only the suspicion of appendicitis but also Crohns disease. Following the colonoscopy, after a total of 10 days admission, the patient was allowed to go home with a four-week course of oral co-amoxiclav. After discharge, the patients case was discussed in the gastroenterology inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) multi-disciplinary team meeting due to concerns raised about possible Crohns disease from the admission CT and following colonoscopy findings. Given the absence of relevant IBD symptoms, a reassuring outpatient MRI small bowel scan (found considerable resolution of the right iliac fossa inflammatory process) and a fecal calprotectin of 29 four months post discharge (normal=0-51 g/g), it was concluded the terminal ileum changes were most likely accounted for by a complicated course of appendicitis.

In keeping with this hypothesis was the finding that the antiviral and cytocidal effects of Ce-Cyd are readily reversed by Cyd and, to a lesser extent, Urd, but not by other nucleosides such as dThd or dCyd. In contrast, pyrazofurin and 6-azauridine, two nucleoside analogues that are assumed to interfere with OMP decarboxylase, another enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, potentiate the cytocidal activity of Ce-Cyd.

Despite this focus on the body, engagement with the strong embodiment hypotheses emerging out of neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy has been limited to only selective theoretical borrowings with practically no attention given to the burgeoning empirical evidence of the relationship between body, mind, and environment. While the neural turn within the discipline has been acknowledged, the flow of influence is found to be largely unidirectional, where cognitive science, and the neurogovernance that stems from it, pays scant attention to the contingencies of spatial lives. At the same time, geographers have been critical of the universalising tendencies and narrow empiricism of neuroscience.

Understanding its spreading dynamics is of fundamental importance for both public health and scientific researches. Recent studies have focused mainly on evaluation and prediction of on-going spreading, which strongly depends on detailed information about the structure of social contacts, human traveling patterns and biological activity of virus, etc. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we analyzed the distributions of confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) in different levels and find the Zipf's law and Heaps' law. Similar scaling properties were also observed for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird cases of H5N1. We also found a hierarchical spreading pattern from countries with larger population and GDP to countries with smaller ones. We proposed a model that considers generic control effects on both the local growth and transregional transmission, without the need of the above mentioned detailed information. We studied in detail the impact of control effects and heterogeneity on the spreading dynamics in the model and showed that they are responsible for the scaling and hierarchical spreading properties observed in empirical data. Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis and modeling showed that although strict control measures for interregional travelers could delay the outbreak in the regions without local cases, the focus should be turned to local prevention after the outbreak of local cases. Target control on a few regions with the largest number of active interregional travelers can efficiently prevent the spreading.

The findings of this study revealed few cases of community building experiences among women scientists within the studied countries. Evidence also showed the emergence of shared patterns in terms of barriers and disincentives to participating in such communities. Meanwhile, data collected from the few existing community groups is used to identify successful incentives and motivations. The analysis of the collected data offered relevant implications for Science Diplomacy. Most respondents referred to the Organization of Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD) as one of the main organizations that can impact and further Science Diplomacy. This organization promotes international engagement and networking among women scientists from developing countries across regions and this article shows how this has been used to foster women science community building in Central America. Exploring similar practices in-depth may offer opportunities to overcome traditional barriers and build further gender equality in science in Central America.","output":"Participation in Communities of Women Scientists in Central America: Implications From the Science Diplomacy Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dysbiosis in the human gastrointestinal microbial community could functionally impact microbial metabolism and colonization resistance to pathogens. To further elucidate the indicators of microbial strain dysbiosis, we have developed an analytic method that detects patterns of presence/absence of selected KEGG metabolic pathways for a selected strain (PKS). Using a metagenomic data set consisting of multiple high-density fecal samples from six normal individuals, we found three had unique PKS for important gut commensal microbes, Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides uniformis, at all sample times examined. Two individuals had multiple shared PKS clusters of B. vulgatus or B. uniformis over time. Analysis of a data set of high-density fecal samples from eight COVID-19 hospitalized patients taken over a short period revealed that two patients had shared PKS clusters for B. vulgatus and one shared cluster for B. uniformis. Our analysis demonstrates that while the majority of normal individuals with no B. vulgatus or B. uniformis strain change over time have unique PKS, in some healthy humans and patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we detected shared PKS clusters at the different times suggesting a slowing down of the intrinsic rates of strain variation that could eventually lead to a dysbiosis in the microbial strain community.","output":"Early indicators of microbial strain dysbiosis in the human gastrointestinal microbial community of certain healthy humans and hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common type of sleep-disordered breathing associated with multiple comorbidities.

The indicators calculated were: 1. rate ratio (RR) for NCH vs non-NCH, adjusted by gender, age, chronic diseases number, at least 1 hospitalisation, at least 1 Emergency room access in the previous year, for 2018, 2019, and 2020; 2. adjusted RR, 2019 and 2020 vs 2018, both sub-cohorts (i.e., NCH and non-NCH). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES first four-month period mortality of the considered years. RESULTS aproximately 100,000 inhabitants by year, 7% in NCH. In the 2020 first four-month period, 4,343 deaths occurred of which 45% in NCH. RR in NCH population vs non-NCH for the year 2018 was 2.13 (95%CI 1.94-2.34); for the year 2019 was 2.70 (95%CI 2.43-3.00); for the year 2020 was 6.98 (95%CI 6,49-7,50). Adjusted RR for NCH population in 2020 vs 2018 was 2.22 (95%CI 2.05-2.42) in the whole ATS Val Padana; 1.58 (95%CI 1.40-1.77) in Mantua Province; 2.93 (2.62-3.27) in Cremona Province.

Using the concept of urban rhythms, the data show that the lockdown has intensified existing pressures of living in a smaller home C lack of space for different functions and household members C whilst constraining coping strategies, like spending time outside the home. Lockdown restrictions governing mobility and contact acted as a mechanism of exception, disrupting habitual patterns of life and sociability, and forcing people to spend more time in smaller homes that struggled to accommodate different functions, affecting home atmospheres.

So, it is important for diabetic patients affected by COVID-19 to eat a healthy balanced diet to maintain stable blood glucose levels and enhance their immune functions.

Like any other country globally, India is also encountering an uphill task to fight against this unfortunate pandemic, with six million-plus COVID-19 cumulative infected cases by the first week of October 2020. This publication elucidates the use of four state-of-art models, namely the Abbasov - Mamedova (AM) Fuzzy, proposed Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Auto-ARIMA, and Auto-MLP, to forecast the number of cumulative infected COVID-19 cases in India. These models exhibited high forecast accuracy for 30 days ahead scenario with MAPE ranges from 0.44 to 1.83% in the test condition, whereas a MAPE range of 1.09 to 2.39% in real-time. We estimated the COVID-19 cases fortnightly and observed that the proposed MLP exhibited the flattening of the COVID-19 curve, whereas other models exhibited a rising trend. Though our proposed MLP outperformed other models, we employed all four methods and estimated a range between 8.53 to 13.77 million COVID-19 positives by 4th January 2021 in India. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Forecasting COVID-19 Outbreak in India Using Time Series Dataset: An Ensemble of ARIMA, Abbasov-Mamedova, and Multilayer Perceptron Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reviews published over the past decade confirm tobacco control campaigns can be effective for influencing adult and youth tobacco use behaviours, with strengthening evidence for high cost-effectiveness.

Trapping of the parent artery may have a risk of ischemic complications due to intracranial perfusion disorders. We successfully treated 24 patients with large CCAs using a flow diverter (Pipeline? embolic device: PED), and this report discusses the safety and efficacy of this method. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty four patients (23 females, mean age 71.5 years old) with large CCAs, including 6 giant CCAs, were treated with a PED over three years. Under sufficient dual anti-platelet management, the PED was deployed over the orifice of the aneurysm. Two patients required multiple telescoping stents. Clinical and radiological states were checked with MRI at 1, 3 and 6 months post-surgically. Angiographic follow-up was performed at 6 months. RESULTS In all patients, PED was appropriately deployed. Stagnation of contrast with eclipse signs was observed post-angiogram in 21 cases. One patient requiring 5 telescoping stents experienced temporary ischemic symptoms. Fourteen patients experienced improvement of ocular motor impairment deficiency, including 6 patients who recovered. Angiograms at 6 months follow-up showed complete occlusion in 63% (12/19) of patients, and MRI showed reduction of aneurysm volume in 89% (17/19) of patients. CONCLUSION Flow diverters for large CCAs showed promising clinical and radiological efficacy. They can shrink the aneurysm and improve symptoms without sacrificing the parent artery.

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency and risk and protective factors of psychological distress, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this group. Data comes from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The analytic sample consisted of 9687 individuals with no prior history of a mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19-24, 2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3 days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms. Risk factors for higher distress included searching online or using social media to post about coronavirus, reporting that the outbreak caused major changes to personal life, and perception that the virus was a threat to the US economy, the individual's personal health or finances.

Although GCs provide only symptomatic relief and do not eliminate the cause of the pathology, in the majority of treatments, GCs frequently cannot be replaced by other classes of drugs. Consequently, long-term treatments cause adverse effects that may, in turn, lead to new pathologies that sometimes require the withdrawal of GC therapy. Therefore, thus far, researchers have focused their efforts on molecules that have the same efficacy as that of GCs but cause fewer adverse effects. To this end, some GC-induced proteins, such as glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), have been used as drugs in mouse models of inflammatory pathologies. In this review, we focus on some important but rare autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases for which the biomedical research investment in new therapies is less likely. Additionally, we critically evaluate the possibility of treating such diseases with other drugs, either GC-related or unrelated.","output":"A Glance at the Use of Glucocorticoids in Rare Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases: Still an Indispensable Pharmacological Tool?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the proportion of lateral flow tests (LFTs) that produce negative results in those with a high risk of infectiousness from SARS-CoV-2, to investigate the impact of the stage and severity of disease, and to compare predictions made by influential mathematical models with findings of empirical studies. DESIGN: Linked data analysis combining empirical evidence of the accuracy of the Innova LFT, the probability of positive viral culture or transmission to secondary cases, and the distribution of viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals in different settings. SETTING: Testing of individuals with symptoms attending NHS Test-and-Trace centres across the UK, residents without symptoms attending municipal mass testing centres in Liverpool, and students without symptoms screened at the University of Birmingham. PARTICIPANTS: Evidence for the sensitivity of the Innova LFT, based on 70 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 and LFT results. Infectiousness was based on viral culture rates on 246 samples (176 people with SARS-CoV-2) and secondary cases among 2 474 066 contacts; distributions of cycle threshold (Ct) values from 231 497 index individuals attending NHS Test-and-Trace centres; 70 people with SARS-CoV-2 detected in Liverpool and 62 people with SARS-CoV-2 in Birmingham (54 imputed). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The predicted proportions who were missed by LFT and viral culture positive and missed by LFT and sources of secondary cases, in each of the three settings. Predictions were compared with those made by mathematical models. RESULTS: The analysis predicted that of those with a viral culture positive result, Innova would miss 20% attending an NHS Test-and-Trace centre, 29% without symptoms attending municipal mass testing, and 81% attending university screen testing without symptoms, along with 38%, 47%, and 90% of sources of secondary cases. In comparison, two mathematical models underestimated the numbers of missed infectious individuals (8%, 10%, and 32% in the three settings for one model, whereas the assumptions from the second model made it impossible to miss an infectious individual). Owing to the paucity of usable data, the inputs to the analyses are from limited sources. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of infectious people with SARS-CoV-2 missed by LFTs is substantial enough to be of clinical importance. The proportion missed varied between settings because of different viral load distributions and is likely to be highest in those without symptoms. Key models have substantially overestimated the sensitivity of LFTs compared with empirical data. An urgent need exists for additional robust well designed and reported empirical studies from intended use settings to inform evidence based policy.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 antigen lateral flow tests for detecting infectious people: linked data analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 vara ampliamente con la edad, siendo generalmente ms severa en los adultos mayores.

Free and voluntary testing was performed at 14 +/- 3 day intervals, over a 4-week window at each site, utilizing a lab-developed ELISA based on the Epitope Diagnostics COVID-19 nucleocapsid IgG detection Kit. We identified 253 SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive individuals among 10,019 total participants, representing a cross-sectional seroprevalence of 2.53%. Subgroup analysis identified differential seropositivity by job role, ranging from 8.03% among housekeepers, odds ratio 3.17 (95% CI 1.59-5.71), to 0.00% among anesthesiologists, odds ratio 0.00 (95% CI 0-0.26), both of which were significant.

Overall, these findings demonstrate relatively low seroprevalence and very low seroconversion rates among HCW in Oregon, USA, over a period in which aggressive social distancing measures were in place. The high rate of seroreversion observed in this cohort, and the relatively high discordance between SARS-CoV-2 serology and swab qPCR, highlight limitations of current detection methods, and stress the need for development of novel assessment methodologies to more accurately identify exposure (and/or immunity) to SARS-CoV-2 in this population.","output":"Longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance of over ten thousand health care workers in the Providence Oregon cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In light of the existing preliminary evidence of a link between Covid-19 and poor air quality, which is largely based upon correlations, we estimate the relationship between long term air pollution exposure and Covid-19 in 355 municipalities in the Netherlands.

STAT1-GOF (c 983AG p H328R) with severe total parenteral dependent enteropathy that led to growth failure (weight 28 5kg) Treatment with ruxolitinib led to resolution of diarrhea, return of normal diet, and catch up growth A dose of 12 5mg twice daily was initially started but was decreased to 12 5mg every morning and 10 mg every evening due to elevated transaminases and thrombocytopenia Over the following year the patient thrived gaining 7 5kg with normal every other day stools Despite weight gain, he remained stable on the same dose of ruxolitinib As he outgrew his dose, he developed an increased frequency of upper respiratory infections (Parainfluenza, Coronavirus, Rhinovirus) One year after initiation of ruxolitinib, he again developed profuse watery diarrhea that was Norovirus positive (weight 36kg, BSA 0 9) He was placed on bowel rest and ruxolitinib was dose escalated with a goal of 15mg/m2/day When he reached 15mg twice daily, enteropathy completely resolved but liver function tests began to rise He gained weight and began thriving after 2 weeks of therapy Six months later, enteropathy is controlled, and transaminases have remained elevated (ALT 88 IU/L, AST 73 IU/ml) but stable The appropriate dose and pharmacokinetics for ruxolitinib for the treatment of immunodysregulatory symptoms in pediatric patients has not been thoroughly studied The dose used was extrapolated from data on the use of ruxolitinib in pediatric myelofibrosis A dose of 15mg/m2/day appears to provide the most benefit with tolerable adverse effects This dose should be maintained in

The novel coronavirus [10] is just the latest example. A new viral outbreak can be unpredictable, and development of specific defense tools and countermeasures against the new virus remains time-consuming even in today's era of modern medical science and technology. In the lack of effective and specific medication or vaccination, it would be desirable to have a nonspecific protocol or substance to render the virus inactive, a substance/protocol, which could be applied whenever a new viral outbreak occurs. This is especially important in cases when the emerging new virus is as infectious as SARS-CoV-2 [4]. Aims and structure of the present communication: In this editorial, we propose to consider the possibility of developing and implementing antiviral protocols by applying high purity aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO2) solutions. The aim of this proposal is to initiate research that could lead to the introduction of practical and effective antiviral protocols. To this end, we first discuss some important properties of the ClO2 molecule, which make it an advantageous antiviral agent, then some earlier results of ClO2 gas application against viruses will be reviewed. Finally, we hypothesize on methods to control the spread of viral infections using aqueous ClO2 solutions.","output":"Can chlorine dioxide prevent the spreading of coronavirus or other viral infections?

We assessed the potential of BIVA for monitoring daily body hydration fluctuations in nine healthy, normally active males under matching normoxic (NX) and hypobaric hypoxic (HH) experimental conditions. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate whether changes in BIVA may correspond with the development of acute mountain sickness (AMS). Subjects were exposed in a hypobaric chamber to both NX (corresponding to an altitude of 262 m) and HH conditions corresponding to an altitude of 3500 m during two four-day sojourns within which food, water intake and physical activity were controlled. Bioimpedance and body weight measurements were performed three times a day and medical symptoms were assessed every morning using the Lake Louise score (LLS). Total body water (TBW) was also assessed on the last day of both sojourns using the deuterium dilution technique. We detected circadian changes in vector length, indicating circadian body water variations that did not differ between NX and HH conditions (ANOVA effects: time: p = 0.018, eta(2) = 0.149; interaction: p = 0.214, eta(2) = 0.083; condition: p = 0.920, eta(2) = 0.001). Even though none of the subjects developed AMS, four subjects showed clinical symptoms according to the LLS during the first 24 hours of HH conditions. These subjects showed a pronounced (Cohens d: 1.09), yet not statistically significant (p = 0.206) decrease in phase angle 6 hours after exposure, which may indicate fluid shift from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment. At the end of each sojourn, vector length correlated with deuterium dilution TBW gold standard measurements (linear regression: NX: p = 0.002 and r(2) = 0.756, HH: p < 0.001 and r(2) = 0.84). BIVA can be considered a valuable method for monitoring body hydration changes at altitude. Whether such changes are related to the development of clinical symptoms associated with AMS, as indicated in the present investigation, must be confirmed in future studies.","output":"Bioelectrical Impedance Vector Analysis: A Valuable Tool to Monitor Daily Body Hydration Dynamics at Altitude"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gene-based approaches for protein replacement therapies have the potential to reduce the number of administrations. Our previous work demonstrated that expression could be enhanced and/or the applied voltage reduced by preheating the tissue prior to pulse administration. In the current study, we utilized our 16-pin multi-electrode array (MEA) and incorporated nine optical fibers, connected to an infrared laser, between each set of four electrodes to heat the tissue to 43 C. For proof of principle, a guinea pig model was used to test delivery of reporter genes. We observed that when the skin was preheated, it was possible to achieve the same expression levels as gene electrotransfer without preheating, but with a 23% reduction of applied voltage or a 50% reduction of pulse number. With respect to expression distribution, preheating allowed for delivery to the deep dermis and muscle. This suggested that this cutaneous delivery approach has the potential to achieve expression in the systemic circulation, thus this protocol was repeated using a plasmid encoding Human Factor IX. Elevated Factor IX serum protein levels were detected by ELISA up to 100 days post gene delivery.

Despite its importance, it is often considered too complex and confusing. Although most people dealing with arterial blood gases (ABGs) do not usually have problems with acid-base disorder assessment, such an analysis is also carried out by other healthcare workers for whom this can be a challenging task. Many aspects may be problematic, partly due to multiple data analysis methods and no definitive statement on which one is better. According to our survey, the correctness of arterial blood gas analysis is unsatisfactory, especially in mixed disorders, which do not always manifest an obvious set of symptoms. Therefore, ABG parameters can be used as an established biomarker panel, which is considered to be a powerful tool for personalized medicine. Moreover, using different approaches to analyze acid-base disorders can lead to varying diagnoses in some cases. Because of these problems, we developed a mobile application that can spot diagnostic differences by taking into account physiological and chemical approaches, including their variants, with a corrected anion gap. The proposed application is characterized by a high percentage of correct analyses and can be an essential aid for diagnosing acid-base disturbances.","output":"ABG AssistantTowards an Understanding of Complex Acid-Base Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created unprecedented challenges to the healthcare system, religion, and alexithymic trait that impacts the psychological resilience of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the role religion and alexithymia play in mental distress and the level of happiness of psychiatric hospital healthcare workers in China amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, whether symptom dimensions (anxiety, depression, hostility, inferiority, and insomnia) are associated with the level of happiness, and a 6-month follow-up was also investigated. A total of one-hundred and ninety healthcare workers were recruited from a psychiatric hospital in Jilin, China, and 122 were followed up after 6 months. All participants filled out the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale, five-item Brief-Symptom Rating Scale, and the Chinese Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. The mental distress of healthcare workers decreased from 2.6 to 1.5% in 6-months. Religious belief was not associated with the mental distress or happiness of healthcare workers. Instead, for those whose anxiety decreased over 6 months, their social adaptation status increased. For those whose inferiority level decreased over time, their perceived level of psychological well-being and overall happiness increased. In over half a century of living in different societies, religion stabilizes the mental health of those in Taiwan amidst the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, but not in China. However, both regions found healthcare workers with alexithymic traits experienced a higher level of mental distress, implying that the collectivist culture of Confucian philosophy continues to influence the emotional expression and alexithymic traits of healthcare workers in China and Taiwan.

This study estimated the safety and reactogenicity of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine after the first dose administered to adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1592 randomly selected vaccinees from April to May 2021. A questionnaire was delivered to the vaccinees via phone calls 7 and 21 days after the first vaccine dose. RESULTS: Of the 1592 vaccinees who had the first dose, the mean age was 37.4 ( 9.6) years and 81% were males. Of all the vaccinees, 553 (34.7%) reported an adverse reaction on the first telephone call. The most common symptoms were: pain at the site of injection (485, 30.5%), musculoskeletal symptoms (438, 27.5%), skin rash (307, 19.2%), gastrointestinal symptoms (379, 23.8%) and fever (498, 31.3%). Men were more likely to report fever (76.9% vs. 23.1%; P = 0.005), skin rash (81.1% vs. 18.9%, P = 0.005) and pain at the injection site (77.3% vs. 22.7%, P < 0.0001).

Although the subcellular localization site of BMV replication has been identified, that of the capsid protein (CP) has remained elusive. In this study, the application of immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to Nicotiana benthamiana leaves expressing replication-derived BMV CP as a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion, in conjunction with antibodies to the CP and double-stranded RNA, a presumed marker of RNA replication, revealed that the subcellular localization sites of replication and CP overlap. Our temporal analysis by transmission electron microscopy of ultrastructural modifications induced in BMV-infected N. benthamiana leaves revealed a reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) incorporating large assemblies of vesicles derived from ER accumulated in the cytoplasm during BMV infection. Additionally, for the first time, we have found by ectopic expression experiments that BMV CP itself has the intrinsic property of modifying ER to induce vesicles similar to those present in BMV infections.

One hundred clinical specimens were collected from Egyptian children suffering from upper and lower respiratory viral infections in the years 2005C2006 to detect HCoV-NL63 genome using RT-PCR. All the specimens were negative for the virus. Also, a complete absence of HCoV-NL63 genome was observed in the twenty-four raw sewage samples collected from two wastewater treatment plants within Greater Cairo from February 2006 to January 2007. Using nested RT-PCR, parainfluenza virus type 1, respiratory syncytial virus type A, adenovirus type 4, and adenovirus type 7 were detected in 3%, 2%, 5%, and 2% of the clinical specimens, respectively. Of these viruses, only adenovirus type 4 was detected in 1/24 (4.17%) of the raw sewage samples, while a complete absence of the other investigated respiratory viruses was observed in the raw sewage samples. The low percentage of positivity in the clinical specimens, the concentration method of the raw sewage samples, and the indirect routes of transmission may be the reasons for the absence of respiratory viruses in raw sewage samples. On the other hand, enteric adenoviruses were detected in 21/24 (87.5%) of the raw sewage samples with a higher prevalence of adenovirus type 41 than adenovirus type 40.

In this study, we screened a library of saRNA constructs with cis-encoded innate inhibiting proteins (IIPs) and determined the effect on protein expression and immunogenicity. We observed that the PIV-5 V and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ORF4a proteins enhance protein expression 100- to 500-fold in vitro in IFN-competent HeLa and MRC5 cells. We found that the MERS-CoV ORF4a protein partially abates dose nonlinearity in vivo, and that ruxolitinib, a potent Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) inhibitor, but not the IIPs, enhances protein expression of saRNA in vivo. Both the PIV-5 V and MERS-CoV ORF4a proteins were found to enhance the percentage of resident cells in human skin explants expressing saRNA and completely rescued dose nonlinearity of saRNA. Finally, we observed that the MERS-CoV ORF4a increased the rabies virus (RABV)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer and neutralization half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) by a10-fold in rabbits, but not in mice or rats.

Psychological preparedness, the primed cognitive awareness and anticipation of dealing with emotional responses in an adverse situation, has assumed a compelling relevance during a health disaster of this magnitude. METHODS: An anonymized eSurvey was conducted in India to assess psychological preparedness toward the ongoing pandemic with a focus on knowledge, management of own and others' emotional response, and anticipatory coping mechanisms among the survey population. An adapted version of the qualitative Psychological Preparedness for Natural Disaster Scale validated by the World Health Organization was widely circulated over the Internet and various social media platforms for assessment. Results are expressed as median  standard deviation. Descriptive statistics were used and figures downloaded from surveymonkey.com. RESULTS: Of the 1120 respondents (M:F 1.7:1, age 35 years 14.1), most expressed a high level of perceived knowledge and confidence of managing COVID-19, such as awareness of the symptoms of the illness (95.1%), actions needed (94.4%), hospital to report to (88.9%), and emergency contact number (89.1%). A majority (95%) monitored regularly the news bulletins and scientific journals regarding COVID-19. However, nearly one-third (29.2%) could not assess their likelihood of developing COVID-19, and 17.5% were unaware of the difference between a mild and severe infection. Twenty-three percent (23.3%) were unfamiliar with the materials needed in an acute illness situation.

The association of anxiety and depression with difficult asthma outcomes (exacerbations, hospital admissions, asthma control, etc.) is unclear. This study assessed the clinical associations of anxiety and depression with difficult asthma outcomes in patients with a specialist diagnosis of difficult asthma. Using real-world data, we retrospectively phenotyped patients from the Wessex Asthma Cohort of Difficult Asthma (N = 441) using clinical diagnoses of anxiety and depression against those without anxiety or depression (controls). Additionally, we stratified patients by severity of psychological distress using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We found that depression and/or anxiety were reported in 43.1% of subjects and were associated with worse disease-related questionnaire scores. Each psychological comorbidity group showed differential associations with difficult asthma outcomes. Anxiety alone (7.9%) was associated with dysfunctional breathing and more hospitalisations [anxiety, median (IQR): 0 (2) vs. controls: 0 (0)], while depression alone (11.6%) was associated with obesity and obstructive sleep apnoea. The dual anxiety and depression group (23.6%) displayed multimorbidity, worse asthma outcomes, female predominance and earlier asthma onset. Worse HADS-A scores in patients with anxiety were associated with worse subjective outcomes (questionnaire scores), while worse HADS-D scores in patients with depression were associated with worse objective (ICU admissions and maintenance oral corticosteroid requirements) and subjective outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression are common in difficult asthma but exert differential detrimental effects. Difficult asthma patients with dual anxiety and depression experience worse asthma outcomes alongside worse measures of psychological distress. There is a severity-gradient association of HADS scores with worse difficult asthma outcomes. Collectively, our findings highlight the need for holistic, multidisciplinary approaches that promote early identification and management of anxiety and depression in difficult asthma patients.","output":"The Detrimental Clinical Associations of Anxiety and Depression with Difficult Asthma Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract When Wistar Furth rats are inoculated intracerebrally with the murine hepatitis virus JHM they often develop a demyelinating disease with resulting hind leg paralysis.

However, the reduction of chlorides by washing only has limited success due to the presence of insoluble Friedel's salt (FS) in the ash. Although some studies on the decomposition of FS and the application of advanced chloride removal methods to bottom ash have been reported, few studies have compared the effects of different removal methods. Moreover, due to the complex ash composition, it is also necessary to compare the effects on different ashes and pure FS. Therefore, in this study, we applied five advanced chloride removal methods to synthesized FS and two types of bottom ash (FS-High and FS-Low), and compared the effects. For both FS and bottom ash, all methods promoted chloride dissolution more than washing only. For FS, aging was the most effective method, with a Cl removal ratio of 73%. In contrast, for ash FS-High, aging increased the Cl removal ratio to 80% and decreased the Cl content to 2800 mg/kg. The FS-derived peak observed in an X-ray diffraction analysis disappeared following aging. For ash FS-Low, acid washing increased the Cl removal ratio to 64% and decreased the Cl content to 1800 mg/kg. The treatment with the highest removal ratio in each ash had the lowest pH. There was a significant correlation between pH and the Cl removal effect.

Studies were mostly triggered by simple clinical observations including futility of electrical cardioversion in persistent AF; many patients with permanent AF tolerating day-after-day 'uncontrolled' resting heart rates of up till 110 beats/min; patients being threatened more by vascular risks than AF itself; and insufficient guideline-based treatments for AF. Also the observation that recent-onset atrial fibrillation generally converts spontaneously, obviating cardioversion, triggered one of the studies. The RACE trials shifted a number of paradigms and by that could change the AF guidelines.

Existing electrical stimulation-driven cycling systems involve the paralyzed musculature but result in rapid force decline and muscle fatigue, limiting their effectiveness. This study explores the effects of selective stimulation patterns delivered through multi-contact nerve cuff electrodes on functional exercise output, with the goal of increasing work performed and power maintained within each bout of exercise. METHODS: Three people with spinal cord injury and implanted stimulation systems performed cycling trials using conventional (S-Max), low overlap (S-Low), low duty cycle (C-Max), and/or combined low overlap and low duty cycle (C-Low) stimulation patterns. Outcome measures include total work (W), end power (P(end)), power fluctuation indices (PFI), charge accumulation (Q), and efficiency (). MannCWhitney tests were used for statistical comparisons of W and P(end) between a selective pattern and S-Max. Welchs ANOVAs were used to evaluate differences in PFIs among all patterns tested within a participant (n  90 per stimulation condition). RESULTS: At least one selective pattern significantly (p < 0.05) increased W and P(end) over S-Max in each participant. All selective patterns also reduced Q and increased  compared with S-Max for all participants. C-Max significantly (p < 0.01) increased PFI, indicating a decrease in ride smoothness with low duty cycle patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Selective stimulation patterns can increase work performed and power sustained by paralyzed muscles prior to fatigue with increased stimulation efficiency. While still effective, low duty cycle patterns can cause inconsistent power outputs each pedal stroke, but this can be managed by utilizing optimized stimulation levels.

Limited literature explores preferences for animation prototypes and other content characteristics across participants in different global regions. Prior research underscores an urgent need for health communication interventions that are compelling and accessible across culturally and geographically diverse audiences. This study presents feedback from global learners on animation design preferences and other key considerations for the development of educational video content intended for global adaptation and scaling. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods, sequential explanatory design, with a qualitative descriptive approach to the analysis of the qualitative data. We recruited participants from an international group of learners enrolled in a massive open online course. Through an online quantitative survey (n = 330), we sought preferences from participants in 73 countries for animation design prototypes to be used in video-based health communication interventions. To learn more about these preferences, we conducted in-depth interviews (n = 20) with participants selected using maximum variation purposive sampling. RESULTS: Generally, respondents were willing to accept animation prototypes that were free of cultural and ethnic identifiers and believed these to be preferable for globally scalable health communication videos. Diverse representations of age, gender roles, and family structure were also preferred and felt to support inclusive messaging across cultures and global regions. Familiar-sounding voiceovers using local languages, dialects, and accents were preferred for enhancing local resonance. Across global regions, narratives were highlighted as a compelling approach to facilitating engagement and participants preferred short videos with no more than two or three health messages.

Because of this, measurements of unbound (free) and albumin-bound (bioavailable) 25(OH)D have been proposed. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the relationship between vitamin D status and mortality from COVID-19. METHODS: In this observational study conducted in Liverpool, UK, hospitalized COVID-19 patients with surplus sera available for 25(OH)D analysis were studied. Clinical data, including age, ethnicity, and comorbidities, were extracted from case notes. Serum 25(OH)D, DBP, and albumin concentrations were measured. Free and bioavailable 25(OH)D were calculated. Relationships between total, free, and bioavailable 25(OH)D and 28-day mortality were analyzed by logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 472 patients with COVID-19 included, of whom 112 (23.7%) died within 28 days. Nonsurvivors were older (mean age, 73 years; range, 34C98 years) than survivors (mean age, 65 years; range, 19C95 years; P = 0.003) and were more likely to be male (67%; P = 0.02). The frequency of vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L] was similar between nonsurvivors (71/112; 63.4%) and survivors (204/360; 56.7%; P = 0.15) but, after adjustments for age, sex, and comorbidities, increased odds for mortality were present in those with severe deficiency [25(OH)D < 25 nmol/L: OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.17C4.78] or a high 25(OH)D (100 nmol/L; OR, 4.65; 95% CI, 1.51C14.34) compared with a 25(OH)D value of 50C74 nmol/L (reference). Serum DBP levels were not associated with mortality after adjustments for 25(OH)D, age, sex, and comorbidities. Neither free nor bioavailable 25(OH)D values were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency, as commonly defined by serum 25(OH)D levels (<50 nmol/L), is not associated with increased mortality from COVID-19, but extremely low (<25 nmol/L) and high (>100 nmol/L) levels may be associated with mortality risks.

Little was known about the impact of these changes on childbearing women. AIM: To describe childbearing women's experiences of becoming a mother during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory design using semi-structured interviews was used. Women were recruited through social media and self-nominated to participate in an interview. Maximum variation sampling was used. A total of 27 interviews were conducted with women across Australia. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: The thematic analysis resulted in four primary themes and ten sub-themes. The themes were 'going it alone - having a baby was an isolating experience' ('receiving maternity care alone', 'dealing with government restrictions', and 'desiring social support'), 'advocating for self or others' ('seeking reliable information', 'valuing peersupport', and 'having to be resourceful'), 'finding a way through' ('a changed experience for all', 'managing stress and anxiety', 'requiring constant adjustments', and 'managing fear mongering'), and 'keeping safe'. CONCLUSION: Becoming a mother during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia was a profound experience for the women. Following the public health initiatives which resulted in physical distancing restrictions, isolation, and the need to provide and receive social and peer support were common experiences. Whilst public health initiatives are implemented to keep people safe, the social and emotional toll on childbearing women should be considered by healthcare professionals. Childbearing women need to be safe but also require support and reassurance.","output":"Becoming a mother in the 'new' social world in Australia during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide demand for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing resulted in a shortage of diagnostic kits. RNA extraction step constitutes a major bottleneck to perform diagnostic. The aim of this study was to assess performances of different extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays compared to a reference RT-PCR assay. The panel of evaluation consisted of 94 samples: 69 positive and 25 negative for SARS-CoV-2 by reference RT-PCR. Three extraction-free RT-PCR assays were assessed: (i) PrimeDirect? Probe RT-qPCR Mix (Takara), (ii) PrimeScript?RT-PCR (Takara), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 SANSURE?BIOTECH Novel Coronavirus (Sansure). The overall sensitivity of PrimeDirect, PrimeScript and Sansure assays was 55.1 %, 69.6 % and 69.6 %, respectively. The sensitivity increased among samples with Ct<30: 91.9 % (n = 34/37), 89.2 % (n = 33/37) and 94.6 % (n = 35/37) for PrimeDirect, PrimeScript and Sansure assays, respectively. The specificity was 88 %, 100 % and 100 % for PrimeDirect, PrimeScript and Sansure assays, respectively. In the present study, we showed a good sensitivity of extraction-free PCR assays, especially for high viral loads (Ct<30), except PrimeDirect that displayed imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Despite a lower sensitivity for low viral loads, extraction-free reagents can provide a valuable option, cheaper, easier and less reagent consuming for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, especially in laboratory with lower experience and equipment for molecular assays.","output":"Evaluation of three extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays: A feasible alternative approach with low technical requirements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Diets high in red and processed meat (RPM) contribute substantially to environmental degradation, greenhouse gas emissions and the global burden of chronic disease. High-profile reports have called for significant global RPM reduction, especially in high-income settings. Despite this, policy attention and political priority for the issue are low. DESIGN: The study used a theoretically guided framing analysis to identify frames used by various interest groups in relation to reducing RPM in online news media articles published in the months around the release of four high-profile reports by authoritative organisations that included a focus on the impacts of high RPM production and/or consumption. SETTING: Four major RPM producing and consuming countries - USA, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: None. RESULTS: Hundred and fifty news media articles were included. Articles reported the views of academics, policymakers, industry representatives and the article authors themselves. RPM reduction was remarkably polarising. Industry frequently framed RPM reduction as part of a 'Vegan Agenda' or as advocated by an elite minority. Reducing RPM was also depicted as an infringement on personal choice and traditional values. Many interest groups attempted to discredit the reports by citing a lack of consensus on the evidence, or that only certain forms of farming and processing were harmful. Academics and nutrition experts were more likely to be cited in articles that were aligned with the findings of the reports. CONCLUSIONS: The polarisation of RPM reduction has led to a binary conflict between pro- and anti-meat reduction actors. This division may diminish the extent to which political leaders will prioritise this in policy agendas. Using nuanced and context-dependent messaging could ensure the narratives around meat are less conflicting and more effective in addressing health and environmental harms associated with RPM.","output":"Who has a beef with reducing red and processed meat consumption?

Documentation of drug safety via traditional use of adverse events (AE) in hematology is limited if not complemented with Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) measures (3-4). Incorporation of HRQoL PROs is now essential to better evaluate risk-benefit of new therapeutic approaches and it is also highly valued by regulatory stakeholders (5). Most PRO data currently available for CLL patients (pts) came from randomized controlled trial settings (6-7), hence limiting generalizability of findings to CLL real-life patients. CHOICE study was designed to investigate CLL patients' QoL and preference towards different treatment profiles through a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) methodology in Italy. Due to the timelines of the study, which started in February 2020, the related data offer an insight into patients' perception and worries during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross sectional, multi-center, observational study included CLL patients, treatment na?ve during the watch & wait period (W&W) or already TREATED (around 50% each, controlled at site level), who signed the informed consent for study participation. Exclusion criteria were inability to take oral drugs, cognitive disorders that could impair the comprehension of the questionnaires and concomitant treatment for other malignancies. Patients were asked to fill in the following HRQoL questionnaires: EQ-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ CLL-16, as well as a DCE questionnaire, (described elsewhere). Each questionnaire was completed by the patient on a tablet - using an App specifically developed for the study. Results 401 pts were enrolled in Italy in 16 hematology centers (Feb - July 2020);199 W&W and 196 TREATED pts completed the questionnaires and were included in the evaluable population. Main patients' characteristics are shown in Table 1. 73.7% of TREATED pts were ON-treatment (30.8% were in 1st-line, 69,2% in further lines) and 26.3% were OFF-treatment;the majority of pts (55,6%) were currently treated with a target therapy (Table1). The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire showed no significant differences between groups. In both groups more than 80% of pts reported low values (1 or 2, indicating no or small impact) on all items. Median VAS was 75 for the TREATED group and 80 for the W&W group (0-100;higher scores indicate higher QoL). QLQ C-30 / CLL-16 scores had very similar results between TREATED and W&W pts suggesting a limited impact of CLL on pts QoL. The median (IQR) QoL Scale was 83.3 (67- 83) for TREATED and 83.3 (67- 92) for W&W pts (0-100;all functional scales had high scores, that represent a better level of functioning;all symptoms' scales had low values, representing a less important symptomatology or problem, Figure 1). The main symptoms reported were fatigue, insomnia, pain, and dyspnea, while the main worry was for future health (Figure 1). Distribution of data was statistically different between the 2 groups only for the Role functioning Scale (p=0.024) and the Social Functioning Scale (p=0.003) of QLQ-C30 and for the Infection Scale (p<0.001) of QLQ CLL-16, always with slightly but significantly better results for the W&W group. Conclusions CHOICE study helps to understand the CLL patients' mindset and feeling in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on health care for this category of pts, highlighting their preferences and worries in a large cohort of pts in Italy, allowing a comparison between TREATED and W&W pts. The main limitation of the study was its cross-sectional design, which does not allow us to evaluate any change in QoL neither with respect to the impact of the pandemic, nor to the effects of the treatment, if any. CLL pts showed a good QoL, as confirmed by both EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QLQ C-30 / CLL-16 scores, with very similar results between TREATED and W&W pts (although slightly better results in the W&W vs TREATED group). The results of th present study are consistent with previous reports, and fatigue was the most reported symptom, while worry for future health was the most relevant score in CLL-16 questionnaire. Hospital accesses reduction that was detected during the pandemic might have influenced patients' response, as well as the extreme attention towards the danger of infections, and might have impacted patients' perception on future health.

As more clinical data is collected and processed, we are beginning to have an understanding of which patients are more at risk for severe complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Preliminary data has shown that patients with lung cancer are disproportionally affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, studies have shown that lung cancer patients are also significantly more likely to be admitted to the ICU and need mechanical ventilation. A specific subset of patients that are even more at risk for severe COVID-19 are those that require lung cancer surgery. To minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients undergoing surgery, new treatment guidelines and preventive measures are necessary. In this review, we summarize the latest evidence regarding recommendations for patients undergoing lung cancer surgery in the COVID-19 era. ABSTRACT: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced healthcare providers worldwide to adapt their practices. Our understanding of the effects of COVID-19 has increased exponentially since the beginning of the pandemic. Data from large-scale, international registries has provided more insight regarding risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and has allowed us to delineate specific subgroups of patients that have higher risks for severe complications. One particular subset of patients that have significantly higher risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection with higher morbidity and mortality rates are those that require surgical treatment for lung cancer. Earlier studies have shown that COVID-19 infections in patients that underwent lung cancer surgery is associated with higher rates of respiratory failure and mortality. However, deferral of cancer treatments is associated with increased mortality as well. This creates difficult situations in which healthcare providers are forced to weigh the benefits of surgical treatment against the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infections. A number of oncological and surgical organizations have proposed treatment guidelines and recommendations for patients planned for lung cancer surgery. In this review, we summarize the latest data and recommendations for patients undergoing lung cancer surgery in the COVID-19 circumstance.","output":"Safety and Feasibility of Lung Cancer Surgery under the COVID-19 Circumstance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) both are rare genetic neuromuscular diseases with progressive loss of motor ability. The neuromotor developmental course of those diseases is well documented. In contrast, there is only little evidence about characteristics of general and specific cognitive development. In both conditions the final motor outcome is characterized by an inability to move autonomously: children with SMA never accomplish independent motoric exploration of their environment, while children with DMD do but later lose this ability again. These profound differences in developmental pathways might affect cognitive development of SMA vs. DMD children, as cognition is shaped by individual motor experiences. DMD patients show impaired executive functions, working memory, and verbal IQ, whereas only motor ability seems to be impaired in SMA. Advanced cognitive capacity in SMA may serve as a compensatory mechanism for achieving in education, career progression, and social satisfaction. This study aimed to relate differences in basic numerical concepts and arithmetic achievement in SMA and DMD patients to differences in their motor development and resulting sensorimotor and environmental experiences. Horizontal and vertical spatial-numerical associations were explored in SMA/DMD children ranging between 6 and 12 years through the random number generation task. Furthermore, arithmetic skills as well as general cognitive ability were assessed. Groups differed in spatial number processing as well as in arithmetic and domain-general cognitive functions. Children with SMA showed no horizontal and even reversed vertical spatial-numerical associations. Children with DMD on the other hand revealed patterns in spatial numerical associations comparable to healthy developing children. From the embodied Cognition perspective, early sensorimotor experience does play a role in development of mental number representations. However, it remains open whether and how this becomes relevant for the acquisition of higher order cognitive and arithmetic skills.","output":"Neuromuscular Diseases Affect Number Representation and Processing: An Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has made it necessary for us to adapt our healthcare systems to a very different sort of reality.

The implementation of these procedures is generally complicated by conditions of forensic psychiatry where, in line with demands made by courts, the treatment and isolation of mentally unwell offenders must be carefully managed. In most countries, forensic psychiatric treatment is an inpatient service where patients are kept in restricted and cramped spaces, making social distancing difficult to implement as patients participate in compulsory group therapeutic activities. As a result, it is necessary to introduce unique recommendations relating to patient safety and treatment adapted to the realities of forensic psychiatry. All this requires the implementation of additional restrictions, over and above those arising from the essential aspects of forensic psychiatry.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that a heterologous vaccination schedule with ChAdOx1 followed by BNT162b2 was more efficacious than and similarly safe to homologous vaccination with two doses of ChAdOx1. Most of the infections in our study occurred when Delta was the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in Spain.

An efficient diagnostic method must be highly accurate, while having a cost-effective profile. We combined a machine learning-based algorithm with mass spectrometry to create an expeditious platform that discriminate COVID-19 in plasma samples within minutes, while also providing tools for risk assessment, to assist healthcare professionals in patient management and decision-making. A cross-sectional study enrolled 815 patients (442 COVID-19, 350 controls and 23 COVID-19 suspicious) from three Brazilian epicenters from April to July 2020. We were able to elect and identify 19 molecules related to the disease's pathophysiology and several discriminating features to patient's health-related outcomes. The method applied for COVID-19 diagnosis showed specificity >96% and sensitivity >83%, and specificity >80% and sensitivity >85% during risk assessment, both from blinded data. Our method introduced a new approach for COVID-19 screening, providing the indirect detection of infection through metabolites and contextualizing the findings with the disease's pathophysiology.

MethodsWe used the latest wave 9C1 of the LSAC, where data were collected from 16-21-year-old Australians via an online survey between October and December 2021. In total, 2291 Australian youths responded to the questions about COVID testing and COVID symptom severity. Data was stratified by living with/without parents, and bivariate and logistic regression analyses examined predictor variables (age, sex, country of birth, remoteness, education level, employment, relationship status, number of household members, living with parents, receiving the COVID financial supplement from government and index of relative socio-economic advantage and disadvantage) and their distributions over the outcome variable COVID testing. ResultsYouths aged 16-17 were more likely to live at home than youths aged 20-21 years. The strongest predictor of COVID testing was living in major cities (regardless of living with or without parents). Changed household composition was significantly associated with COVID testing among the youths living in the parental home. While among the respondents living without their parents, living with multiple household members and low or no cohesion among household members was associated with higher rates of COVID testing.

METHODS: Pre-planned analyses evaluating 1-year mortality and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) outcomes in the previously published Handling Oxygenation Targets in the ICU trial which randomised 2928 adults with acute hypoxaemia to targets of arterial oxygen of 8 kPa or 12 kPa throughout the ICU stay up to 90 days. One-year all-cause mortality was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. HRQoL was assessed using EuroQol 5 dimensions 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire and EQ visual analogue scale score (EQ-VAS), and analyses were conducted in both survivors only and the intention-to-treat population with assignment of the worst scores to deceased patients. RESULTS: We obtained 1-year vital status for 2887/2928 (98.6%), and HRQoL for 2600/2928 (88.8%) of the trial population. One year after randomisation, 707/1442 patients (49%) in the lower oxygenation group vs. 704/1445 (48.7%) in the higher oxygenation group had died (adjusted risk ratio 1.00; 95% confidence interval 0.93C1.08, p = 0.92).

MATERIALS AND METHODS This HIPAA-compliant IRB-approved retrospective analysis included 85 therapy-na?ve patients from 2010 to 2018 (63 males, 22 females, mean age 62.4  8.5 years) who underwent either TA alone (n = 64) or TA in combination with drug-eluting beads (DEB)-TACE (n = 18) or Lipiodol-TACE (n = 3) for locoregional therapy of early stage HCC with maximum tumor diameter under 3 cm. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed using the log-rank test to assess TTP and OS. RESULTS All TA and TACE+TA treatments included were technically successful. TTP was 23.0 months in the TA group and 22.0 months in the TACE+TA group. There was no statistically significant difference in TTP (p = 0.64). Median OS was 69.7 months in the TA group and 64.6 months in the TACE+TA group. There was no statistically significant difference in OS (p = 0.14).

COVID-19 is more pathogenic and infectious than the prior 2002 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-1. The pathogenesis of certain disease manifestations in COVID-19 such as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) are thought to be similar to SARS-CoV-1. However, the exact pathogenesis of COVID-19 related deaths remains poorly understood. The aim of this article was to systematically summarize the rapidly emerging literature regarding COVID-19 autopsies. A meta-analysis was also conducted based on data accrued from preprint and published articles on COVID-19 (n=241 patients) and the results compared with postmortem findings associated with SARS-CoV-1 deaths (n=91 patients). Both autopsy groups included mostly adults of median age 70 years with COVID-19 and 50 years with SARS-CoV-1. Overall, prevalence of DAD was more common in SARS-CoV-1 (100.0%) than COVID-19 (80.9%) autopsies (P=0.001).

AIMS: We sought to measure the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volumes for mechanical thrombectomy (MT), stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) hospitalizations over a 3-month period at the height of the pandemic (March 1 to May 31, 2020) compared with two control 3-month periods (immediately preceding and one year prior). METHODS: Retrospective, observational, international study, across 6 continents, 40 countries, and 187 comprehensive stroke centers. The diagnoses were identified by their ICD-10 codes and/or classifications in stroke databases at participating centers. RESULTS: The hospitalization volumes for any stroke, ICH, and MT were 26,699, 4,002, and 5,191 in the 3 months immediately before versus 21,576, 3,540, and 4,533 during the first 3 pandemic months, representing declines of 19.2% (95%CI,-19.7 to -18.7), 11.5% (95%CI,-12.6 to -10.6), and 12.7% (95%CI,-13.6 to -11.8), respectively. The decreases were noted across centers with high, mid, and low COVID-19 hospitalization burden, and also across high, mid, and low volume stroke/MT centers. High-volume COVID-19 centers (-20.5%) had greater declines in MT volumes than mid- (-10.1%) and low-volume (-8.7%) centers (p<0.0001). There was a 1.5% stroke rate across 54,366 COVID-19 hospitalizations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was noted in 3.9% (784/20,250) of all stroke admissions.

Many drugs and materials that have an antiviral therapeutic effect are still being tested, including silver nanoparticles. Materials and Methods: It has been proven that Synthesis of silver Nanoparticles (Ag NPs) (Ag NPs) possess strong antifungal, antibacterial, anti-angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory potential. Green synthesized of Ag NPs are a promising source of new antiviral agents considering the multiplicity of its mechanism and the multiple target areas in the virus. The Ag NPs or Ag+ ions, which are released from the Ag NPs, interact directly with some biological molecules of the viruses that contain phosphorous or sulfur, such as some proteins, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), and Ribonucleic Acid (RNA). Results: This reaction generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), causing damage to the membranes in the virus. Metal nano-therapies such as Ag NPs are granted research consideration for COVID-19 treatment. Conclusion: The biocompatibility achieved through green synthesis suggests its possible use not only in these specific coronavirus conditions but also in other types of virus infections without any risk of toxicity of these molecules.

The soil moisture control strategy was designed to regulate wastewater disposal timing according to drain field conditions to prevent hydraulic overloading and corresponding environmental hazard. CW2D/HYDRUS simulation modeling was utilized to explore difficult-to-measure aspects of system performance. While the control system successfully adapted hydraulic loading rate to changing drain field conditions, saturated field conditions during the dormant season presented practical application challenges. The paired field experiment and simulation model demonstrate that soil biofilm growth was stimulated in the vicinity of drip emitters. Although biofilm growth is critical in maintaining adequate COD and [Formula: see text] removal efficiencies, the efficient removal of biodegradable COD itself by soil biofilm limits denitrification of formed [Formula: see text] . Furthermore, stimulated soil biofilm growth can create soil clogging around drip emitters, which was discerned in the field experiment along with salt accumulation, both of which were verified by simulation. Comparable modeling of system performance in sand and clay media demonstrate that the placement of soil moisture sensors within the drain field can have pronounced impacts on system hydraulic performance, depending on the soil permeability.

The effect of green tea polyphenols on weight reduction in adult population has been shown, but few related studies have been conducted in children. This study was performed to examine the effectiveness and safety of decaffeinated green tea polyphenols (DGTP) on ameliorating obesity and early sexual development in girls with obesity. DESIGN: This is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Girls with obesity aged 6C10 years old were randomly assigned to receive 400 mg/day DGTP or isodose placebo orally for 12 weeks. During this period, all participants received the same instruction on diet and exercise from trained dietitians. Anthropometric measurements, secondary sexual characteristics, B-scan ultrasonography of uterus, ovaries and breast tissues, and related biochemical parameters were examined and assessed pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: Between August 2018 and January 2020, 62 girls with obesity (DGTP group n = 31, control group n = 31) completed the intervention and were included in analysis. After the intervention, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio significantly decreased in both groups, but the percentage of body fat (PBF), serum uric acid (UA), and the volumes of ovaries decreased significantly only within the DGTP group. After controlling confounders, DGTP showed a significantly decreased effect on the change of PBF ( = 2.932, 95% CI: 0.214 to 5.650), serum UA ( = 52.601, 95% CI: 2.520 to 102.681), and ovarian volumes (right:  = 1.881, 95% CI: 0.062 to 3.699, left:  = 0.971, 95% CI: 0.019 to 1.923) in girls with obesity.

One such model, Community Client-Led ART Delivery (CCLAD) was rolled out in Uganda in 2017. The extent of utilization of this model has not been fully studied. The aim of the study was to explore the patients and health workers experiences on the utilization of CCLAD model at Bwizibwera Health Centre IV, south western Uganda. METHODS: This was a descriptive study employing qualitative methods. The study had 68 purposively selected participants who participated in 10 focus group discussions with HIV clients enrolled in CCLAD; 10 in-depth interviews with HIV clients not enrolled in CCLAD and 6 in-depth interviews with the health workers. Key informant interviews were held with the 2 focal persons for DSD. The discussions and interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and then translated. Both deductive and inductive approaches were employed to analyse the data using in NVivo software. RESULTS: Patients and health workers experiences in this study were categorized as drivers and barriers to the utilization of the CCLAD model. The main drivers for utilization of this model at different levels were: individual (reduced costs, living positively with HIV, improved patient self-management), community (peer support and contextual factors) and health system (reduced patient congestion at the health centre, caring health workers as well as CCLAD sensitization by health workers). However, significant barriers to the utilization of this community-based model were: individual (personal values and preferences, lack of commitment of CCLAD group members), community (stigma, gender bias) and health system (frequent drug stockouts, certain implementation challenges, fluctuating implementing partner priorities, shortage of trained health workers and insufficient health education by health workers). CONCLUSION: Based on our findings the CCLAD model is meeting the objectives set out by Differentiated Service Delivery for HIV care and treatment. Notwithstanding the benefits, challenges remain which call on the Ministry of Health and other implementing partners to address these hindrances to facilitate the scalability, sustainability and the realisation of the full-range of benefits that the model presents.

We have previously shown that iatrogenic dehydration during treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with a shift to organic osmolyte production in the general ICU population. In this study we investigate the development of estimated osmolality (eOSM = 2Na+2K+glucose+urea) over time in ICU, as well as the relationship between the major osmolytes and eOSM. The study includes 370 COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU at Uppsala University Hospital between March 13. 2020 and June 11. 2021. Complete data was available for 176 of these patients, which were used for the analysis. The results show that eOSM increases with time spent in ICU (R2 = 0.75, P<0.001), which indicates iatrogenic dehydration. Further, increasing eOSM is correlated with increasing role of urea as an osmolyte (R2 = 0.6, P<0.001), while the role of sodium and potassium are inversely correlated to eOSM. This is consistent with the aestivation response where dehydration with increased osmolality drives production of organic osmolytes through gluconeogenesis and urea synthesis. Interestingly, glucose shows a weak negative correlation to eOSM (R2 = 0.01, P<0.01), which we interpret as a sign of iatrogenic control using insulin treatment. Acute Kidney Injury with reduced kidney function is an alternative explanation for increasing urea concentration. However, although there is a correlation between urea and the GFR-markers creatinine and cystatin-C the effect size cannot explain more than part of the association. In conclusion, iatrogenic dehydration causes an aestivation response in critical COVID-19 where urea plays an increasing role as an osmolyte with increasing total osmolality.","output":"Iatrogenic dehydration drives organic osmolyte production in critical COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a major complication of kidney transplantation, so as of urologic and vascular surgeries.

RESULTS: Of 318 FRs, 225 (80.2%) underwent serology testing (LE: 163/207 [78.7%]; FF: 92/111 [82.9%]). The prevalence of positive serology for all FRs tested was 3/255 (1.2%). Two LE (1.2%) and one FF (1.1%) had positive serology (P = 1.0). Two hundred and twenty-four FRs responded to a survey regarding prior symptoms and testing. Fifty-eight (25.9%) FRs (44 LE; 14 FFs) reported the presence of COVID-19-like symptoms. Of these, only nine (15.5%) received reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing; none were positive. Two of the three FRs with positive serology reported no COVID-19-like symptoms and none of these responders had received prior nasal RT-PCR swabs. The overall community positive RT-PCR rate was 0.36%, representing a three-fold higher rate of positive seroprevalence amongst FRs compared with the general population (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: Amongst a cohort of municipal FRs with low community COVID-19 prevalence, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-19 IgG Ab was three-fold greater than the general community. Two-thirds of positive FRs reported a lack of symptoms. Only 15.5% of FRs with COVID-19-like symptoms received RT-PCR testing. In addition to workplace control measures, increased testing availability to FRs is critical in limiting infection spread and ensuring response capability.","output":"Prevalence of COVID-19 IgG Antibodies in a Cohort of Municipal First Responders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 serology is useful to identify past COVID-19 cases, and it is not useful for acute infection.

This study compared virtual with F2F new neurological consultations. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated new outpatient consultations in neurology clinics in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. We compared sociodemographic data, time to consultation, time to diagnosis, the need for reassessment and re-investigation between traditional F2F and virtual clinics using the web-based Attend Anywhere platform or telephone into patients own homes (or chosen location) without a trained assistant. We calculated the relative risk (RR) of the need for reassessment and re-investigation over 6-month periods by the suspected neurological diagnosis. RESULTS: 73% of consultations were virtual (Attend Anywhere or telephone) between June and October 2020, this was almost non-existent (<0.1%) in JuneCOctober 2019. We analysed 352 F2F (JuneCJuly 2019) and 225 virtual consultations (JuneCJuly 2020). Compared with F2F clinics, virtual clinics had a longer time to diagnosis (p=0.019), were more likely to be reassessed (RR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.5 to 3.2; p<0.0001) and re-investigated (RR: 1.50, 95% CI: 0.88 to 2.54; p=0.133), this was likelier in those aged 60 years. Patients with headaches and suspected seizures were less likely to need reassessment or re-investigation following virtual clinics than multiple sclerosis and neuroinflammatory disorders, spinal cord disorders and functional neurological disorders. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that virtual clinics have higher rates of reassessment and re-investigation than F2F clinics. As virtual clinics become a potential consultation alternative, this study should instruct the selection of patients for either consultation type.","output":"Evaluation of telemedicine for new outpatient neurological consultations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by viral proliferation and clearance phases and can be followed by low-level viral RNA shedding. The dynamics of viral RNA concentration, particularly in the early stages of infection, can inform clinical measures and interventions such as test-based screening. MethodsWe used prospective longitudinal RT-qPCR testing to measure the viral RNA trajectories for 68 individuals during the resumption of the 2019-20 National Basketball Association season. For 46 individuals with acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and the duration of the viral proliferation and clearance phases. FindingsOn average, viral RNA concentrations peaked 2.7 days (95% credible interval [1.2, 3.8]) after first detection at a cycle threshold value of 22.4 [20.6, 24.1]. The viral clearance phase lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.5 days [6.5, 14.0]) than for asymptomatic individuals (6.7 days [3.2, 9.2]). A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR substantially improves certainty about a patients infection phase. The effective sensitivity of a test intended to identify infectious individuals declines substantially with test turnaround time. InterpretationSARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations peak rapidly regardless of symptoms. Sequential tests can help reveal a patients progress through infection stages. Frequent rapid-turnaround testing is needed to effectively screen individuals before they become infectious.

We searched Web of Science using the search terms \\"ALL = ((SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19) AND (viral OR RNA) AND (load OR concentration OR shedding) AND (dynamic* OR kinetic* OR trajector*))\\" which returned 83 references. Of these, 22 were not pertinent to within-host SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics. The remaining 61 studies tracked SARS-CoV-2 viral trajectories in a variety of geographic locations and patient populations. Together, these studies report that viral titers normally peak at or before the onset of symptoms and that a long tail of intermittent positive tests can follow a period of acute infection. Plasma but not nasopharyngeal viral concentration is associated with increased disease severity. Most studies tracked hospitalized patients after the onset of symptoms. Two of the studies tracked pre-symptomatic and/or asymptomatic patients, but these were too sparsely sampled to clearly discern viral dynamics during the earliest stage of infection. Added value of this studyWe implemented prospective longitudinal real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of individuals during the resumption of the 2019-20 National Basketball Association season. This allowed us to explicitly measure viral titers during the full course of 46 acute infections. Consistent with other studies, we find that peak viral concentrations do not differ substantially between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals but that symptomatic individuals take longer to clear the virus than asymptomatic individuals. For both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, viral titers normally peak within 3 days of the first positive test. This study is the first to describe the time course of viral concentrations during the earliest stage of infection when individuals are most likely to be infectious. Implications of all the available evidenceSymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals follow similar SARS-CoV-2 viral trajectories. Due to the rapid progression from first possible detection to peak viral concentration, frequent rapid-turnaround testing is needed to screen individuals prior to them becoming infectious.","output":"Viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the predictive value of repeat testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted electricity consumption patterns and such an impact cannot be analyzed by simple data analytics. In China, specifically, city lock-down policies lasted for only a few weeks and the spread of COVID-19 was quickly under control. This has made it challenging to analyze the hidden impact of COVID-19 on electricity consumption. This paper targets the electricity consumption of a group of regions in China and proposes a new clustering-based method to quantitatively investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the industrial-driven electricity consumption pattern. This method performs K-means clustering on time-series electricity consumption data of multiple regions and uses quantitative metrics, including clustering evaluation metrics and dynamic time warping, to quantify the impact and pattern changes. The proposed method is applied to the two-year daily electricity consumption data of 87 regions of Zhejiang province, China, and quantitively confirms COVID-19 has changed the electricity consumption pattern of Zhejiang in both the short-term and long-term. The time evolution of the pattern change is also revealed by the method, so the impact start and end time can be inferred. Results also show the short-term impact of COVID-19 is similar across different regions, while the long-term impact is not. In some regions, the pandemic only caused a time-shift in electricity consumption;but in others, the electricity consumption pattern has been permanently changed. The data-driven analysis of this paper can be the first step to fully interpret the COVID-19 impact by considering economic and social parameters in future studies.","output":"A Data-Driven Clustering Analysis for the Impact of COVID-19 on the Electricity Consumption Pattern of Zhejiang Province, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, body temperature screening is very important especially in the current global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. It can be considered as the first step in monitoring the fever symptom if the body temperature is checked regularly.

The key idea relies on a combination of a 3-D depth sensor, an electronic temperature sensor, and a reference temperature for realtime data feedback and control. In addition, we obtain simple mathematical models for compensating the influence of ambient temperature and measuring distance variations. Experimental demonstration using a blackbody radiation source as an object confirms that the measured temperature under our self-compensation agrees very well with the blackbody radiation source, showing a very low standard deviation of 0.10 C under 21.0 CC40.0 C ambient temperature.

Design: Systematic review of spontaneously reported data from the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United States (US). Data Sources: EudraVigilance (EU/EEA) and Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS; US) spontaneous reporting databases were searched from date of vaccine launch to 30 November 2021. Eligibility criteria: Publicly available spontaneous reporting data for 'Myocarditis' and 'Pericarditis' from EU/EEA and US following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Reports with comorbidities or concurrent medication indicative of transplantation, HIV infection, or cancer ('immunocompromised' population) were compared with each overall database population. Data extraction and synthesis: Two researchers extracted data. Spontaneously reported events of myocarditis and pericarditis were presented for immunocompromised populations for each data source, stratified by age, sex, dose, and time-to-onset (where available). Seriousness of each event was determined according to the ICH E2A definition. Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) was calculated. Results: There were 106 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis amongst immunocompromised individuals overall. Seriousness was comparable between the immunocompromised and overall populations in both databases. No trends in age or sex were observed amongst immunocompromised individuals. Most reports (54.4%) to VAERS followed a second vaccine dose and 70.2% of events occurred within 14 days. The frequency of reporting was similar to the wider population (PRR=1.36 [95% CI= 0.89-1.82] for VAERS population). Conclusions: Myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination are very rare, and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination continue to outweigh any perceived risks. Reporting rates of myocarditis and pericarditis were similar in immunocompromised individuals, however defining characteristics differed compared to the whole population; therefore, continued monitoring of adverse events following vaccination remains vital to understand differences between population subgroups.","output":"Systematic review of spontaneous reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in transplant recipients and immunocompromised patients following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Preventive interventions are needed to protect residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities from COVID-19 during outbreaks in their facilities. Bamlanivimab, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2, may confer rapid protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Objective: To determine the effect of bamlanivimab on the incidence of COVID-19 among residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind, single-dose, phase 3 trial that enrolled residents and staff of 74 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in the United States with at least 1 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 index case. A total of 1175 participants enrolled in the study from August 2 to November 20, 2020. Database lock was triggered on January 13, 2021, when all participants reached study day 57. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of bamlanivimab, 4200 mg (n = 588), or placebo (n = 587). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was incidence of COVID-19, defined as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and mild or worse disease severity within 21 days of detection, within 8 weeks of randomization. Key secondary outcomes included incidence of moderate or worse COVID-19 severity and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: The prevention population comprised a total of 966 participants (666 staff and 300 residents) who were negative at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 infection and serology (mean age, 53.0 [range, 18-104] years;722 [74.7%] women). Bamlanivimab significantly reduced the incidence of COVID-19 in the prevention population compared with placebo (8.5% vs 15.2%;odds ratio, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.28-0.68];P &lt; .001;absolute risk difference, -6.6 [95% CI, -10.7 to -2.6] percentage points). Five deaths attributed to COVID-19 were reported by day 57;all occurred in the placebo group. Among 1175 participants who received study product (safety population), the rate of participants with adverse events was 20.1% in the bamlanivimab group and 18.9% in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were urinary tract infection (reported by 12 participants [2%] who received bamlanivimab and 14 [2.4%] who received placebo) and hypertension (reported by 7 participants [1.2%] who received bamlanivimab and 10 [1.7%] who received placebo). Conclusions and Relevance: Among residents and staff in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, treatment during August-November 2020 with bamlanivimab monotherapy reduced the incidence of COVID-19 infection. Further research is needed to assess preventive efficacy with current patterns of viral strains with combination monoclonal antibody therapy.

Here, a proteomic approach was employed to identify specific proteins differentially expressed by WJ-MSCs in comparison to those by neonatal foreskin and adult skin fibroblasts (NFFs and ASFs, respectively). Mass spectrometry analysis identified 454 proteins with a transmembrane domain. These proteins were then compared across the different cell-lines and categorized based on their cellular localizations, biological processes, and molecular functions. The expression patterns of a selected set of proteins were further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays. As anticipated, most of the studied proteins had common expression patterns. However, EphA2, SLC25A4, and SOD2 were predominantly expressed by WJ-MSCs, while CDH2 and Talin2 were specific to NFFs and ASFs, respectively.

METHODS: BEAS-2B cells were exposed to 0, 20, 50, 100 and 150 g/ml of PM2.5. Secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and IL-1? was determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined using flow cytometry. Phosphorylation of the EGFR was examined with immunoblotting. RESULTS: PM2.5 exposure increased the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1? in a concentration-dependent fashion. Moreover, exposure to PM2.5 elevated intracellular levels of ROS, and phosphorylation of the EGFR (Y1068). Pretreatment of BEAS-2B cells with either an antioxidant or a specific EGFR inhibitor significantly reduced PM2.5-induced IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1? secretion, implying that both oxidative stress and EGFR activation were involved in PM2.5-induced pro-inflammatory response.

METHODS: The proning program evolved based on the principles of High Reliability Organizations (HROs) and Crew Resource Management (CRM). Patients with severe ARDS [PaO(2):FiO(2) ratio (PFr)  150 on FiO(2)  0.6 and PEEP  5 cm H(2)O] received IPP. Patients were placed prone 16 h each day. When PFr was  200 for > 8 h supine IPP ceased. IPP used available materials without requiring additional work from the bedside team. Changes in PFr, PaCO(2), and the SaO(2):FiO(2) ratio (SaFr) positionally were evaluated using t-statistics and ANOVA with Bonferroni correction (p < 0.017). RESULTS: Between 14APR2020 and 09MAY2020, at the peak of deaths in New York, there were 202 IPPs in 29 patients. Patients were 58.5  1.7 years of age (37, 73), 76% male and had a body mass index (BMI) of 27.8  0.8 (21, 38). Pressor agents were used in 76% and 17% received dialysis. The PFr prior to IPP was 107.5  5.6 and 1 h after IPP was 155.7  11.2 (p < 0.001 compared to pre-prone). PFr after the patients were placed supine was 131.5  9.1 (p = 0.02). Pre-prone PaCO(2) was 60.0  2.5 and the 1-h post-prone PaCO(2) was 67.2  3.1 (p = 0.02). Supine PaCO(2) after IPP was 60.4  3.4 (p = 0.90). The SaFr prior to IPP was 121.3  4.2 and the SaFr 1 h after positioning was 131.5  5.1 (p = 0.03). The post-IPP supine SaFr was 139.7  5.9 (p < 0.001). With ANOVA and Bonferroni correction there were statistically significant changes in PFr (p < 0.001) and SaFr (p < 0.001) and no significant changes in PaCO(2) over the four time points measured.

In this paper, we present short-term forecasts of COVID-19 for 28 Indian states and five union territories using real-time data from 30 January to 21 April 2020. Applying Holt's second-order exponential smoothing method and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, we generate 10-day ahead forecasts of the likely number of infected cases and deaths in India for 22 April to 1 May 2020. Our results show that the number of cumulative cases in India will rise to 36335.63 [PI 95% (30884.56, 42918.87)], concurrently the number of deaths may increase to 1099.38 [PI 95% (959.77, 1553.76)] by 1 May 2020. Further, we have divided the country into severity zones based on the cumulative cases. According to this analysis, Maharashtra is likely to be the most affected states with around 9787.24 [PI 95% (6949.81, 13757.06)] cumulative cases by 1 May 2020. However, Kerala and Karnataka are likely to shift from the red zone (i.e. highly affected) to the lesser affected region. On the other hand, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh will move to the red zone.

This rate was then extrapolated to predict the number of future cases each year going forward. The model shows that there may be yet further cases of classical scrapie in GB. These will most likely occur in the fallen stock scheme, with approximately a 25% probability of at least 1 further scrapie positive, with a very low probability (~0.2%) of having up to three additional scrapie positives.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may represent a vulnerable population due to the frequent administration of immune-modifying treatments. METHODS: We aimed to depict the natural history of COVID-19 infection in Greek patients with IBD at a nationwide level via the unbiased reporting of all cases that were registered during the first and second waves of the pandemic. Following a national call from the Hellenic Society for the study of IBD, we enrolled all IBD patients with established diagnosis of COVID-19. Clinical and epidemiological data, including COVID-19 modifying factors and IBD-associated therapies were analysed against adverse outcomes (hospitalization, ICU admission, and death). RESULTS: We identified 80 patients with IBD who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period (male:65%; median age=44 [IQR=26] years; CD:62.5%). Adverse outcomes were reported in 16 patients (20%), including 3 ICU admissions (3.75%) and 2 deaths (2.5%). Negative prognostic factors for adverse outcomes included age, Body Mass Index, and hypertension, as well as dyspnoea, fatigue and abdominal pain at presentation. In contrast, treatment with biologics, in particular anti-TNF agents, exerted a protective effect against an unfavorable course COVID-19. Patients on subcutaneous biologics were more likely to halt treatment due to the infection as compared to those on intravenous medications. CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD who developed COVID-19 had a benign course with adverse outcomes being scarce. Treatment with biologics had a beneficial effect, supporting the continuation of therapy during the pandemic.","output":"P636 The natural history of COVID-19 in patients with IBD: A nationwide study by the Hellenic Society for the Study of IBD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has a variety of serotypes with relatively limited cross-protection leading the disease to be a major problem in the poultry industry. The IBV 793/B strain has identified to circulate in Iran; therefore, the development of a specific vaccine to protect against the virulent virus has received attention. In this regard, the live IB 793/B vaccine (793/B.08IR) was developed in the Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute. In this study, the immunogenicity of 793/B.08IR vaccine via different routes of vaccination and efficacy of the vaccine were determined in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. Three treatment groups of 10 SPF chickens received the vaccine via eye drops, spray, and drinking water. The sera were collected from the chicks at 3 and 6 weeks after the vaccination, and IBV specific antibody was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and serum neutralization (SN) test. To evaluate 793/B.08IR vaccine efficacy, 10 SPF chickens were vaccinated using eye drops. Moreover, 10 unvaccinated chickens were separately retained as negative controls. The birds were challenged with the virulent virus 3 weeks following the vaccination. Five days after the challenge, the tracheal swab was taken for virus reisolation. In the immunogenicity test, the ELISA titers of three vaccinated groups were significantly higher than the background values obtained in the control group (p<0.0001). The mean value of ELISA titer in the spray vaccinated group was higher than the spray and drinking water vaccinated groups 3 weeks following the vaccination; however, the difference was not statistically significant. No differences were observed in antibody titers among the three vaccinated groups 6 weeks after the vaccination. The results of the SN test confirmed the data obtained from the ELISA. The results of antibody titer and its increasing trend in chickens showed that 793/B.08IR vaccine induce proper immunity against the virus. In the efficacy test, IBV was isolated from 90% of the unvaccinated controls and 10% of vaccinated groups. The results of the recovery of the virus after the challenge showed that 793/B.08IR vaccine can provide a significantly improved protection against the pathogen in SPF vaccinated chickens.","output":"Immunogenicity and Efficacy of Live Infectious Bronchitis 793/B.08IR Vaccine in SPF Chickens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nevoxanthoendothelioma is a condition observed almost exclusively in childhood.

Our goal was to learn more about how COVID\\\\19 has impacted Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) training and practice across the country. To do so, real time, in\\\\depth experiences and opinions from persons within, or committed, to PM&R were pooled and this information was used to inform the creation of an anonymous survey that was distributed online to the PM&R community. 501 people completed the survey, 178 (35.5%) attending physicians, 183 (36.5%) residents and fellows, 29 (5.8%) interns, and 111 (22.2%) medical students. The survey results explore the impact of the global crisis on patient care and education in the field of PM&R. The adaptation from traditional patient care to telehealth was notable with 86.5% of physiatrists practicing via telemedicine during the pandemic. There was also a massive shift of education to virtual didactics with 92.5% of residents participating in virtual learning. The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has caused PM&R to revisit traditional routines in medical education and adapt to new practices to enhance educational experiences while still maintaining safe social distance between physicians, trainees and patients.

There are growing concerns on the impact of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Several papers reporting recommendations and guidelines are published. But few data on cancer patients affected by COVID-19 are available. METHODS: This is a retrospective study including all consecutive patients affected by gynecological cancer who developed COVID-19. All patients were treated in an academic setting (in Milan, Lombardy, Italy) between February and March 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 355 patients had active treatment during the study period due to newly diagnosed or recurrent gynecological disease. Among those, 19 (5.3%) patients affected developed COVID-19. All patients were asymptomatic at the time of COVID-19 detection. Six patients were diagnosed before starting planned treatments; while the remaining 13 were diagnosed for COVID-19 after their started their treatments. Considering the first group of six patients, one patient died due to COVID-19 3 days after the diagnosis; while the other patients recovered from COVID-19 after a median of three weeks. The latter group of 13 patients (treatments started) included five patients who underwent surgery and eight patients who underwent chemotherapy. Focusing on five patients who were diagnosed after surgery, we observed that two patients died during postoperative course, while in other two cases prolonged hospitalization was needed. One patient had no issues. Chemotherapy was delayed for the remaining patents without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Our report highlights that COVID-19 impacts the quality of treatments for cancer patients. Mortality rate is high, especially after surgery. More important, patients under active treatment for cancer are at high risk of developing severe evolution of COVID-19.

However, this complicated protocol may have a downside. Furthermore, the Joint Taiwan Critical Care Medicine Committee has launched a nationwide educational program after the publication of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) to improve the overall survival rate from septicemia in the emergency care system of Taiwan. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of the EGDT protocol and SSC education programs on island-wide septicemia-related emergency department (ED) visits. METHODS: Segmented regression techniques were utilized to assess the differences in annual rates and changes in septicemia-related ED visits between 1998 and 2012. We considered annual incidence of two medical comorbidities as potential confounders: metastatic malignant neoplasms and malignant neoplasms of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues. RESULTS: The EGDT protocol was associated with decreased septicemia-related ED visits in 2002 (level change; p < 0.001), while the SSC education program led to a slight increase in septicemia-related ED visits in 2007 (slope change; p < 0.001). For the EGDT protocol, the number of patient visits decreased by 32.9% after the protocol was implemented in 2002 compared with the expected number without the intervention. For the SSC education program, the number of patient visits increased by 20.2% (compared with the predicted number) in 2007 after the education program was implemented.

A computational approach was adopted to identify multiepitope vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 based on S, N and M proteins being able to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. In this study, the sequence of the virus was obtained from NCBI database and analyzed with in silico tools such as NetMHCpan, IEDB, BepiPred, NetCTL, Tap transport/proteasomal cleavage, Pa3P, GalexyPepDock, I-TASSER, Ellipro and ClusPro. To identify the most immunodominant regions, after analysis of population coverage and epitope conservancy, we proposed three different constructs based on linear B-cell, CTL and HTL epitopes. The 3D structure of constructs was assessed to find discontinuous B-cell epitopes. Among CTL predicted epitopes, S257-265, S603-611 and S360-368, and among HTL predicted epitopes, N167-181, S313-330 and S1110-1126 had better MHC binding rank. We found one putative CTL epitope, S360-368 related to receptor-binding domain (RBD) region for S protein. The predicted epitopes were non-allergen and showed a high quality of proteasomal cleavage and Tap transport efficiency and 100% conservancy within four different clades of SARS-CoV-2. For CTL and HTL epitopes, the highest population coverage of the world's population was calculated for S27-37 with 86.27% and for S196-231, S303-323, S313-330, S1009-1030 and N328-349 with 90.33%, respectively. We identified overall 10 discontinuous B-cell epitopes for three multiepitope constructs. All three constructs showed strong interactions with TLRs 2, 3 and 4 supporting the hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to TLRs 2, 3 and 4 like other Coronaviridae families. These data demonstrated that the novel designed multiepitope constructs can contribute to develop SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine candidates.

Two different importance evaluation methods (%IncMSE and IncNodePurity) of random forest were used to preliminary select the important parameters. Then, based on the partial dependency analysis, the sensitive diagnostic parameters that had promotion to the diagnostic performance were obtained. Data-FFKC was analyzed in the same way. Finally, a diagnostic test meta-analysis on the sensitive parameter of interest was conducted to verify the reliability of the above analysis methods. RESULTS There were 88 parameters with 766 records in Data-CKC, 57 parameters with 346 records in Data-FFKC. Based on two importance evaluation methods, 60 important parameters were obtained, of which 20 were further screened as sensitive parameters of keratoconus, and most of these parameters were related to the thinnest point of cornea. The stiffness parameter at first applanation (SPA1) was the only Corvis ST output parameter sensitive to FFKC except the Tomographic and Biomechanical Index and the Corvis Biomechanical Parameter (CBI). A total of 4 records were included in the meta-analysis of diagnostic tests on SPA1. The results showed that there was threshold effect, but no significant heterogeneity (I2 = 33%), and the area under the SROC curve was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.90). CONCLUSIONS For the diagnosis of FFKC, the sensitivity of SPA1 is not inferior to the well-known CBI, and may be the earliest Corvis ST output parameter to reflect the changes of corneal biomechanics during keratoconus progression.

A questionnaire was applied to Portuguese consumers who use the Nike Run Club application, from which 203 valid responses were received. The results confirm the influence of social circles and their impact on the intention to interact with the brand. For theoretical contributions, this research contributes to the existing literature and academic knowledge in the areas of marketing and gamification, providing a suggestion for the TAM model to be used in this type of research. It also contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between gamification and marketing, demonstrating that the use of gamified applications as engagement tools can have a positive impact on the brand attitude. On the practical side, it contributes as a consultation tool for brands, application designers, and marketers when defining engagement strategies, allowing a better understanding of the factors that may or may not influence the publics relationship with the brands and what dynamics they should use in the development of new Gamified marketing solutions.","output":"How Can Gamified Applications Drive Engagement and Brand Attitude?

In this study, we fabricated CTS ENs by using an electrospinning (ELSP) system, followed by surface modification using succinyl-beta-cyclodextrin (-CD) under mild conditions. The -CD-modified CTS (CTS) ENs had slightly increased hydrophobicity compared to pristine CTS ENs as well as decreased residual amine content on the surface. Through FTIR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), we characterized the surface treatment physiochemically. In the drug release test, we demonstrated the stable and sustained release of a hydrophobic drug (e.g., dexamethasone) loaded on -CD ENs. During in vitro biocompatibility assessments, the grafting of -CD was shown to not reduce cell viability compared to pristine CTS ENs. Additionally, cells proliferated well on -CD ENs, and this was confirmed by F-actin fluorescence staining. Overall, the material and strategies developed in this study have the potential to load a wide array of hydrophobic drugs. This could be applied as a drug carrier for a broad range of tissue engineering applications.","output":"Facile Preparation of -Cyclodextrin-grafted Chitosan Electrospun Nanofibrous Scaffolds as a Hydrophobic Drug Delivery Vehicle for Tissue Engineering Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide, but the factors that may affect the SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding time in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were rarely reported. Methods We retrospectively recruited 40 confirmed common COVID-19 patients and classified them into two groups according to the SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding time (group A (less than 10 days) and group B (10 days or more)). The demographic, laboratory parameters and chest computed tomography (CT) features on admission and the 3 rd day after treatment were analyzed respectively. Results Fourteen patients were in group A and 26 patients in group B, the median SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding time of the two groups was 7 and 16 days respectively. Compared to the group A, the comorbidity, epidemiological risk history, serum glucose and CD4/8 on admission were significantly higher in the group B (P<0.05). On the 3 rd day after treatment, the group B got significantly higher IL-6, IL-2R, TNF- and CD4/8, and lower platelet and CD8 + T lymphocyte counts than group A (P<0.05). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the higher epidemiological risk history, serum glucose and CD4/8 on admission were significantly associated with a longer SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding time (OR=7.5, 11.41, 9.21 respectively, P<0.05), as well as the higher TNF- and lower CD8 + T lymphocytes on the 3 rd day after treatment (OR=2.36, 0.98 respectively, P<0.05). Conclusions Our study provides the evidence that the prolonged SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding time might be correlated with the patients epidemiological risk history, as well as the serum glucose and CD4/8 on admission, TNF- and CD8 + T lymphocytes on the 3 rd day after treatment. Our result may help clinicians to distinguish the patients with a prolonged viral shedding time at the early stage.","output":"Analysis of factors affected the SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding time of COVID-19 patients in Anhui, China: a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid identification and isolation of COVID-19 patients has become the cornerstone for the control of the recent outbreak.

We found that cGAMP added to the culture medium could suppress the replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b strain Con1 subgenomic replicon in human hepatoma cells. Knockdown of STING expression diminished the inhibitory effect on replicon replication, while overexpression of STING enhanced the inhibitory effects of cGAMP. The addition of cGAMP into 1b/Con1 replicon cells significantly increased the expression of type I IFNs and antiviral interferon-stimulated genes. Unexpectedly, replication of the genotype 2a JFH1 replicon and infectious JFH1 virus was less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of cGAMP than was that of 1b/Con1 replicon. Using chimeric replicons, 2a NS4B was identified to confer resistance to cGAMP. Transient expression of 2a NS4B resulted in a pronounced inhibitory effect on STING-mediated beta IFN (IFN-) reporter activation compared to that of 1b NS4B. 2a NS4B was found to suppress STING accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. The predicted transmembrane domain of 2a NS4B was required to inhibit STING accumulation. These results demonstrate a novel genotype-specific inhibition of the STING-mediated host antiviral immune response. IMPORTANCE The cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP was found to potently inhibit the replication of HCV genotype 1b Con1 replicon but was less effective for the 2a/JFH1 replicon and infectious JFH1 virus. The predicted transmembrane domain in 2a NS4B was shown to be responsible for the decreased sensitivity to cGAMP. The N terminus of NS4B has been reported to suppress STING-mediated signaling by disrupting the interaction of STING and TBK1 and/or MAVS. We show that 2a/JFH1 NS4B has an additional mechanism to evade STING signaling through suppressing STING accumulation.","output":"Hepatitis C Virus NS4B Can Suppress STING Accumulation To Evade Innate Immune Responses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Throughout the Pandemic caused by COVID-19, health professionals have faced the fight against this disease in the front line, even without effective treatment, this uncertainty led to the presentation of various ethical crises in health services to be analyzed.

Although systematic temperature monitoring seems is a simple, inexpensive and forthright strategy for screening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), doubts remain that the normal body temperature may vary according to demographic factors, thus limiting the effectiveness of this practice. Methods. This observational study was performed at the University Hospital of Verona (Italy), where a compelling practice has been established by the Hospital administration, that body temperature shall be systematically screened in all people accessing hospital buildings.

We modelled how vaccination through the UK's vaccine priority groups impacts deaths, hospital and ICU admissions from COVID-19. We used the UK COVID-19 vaccines delivery plan and publicly available data to estimate UK population by age group and vaccination priority group, including frontline health and social care workers and individuals deemed 'extreme clinical vulnerable' or 'high risk'. Using published data on numbers and distributions of COVID-19-related hospital and ICU admissions and deaths, we modelled the impact of vaccination by age group. We then modified the model to account for hospital and ICU admission, and death among health and social care workers and the population with extreme clinical vulnerability and high risk. Our model closely matches the government's estimates for mortality after vaccination of priority groups 1-4 and groups 1-9. The model shows vaccination will have a much slower impact on hospital and ICU admissions than on deaths. The early prioritisation of healthcare staff and clinically vulnerable patients increases the impact of vaccination on admissions and also protects the healthcare service. An inflection point, when 50% of the adult population has been vaccinated - with deaths reduced by 95% and hospital admissions by 80% - may be a useful point for re-evaluating vaccine prioritisation.

It is a promising prostate cancer treatment due to sparing of the tissues associated with morbidity risk from conventional therapies. IRE effects depend on electric field strength and tissue properties. These characteristics are organ-dependent, affecting IRE treatment outcomes. This study characterizes the relevant properties to improve treatment planning and outcome predictions for IRE prostate cancer treatment. METHODS Clinically relevant IRE pulse protocols were delivered to a healthy canine and two human cancerous prostates while measuring electrical parameters to determine tissue characteristics for predictive treatment simulations. Prostates were resected 5 hr, 3 weeks, and 4 weeks post-IRE. Lesions were correlated with numerical simulations to determine an effective prostate lethal IRE electric field threshold. RESULTS Lesions were produced in all subjects. Tissue electrical conductivity increased from 0.284 to 0.927 S/m due to IRE pulses. Numerical simulations show an average effective prostate electric field threshold of 1072  119 V/cm, significantly higher than previously characterized tissues. Histological findings in the human cases show instances of complete tissue necrosis centrally with variable tissue effects beyond the margin. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary experimental IRE trials safely ablated healthy canine and cancerous human prostates, as examined in the short- and medium-term.

In settings like this such as China, Australia, and New Zealand, rare outbreak events can lead to escalating epidemics and trigger the imposition of large scale lockdown policies. Here, we examine to what degree vaccination status of incoming arrivals and the quarantine workforce can allow relaxation of quarantine requirements. To do so, we develop and apply a detailed model of COVID-19 disease progression and transmission taking into account nuanced timing factors. Key among these are disease incubation periods and the progression of infection detectability during incubation. Using the disease characteristics associated with the ancestral lineage of SARS-CoV-2 to benchmark the level of acceptable risk, we examine the performance of the border quarantine system for vaccinated arrivals. We examine disease transmission and vaccine efficacy parameters over a wide range, covering plausible values for the Delta variant currently circulating globally. Our results indicate a threshold in outbreak potential as a function of vaccine efficacy, with the time until an outbreak increasing by up to two orders of magnitude as vaccine efficacy against transmission increases from 70% to 90%. For parameters corresponding to the Delta variant, vaccination is able to maintain the capacity of quarantine systems to reduce case importation and outbreak risk, by counteracting the pathogen's increased infectiousness. To prevent outbreaks, heightened vaccination in border quarantine systems must be combined with mass vaccination.

Supporting psychosocial and behavioural self-management is increasingly important for CWP, as pharmacological interventions show limited benefit. We systematically reviewed the effectiveness of interventions applying self-management principles for CWP including fibromyalgia. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry were searched for studies reporting randomised controlled trials of interventions adhering to self-management principles for CWP including fibromyalgia. Primary outcomes included physical function and pain intensity. Where data were sufficient, meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. Studies were narratively reviewed where meta-analysis could not be conducted Evidence quality was rated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) (PROSPERO-CRD42018099212). RESULTS: Thirty-nine completed studies were included. Despite some variability in studies narratively reviewed, in studies meta-analysed self-management interventions improved physical function in the short-term, post-treatment to 3 months (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.20, 0.64) and long-term, post 6 months (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.20, 0.53), compared to no treatment/usual care controls. Studies reporting on pain narratively had greater variability, however, those studies meta-analysed showed self-management interventions reduced pain in the short-term (SMD -0.49, 95% CI -0.70, -0.27) and long-term (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.58, -0.19) compared to no treatment/usual care.

Most participants reported beliefs about COVID-19 health risks that were inaccurate, and overestimation of health risk was most common. For example, while deaths in persons younger than 55 years old accounted for 7% of total US deaths, respondents estimated that this population represented 43% of deaths. Overestimating COVID-19 health risks was associated with increased self-reported household isolation, with percentage differences ranging from 5.6 to 11.8 (P<.001 at each time point). Characteristics associated with self-reported household isolation from the July and August 2020 surveys and persisting in the December 2020 survey included younger age (18 to 39 years), having a serious medical condition, having a household member with a serious medical condition, and identifying as a Democrat. In the Gallup Panel, self-reported household isolation was associated with a higher prevalence of loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic-related harms to emotional and mental well-being may be attenuated by reducing risk overestimation and household isolation preferences that exceed public health guidelines.","output":"Association of COVID-19 Risk Misperceptions With Household Isolation in the United States: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to explore the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related lockdown in university workers, and to analyse the factors related to their levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.

Data were electronically stored by the monitor during transport, extracted and analyzed off-line after the transport. After removal of all zero and floor effect values, the Savitzky-Golay algorithm of data smoothing was applied on the NIRS-signal. The second order of smoothing polynomial was used and the optimal number of neighboring points for the smoothing procedure was evaluated. NIRS-data from 38 pediatric patients was examined. Reliability, defined as measurements without values of 0 or 15%, was acceptable during transport (> 90% of all measurements). There were, however, individual patients with < 90% reliable measurements during transport, while no patient was found to have < 90% reliable measurements in hospital. Satisfactory noise reduction of the signal, without distortion of the underlying information, was achieved when 20-50 neighbors (\\"window-size\\") were used. The use of NIRS for measuring rSO2 in clinical studies during pediatric transport in ground and air-ambulance is feasible but hampered by unreliable values and signal interference.

The first chapter is the one of Tigerstedt's experiments about renin, and Loesch and Gollblatt's model of renal hypertension. The race to elucidate the mechanisms of angiotensin, angiotensinogen and the angiotensin conversion enzyme cascade, by Braun Menndez and Page teams, is a second chapter. The puzzle of this elegant cascade is completed by aldosterone isolation by the collaboration of Tait spouses and Tadeus Rechstein. As a corollary of these findings, Conn made the first description of primary hyperaldosteronism. The elucidation of RAAS pathophysiology naturally led to the synthesis of the antihypertensive captopril by Ondetti and Cushman, thereby opening the modern era of ACE inhibitors and ARII blockers. In March 2020, a viral pandemic caused by SARS-Cov-2 ignites the entire planet. This new coronavirus uses the RAAS angiotensin conversion enzyme type 2 (ACE-2) as a gateway. The SARS-CoV-2/ACE-2 signalling pathway and its pathological effects on the cardio-respiratory and renal system of these patients initiate a new chapter. The interaction of SARS-Cov-2/ACE-2 axis with anti-hypertensive agents, as well as with ACE-2 activators and ACE-2 homologs, takes a part of an active international study searching for therapeutic targets.

Mutations in integrins and Kindlin3 in humans known as Leukocyte adhesion deficiencies (LAD) cause a wide spectrum of complications, including osteopetrosis. Yet, the rarity, frequent misdiagnosis, and lethality of LAD preclude mechanistic analysis of skeletal abnormalities in these patients. Here, using inducible and constitutive tissue-specific Kindlin3 knockout (K3KO) mice, we show that the constitutive lack of embryonic-Kindlin3 in myeloid lineage cells causes growth retardation, edentulism, and skull deformity indicative of hydrocephaly. Micro-CT analysis revealed craniosynostosis, choanal stenosis, and micrognathia along with other skeletal abnormalities characteristic of osteopetrosis. A marked progression of osteosclerosis occurs in mature to middle-aged adults, resulting in the narrowing of cranial nerve foramina and bone marrow cavities of long bones. However, postnatal-Kindlin3 is less critical for bone remodeling and architecture. Thus, myeloid Kindlin3 is essential for skeletal development and its deficiency leads to autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate whether a Web-based intervention can encourage more frequent hand-washing in the home, and to examine potential mediators and moderators of outcomes, as a necessary first step before testing effects of the intervention on infection rates in the PRIMIT trial (PRimary care trial of a website based Infection control intervention to Modify Influenza-like illness and respiratory infection Transmission). METHODS: In a parallel-group pragmatic exploratory trial design, 517 nonblinded adults recruited through primary care were automatically randomly assigned to a fully automated intervention comprising 4 sessions of tailored motivational messages and self-regulation support (n = 324) or to a no-intervention control group (n = 179; ratio 2:1). Hand-washing frequency and theory of planned behavior cognitions relating to hand-washing were assessed by online questionnaires at baseline (in only half of the control participants, to permit evaluation of effects of baseline assessment on effect sizes), at 4 weeks (postintervention; all participants), and at 12 weeks. RESULTS: Hand-washing rates in the intervention group were higher at 4 weeks than in the control group (mean 4.40, n = 285 and mean 4.04, n = 157, respectively; P < .001, Cohen d = 0.42) and remained higher at 12 weeks (mean 4.45, n = 282 and mean 4.12, n = 154, respectively; P < .001, Cohen d = 0.34). Hand-washing intentions and positive attitudes toward hand-washing increased more from baseline to 4 weeks in the intervention group than in the control group. Mediation analyses revealed positive indirect effects of the intervention on change in hand-washing via intentions (coefficient = .15, 95% confidence interval [CI], .08C.26) and attitudes (coefficient = 0.16, 95% CI, .09C.26). Moderator analyses confirmed that the intervention was similarly effective for men and women, those of higher and lower socioeconomic status, and those with higher and lower levels of perceived risk. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides promising evidence that Web-based interventions could potentially provide an effective method of promoting hand hygiene in the home. Data were collected during the 2010 influenza pandemic, when participants in both groups had already been exposed to extensive publicity about the need for hand hygiene, suggesting that our intervention could add to existing public health campaigns.

However, there is no specific drug for preventing the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) caused by COVID-19. Indeed, interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been highlighted for its many biological functions, such as immune regulation, inflammatory response, and metabolism. Therapeutic blockade of the IL-6 signaling pathway is expected to reduce the excessive immune reponse observed in COVID-19. Currently, the IL-6 receptor antagonists tocilizumab and sarilumab, have been adopted for preventing CRS during the progression of COVID-19, and remarkable beneficial effects were observed by using these humanized monoclonal antibodies.

Several obstacles hinder achieving their goals; thus, MedMinas Project aimed to evaluate the PHCPS, the supply system, and the use of medicines. This paper reflects on our experience designing, planning, and conducting the project, describing the issues yielded in the field and lessons learned. METHODS: This work consists of a mixed-methods study conducted in Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. We adopted the principles of Rapid Evaluation Methods, employing a multistage stratified sampling for the quantitative and a purposeful sampling for the qualitative components, respectively, and a documentary research. Data sources included individuals (patients and professionals), prescriptions, dispensed medicines, and policy documents collected between April and October 2019. The quantitative data described in this paper were analysed by descriptive statistics and the qualitative by Thematic Content Analysis. RESULTS: A total of 26 municipalities varying from 37,784 to 409,341 inhabitants were included. The field team spent, on average, 16 days in each location. We interviewed 1019 respondents, of which 127 were professionals and 892 patients. The participation rate varied from 92 to 100%, depending on the respondent subgroup. Most interviews lasted between 45 min and one hour. Fieldwork challenges included participants enrolment, field team, interview processes, and project budget.

So home can be converted to intelligent home automation systems to perform its computation automatically. In a pandemic situation, the majority of people have spent their maximum time at home. So indoor air quality, insider's and outsider's health monitoring has become an important issue. As respiratory diseases are the main concern for pandemics, we have to develop an intelligent home system model to monitor healthy environmental conditions for the users. This paper proposes an energy-efficient smart system model to monitor the health and environmental condition by measuring the carbon monoxide threat level that indirectly affects other atmospheric parameters. Our system alerts when the carbon monoxide level exceeds the safe level. Remote monitoring of the home and health parameters is done in real-time with the help of the system model. For this purpose, we are adopting Dempster-Shafer evidence theory as a mathematical model to aggregate the data coming from different sensors. The sensor nodes track the home and health parameters such as room temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide level, SpO2 level, body temperature, and pulse rate. The smartphone app updates the user's real-time sensor data through the display and indirectly helps to maintain the physical distance.

This manuscript is an attempt to study the various structural, physical and chemical properties of the molecules. The molecule was optimised using B3LYP functional with 6-311G+(2d,p) basis set. Excited state properties of the compound were studied using CAM-B3LYP functional with same basis sets using IEFPCM model in methanol for the implicit solvent atmosphere. The various electronic descriptors helped to identify the reactivity behaviour and stability. The compound is found to possess good nonlinear optical properties in gas phase. The various intramolecular electronic delocalisations and non-covalent interactions were analysed and explained. As the compound contain several heterocyclic nitrogen atoms, they have potential proton abstraction features, which was analysed energetically. The most important result from this study is from the molecular docking analysis which indicates that rimegepant binds irreversibly with three established SARS-CoV-2 proteins with ID 6LU7, 6M03 and 6W63 with docking scores ? 9.2988, -8.3629 and ? 9.5421 kcal/mol respectively. Further assessment of docked complexes with molecular dynamics simulations revealed that hydrophobic interactions, water bridges and  C  interactions play a signification role in stabilising the ligand within the binding region of respective proteins. MMGBSA free energies further demonstrated that rimegepant is more stable when complexed with 6LU7 among the selected PDB models. As the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of this molecule are already established, rimegepant can be considered as an ideal candidate with potential for use in the treatment of COVID patients after clinical studies.","output":"Energy and Reactivity Profile and Proton Affinity Analysis of Rimegepant with Special Reference to its Potential Activity against SARS-Cov-2 Virus Proteins using Molecular Dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior epidemiologic studies have shown that increasing body mass index (BMI) is associated with higher total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL).

Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between BMI and lipid fractions. Multiple linear regression was performed to assess the independent effect of BMI on lipid levels while adjusting for potential confounders and propensity scores. Six hundred thirty-seven patients were analyzed (females, n = 362, 57%). There was no association between higher BMI and LDL (r = 0.19 p = 0.07), a negative association with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL; r = 0.45, p < 0.001), and a positive association with the log transformation of triglycerides (r = 0.32, p = 0.005).Higher BMI was inversely associated with HDL and directly associated with TG. BMI showed no significant association with LDL.

It indicates the presence of linear correlations in the PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations.

Inferring the intentional states of our interaction partners is crucial in achieving this, and social neuroscience has begun elucidating the intra- and inter-personal neural processes supporting such inferences. Typically, however, neuroscientific paradigms lack the reciprocal to-and-fro characteristic of social communication, offering little insight into the way these processes operate online during real-world interaction. In the present study, we overcame this by developing a \\"hyperscanning\\" paradigm in which pairs of interactants could communicate verbally with one another in a joint-action task whilst both undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging simultaneously. Successful performance on this task required both interlocutors to predict their partner's upcoming utterance in order to converge on the same word as each other over recursive exchanges, based only on one another's prior verbal expressions. By applying various levels of analysis to behavioural and neuroimaging data acquired from 20 dyads, three principle findings emerged: First, interlocutors converged frequently within the same semantic space, suggesting that mutual understanding had been established. Second, assessing the brain responses of each interlocutor as they planned their upcoming utterances on the basis of their co-player's previous word revealed the engagement of the temporo-parietal junctional (TPJ), precuneus and dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex. Moreover, responses in the precuneus were modulated positively by the degree of semantic convergence achieved on each round. Second, effective connectivity among these regions indicates the crucial role of the right TPJ in this process, consistent with the Nexus model.

Data on socio-demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, comorbidities, and the health outcomes of 205,654 patients were examined. Characteristics of the study population were described. To assess the association of study variables with the disease severity, the Chi-Squared test and Multiple Logistic Regression model were applied. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 52.8 years and 93,612 (45.5%) were women. About half of the patients have presented with low levels of blood oxygen saturation. The ICU admission rate was 17.8% and the overall mortality rate was 10.0%. Older age, male sex, comorbidities including hypertension, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases other than asthma, chronic liver diseases, chronic kidney diseases, chronic neurological disorders, and HIV/AIDS infection were risk markers of poor health outcome. Clinical presentations related with worse prognosis included fever, difficulty breathing, impaired consciousness, and cutaneous manifestations. CONCLUSION: These results might alert physicians to pay attention to determinants and risk factors associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. In addition, our findings aid decision makers to emphasise on vulnerable groups in the public health strategies that aim at preventing the spread of the disease and its mortalities.","output":"Sociodemographic determinants and clinical risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity: a cross-sectional analysis of over 200,000 patients in Tehran, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The onset of COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly rendered disinfectants an essential class of substances for daily use globally.

The pandemic not only has catastrophic impacts on physical health and economy around the world, but also the psychological well-being of individuals, communities and society. The psychological and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic internationally have not been well described. There is a lack of international study assessing health-related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on the degree to which individuals are fearful of the pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to (1) assess the health-related impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in community-dwelling individuals around the world; (2) determine the extent various communities are fearful of COVID-19 and (3) identify perceived needs of the population to prepare for potential future pandemics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This global study involves 30 countries. For each country, we target at least 500 subjects aged 18 years or above. The questionnaires will be available online and in local languages. The questionnaires include assessment of the health impacts of COVID-19, perceived importance of future preparation for the pandemic, fear, lifestyles, sociodemographics, COVID-19-related knowledge, e-health literacy, out-of-control scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe participants' characteristics, perceptions on the health-related impacts of COVID-19, fear, anxiety and depression, lifestyles, COVID-19 knowledge, e-health literacy and other measures. Univariable and multivariable regression models will be used to assess the associations of covariates on the outcomes.

SUBJECT AND METHODS: We estimated the number of PrEP users by using drug prescription data and information on on-demand/intermittent PrEP use from online surveys to determine the proportion of on-demand/intermittent and daily PrEP use as well as the average number of PrEP pills used. The number of MSM in need of PrEP in 2017 was estimated based on four groups defined among respondents to a large online survey, combining respondents with PrEP use intention and respondents indicating substantial sexual risks. The size of each group was estimated based on self-selection biases. MSM with PrEP need in 2017 were compared with the estimated number of persons taking PrEP by June 2020. RESULTS: We estimated a total of 15,600 to 21,600 PrEP users in Germany by the end of June 2020, corresponding to 40C55% of men with PrEP use intention in 2017. A correlation between the regional distribution of PrEP use intention in 11/2017 and actual PrEP use by 06/2020 suggested an unequal regional distribution of unsatisfied needs. The number of men with unmet PrEP needs ranged between 27,500 and 93,000 in 06/2020. CONCLUSION: PrEP use in Germany has increased considerably between 10/2017 and 06/2020, but large regional inequalities persist.

Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by vasoconstriction, cell proliferation and shifting toward a proinflammatory and prothrombic state. In hypertension endothelial dysfunction may be involved in the initiation and development of vascular inflammation, vascular remodeling, and atherosclerosis and is independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Different conditions such as impaired vascular shear stress, inflammation and oxidative stress, activation of the renin angiotensin system have been described as important pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of endothelial dysfunction. The release of extracellular vesicles by neighboring cells in the vascular wall has emerged as an important regulator of endothelial function and with potential antihypertensive properties and beneficial effects by counteracting the hypertension mediated organ damage. Furthermore, macrovesicles are emerging as an innovative therapeutic approach for vascular protection, allowing the delivery of bioactive molecules, such as miRNA and drugs interacting with the renin angiotensin system. In this review we summarize the available evidence about the pathophysiological implications of endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular diseases, focusing on hypertension and its sequelae, and the potential innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the endothelium with the aim to improve vascular function and remodeling.","output":"Endothelial Dysfunction in Hypertension: Current Concepts and Clinical Implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The mesh fixation technique used in repair of hiatal hernias and subxiphoid ventral and incisional hernias must meet strenuous requirements. In the literature, there are reports of life-threatening complications with cardiac tamponade and a high mortality rate on using tacks. The continuing practice of tack deployment for mesh fixation to the diaphragm and esophageal hiatus should be critically reviewed. METHODS In a systematic search of the available literature in May 2017, 23 cases of severe penetrating cardiac complications were identified. The authors became aware of two other cases in which they acted as medical experts. Furthermore, the instructions for use issued by the manufacturers of the tacks were reviewed with regard to their deployment in the diaphragm. RESULTS Twenty-three of 25 cases (92%) with severe cardiac injuries and subsequent cardiac tamponade were triggered by the use of tacks in the diaphragm. In six cases (24%), these related to ventral and incisional hernias with extension to the subxiphoid area, and in 19 cases (76%) to mesh-augmented hiatoplasty. Twelve of 25 (48%) patients died as a result of pericardial and/or heart muscle injury with cardiac tamponade despite heart surgery intervention. In the tack manufacturers' instructions for use, their deployment in the diaphragm, in particular in the vicinity of the heart, is contraindicated. Likewise, the existing guidelines urgently advise against the use of tacks in the diaphragm, recommending instead alternative fixation techniques.

However, no studies have been conducted to investigate its anticancer potential, particularly its extracted oil. PURPOSE: The present study was put forth to appraise the anticancer potential of Parrotiopsis jacquemontiana extracted oil against liver (hcclm3 and hepg2) and breast cancer (mda-mb 231 and mcf-7) cell lines relative to normal cell lines (lo2 and mcf-10a) via MTT assay. METHODS: Flow cytometry indicated the apoptotic effect whereas invasion and migration capabilities of oil against cancer cells were determined by Matrigel invasion chamber and wound-scratch assays. RESULTS: The results of oil revealed a time and dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation inhibition, conferring to least IC50 shown against hcclm3 (144.9  0.75 g/ml) and mda-mb 231 (145.7  0.32 g/ml) cell line at 72 h, whereas no cytotoxic effect on normal cells was observed. In addition, the oil significantly (p < 0.001) suppressed the migration and invasion of hcclm3 and mda-mb 231 cells, showing noteworthy anti-metastatic potential. Furthermore, cell death was confirmed by AnnexinaV/PI staining where the maximum apoptotic percentage was calculated for oil (200 g/ml) alongside mda-mb 231 conferring to 15.36  1.22, 26.7  1.2, and 36.43  1.65 at 24, 48, and 72 h whereas 12.33  1.05, 19.36  1.62, and 29.3  0.79 was recorded alongside hcclm3 at similar time intervals, respectively.

However, findings suggest that many PMHS are provided sub-optimally due to a lack of resources. This study sought to examine pharmacy professionals perceptions of the future of PMHS. METHODS: Participants comprised pharmacy professionals from NHS Trusts in England that provided a PMHS. Invitations to participate in a qualitative survey and then an interview were sent to pharmacy services at all NHS Trusts that provided a PMHS. This resulted in 100 survey participants and 34 interview participants. Data were analysed using Braun and Clarkes inductive reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two themes were generated: Enhancing value for service users and Improving efficiency. Enhancing value for service users identifies pharmacy professionals suggestions for improving the value of PMHS for service users. These include providing access methods extending beyond the telephone, and providing patients/carers with post-discharge follow-up calls from a pharmacist to offer medicines-related support. Improving efficiency identifies that, in the future, and in line with NHS plans for efficiency and shared resources, PMHS may become centralised or provided by community pharmacies. Centralised services were considered to likely have more resources available to provide a patient medicines information service compared to hospital pharmacies. However, such a change was perceived to only increase efficiency if patient information can be shared between relevant healthcare settings. CONCLUSIONS: PMHS are perceived by pharmacy professionals as likely to become centralised in the future (i.e., provided regionally/nationally). However, such change is dependent upon the sharing of patients information between hospitals and the centralised hub/s or pharmacies. To enhance the value of PMHS for service users, providers should consider establishing other methods of access, such as email and video consultation. Considering the uncertainty around the future of PMHS, research should establish the best way to support all patients and carers regarding medicines following hospital discharge.","output":"Pharmacy professionals views regarding the future of NHS patient medicines helpline services: a multimethod qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nature-based tourism (NBT) has become a popular tool for developing countries to achieve economic growth by the non-destructive use of their natural resources. COVID-19 has caused severe financial impacts on tourism-dependent areas. Revitalizing NBT is needed for economic recovery in those regions and can also help deal with mental health issues worldwide. Zhangjiajie National Forest Park (ZNFP), the first national park created in China, was selected to examine the important factors that influence visitor satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic and the relationship between satisfaction and visitors' environmentally responsible behavior (ERB) intention. The authors collected 788 onsite and online questionnaires from visitors to ZNFP during JuneCSeptember 2020. This paper reveals previously underestimated factors and offers practical applications for park development at ZNFP and other NBT destinations. Visitors had a high level of satisfaction with the natural scenery of the park but were relatively dissatisfied with price reasonableness, park services, activities and events, and artificial attractions. Younger visitors, especially students, and well-educated visitors looking for environmental education opportunities tended to have lower satisfaction rates. Visitor satisfaction may have a positive but limited influence on promoting visitors' ERB intentions. We propose group-specific strategies for national park managers to attract more visitors and increase their length of stay.","output":"Visitor satisfaction and behavioral intentions in nature-based tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case study from Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In absence of effective pharmaceutical treatments, the individuals compliance with a series of behavioral recommendations provided by the public health authorities play a critical role in the control and prevention of SARS-CoV2 infection.

Based on the current literature, these 3 categories of factors were identified as potential determinants of individual differences in the health preventive behaviors. The data used for these analyses are drawn from 2 cross-sectional studies (N  2,000) conducted after the lockdown and before the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. The participants were drawn from a larger internet consumer panel where recruitment was stratified to generate a socio-demographically representative sample of the French adult population. Overall, the results show a very high rate of compliance with the behavioral recommendations among the participants. A series of linear regression analyses were then performed to assess the potential explanatory power of these approaches in complying with these recommendations by successively including sociocultural factors, psychosocial factors, social cognitive factors, and then all factors, in the model. Only the inclusion of the cognitive variables substantially increased the explained variance of the self-reported adoption of preventive behaviors, providing better support for the social cognitive than the sociocultural and psychosocial explanations.","output":"Determinants of preventive behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in France: comparing the sociocultural, psychosocial and social cognitive explanations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the declaration of the end of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS) outbreak in December 2015 in South Korea that the epidemic lasted for 2 months, the depressed domestic economy and tourism sector did not immediately restore.

Identifying, at first clinical presentation, gene expression signatures that predict subsequent severity will allow clinicians to identify the most at-risk groups of patients and enable appropriate antibiotic use. METHODS: Blood RNA-Seq and clinical data were collected from 348 patients in four emergency rooms (ER) and one intensive-care-unit (ICU), and 44 healthy controls. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using machine learning and data mining to identify clinically relevant gene signatures reflecting disease severity, organ dysfunction, mortality, and specific endotypes/mechanisms. FINDINGS: Gene expression signatures were obtained that predicted severity/organ dysfunction and mortality in both ER and ICU patients with accuracy/AUC of 77C80%. Network analysis revealed these signatures formed a coherent biological program, with specific but overlapping mechanisms/pathways. Given the heterogeneity of sepsis, we asked if patients could be assorted into discrete groups with distinct mechanisms (endotypes) and varying severity. Patients with early sepsis could be stratified into five distinct and novel mechanistic endotypes, named Neutrophilic-Suppressive/NPS, Inflammatory/INF, Innate-Host-Defense/IHD, Interferon/IFN, and Adaptive/ADA, each based on 200 unique gene expression differences, and distinct pathways/mechanisms (e.g., IL6/STAT3 in NPS). Endotypes had varying overall severity with two severe (NPS/INF) and one relatively benign (ADA) groupings, consistent with reanalysis of previous endotype studies. A 40 gene-classification tool (accuracy=96%) and several gene-pairs (accuracy=89C97%) accurately predicted endotype status in both ER and ICU validation cohorts.

In the subgroup analysis, IL-6 was the optimal differential diagnostic parameter that had the ability to identify if COVID-19 patients would be severely affected, and severe COVID-19 patients had lower levels of lymphocyte subsets (CD3(+) T cells, CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells, CD3(+)CD8(+)T cells, and CD19(+) B cells) and CD16(+)CD56(+) NK cells and higher level of neutrophils. There were significant differences in the levels of CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells between T(1-2) and T(3-4) stages as well as IL-2 and CD19(+) B cells between N(0-1) and N(2-3) stages while no significant differences between the metastatic and nonmetastatic cancer patients. Additionally, there were higher correlations between IL-2 and IL-4, TNF- and IL-2, TNF- and IL-4, TNF- and IFN-, and CD16(+)CD56(+)NK cells and various subsets of T cells in COVID-19 patients. There was a higher correlation between CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells in cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Inflammation associated with COVID-19 or cancer had effects on patients' outcomes. Accompanied by changes in immune cells and cytokines, there were consistencies, differences, and satisfactory correlations between patients with COVID-19 and those with cancers.","output":"COVID-19 and Cancer: Discovery of Difference in Clinical Immune Indexes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Essential worker absenteeism has been a pressing problem in the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly 20% of US hospitals experienced staff shortages, exhausting replacement pools and at times requiring COVID-positive healthcare workers to remain at work. To our knowledge there are no data-informed models examining how different staffing strategies affect epidemic dynamics on a network in the context of rising worker absenteeism. Here we develop a susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered adaptive network model using pair approximations to gauge the effects of worker replacement versus redistribution of work among remaining healthy workers in the early epidemic phase. Parameterized with hospital data, the model exhibits a time-varying trade-off: Worker replacement minimizes peak prevalence in the early phase, while redistribution minimizes final outbreak size. Any \\"ideal\\" strategy requires balancing the need to maintain a baseline number of workers against the desire to decrease total number infected.

This study examined whether alternative mismatch criteria can also differentiate patients according to their response to reperfusion. METHODS Patients from the DEFUSE 2 study were categorized according to vessel occlusion on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and DWI lesion volume criteria (MRA-DWI mismatch) and symptom severity and DWI criteria (clinical-DWI mismatch). Favorable clinical response was defined as an improvement of 8 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) by day 30 or an NIHSS score of 1 at day 30. We assessed, for each set of criteria, whether the association between reperfusion and favorable clinical response differed according to mismatch status. RESULTS A differential response to reperfusion was observed between patients with and without MRA-DWI mismatch defined as an internal carotid artery or M1 occlusion and a DWI lesion<50 mL. Reperfusion was associated with good functional outcome in patients who met these MRA-DWI mismatch criteria (odds ratio [OR], 8.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-31.3), whereas no association was observed in patients who did not meet these criteria (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.08-3.1; P for difference between the odds, 0.01).

Although individual differences in chronotype have been associated with an increased risk of developing some types of cancer, no studies have been carried out in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET). MATERIALS: We investigate the differences in chronotype between 109 GEP-NET and 109 healthy subjects, gender-, age-, and BMI-matched; and its correlation with tumor aggressiveness. RESULTS: GEP-NET patients have a lower chronotype score (p = 0.035) and a higher percentage of evening chronotype (p = 0.003) than controls. GEP-NET patients with morning chronotype had lower BMI, waist circumference, and higher percentage of MetS (p < 0.001) than evening type. Interestingly, considering the clinical pathological characteristics, patients with the presence of metastasis, grading G2, and in progressive disease presented the lower chronotype score (p = 0.004, p < 0.001, and p = 0.002; respectively) compared to other categories. Chronotype score was negatively associated with anthropometric measurements, metabolic profile, percentage of MetS, and Ki67 index (p < 0.001 for all).

OBJECTIVES: This article presents methodological guidelines for just-in-time qualitative research based on our current, pandemic-relevant research. METHODS: The processes followed while conducting two longitudinal, online qualitative studies addressing the lived experience and response to the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. Methodological challenges faced were then identified, and specific design and implementation guidelines were developed. The ways in which these guidelines can be applied to conduct just-in-time research during the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises were further delineated using examples from our pandemic-relevant research. RESULTS: Six guidelines were identified: (a) capitalize on fast track review and reporting processes; (b) prioritize accessibility during sample specification and selection; (c) optimize recruitment and retention strategies; (d) maximize current and future data use through strategic research design; (e) tailor data collection to participants' characteristics, preferences, and priorities; and (f) incorporate timeline mapping of personal and contemporaneous phenomena. DISCUSSION: Public health measures taken to slow disease spread during the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises may slow the pace of research and make its implementation all the more challenging. However, just-in-time qualitative research advances our understanding of the human experience and response to the COVID-19 and major public health crises. It also complements existing behavioral theory and research. The guidelines presented may assist researchers to initiate necessary qualitative research more rapidly, with fewer logistic challenges, and with methodological rigor. They may also help expand research on groups experiencing collateral effects of the pandemic and major public health crisis. Lastly, the guidelines may support the development of more robust data for alternate analysis at a later date.","output":"Just-in-Time Qualitative Research: Methodological Guidelines Based on the COVID-19 Pandemic Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robotic observatories are ideal infrastructures that can be remotely accessed by scientists, amateurs, and general public for research and education in Astronomy.

Unfortunately, though, intensive animal agriculture has grown rapidly over the last century. All signs indicate that it will continue to grow in the future. This is bad news for billions of animals. It's also bad news for those who want an animal-friendly food system. Because the public isn't very concerned about the plight of animals-or is concerned, but has a high tolerance for cognitive dissonance-animal activists regularly engage in indirect activism. Indirect activism involves arguing that some cause that's indirectly related to the activist's primary agenda provides reasons to act in ways that are congruent with that agenda. In this paper, we consider the two indirect arguments that animal activists advanced in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: first, some used COVID-19 to criticize intensive animal agriculture-many of these had US-based audiences as their target;second, and more modestly, some activists used COVID-19 to condemn wet markets specifically. We contend that both arguments had the risk of backfiring: they risked promoting the very systems that are worst for animals. We then assess the moral significance of this risk, concluding that while it may have been permissible to advance these arguments, there were some serious moral considerations against doing so-ones that weren't addressed by flagging animal activists' concern for animals or any other stakeholder in the discussion. In both cases, we think there are plausible precautionary arguments against the strategies that these activists pursued. Additionally, in the case of arguments against wet markets specifically, we contend that the precautionary argument can be supplemented with a side constraint condition that, arguably, activists violated insofar as they were acting in ways that maintain a racist and xenophobic system.","output":"Animal Agriculture, Wet Markets, and COVID-19: a Case Study in Indirect Activism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DefinitionWhile the precise conceptualization of the term misinformation remains a subject of debate, the current entry defines misinformation as any type of information which is misleading or false, regardless of intent.

However, the chronology of these effects is not yet fully understood. This study aimed to establish the early sequential effects of heat stress in bull sperm quality. Semen and blood samples of Nellore breed bulls were collected and distributed into control and testicular heat stress (scrotal bags/96 h) groups. Semen samples were evaluated for sperm motility, abnormalities, plasma membrane integrity, acrosomal membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm lipid peroxidation, seminal plasma lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation. Blood plasma was also evaluated for lipid peroxidation. An increase in sperm abnormalities was observed 7 days following heat stress. After 14 days, sperm lipid peroxidation increased and mitochondrial membrane function, sperm motility, and plasma membrane integrity decreased. Heat stress effects were still observed after 21 days following heat stress. An increase in sperm DNA fragmentation was observed as a late effect after 28 days. Thus, the initial effects of heat stress (i.e., increasing sperm abnormalities and lipid peroxidation) suggest the presence of oxidative stress in the semen that alters mitochondrial function, sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, and belatedly, DNA fragmentation. Although sperm abnormalities persisted and increased over time, sperm lipid peroxidation, in turn, increased only until 21 days after heat stress.

AimsAscertain changes across settings in healthcare service presentations with self-harm during Waves 1 and 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodE-cohort study using individual-level linked routine healthcare data from Wales, UK, 2016-March 2021. We measured weekly proportion of self-harm contacts and people who self-harmed in contact with general practice (GP), emergency department (ED) and hospital admissions. We modelled weekly trends using linear regression and generalised estimated equations, quantifying time differences using difference-in-difference (DiD). ResultsWe included 3,552,210 Welsh residents aged []10 years. Counts of self-harm presentations across settings was at a minimum at the start of stay-at-home restrictions during both waves and recovered compared to previous years in 3-5 months. Those who self-harmed in April 2020 were more likely to be seen in GP compared to other settings and previous years - mean rate of OR=1.2, although actual numbers fell. The proportion of self-harm ED contacts admitted to hospital dropped from June 2020 (1.9 [1.5-2.3] pp/month). Self-harm and COVID-19 infection had a bidirectional effect - self-harm history had OR=1.4 [1.2-1.6] and incidence had DiD=1.1 [0.8-1.4]. ConclusionsThose that self-harmed and sought help during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially encountered stringent criteria for hospitalisation, particularly in Wave 2, while in Wave 1 they preferentially presented to GP. Reductions in contacts likely resulted in unmet healthcare needs which may later emerge placing further burden on individuals and healthcare services. Relevance statementThis study provides novel findings on how the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to curb its spread affected self-harm healthcare service presentations. To our knowledge no other population-based studies in the UK have linked routinely collected general practice (GP), emergency department (ED) and hospital admission data covering Waves 1 and 2 of the pandemic. Reductions in presentations with self-harm during the pandemic may be the result of those not requiring ED care or hospitalisation avoiding seeking help during the pandemic as often as before.

We assessed, from the day following transfusion, whether the patient was categorized by his or her physician as better, worse or unchanged compared to the day before, and whether, on the reporting day, the patient received mechanical ventilation, was in the ICU, had died or had been discharged. Most patients improved following transfusion, but clinical improvement was most notable in mild to moderately ill patients. Patients classified as severely ill upon enrollment improved, but not as rapidly, while patients classified as critically ill/end-stage and patients on ventilators showed worsening of disease status even after treatment with convalescent plasma. Patients age 80 and over showed little or no clinical improvement following transfusion.

Once \\"lockdown\\" has driven incidence to low levels, selected activities are being permitted. Re-opening schools is a priority because of the welfare and educational impact of closures on children. However, the impact of school re-opening needs to be considered within the context of other measures. Methods We use social contact data from the UK to predict the impact of social distancing policies on the reproduction number. We calibrate our tool to the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK using publicly available death data and Google Community Mobility Reports. We focus on the impact of re-opening schools against a back-drop of wider social distancing easing. Results We demonstrate that pre-collected social contact data, combined with incidence data and Google Community Mobility Reports, is able to provide a time-varying estimate of the reproduction number (R). From an pre-control setting when R=2.7 (95%CI 2.5, 2.9), we estimate that the minimum reproduction number that can be achieved in the UK without limiting household contacts is 0.45 (95%CI:0.41-0.50); in the absence of other changes, preventing leisure contacts has a smaller impact (R=2.0,95%CI:1.8-2.4) than preventing work contacts (R=1.5,95%CI:1.4-1.7). We find that following lockdown (when R=0.7 (95% CI 0.6, 0.8)), opening primary schools in isolation has a modest impact on transmission R=0.83 (95%CI:0.77-0.90) but that high adherence to other measures is needed. Opening secondary schools as well as primary school is predicted to have a larger overall impact (R=0.95,95%CI:0.85-1.07), however transmission could still be controlled with effective contact tracing. Conclusions Our findings suggest that primary school children can return to school without compromising transmission, however other measures, such as social distancing and contract tracing, are required to control transmission if all age groups are to return to school. Our tool provides a mapping from policies to the reproduction number and can be used by policymakers to compare the impact of social-easing measures, dissect mitigation strategies and support careful localized control strategies.","output":"Using social contact data to predict and compare the impact of social distancing policies with implications for school re-opening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the global community was caught off guard with the pandemic, semiconductor industry dealt with unexpected swings in applications and demands.

This mixed method case study explores the patterns that emerged when we used WhatsApp to create a community of learning during the multimodal presentation of a postgraduate course in research proposal writing. Three questions drive the study: (1) What kinds of messages were sent? (2) Who participated and how? (3) How did the learners experience the use of WhatsApp in support of the community of learning? Data were collected during the presentation of a five-evening proposal writing workshop that was conducted using Zoom, WhatsApp, and YouTube as communication platforms. To answer the first question, all WhatsApp messages were analysed through both manual (individual) and automated (meta) content analysis. The third question was answered by analysing students responses to the end-of session online questionnaire that was administered via Google Forms. Results indicate that many messages were administrative in nature, while the most notable academic messages concerned a discussion of empirical research, research paradigms, and research design. The presenter and co-presenter together accounted for almost half of the messages sent, and the other messages were evenly distributed between members of the class, with five notably vocal students. Student responses indicated that they liked the high level of interactivity and the content, but that they disliked the time it took to form groups. The paper contributes to the literature by showing how this use of multiple WhatsApp groups was effective in creating a sense of community by facilitating access, relationships, vision, and function (West and Williams, 2017). More research is needed in determining the extent to which students might support one another with conversations outside of the main WhatsApp group. ?

Emerging evidence supports use of non-invasive respiratory support (CPAP and high-flow nasal oxygen [HFNO]) in this context, but little is known about its use in patients receiving end-of-life care. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 33 patients who died of Covid-19 on the Respiratory High Dependency Unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford between 28/03/20 and 20/05/20. Data was sourced via retrospective review of electronic patient records and drug charts. RESULTS: Patients dying from Covid-19 on the Respiratory HDU were comorbid with median Charlson Comorbidity Index 5 (IQR 4-6); median age 78 (IQR 72-85). Respiratory support was trialled in all but one case with CPAP being the most common form of first line respiratory support (84.8%) however, was only tolerated in 44.8% of patients. Median time to death was 10.7 days from symptom onset (IQR 7.5-14.6) and 4.9 days from hospital admission (IQR 3.1-8.3). 48.5% of patients remained on respiratory support at the time of death. CONCLUSIONS: End-of-life care for patients with Covid-19 remains a challenge. Patients tend to be frail and comorbid with a rapid disease trajectory. Non-Invasive Respiratory Support may play a key role in symptom management in select patients, however, further work is needed in order to identify patients who will most benefit from Respiratory Support and those for whom withdrawal may prevent unnecessary distress at the end of life or potential prolongation of suffering.","output":"What can we Learn from Patients who Died from Covid-19 Following Escalation to a Respiratory High Dependency Unit for Trial of Non-Invasive Respiratory Support?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 infections and deaths have largely been uneven within and between countries. With 17% of the world's population, India has so far had 13% of global COVID-19 infections and 8.5% of deaths. Maharashtra accounting for 9% of India's population, is the worst affected state, with 19% of infections and 33% of total deaths in the country until 23rd December 2020. Though a number of studies have examined the vulnerability to and spread of COVID-19 and its effect on mortality, no attempt has been made to understand its impact on mortality in the states of India. METHOD: Using data from multiple sources and under the assumption that COVID-19 deaths are additional deaths in the population, this paper examined the impact of the disease on premature mortality, loss of life expectancy, years of potential life lost (YPLL), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in Maharashtra. Descriptive statistics, a set of abridged life tables, YPLL, and DALY were used in the analysis. Estimates of mortality indices were compared pre- and during COVID-19. RESULT: COVID-19 attributable deaths account for 5.3% of total deaths in the state and have reduced the life expectancy at birth by 0.8 years, from 73.2 years in the pre-COVID-19 period to 72.4 years by the end of 2020. If COVID-19 attributable deaths increase to 10% of total deaths, life expectancy at birth will likely reduce by 1.4 years. The probability of death in 20-64 years of age (the prime working-age group) has increased from 0.15 to 0.16 due to COVID-19. There has been 1.06 million additional loss of years (YPLL) in the state, and DALY due to COVID-19 has been estimated to be 6 per thousand.

The aim of this study was to articulate the clinical characteristics of COVID\\\\19 and to reveal possible factors that may affect the persistent time of positive SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 nucleic acid test, so as to identify which patients may deteriorate or have poor prognoses as early as possible. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study was carried out on 47 patients with confirmed COVID\\\\19 infection admitted to XinYu People's Hospital of JiangXi Province. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratorial, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In this study, patients were divided into two groups based on whether their SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 nucleic acid tests in respiratory specimens turn negative within (Group Rapid or Group R) or over (Group Slow or Group S) a week. There was no significant difference in age, sex, travel or exposure history, and smoking history between the two groups. Forty\\\\two patients had been observed with comorbidities. Similar clinical manifestations, for instance fever, cough, sputum, and fatigue, have been observed among patients in both groups, except that patients in Group S were obviously more likely to get fatigue than patients in Group R. Both groups had shown decrease in white blood cell or lymphocyte counts. Chest X\\\\ray or computed tomography scan showed unilateral or bilateral infiltrates.

It is complex because it has many players and is complicated because its institutionalization will require many changes that will be challenging to make. Like many other issues, strengthening EIHP needs a road map, which should consider challenges and address them through effective, harmonized and contextualized strategies. This study aims to develop a road map for enhancing EIHP in Iran based on steps of planning. METHODS: This study consisted of three phases: (1) identifying barriers to EIHP, (2) recognizing interventions and (3) measuring the use of evidence in Iran's health policy-making. A set of activities was established for conducting these, including foresight, systematic review and policy dialogue, to identify the current and potential barriers for the first phase. For the second phase, an evidence synthesis was performed through a scoping review, by searching the websites of benchmark institutions which had good examples of EIHP practices in order to extract and identify interventions, and through eight policy dialogues and two broad opinion polls to contextualize the list of interventions. Simultaneously, two qualitative-quantitative studies were conducted to design and use a tool for assessing EIHP in the third phase. RESULTS: We identified 97 barriers to EIHP and categorized them into three groups, including 35 barriers on the generation of evidence (push side), 41 on the use of evidence (pull side) and 21 on the interaction between these two (exchange side). The list of 41 interventions identified through evidence synthesis and eight policy dialogues was reduced to 32 interventions after two expert opinion polling rounds. These interventions were classified into four main strategies for strengthening (1) the education and training system (6 interventions), (2) the incentives programmes (7 interventions), (3) the structure of policy support organizations (4 interventions) and (4) the enabling processes to support EIHP (15 interventions). CONCLUSION: The policy options developed in the study provide a comprehensive framework to chart a path for strengthening the countrys EIHP considering both global practices and the context of Iran. It is recommended that operational plans be prepared for road map interventions, and the necessary resources provided for their implementation. The implementation of the road map will require attention to the principles of good governance, with a focus on transparency and accountability.

Guidelines for training and certification are narrowing in high-income countries (HICs) at the same time as the fertility rate is declining and the prevalence of complex genitourinary (GU) conditions is decreasing. In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), health systems for large populations are currently in a state of stress. Here we briefly review the history of pediatric urology as a surgical subspecialty, identify unmet needs especially in LMICs and place the field in the context of a global surgical ecosystem. METHODS The English language literature on workforce trends in pediatric urology, pediatric surgery and urology was reviewed as well as development of the emerging field of global surgery. Global surgery looks at the social, economic and political context of health systems as well as unmet clinical need. World trends in fertility rates were reviewed to identify regions of workforce surplus and gaps, supply chain needs, infrastructure and systems strengths and weaknesses. RESULTS The proliferation of training programs in pediatric surgery and specialties in high-income countries (HICs) coupled with declining birth rates has led to a saturation of specialists and declining surgical case load. In LMICs, while the birth rate has also been declining, surgical specialization has not progressed. In the lowest income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, training in pediatric surgical specialties and urology is rare. The broad workforce that supports surgical care, such as anesthesia, intensivist pediatrics, radiology, laboratory, and nursing face similar challenges. Supply chains for specialized pediatric urological surgery are weak. CONCLUSION There is an evolving maldistribution of pediatric surgical and pediatric urological workforce globally, with too few practitioners in LMICs and too many in HICs. The high cost of specialized equipment limits access to quality care, and the supply chain for consumables and medication is patchy. In LIC's, basic community-based infrastructure for health including reliable electricity is lacking.

While much is being discussed about the health and economic impacts, there has been a limited focus on the immediate food sector shocks and their related social implications in developing countries, especially when the farmer surveys cannot be conducted due to mobility restrictions in many countries. To overcome these challenges, this study uses news mining and content analysis of media articles published from February to April 2020, to assess the early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food supply chain and farm distress in India. It also presents the media perception of the impact of the pandemic and resulting policy measures using sentiment analysis, in addition to the cross-tabulation of results that show differential impacts across food supply chain components among different commodity groups and regions. The results show wide-scale impacts across different components of the food supply chain ranging from crop harvesting and processing, distribution and logistics to disruptions across food markets, as represented by 22, 11 and 30% of total articles, respectively. The impacts are also differentiated by commodity groups, with animal products having more trade and demand-side issues, logistic bottlenecks in fruits and vegetables and crops showing problems in labor availability and harvesting. Sentiment analysis of news items shows a spike in the negative sentiment immediately post the national lockdown, with relatively less negativity in subsequent weeks due to large-scale policy and community action. Sentiment classification along different indicators shows the highest negative sentiment for animal products (85%) in commodity groups, western states of India (78%) among different regions, and food supply (85%) and markets (83%) among supply chain components. Further, extreme weather analysis (using excess rainfall events) shows that farmers faced compound risks from the COVID-19 pandemic and extreme weather events in many parts of the country.

The study employs three estimation methods, Ordinary Least Squares/Robust Ordinary Least Squares (OLS/ORLS), Pooled Ordinary Least Squares (POLS) and Panel Vector Autoregressive (PVAR). While the OLS and POLS are used to examine a conditional mean effect of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths on stock market returns PVAR is used to estimate and trace the response of stock market return to shocks from daily growth in COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. OLS results show that stock market returns react negatively and significantly to daily growth in COVID-19 confirmed cases in countries like Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania, Tunisia and Uganda while the negative effects of daily growth in COVID-19 confirmed deaths on stock market returns are negligible. Evidence from POLS reveals that the impacts of an increase in COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths are insignificant. This is corroborated by the results of FEVD. IRF results show that stock market returns react positively to COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths shocks before declining and returning towards normal returns in the long-run.

After nearly 12 months of recovery, we found no significant difference in lung ventilation defect percentage (VDP) between the COVID-19 group and the healthy group (3.8 2.1% versus 3.7 2.2%) using 129Xe MRI, and several lung-function-related parameters-such as gasCblood exchange time (T)-showed improvement (42.2 ms versus 32.5 ms). Combined with 1H brain MRI, we found that the change in gray matter volume (GMV) was strongly related to the degree of pulmonary function recovery-the greater the increase in GMV, the higher degree of pulmonary function damage.","output":"Relationship between Lung and Brain Injury in COVID-19 Patients: A Hyperpolarized 129Xe-MRI-based 8-Month Follow-Up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Blinded outcome assessment in trials with prospective randomized open blinded end point design is challenging. Unblinding can result in misclassified outcomes and biased treatment effect estimates. An outcome adjudication committee assures blinded outcome assessment, but the added value for trials with prospective randomized open blinded end point design and subjective outcomes is unknown. We aimed to assess the degree of misclassification of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores by a central assessor and its impact on treatment effect estimates in a stroke trial with prospective randomized open blinded end point design. METHODS We used data from the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). The primary outcome was the mRS at 90 days. Standardized, algorithm-based telephone interviews to assess the mRS were conducted from a central location by an experienced research nurse, unaware but not formally blinded to treatment allocation (central assessor). Masked reports of these interviews were adjudicated by a blinded outcome committee. Misclassification was defined as an incorrect classification of the mRS by the central assessor. The effect of endovascular treatment on the mRS was assessed with multivariable ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS In MR CLEAN, 53/500 (10.6%) of the mRS scores were misclassified. The degree and direction of misclassification did not differ between treatment arms (P=0.59). Benefit of endovascular treatment was shown on the mRS when scored by the central assessor (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.16-2.21]) and the outcome adjudication committee (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.21-2.20]). CONCLUSIONS Misclassification by the central assessor was small, randomly distributed over treatment arms, and did not affect treatment effect estimates. This study suggests that the added value of a blinded outcome adjudication committee is limited in a stroke trial with prospective randomized open blinded end point design applying standardized, algorithm-based outcome assessment by a central assessor, who is unaware but not formally blinded to treatment allocation.

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk of viral infections, and recent data suggests they may be at an increased risk of poor outcomes with COVID-19. This may be particularly true for those on rituximab or high dose steroids. A huge international effort from the scientific community has so far resulted in the temporary authorisation of three vaccines which offer protection against SARS-CoV-2, with over 30 other vaccines being evaluated in ongoing trials. Although there has historically been concern that vaccines may trigger disease flares of SLE, there is little convincing evidence to show this. In general lupus patients appear to gain good protection from vaccination, although there may be reduced efficacy in those with high disease activity or those on immunosuppressive therapies, such as rituximab or high dose steroids. Recent concerns have been raised regarding rare clotting events with the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine and it is currently unknown whether this risk is higher for those patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. With the possibility of annual COVID vaccination programmes in the future, prospective data collection and registries looking at the effect of vaccination on SLE disease control, the incidence of COVID-19 in SLE patients and severity of COVID-19 disease course would all be useful. As mass vaccination programmes begin to roll out across the world, we assess the evidence of the use of vaccines in SLE patients and in particular vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Lupus, vaccinations and COVID-19: What we know now"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Domestic wastewater and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are key emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Quantifying these emissions in the present and future is crucial to tackle global climate change issues. As a developing country with few rural and urban wastewater treatment facilities, Nepal may have a unique opportunity to reduce future GHGs emissions by a proper selection of wastewater treatment technology. In this paper, the authors used Python programming to estimate the GHGs emissions from the domestic wastewater sector in Nepal under various technological development scenarios for 2020 to 2040 using the refined 2019 estimation methodology developed by Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Results show total equivalent CO2 emission of 3829.43 and 4523.65 Gigagrams in 2020 and 2040, respectively. The 2020 value is seven times greater than Nepal's 2017 national estimates because this study considered rural population and updated methodology. Comparing the technology development scenarios with the Business as Usual scenario, the highest GHGs reduction could be achieved by hybrid constructed wetlands (69.20%) followed by a combined anaerobic and aerobic system with biogas recovery for energy generation (61.72%). Further accuracy may be attained only through the actual measurement of WWTPs emissions and country-specific emission factors. Thus, this paper proposes GHGs estimation of future scenarios portraying urban and rural populations may be invaluable to policymakers of GHGs mitigation for selection of feasible WWTPs, especially in developing countries with limited wastewater treatment facilities and wastewater activity data.","output":"Estimation of greenhouse gases emission from domestic wastewater in Nepal: A scenario-based analysis applicable for developing countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coyotes (Canis latrans) have expanded recently into the eastern US and can serve as a source of pathogens to domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), livestock, and humans.

The articles were analyzed using both a critical discourse analysis approach and a thematic analytical framework. RESULTS: Findings indicate that residents voices are excluded and superseded by others, namely their family members. Literary elements were used to portray residential care as shockingly dangerous, deceptive, and problematic.

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: A cultural model of panic and dishonesty begins to take shape through the COVID-19 pandemic. Fearmongering and the portrayal of residential care as lacking transparency will likely create future mistrust of the industry.

The continuous process was based on the generation of hydroxyl-radicals via the UV-C (254 nm) photo-degradation of hydrogen peroxide and ozone. The decontamination efficacy of the gAOP was dependent on the orientation of the N95 mask passing through the gAOP unit with those positioned horizontally enabling greater exposure to hydroxyl-radicals compared to when arranged vertically. The lethality of gAOP was independent of the applied hydrogen peroxide concentration (2-6% v/v) but was significantly (P<0.05) higher when H2O2 was introduced into the unit at 40 ml/min compared to 20 ml/min. A suitable treatment for N95 masks was identified as 3% v/v hydrogen peroxide delivered into the gAOP reactor at 40 ml/min with continuous introduction of ozone gas and a UV-C dose of 113 mJ/cm2 (30 s processing time). The treatment supported >6 log CFU decrease in Geobacillus stearothermophilus endospores, > 8 log reduction of human coronavirus 229E, and no detection of Escherichia coli K12 on the interior and exterior of masks. There was no negative effect on the N95 mask fitting or particulate efficacy after 20 passes through the gAOP system. No visual changes or hydrogen peroxide residues were detected (<1 ppm) in gAOP treated masks. The optimized gAOP treatment could also support >6 log CFU reduction of endospores inoculated on the interior or exterior of surgical masks. G. stearothermophilus Apex spore strips could be applied as a biological indicator to verify the performance of gAOP treatment. Also, a chemical indicator based on the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole was found suitable for reporting the generation of hydroxyl-radicals. In conclusion, gAOP is a verifiable treatment that can be applied to decontaminate N95 and surgical masks without any negative effects on functionality.","output":"Decontamination of N95 and surgical masks using a treatment based on a continuous gas phase-Advanced Oxidation Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the fear of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its influence on the students' fear of COVID-19 and intention to leave nursing school.

In France, between mid-March and mid-April 2020, 660 COVID-19 patients were safely transported from four regions towards six other regions and four neighboring countries using various modes of transport (plane, helicopter, train, boat). The study aimed to assess costs for these transfers and compare the different transport options. Methods: A cost analysis was conducted including the operating costs for a specific transport distance and time, as well as associated personnel costs. We measured costs for each type of transport system, and costs for specific distances or time in operation, in order to perform comparisons for short, moderate, and long transport distances. Results: Our preliminary findings indicated that using fixed-wing transport for patients was cheaper and more time-effective. For a reference distance of 500 km, which corresponds to the average distance traveled for such transfers, the cost of fixed-wing transport was around 1 625  per patient. On the opposite, helicopters appeared to be the worst option (7 327  per patient) whereas the train accounted for 5 136 euros per patient. In average, personnel costs represented around 13% of total costs. Conclusions: To our knowledge, few studies have investigated the costs of patient transfers during the sanitary crisis. This study includes the first comprehensive cohort of transferred patients during COVID-19 pandemic, in France, between mid-March and mid-April 2020.

Campylobacter spp., L. monocytogenes and STEC were present in samples from the farm environment and were also detected in 4%, 13% and 7% of the milk filters, respectively, and in 3%, 0% and 1% of bulk tank milk samples. Four STEC isolates carried the eae gene, which is linked to the capacity to cause severe human disease. L. monocytogenes were detected more frequently in loose housing herds compared with tie-stalled herds in feces (p=0.02) and feed (p=0.03), and Campylobacter spp. were detected more frequently in loose housing herds in feces (p<0.01) and teat swabs (p=0.03).

Prior research has established sound psychometric properties of the PSC-17-Y for English speakers. OBJECTIVE: This study extends psychometric evidence for the acceptability of the PSC-17-Y in a large sample of Spanish adolescents, providing proof of its reliability and structure, convergent and discriminant validity, and longitudinal and gender invariance. METHODS: Data were collected on 5430 adolescents, aged 12-18 years, who filled out the PSC-17-Y twice during 2018-2019 (7-month interval). We calculated the Cronbach alpha and the McDonald omega coefficients to test reliability, the Pearson correlation for convergent (distress) and criterion validity (well-being, quality of life, and socioemotional skills), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for structure validity, and multigroup and longitudinal measurement invariance analysis for longitudinal and gender stability.

We aimed to analyse the effect of social distancing on the emotional state, post-operative pain and functional outcomes of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of male patients who underwent RARP within the study period (from March to April 2019 [Group A = 27 patients] and from March to April 2020 [Group B = 29 patients]). Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) results were collected on the first day of hospitalization. Post-operative pain was assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS) and visual analogic scale (VAS) after surgery in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 24 hours. Functional outcomes were evaluated at the one-month follow-up. Demographic, pathological and peri-operative data were collected for all patients. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographics and pathological characteristics amongst the groups. We observed that patients in Group A had a statistically lower value on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires than patients of Group B. Moreover, Group A showed statistically significant better post-operative pain control in PACU and at 24 hours. At one-month follow-up, patients in Group B required more diapers for incontinence than Group A, showing poor early continence.

Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the predictor variables and outcome of Severe COVID-19 (Alive Vs Death) where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results. ResultsHaving diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.257, 95% CI= 1.348, 7.867, p-value=0.00), fever (AOR=0.328, 95% CI: 0.123, 0.878, p-value= 0.027) and Shortness of breath (AOR= 4.034, 95% CI= 1.481, 10.988, p-value=0.006) were found to be significant predictors of death in Severe COVID-19 patients. ConclusionsThe outcome of death in Severe COVID-19 patients is found to be associated with exposures to being diabetic and having SOB at admission. On the other hand, having a fever at admission was associated with a favorable outcome of being discharged alive.","output":"Predictors of Death in Severe COVID-19 Patients at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia: A Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is experiencing pandemic of the COVID-19 now, a RNA virus that spread out from Wuhan, China. Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus. Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available. To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21-40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).","output":"Epidemic of COVID-19 in China and associated Psychological Problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze the global structure of the world-wide air transportation network, a critical infrastructure with an enormous impact on local, national, and international economies.

In contrast to the prediction of scale-free network models, however, we find that the most connected cities are not necessarily the most central, resulting in anomalous values of the centrality. We demonstrate that these anomalies arise because of the multi-community structure of the network. We identify the communities in the air transportation network and show that the community structure cannot be explained solely based on geographical constraints, and that geo-political considerations have to be taken into account. We identify each city's global role based on its pattern of inter- and intra-community connections, which enables us to obtain scale-specific representations of the network.","output":"The worldwide air transportation network: Anomalous centrality, community structure, and cities' global roles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study was to investigate the CT quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia and its impacts on the assessment of disease severity and the prediction of clinical outcomes in the management of COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine COVID-19 patients who were confirmed by positive nucleic acid test (NAT) of RT-PCR and hospitalized from January 19, 2020 to February 19, 2020 were collected for this retrospective study. All patients underwent arterial blood gas test, routine blood test, chest CT examination, and physical examination on admission. In addition, fellow-up clinical data including the disease severity, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes were collected for each patient. Lung volume, lesion volume, non-lesion lung volume (NLLV) (lung volume C lesion volume), and fraction of non-lesion lung volume (%NLLV) (non-lesion lung volume / lung volume) were quantified in CT images by using two U-Net models trained for segmentation of lung and COVID-19 lesions in CT images. Furthermore, we calculated 20 histogram textures for lesions volume and non-lesion lung volumes, respectively. To investigate the validity of CT quantification in the management of COVID-19, we built Random Forest (RF) models for the purpose of classification and regression to assess the disease severity (Moderate, Severe, and Critical) and to predict the need and length of ICU stay, the duration of oxygen inhalation, hospitalization, sputum NAT-positive, and patient prognosis. The performance of RF classifiers was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) and that of RF regressors using the root-mean-square error (RMSE). RESULTS: Patients were classified into three groups of disease severity: moderate (n=25), severe (n=47) and critical (n=27), according to the clinical staging. Of which, a total of 32 patients, 1 (1/25) moderate, 6 (6/47) severe and 25 critical (25/27), respectively, were admitted to ICU. The median values of ICU stay were 0, 0, 12 days, the duration of oxygen inhalation 10, 15, and 28 days, the hospitalization 12, 16, and 28 days, and the sputum NAT-positive 8, 9, 13 days, in three severity groups, respectively. The clinical outcomes were complete recovery (n=3), partial recovery with residual pulmonary damage (n=80), prolonged recovery (n=15), and death (n=1). The %NLLV in three severity groups were 92.189.89%, 82.9416.49%, and 66.1924.15% with p-value <0.05 among each two groups. The AUCs of RF classifiers were 0.927 and 0.929 in classification of moderate vs (severe + critical), and severe vs critical, respectively, which were significantly higher than both radiomics models and clinical models (p<0.05). The RMSEs of RF regressors were 0.88 weeks for prediction of duration of hospitalization (mean: 2.60  1.01 weeks), 0.92 weeks for duration of oxygen inhalation (mean: 2.44  1.08 weeks), 0.90 weeks for duration of sputum NAT-positive (mean: 1.59  0.98 weeks), and 0.69 weeks for stay of ICU (mean: 1.32  0.67 weeks), respectively. The AUCs for prediction of ICU treatment and prognosis (partial recovery vs prolonged recovery) were 0.945 and 0.960, respectively.

All E proteins have conserved cysteine residues located on the carboxy side of the long hydrophobic domain, suggesting functional significance. In this study, we confirmed that mouse hepatitis coronavirus A59 E protein is palmitoylated. To understand the role of the conserved residues and the necessity of palmitoylation, three cysteines at positions 40, 44, and 47 were changed singly and in various combinations to alanine. Double- and triple-mutant E proteins resulted in decreased virus-like particle output when coexpressed with the membrane (M) protein. Mutant E proteins were also studied in the context of a full-length infectious clone. Single-substitution viruses exhibited growth characteristics virtually identical to those of the wild-type virus, while the double-substitution mutations gave rise to viruses with less robust growth phenotypes indicated by smaller plaques and decreased virus yields. In contrast, replacement of all three cysteines resulted in crippled virus with significantly reduced yields. Triple-mutant viruses did not exhibit impairment in entry. Mutant E proteins localized properly in infected cells. A comparison of intracellular and extracellular virus yields suggested that release is only slightly impaired. E protein lacking all three cysteines exhibited an increased rate of degradation compared to that of the wild-type protein, suggesting that palmitoylation is important for the stability of the protein. Altogether, the results indicate that the conserved cysteines and presumably palmitoylation are functionally important for virus production.","output":"Importance of conserved cysteine residues in the coronavirus envelope protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study introduces a novel time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) based extended joint connectedness approach in order to characterize connectedness of 11 agricultural commodity and Crude Oil futures prices spanning from July 1, 2005 to May 1, 2020. Our results reveal that the system-wide dynamic connectedness is heterogeneous over time and driven by economic events.

Further findings show that commodities such as Crude Oil, Grains, Livestock, Sugar, and Soybean Oil tend to be the main net transmitters of shocks while Corn, Lean Hogs, Soybeans, Cattle, and Wheat are the main receivers of shocks. Pairwise connectedness on the other hand shows that Crude Oil not only affects other commodity markets, but is also equally responsive to innovations that take place in most of these markets explaining the high interconnectedness of the network. Finally, we illustrate the importance of the chosen normalization technique employed in the connectedness framework as the retrieved findings have important implications for investors to design strategies for optimization of portfolio and asset allocation, reduction in downside risk along with hedging strategies.

The state of transport and transport infrastructure is a factor sign that affects many sectors of the national economy. The problems that have affected many areas of the economy have not spared the transport industry. The positive growth trends that the industry has shown in recent years (2018-2019) have been replaced by volatile and negative trends, as the industry has been one of the most affected by numerous restrictions on work in the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 and 2021). The article presents some statistical indicators characterizing transport activities and transport infrastructure. The article also presents an analysis of digital transformation (DT) in a number of areas of the economy, including transport, transport and road infrastructure, taking into account current trends in public administration. The relevance of DT is confirmed by profound changes taking place in all sectors of the economy and society, as a result of the introduction and integration of digital technologies into all aspects of human life. Digital technologies have an increasing impact on the way of life, work, communication and social interaction of an increasing part of the population, which cannot affect the methods of public administration in the economy, including transport. DT is expected to become a strategic vector of economic development over the coming years, and there is a significant need to be able to identify and address current and future problems for the economy and society. Due to the very wide range of interrelated areas that need to be considered when analyzing DT, an interdisciplinary approach was adopted to prepare this article, taking into account trends in areas related to transport, and it concludes with further directions for transport policy and research prospects.

However, with time it has behaved as a virus with the potential to cause multi-system involvement, including neurological manifestations. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) has increasingly been reported in association with coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we have shed light upon CVT and its possible mechanisms in the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this review, data were collected from PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science, until March 30, 2021, using pre-specified searching strategies. The search strategy consisted of a variation of keywords of relevant medical subject headings and keywords, including COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. RESULTS: COVID-19 has a causal association with a plethora of neurological, neuropsychiatric and psychological effects. CVT has gained particular importance in this regard. The known hypercoagulable state in SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to be the main mechanism in COVID-19 related CVT. Other plausible mechanisms may include vascular endothelial dysfunction and altered flow dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are no specific clinical characteristics, insidious or acute onset headache, seizures, stroke-like, or encephalopathy symptoms in a patient with, or who has suffered COVID-19, should prompt the attending physician to investigate for CVT. The treatment of COVID-19 associated CVT does not differ radically from the therapy of CVT without the infection, i.e. urgent initiation of parenteral unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed by conventional or mostly newer oral anticoagulants.","output":"Cerebral venous thrombosis in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have developed periscope, a tool for the detection and quantification of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data. The translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome for most open reading frames (ORFs) occurs via RNA intermediates termed subgenomic RNAs. sgRNAs are produced through discontinuous transcription, which relies on homology between transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-B) upstream of the ORF start codons and that of the TRS-L, which is located in the 5 UTR. TRS-L is immediately preceded by a leader sequence. This leader sequence is therefore found at the 5 end of all sgRNA. We applied periscope to 1155 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Sheffield, United Kingdom, and validated our findings using orthogonal data sets and in vitro cell systems. By using a simple local alignment to detect reads that contain the leader sequence, we were able to identify and quantify reads arising from canonical and noncanonical sgRNA. We were able to detect all canonical sgRNAs at the expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10. A number of recurrent noncanonical sgRNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sgRNA analysis. In VeroE6 ACE2+/? cell lines, periscope can detect the changes in the kinetics of sgRNA in orthogonal sequencing data sets. Finally, variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sgRNAs with high fidelity in most cases. This tool can be applied to all sequenced COVID-19 samples worldwide to provide comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA.","output":"Subgenomic RNA identification in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidence has revealed that exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in human diseases. However, role of exosomal miR-125b-5p in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) remains further explored. We focused on the effect of exosomal miR-125b-5p on ALI progression via targeting topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A). METHODS: The ALI mouse models were established by cecal ligation and perforation, which were then treated with miR-125b-5p agomir or overexpressed TOP2A. Next, the pathological structure of ALI mouse lung tissues were observed, miR-125b-5p, TOP2A and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was determined, and the lung water content, inflammatory response, protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and cell apoptosis in ALI mouse lung tissues were assessed. Exosomes were extracted from endothelial cells (ECs) and identified, which were then injected into the modeled mice to observe their roles in ALI. The targeting relationship between miR-125b-5p and TOP2A was confirmed. RESULTS: MiR-125b-5p was downregulated while TOP2A was upregulated in ALI mice. MiR-125b-5p elevation or ECs-derived exosomes promoted VEGF expression, improved pathological changes and restrained lung water content, inflammatory response, protein content in BALF and cell apoptosis in lung tissues ALI mice. TOP2A overexpression reversed the repressive role of miR-125b-5p upregulation in ALI, while downregulated miR-125b-5p abrogated the effect of ECs-derived exosomes on ALI. TOP2A was confirmed as a direct target gene of miR-125b-5p. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that ECs-derived exosomes overexpressed miR-125b-5p to protect from sepsis-induced ALI by inhibiting TOP2A, which may contribute to ALI therapeutic strategies.","output":"Upregulation of endothelial cell-derived exosomal microRNA-125b-5p protects from sepsis-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting topoisomerase II alpha"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the frequency, nature, and clinical significance of pharmacist interventions on over-the-counter (OTC) medicines with abuse potential across community pharmacies with and without virtual care. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, a trained research team observed the dispensary teams of 12 community pharmacies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 6 of which were operating virtual pharmacy care. A standardized data collection form was used to include information about dispensing of OTC medicines and pharmacist interventions on those with abuse/misuse potential. The clinical significance of the interventions was evaluated by a multidisciplinary committee. RESULTS: The frequency of pharmacist interventions on OTC medicines with abuse potential across pharmacies with and without virtual services was 83.2% versus 91.0%, respectively, whereas the frequency of pharmacist interventions on OTC medicines with misuse potential across pharmacies with and without virtual services was 79.8% versus 41.2%, respectively. The proportions of clinically significant interventions across pharmacies with and without virtual services were 19.7% versus 10.5%, respectively. Cough medicines were dispensed significantly more across pharmacies with virtual care than across pharmacies without virtual care (25.6% vs. 9.7%, respectively; P = 0.04). Asking the patient to seek the advice of an addiction specialist (adjusted odds ratio = 4.11; P = 0.001) versus refusing to sell the drug was more likely to be associated with pharmacies with virtual services than with pharmacies operating traditional pharmacy services. CONCLUSION: Virtual pharmaceutical care is a potential approach to reduce the abuse/misuse of OTC medicines but needs some improvements regarding detection of these cases.

The unique backdrop amidst a pandemic and promotion of nonpharmaceutical interventions generated some distinct changes in the epidemiology of common respiratory pathogens. In this study, we aimed to investigate the dynamic changes in respiratory pathogens in children during 2020. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary hospital in southern Taiwan during 2020. Patients aged 0-18 years who visited the pediatric emergency department were enrolled. Children who presented with clinical symptoms (fever or respiratory illness) and received nasopharyngeal swabs for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were included in our analysis. We also compared respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) trends from previous years by PCR and lateral flow immunochromatographic assays from 2017 to 2020. RESULTS: A total of 120 children were tested. The overall detection rate was 55%. With strengthened restrictions, the detection rate dropped from 70% to 30%. However, non-enveloped viruses (rhinovirus/enterovirus and adenovirus) were in constant circulation. Upon easing prevention measures, the detection rate remained above 60%, and an outbreak of an enveloped virus (RSV and parainfluenza virus) was noted. Compared with 2017-2019, the cyclical RSV epidemic was delayed, with a large surge in late 2020.

As the market for voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri) grows and people increasingly use them to assist their daily tasks, there is a pressing need to explore how voice assistant (VA) technology may be used in behavioral health interventions. A scoping review of literature was conducted to address a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question: across populations, how does the use of voice assistants in behavioral health research/interventions influence healthy lifestyle behaviors versus control or comparison interventions? To inform the science, a secondary aim of this review was to explore characteristics of VAs used in behavioral health research. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines with scoping review extension (PRISMA-ScR). Ten studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing research published through February 2019. Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms.

This study was aimed to investigate the regulative role of microRNA (miR-429) in myocardial injury of rats with CHD. Expression of miR-429 in CHD patients and healthy people was detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The CHD rat models were injected with normal saline, mimics negative control (NC), miR-429 mimics, inhibitors NC and miR-429 inhibitors twice a week, for 4 weeks. Levels of inflammatory factors, oxidative stress indices as well as apoptosis of cardiomyocytes were determined by a series of assays. Expression of miR-429 was up-regulated in CHD patients. Reduced miR-429 could decline the expression of oxidative stress-related factors and inflammation-related factors, and inhibit the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in rats with CHD. Moreover, the down-regulation of miR-429 could promote the expression of CrkL and repress activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. This study reveals that restrained miR-429 could exert a protective impact on myocardial injury of rats with CHD by suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation reaction and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.

Racial trauma occurs as a result of an event of racism or cumulative events over time whereby an individual experiences stress and consequent mental health sequelae. Given that the BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and/or Person of Colour) population in Canada is increasing, it is imperative to identify racial discrimination and the subsequent stress and trauma associated with being racialized in Canada, which subjects BIPOC Canadians to various forms of racism, including microaggressions. RECENT FINDINGS: This paper reviews the published literature on racism and racial discrimination that identifies or infers racial trauma as the source of the mental health implications for various groups (e.g., Indigenous people, Black Canadians, Asian Canadians, immigrants, and refugees). In addition, intersectionality of racialized persons is prominent to their psychological well-being as their psychosocial and socioeconomic position are complex. Therefore, this paper both provides insight into the Canadian experience as a person of colour and signifies the need for further research on racial trauma in a Canadian context. SUMMARY: Despite Canadas emphasis on multiculturalism, racialized individuals are at risk for racial trauma due to prejudice and discrimination. The politicization of multiculturalism has permitted Canada to deny claims of racism, yet the historical basis of established institutions results in irrefutable systemic and systematic barriers for Canadian people of colour.","output":"The Traumatizing Impact of Racism in Canadians of Colour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Favipiravir is an antiviral agent showing activity for the treatment of various life threatening viruses such as Ebola virus, Lassa virus and also recent virus for COVID-19.

Attempts to use reverse vaccinology to generate an HIV-1 vaccine on the basis of the structure of viral epitopes bound to monoclonal neutralizing antibodies have failed so far because it was not possible to extrapolate from an observed antigenic structure to the immunogenic structure required in a vaccine. Vaccine immunogenicity depends on numerous extrinsic factors such as the host immunoglobulin gene repertoire, the presence of various cellular and regulatory mechanisms in the immunized host and the process of antibody affinity maturation. All these factors played a role in the appearance of the neutralizing antibody used to select the epitope to be investigated as potential vaccine immunogen, but they cannot be expected to be present in identical form in the host to be vaccinated. It is possible to rationally design and optimize an epitope to fit one particular antibody molecule or to improve the paratope binding efficacy of a monoclonal antibody intended for passive immunotherapy. What is not possible is to rationally design an HIV-1 vaccine immunogen that will elicit a protective polyclonal antibody response of predetermined efficacy. An effective vaccine immunogen can only be discovered by investigating experimentally the immunogenicity of a candidate molecule and demonstrating its ability to induce a protective immune response. It cannot be discovered by determining which epitopes of an engineered antigen molecule are recognized by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody.

METHODS A prospective, randomized, single blind clinical trial of an oral supplement containing bLF (daily dose approximately 70 to 85 mg) was carried out with healthy children in a day care center from March 2002 to June 2003. The incidence of enterovirus or rotavirus infection and the serum level of interferon- gamma (IFN-) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were compared between children receiving and not receiving bLF. RESULTS A total of 172 children, 96 in group A, which received bLF, and 76 in group B which did not receive bLF, completed the trial. During the study period, no EV71 was isolated and seroconversion of EV71 antibodies was noted in only one child. Fourteen episodes of presumptive enterovirus infection and 12 episodes of presumptive viral enteritis were detected. No significant differences were observed between groups in the incidence of presumptive enterovirus infection or viral enteritis or the number of laboratory confirmed enterovirus or rotavirus infections. No significant differences were observed in the serum levels of IFN- and IL-10 between groups either prior to or following the trial. In both groups, IFN- levels increased, but IL-10 was unchanged following the trial.

While COVID-19 mobile-health (mHealth) applications have emerged, research examining attitudes towards COVID-19 mHealth use among those with chronic conditions is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To examine attitudes and identify determinants of COVID-19 mHealth use across demographic and health-related characteristics; and evaluate associations of having chronic health conditions with attitudes towards COVID-19 mHealth use (e.g. use of mHealth or web-based methods to track COVID-19 exposures, symptoms, and recommendations). METHODS: We utilized nationally-representative data from the COVID-19 Impact Survey collected from April-June 2020 (n=10,760). Primary exposure was a history of chronic conditions which was defined using self-reported diagnoses of cardiometabolic, respiratory, immune-related, mental health conditions, and overweight/obesity. Primary outcomes were attitudes of COVID-19 mHealth including (1) likelihood of using a mobile-phone app to track COVID-19 symptoms and receive recommendations, (2) likelihood of using a website to track COVID-19 symptoms, location, and receive recommendations, and (3) likelihood of using an app using location to track potential COVID-19 exposure. COVID-19 mHealth use outcome response options were extremely/very likely, moderately likely, or not too likely/not likely at all. Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare likelihood of COVID-19 mHealth use across chronic health conditions, with not too likely/not likely at all as the reference category for each outcome. We evaluated determinants of each form of COVID-19 mHealth intervention using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among the 10,760 respondents, about half were aged 30-59 years, female, had a household income <$50,000, and had employer-sponsored insurance. Overall, 22% were extremely/very likely to use a mobile-phone app or a website to track their COVID-19 symptoms and receive recommendations. Almost one-quarter were extremely/very likely to use a mobile-phone app to track their location and receive push notifications if they have been exposed to COVID-19. After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and residence, adults living with mental health conditions were most likely to report being either extremely/very or moderately likely to use each mHealth intervention when compared to those who were not likely. Adults with respiratory-related chronic diseases were extremely/very (cOR:1.16, 95% CI:1.00-1.35) and moderately likely (cOR:1.23, 95% CI:1.04-1.45) to use a mobile-phone app to track their location and send push notifications if they might have been exposed to COVID-19. Across each mHealth intervention, positive determinants of extremely/very likely use included being female, racial/ethnic minority, and having at least one recent COVID-19 related symptom. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that attitudes towards COVID-19 mHealth use vary widely by modality (web-based vs. app) and across chronic health conditions.

Agent-based Social Simulation (ABSS) is argued to be particularly useful as it can capture the behavior of and interactions between individuals. We performed a systematic literature reviewand identified 126 articles that describe ABSS of Covid-19 transmission processes.

This also includes how thoroughly the models consider and represent the real world, e.g. in terms of factors that affect the transmission probability or how humans make decisions. Shortcomingswere also identified in the transparency of the presented models, e.g. in terms of documentation or availability, as well as in their validation, which might limit their suitability for supporting decision-making processes.

Therefore, inhibiting this enzyme may be helpful in the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, it is aimed to investigate eight natural compounds which have recently entered the literature, computationally for their potential use against SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, first, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on the investigated compounds, and energy minimizations, geometry optimizations, vibrational analyses, molecular electrostatic potential map calculations were carried out. After DFT calculations, geometry optimized structures were subjected to molecular docking calculations with the use of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (pdb id: 5r80) and top-scoring ligand-receptor complexes were obtained. In the next part of the study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the top-scoring ligand-receptor complexes to investigate the stability of the ligand-receptor complexes and the interactions between ligands and receptor in more detail. Additionally, in this part of the study, binding free energies are calculated with the use of molecular mechanics with Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method. Results showed that, all ligand-receptor complexes remain stable during the MD simulations and most of the investigated compounds but especially two of them showed considerably high binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 main protease.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the recommendation of awake prone positioning is associated with improved outcomes among patients with COVID-19Crelated hypoxemia who have not received mechanical ventilation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pragmatic nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted at 2 academic medical centers (Vanderbilt University Medical Center and NorthShore University HealthSystem) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 501 adult patients with COVID-19Cassociated hypoxemia who had not received mechanical ventilation were enrolled from May 13 to December 11, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive either the practitioner-recommended awake prone positioning intervention (intervention group) or usual care (usual care group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome analyses were performed using a bayesian proportional odds model with covariate adjustment for clinical severity ranking based on the World Health Organization ordinal outcome scale, which was modified to highlight the worst level of hypoxemia on study day 5. RESULTS: A total of 501 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.0 [15.3] years; 284 [56.7%] were male; and most [417 (83.2%)] were self-reported non-Hispanic or non-Latinx) were included. Baseline severity was comparable between the intervention vs usual care groups, with 170 patients (65.9%) vs 162 patients (66.7%) receiving oxygen via standard low-flow nasal cannula, 71 patients (27.5%) vs 62 patients (25.5%) receiving oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, and 16 patients (6.2%) vs 19 patients (7.8%) receiving noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Nursing observations estimated that patients in the intervention group spent a median of 4.2 hours (IQR, 1.8-6.7 hours) in the prone position per day compared with 0 hours (IQR, 0-0.7 hours) per day in the usual care group. On study day 5, the bayesian posterior probability of the intervention group having worse outcomes than the usual care group on the modified World Health Organization ordinal outcome scale was 0.998 (posterior median adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.63; 95% credibility interval [CrI], 1.16-2.31). However, on study days 14 and 28, the posterior probabilities of harm were 0.874 (aOR, 1.29; 95% CrI, 0.84-1.99) and 0.673 (aOR, 1.12; 95% CrI, 0.67-1.86), respectively. Exploratory outcomes (progression to mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and 28-day mortality) did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this nonrandomized controlled trial, prone positioning offered no observed clinical benefit among patients with COVID-19Cassociated hypoxemia who had not received mechanical ventilation. Moreover, there was substantial evidence of worsened clinical outcomes at study day 5 among patients recommended to receive the awake prone positioning intervention, suggesting potential harm.

METHODS: We investigated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in seropositive and seronegative health care workers attending testing of asymptomatic and symptomatic staff at Oxford University Hospitals in the United Kingdom. Baseline antibody status was determined by anti-spike (primary analysis) and anti-nucleocapsid IgG assays, and staff members were followed for up to 31 weeks. We estimated the relative incidence of PCR-positive test results and new symptomatic infection according to antibody status, adjusting for age, participant-reported gender, and changes in incidence over time. RESULTS: A total of 12,541 health care workers participated and had anti-spike IgG measured; 11,364 were followed up after negative antibody results and 1265 after positive results, including 88 in whom seroconversion occurred during follow-up. A total of 223 anti-spikeCseronegative health care workers had a positive PCR test (1.09 per 10,000 days at risk), 100 during screening while they were asymptomatic and 123 while symptomatic, whereas 2 anti-spikeCseropositive health care workers had a positive PCR test (0.13 per 10,000 days at risk), and both workers were asymptomatic when tested (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.44; P=0.002). There were no symptomatic infections in workers with anti-spike antibodies. Rate ratios were similar when the anti-nucleocapsid IgG assay was used alone or in combination with the anti-spike IgG assay to determine baseline status.

The resulting conjugate, NOTA-PEG2-[d-Phe(6),Sta(13),Leu(14)]bombesin[6-14] (NOTA-P2-RM26), was labeled with (68)Ga (T1/2 = 68 min, positron emitter) and (111)In (T1/2 = 2.8 days, gamma emitter). The labeling stability, specificity, inhibition efficiency (IC50), and dissociation constant (KD) of both labeled compounds as well as their cellular retention and internalization were investigated. The pharmacokinetics of the dual isotope ((111)In/(68)Ga)-labeled peptide in both normal NMRI mice and PC-3 tumor-bearing Balb/c nu/nu mice was also studied. NOTA-P2-RM26 was labeled with (111)In and (68)Ga at a radiochemical yield of >98%. Both conjugates were shown to have high specificity and binding affinity for GRPR. The KD value was determined to be 23  13 pM for the (111)In-labeled compound in a saturation binding experiment. In addition, (nat)In- and (nat)Ga-NOTA-P2-RM26 showed low nanomolar binding inhibition concentrations (IC50 = 1.24  0.29 nM and 0.91  0.19 nM, respectively) in a competitive binding assay. The internalization rate of the radiolabeled conjugates was slow. The radiometal-labeled tracers demonstrated rapid blood clearance via the kidney and GRPR-specific uptake in the pancreas in normal mice. Tumor targeting and biodistribution studies in mice bearing PC-3 xenografts displayed high and specific uptake in tumors (8.1  0.4%ID/g for (68)Ga and 5.7  0.3%ID/g for (111)In) and high tumor-to-background ratios (tumor/blood: 12  1 for (68)Ga and 10  1 for (111)In) after only 1 h p.i. of 45 pmol of peptide.

Treatment consisted of a single cycle of cisplatin 30 mg/m2 days 1C3, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 day 1, durvalumab 1500 mg fix dose day 5 and tremelimumab 75 mg fix dose day 5. Patients with increased intratumoral CD8 +immune cell density or pathological complete response (pCR) in the rebiopsy entered RIT up to a total dose of 70 Gy. Patients received further three cycles of durvalumab/tremelimumab followed by eight cycles of durvalumab mono (every 4 weeks). The intended treatment for patients not meeting these criteria was standard radiochemotherapy outside the trial. Primary endpoint was a feasibility rate of patients entering RIT to receive treatment until at least cycle 6 of immunotherapy of 80%. RESULTS: Between September 2018 and May 2020, 80 patients were enrolled (one excluded). Out of these, 23 patients had human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer.

individuals with cancer has been profound. It has led to increased anxiety, distress and deconditioning due to reduced physical activity. We aim to investigate whether SafeFit, a multimodal intervention of physical activity, nutrition and psychological support delivered virtually by cancer exercise specialists (CES), can improve physical and emotional functionings during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A phase III non-randomised intervention trial, target recruitment of 1050 adults with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of cancer. All recruited participants will receive the multimodal intervention delivered by CES for 6 months. Sessions will be delivered 1-to-1 using telephone/video conferencing consultations. CES will work with each participant to devise a personalised programme of (1) physical activity, (2) basic dietary advice and (3) psychological support, all underpinned by behaviour change support. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Physical and emotional functioning as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30). Secondary outcomes: overall quality of life measured by EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L, health economics, patient activation, self-efficacy to self-manage chronic disease, distress, impact of COVID-19 on emotional functioning, self-reported physical activity, functional capacity and nutrition. Adherence to the intervention will also be measured and a process evaluation conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Research Authority (reference number 20/NW/0254). Results of this trial will be disseminated through publication of peer-reviewed articles, presentations at scientific conferences, and to the public and people with cancer in collaboration with our patient and public involvement representatives and partners.

METHODS: The virus was inoculated on plastic surface and harvested at predefined time-points in parallel at 20-25C (RT) and at 28C (JT). Samples collections were tested by TCID(50) titers on Vero cells. Samples collections were tested by TCID(50) titers on Vero cells. RESULTS: Our results confirm that fomite transmission of the emerging SARS-CoV2 is possible: the virus reserved its ability to infect cells up to 84 hours at both RT and JT on plastic surface, with a TCID(50) viral titre of 0,67 and 0,25 log10 respectively. At RT, an important reduction in the viral titre, from 4 log10 to 3 log10 TCID(50) was observed during the first 24-36 hours. At JT the same decay was observed more rapidly (between 8 and 12 hours), The rate of viral inactivation by D-value was 24.74 at RT and 12,21 hours at JT. CONCLUSIONS: This remarkable difference between the two temperatures suggests that virus vitality can be influenced by the environmental temperature and that the hot season could reduce the probability of COVID-19 transmission.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection: the environmental endurance of the virus can be influenced by the increase of temperature()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Lombardy region suffered severely during the acute phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in Italy (Mar-Apr 2020) with 16,000 diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019-related deaths (49% of the total coronavirus disease 2019-related deaths in Italy). In the area surrounding Pavia during the critical stage of the outbreak (Mar-Apr 2020), 1,225 of the documented 4,200 deaths were related to coronavirus disease 2019 infection, with a mortality rate of 181/100,000 inhabitants and an increase in deaths of 138% compared with the same period during previous years. Our aim was to report the experience of the Department of Vascular Surgery of Pavia (Lombardy, Italy), including the lessons learned and future perspectives regarding the management of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who developed severe acute ischemia with impending lower limb loss or deep vein thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective data collection of coronavirus disease 2019 patients with severe acute ischemia of the lower limbs or deep vein thrombosis, which we observed in our department during the period March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. Primary outcomes of the analysis were postoperative mortality for all patients and amputation rates only in those coronavirus disease 2019 patients suffering from acute lower limb ischemia. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of the disease among admitted coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and any possible correlation among inflammatory parameters, thrombolytic status, and the presence of acute ischemia or deep vein thrombosis. RESULTS: We observed 38 patients (28 male) with severe coronavirus disease 2019 infection (6 with lower limb arterial thrombosis and 32 with deep vein thrombosis). The median patient age was 64 years (range 30-94 y). In the arterial group, 3 had thrombosis on plaque and 3 on healthy arteries (\\"simple\\" arterial thrombosis). All underwent operative or hybrid (open/endo) revascularization; 1 patient died from major organ failure and 1 patient underwent major amputation. In the deep vein thrombosis group, 9 (28%) patients died from major organ failure, despite aggressive medical therapy. In patients with simple arterial thrombosis and those with deep vein thrombosis, we observed a decrease in inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein) and in D-dimer and fibrinogen after aggressive therapy (P <.001). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that critically ill, coronavirus disease 2019 patients who develop arterial and deep vein thrombosis have a high risk of mortality, but, if treated properly, there is an improvement in overall survival, especially in patients of 60 years of age or younger.","output":"Acute arterial and deep venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients: Risk factors and personalized therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Number of well-known contagious diseases exist around the world that mainly include HIV, Hepatitis B, influenzas etc., among these, a recently contested coronavirus (COVID-19) is a serious class of such transmissible syndromes.

Vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) at 1 and 3 months after RFA were compared with the baseline (i.e., values before RFA). To evaluate the factors that influenced impaired pulmonary function, univariate analysis was performed by using multiple variables. If two or more variables were indicated as statistically significant by univariate analysis, these variables were subjected to multivariate analysis to identify independent factors. RESULTS The mean VC and FEV(1) before RFA and 1 and 3 months after RFA were 3.04 and 2.24 l, 2.79 and 2.11 l, and 2.85 and 2.13 l, respectively.

PPI ratio was calculated at every time point as: PPI value/ baseline PPI. The primary outcome was the accuracy of PPI ratio at the end of the SBT in detecting failed weaning. Forty-three patients were available for the final analysis. Eighteen patients (42%) were considered failed weaning. PPI ratio was higher in patients with successful weaning compared to patients with failed weaning during the last 15 min of the SBT.

In our system, the facile production of 1225 nm excitation pulses is achieved by the stimulated Raman scattering of a 1064 nm source propagating through an optical fiber. PARS-based detection is achieved by monitoring the change in the scattering profile of a co-aligned 1550 nm continuous-wave interrogation beam in response to absorption of the 1225 nm light by lipids. Our non-contact, reflection-mode approach can achieve a FWHM resolution of up to 0.96 m and signal-to-noise ratios as high as 45 dB from carbon fibers and 9.7 dB from a lipid phantom.

The aim was to assess the importance of the choice of the most adequate calculation modality, providing recommendations about the choice of the computation tool. METHODS The performances were evaluated both on phantoms and patients in a multi-level approach. Different phantoms filled with a 177Lu-radioactive solution were used: a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, a phantom with organ-shaped inserts and two cylindrical phantoms with inserts different for shape and volume. A total of 70 patients with NETs treated by PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATOC were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS The comparisons were performed mainly between the mean values of the absorbed dose in the regions of interest. A general better agreement was obtained between Dose kernel convolution and Monte Carlo simulations results rather than between either of these two and organ-level dosimetry, both for phantoms and patients. Phantoms measurements also showed the discrepancies mainly depend on the geometry of the inserts (e.g. shape and volume). For patients, differences were more pronounced than phantoms and higher inter/intra patient variability was observed. CONCLUSION This study suggests that voxel-level techniques for dosimetry calculation are potentially more accurate and personalized than organ-level methods. In particular, a voxel-convolution method provides good results in a short time of calculation, while Monte Carlo based computation should be conducted with very fast calculation systems for a possible use in clinics, despite its intrinsic higher accuracy. Attention to the calculation modality is recommended in case of clinical regions of interest with irregular shape and far from spherical geometry, in which Monte Carlo seems to be more accurate than voxel-convolution methods.","output":"Comparison of different calculation techniques for absorbed dose assessment in patient specific peptide receptor radionuclide therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine the evidence that the dietary quality of children changed between the period preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and the first year during the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: A systematic review of the evidence for dietary changes occurring as a result of the pandemic-related restrictions, in Part I of this article, yielded 38 original research articles. These articles had conflicting results, some describing improvements in overall quality and some describing deteriorations. As a whole the studies were characterized by a low study quality, and children were poorly represented. Taken together, these studies do not provide enough evidence to draw conclusions about whether dietary habits changed or not as a result of the pandemic. However, in a wider, narrative review of the psychosocial changes occurring as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the known associations of these factors with a dietary intake in Part II, we conclude that there is a reason to expect that the dietary quality of children might have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. One the one hand, the literature fails to provide conclusive evidence on changes in the dietary quality of children resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the broader literature supports the hypothesis that children's dietary quality will have declined during the pandemic. Taken together, we urgently need more high-quality research on children's changes in dietary intake occurring over the pandemic. This will provide important information on whether any potential long-term consequences of such changes, if they exist, need to be examined and ameliorated.","output":"Challenges in Feeding Children Posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Systematic Review of Changes in Dietary Intake Combined with a Dietitian's Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetically programmed biosensors have been widely used to monitor bioavailable heavy metal pollutions in terms of their toxicity to living organisms. Most bacterial biosensors were initially designed to detect specific heavy metals such as mercury and cadmium. However, most available biosensors failed to distinguish cadmium from various heavy metals, especially mercury. Integrating diverse sensing elements into a single genetic construct or a single host strain has been demonstrated to quantify several heavy metals simultaneously. In this study, a dual-sensing construct was assembled by employing mercury-responsive regulator (MerR) and cadmium-responsive regulator (CadR) as the separate sensory elements and enhanced fluorescent protein (eGFP) and mCherry red fluorescent protein (mCherry) as the separate reporters. Compared with two corresponding single-sensing bacterial sensors, the dual-sensing bacterial sensor emitted differential double-color fluorescence upon exposure to 0-40 M toxic Hg(II) and red fluorescence upon exposure to toxic Cd(II) below 200 M. Bioavailable Hg(II) could be quantitatively determined using double-color fluorescence within a narrow concentration range (0-5 M). But bioavailable Cd(II) could be quantitatively measured using red fluorescence over a wide concentration range (0-200 M). The dual-sensing biosensor was applied to detect bioavailable Hg(II) and Cd(II) simultaneously. Significant higher red fluorescence reflected the predominant pollution of Cd(II), and significant higher green fluorescence suggested the predominant pollution of Hg(II). Our findings show that the synergistic application of various sensory modules contributes to an efficient biological device that responds to concurrent heavy metal pollutants in the environment.","output":"Differential Detection of Bioavailable Mercury and Cadmium Based on a Robust Dual-Sensing Bacterial Biosensor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The unexpected COVID-19 crisis has disrupted medical education and patient care in unprecedented ways. Despite the challenges, the health-care system and patients have been both creative and resilient in finding robust \\"temporary\\" solutions to these challenges. It is not clear if some of these COVID-era transitional steps will be preserved in the future of medical education and telemedicine. OBJECTIVES The goal of this commentary is to address the sometimes substantial changes in medical education, continuing medical education (CME) activities, residency and fellowship programs, specialty society meetings, and telemedicine, and to consider the value of some of these profound shifts to \\"business as usual\\" in the health-care sector. METHODS This is a commentary is based on the limited available literature, online information, and the front-line experiences of the authors. RESULTS COVID-19 has clearly changed residency and fellowship programs by limiting the amount of hands-on time physicians could spend with patients. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medicine Education has endorsed certain policy changes to promote greater flexibility in programs but still rigorously upholds specific standards. Technological interventions such as telemedicine visits with patients, virtual meetings with colleagues, and online interviews have been introduced, and many trainees are \\"techno-omnivores\\" who are comfortable using a variety of technology platforms and techniques. Webinars and e-learning are gaining traction now, and their use, practicality, and cost-effectiveness may make them important in the post-COVID era. CME activities have migrated increasingly to virtual events and online programs, a trend that may also continue due to its practicality and cost-effectiveness. While many medical meetings of specialty societies have been postponed or cancelled altogether, technology allows for virtual meetings that may offer versatility and time-saving opportunities for busy clinicians. It may be that future medical meetings embrace a hybrid approach of blending digital with face-to-face experience. Telemedicine was already in place prior to the COVID-19 crisis but barriers are rapidly coming down to its widespread use and patients seem to embrace this, even as health-care systems navigate the complicated issues of cybersecurity and patient privacy. Regulatory guidance may be needed to develop safe, secure, and patient-friendly telehealth applications. Telemedicine has affected the prescribing of controlled substances in which online counseling, informed consent, and follow-up must be done in a virtual setting. For example, pill counts can be done in a video call and patients can still get questions answered about their pain therapy, although it is likely that after the crisis, prescribing controlled substances may revert to face-to-face visits. LIMITATIONS The health-care system finds itself in a very fluid situation at the time this was written and changes are still occurring and being assessed. CONCLUSIONS Many of the technological changes imposed so abruptly on the health-care system by the COVID-19 pandemic may be positive and it may be beneficial that some of these transitions be preserved or modified as we move forward. Clinicians must be objective in assessing these changes and retaining those changes that clearly improve health-care education and patient care as we enter the COVID era.","output":"The Technological Impact of COVID-19 on the Future of Education and Health Care Delivery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Despite new improvements on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), brain damage is very often after resuscitation. OBJECTIVE To assess the prognostic value of cerebral oxygen saturation measurement (rSO2) for assessing prognosis on patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. DESIGN Retrospective analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS We analyzed 25 post-CPR patients (12 female and 13 male). All the patients were cooled to a target temperature of 33-34C. The Glascow Coma Scale (GCS), Corneal Reflexes (CR), Pupillary Reflexes (PR), arterial Base Excess (BE) and rSO2 measurements were taken on admission. The rewarming GCS, CR, PR, BE and rSO2 measurements were made after the patient's temperature reached 36C. RESULTS In survivors, the baseline rSO2 value was 67.5 (46-70) and the percent difference between baseline and rewarming rSO2 value was 0.03 (0.014-0.435). In non-survivors, the baseline rSO2 value was 30 (25-65) and the percent difference between baseline and rewarming rSO2 value was 0.031 (-0.08 to -20). No statistical difference was detected on percent changes between baseline and rewarming values of rSO2. Statistically significant difference was detected between baseline and rewarming GCS groups (p=0.004). No statistical difference was detected between GCS, CR, PR, BE and rSO2 to determine the prognosis. CONCLUSION Despite higher values of rSO2 on survivors than non-survivors, we found no statistically considerable difference between groups on baseline and the rewarming rSO2 values. Since the measurement is simple, and not affected by hypotension and hypothermia, the rSO2 may be a useful predictor for determining the prognosis after CPR.","output":"[The prognostic value of cerebral oxygen saturation measurement for assessing prognosis after cardiopulmonary resuscitation]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the widespread of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, the educational authorities issued firm directions to convert to virtual classes exploiting the available Learning Management System (LMS). However, during the academic year 2020-2021, the researchers observed that writing EFL instructors at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University (PSAU), Saudi Arabia, faced diverse challenges due to having online mixed-ability classes, i.e. those classes where students have varying levels of readiness, motivation, and academic caliper. Though many previous studies explored the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on teaching and learning practices, very few studies addressed the way technological affordances pose challenges for instructors teaching mixed-ability classes. Therefore, the present study, using mixed quantitative and qualitative research methods, sought to explore challenges that evolved due to the technological affordances of LMS to spot the persistent problems and to offer relevant solutions for upgrading, writing teaching and learning practices. The basic research design relied on an online questionnaire followed by semi-structured interviews. Findings showed that differentiated instruction proved to be the most successful strategy for teaching writing in mixed-ability online classes as it allowed the adaptation of materials, teaching and learning practices, and assessment tools to motivate low-achievers. In addition, the collaborative tools offered by the Blackboard such as the White Board, Discussion Board, Blogs, and Breakout Groups helped to meet the preferences of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners. Finally, further studies are recommended to explore the affordances of educational technologies regularly to identify potential benefits and limitations for offering the best teaching and learning practices.","output":"Technological Affordances and Teaching in EFL Mixed-ability Classes during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes the properties of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator for mixed causal and noncausal models when the error term follows a Student's t-distribution.

We propose that the same concept could be applied to infectious diseases and, especially, to those that hamper the immune system like COVID-19. It is well known that an adaptive immune response is able to eradicate viral infections and CD8+ T-cells are key in such anti-viral response. Furthermore, several studies reported that the number of CD8+ T-cells is reduced in COVID-19 patients since the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection and further decreased in severe cases. CD8+ T-cells often show signs of exhaustion, loss of T-cell functions and suppression in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that hampering CD8+ T-cells could be a way by which SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses. Importantly, the number of CD8+ T cells appears to re-increase in patients that are recovering from COVID-19, suggesting that CD8+ T-cells could be a key factor that determines whether our body can recover from the disease. We propose that therapies that boost CD8+ T cells could be effective in clearing SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19. To test this, we will take advantage of the adenosine-mediated immunomodulation. Adenosine, an ATP metabolite that is produced during inflammation, hypoxia and in the tumor microenvironment, was found to suppress the immune response through activation of adenosine receptors present on immune cells. Small molecules antagonists that block one of these receptors, adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonists, are currently being studied to boost anti-cancer T-cell mediated immune responses. Our data show that treatment with an A2AR antagonist restores and stabilizes Notch1, a key pathway for T-cell functions, along with production of INF-gamma and Granzyme B and proliferation in CD8+ T-cells. As a proof of concept, our data indicates that treatment with an A2AR antagonist increases CD8+ T-cells anti-cancer response in tumor-derived organoids, suggesting that the treatment boosts CD8+ T-cells-mediated immune response. Ongoing work aims to test whether the A2AR antagonist treatment restores several parameters of T-cell function that are specifically modified in COVID-19. This analysis will help to predict the action of the A2AR antagonist on T-cells in vivo and we ultimately aim to test this treatment in a mouse model for COVID-19. Overall, our work could introduce a new paradigm and new therapies for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.","output":"Adenosine-based cancer immunotherapy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Smartphone-based online education gained popularity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Although recent studies have highlighted the association between problematic smartphone use (PSU) and mental health symptoms, the potential role of online learning in this relationship remains unclear. This study aimed to analyze the relationships between higher education modes, PSU, and related psychological symptoms in university students. METHODS: A total of 1,629 Chinese university students from five provinces completed a web-based questionnaire survey between March 2020 and October 2021. Demographic characteristics and learning conditions were recorded. All participants completed the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and Athens Insomnia Scale. Multiple regressions models and stratified analyses were used to examine the association between online education mode, PSU, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. RESULTS: The prevalence of PSU was 58.5%. Students who relied primarily on online learning had a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms (29.95% vs. 22.24%), anxiety symptoms (25.13% vs. 18.91%), and insomnia symptoms (75.89% vs. 70.27%) than those who relied on traditional face-to-face learning (Ps < 0.05). After adjusting for covariates, subjects with PSU were more likely to report depressive symptoms (AdjOR = 3.14, 95% CI = 2.26C4.37), anxiety symptoms (AdjOR = 3.73, 95% CI = 2.13C4.59), and insomnia symptoms (AdjOR = 2.96, 95% CI = 2.23C3.92) than those without PSU. Furthermore, the associations of PSU with depressive symptoms (OR = 4.66 vs. 2.33, P for interaction = 0.015) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 6.05 vs. 2.94, P for interaction = 0.021) were more pronounced in the online learning group. CONCLUSION: Our study provides preliminary evidence that Chinese university students have serious smartphone addiction problems, which are associated with depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms. Online learning is found to exacerbate PSU and mental health problems.

This phylogeny has statistically significant support throughout, including its basal branches. The viruses form eight lineages that are congruent with the taxonomy of the hosts from which each was first isolated and, with the exception of three of the twenty-nine species, all fall into three clusters that have either asterid or rosid or caryophyllid hosts (i.e. the major subdivisions of eudicotyledonous plants). A modified Mantel permutation test showed that the patristic distances of virus and host phylogenies are significantly correlated, especially when the three anomalously placed viruses are removed. When the internal branches of the virus phylogeny were collapsed the congruence decreased. The simplest explanation of this congruence of the virus and host phylogenies is that most tobamovirus lineages have co-diverged with their primary plant hosts for more than 110 million years, and only the brassica-infecting lineage originated from a major host switch from asterids to rosids. Their co-divergence seems to have been fuzzy rather than strict, permitting viruses to switch hosts within major host clades. Our conclusions support those of a coalesence analysis of tobamovirus sequences, that used proxy node dating, but not a similar analysis of nucleotide sequences from dated samples, which concluded that the tobamoviruses originated only 100 thousand years ago.","output":"Tobamoviruses have probably co-diverged with their eudicotyledonous hosts for at least 110 million years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic temporarily suspended medical student involvement in clinical rotations, resulting in the need to develop virtual clinical experiences.

We investigated lung ventilation and perfusion (LVP) by LVP scintigraphy, and, 24 h later, left and right ventricular function by Tc-99m-labeled albumin-gated blood-pool scintigraphy with late (60 mn) tomographic albumin images on the lungs to evaluate lung albumin retention that could indicate microvascular injuries with secondary edema. RESULTS: We included 20 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. All had CT evidence of organizing pneumonia and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. No patient demonstrated preserved ventilation with perfusion defect (mismatch), which may discard a distal lung thrombosis. Patterns of ventilation and perfusion were heterogeneous in seven patients (35%) with healthy lung segments presenting a relative paradoxical hypoperfusion and hypoventilation compared with segments with organizing pneumonia presenting a relative enhancement in perfusion and preserved ventilation. Lung albumin retention in area of organizing pneumonia was observed in 12 patients (60%), indicating microvascular injuries, increase in vessel permeability, and secondary edema. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized non-critically ill patients without evidence of superinfection, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac dysfunction, various types of damage may contribute to clinical deterioration including microvascular injuries and secondary edema, inconsistencies in lung segments vascularization suggesting a dysregulation of the balance in perfusion between segments affected by COVID-19 and others.

Infective episodes may trigger relapses and significantly deteriorate the course of the disease. Some immunotherapies may cause increased rates of infection-related adverse events. Thus, infection and vaccine-related issues should be included in the individualized patient-specific treatment strategy and counseling before starting therapy and regularly on treatment. Clinical and epidemiological studies as well as pharmacovigilance data repeatedly demonstrated the safety of the great majority of vaccines in multiple sclerosis patients. Moreover, studies have shown that vaccinations with killed/inactivated vaccines do not increase the short-term risk of relapse or deterioration in multiple sclerosis, whereas infections have been shown to provoke relapses. The available evidence indicates reduced humoral vaccination efficacy on treatment with MS drugs acting on the S1P receptor, natalizumab, and B-cell depleting therapies. Recent data for cladribine tablets suggest the potential of effective immunization in the interval of the two treatment courses and after completion of therapy. Regardless of treatment, vaccine efficacy may be optimized with proper timing of application. Multiple sclerosis patients receiving highly effective therapies should be vaccinated according to general recommendations for healthy adults. Immunization against COVID-19 is highly recommended for all multiple sclerosis patients regardless of age and comorbidities. Preliminary data show the potential of adequate responses in patients treated with cladribine tablets.","output":"Vaccination in multiple sclerosis patients treated with highly effective disease-modifying drugs: an overview with consideration of cladribine tablets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Postdoctoral researchers face substantial challenges and stresses that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This prospective study aimed to define headache characteristics, associated clinical and laboratory factors, and treatment response in COVID-19. METHODS: Cross-sectional study enrolled 287 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized on a regular ward during the pandemic. All patients were examined face to face and followed by a neurologist during their stay in the hospital. The characteristics, concomitant symptoms, treatment responses, and laboratory findings of COVID-19-associated headaches were recorded. RESULTS: Eighty-three COVID-19 patients reported headache (28.9%), in which 85.5% had no prior headaches. Mean age was 48.40  15.90 and 58% was men. Compared to COVID-19 patients without headache (n = 204), patients with headache showed significantly higher frequency of pulmonary involvement (76%) and increased D-dimer levels. Fifty-nine percent of headaches responded iv paracetamol 1000 mg, and 85% of the paracetamol unresponsive headaches were relieved by greater occipital nerve (GON) blocks. Latent class cluster analysis identified 2 distinct class of bilateral, frontal, throbbing headaches: severe (VAS > 84), longer (> 14 h), frequent (> 7 headache days), paracetamol unresponsive-GON responsive headaches (85%), with pulmonary involvement (100%), and higher IL-6 levels (> 90 pg/mL) were classified in cluster 1. Cluster 2 included moderately affected patients (VAS > 54, > 6 h, > 4 days, 60% pulmonary involvement, > 20 pg/mL IL-6) and paracetamol responsive headaches (96%). VAS scores showed positive linear correlation with IL-6 levels (p < 0.001; r = 0.567). CONCLUSION: The intensity, duration, frequency, bilateral frontal location, and treatment response of COVID-19 headache was related to pulmonary involvement and IL-6 levels, which indicated a role of inflammation in determining the headache manifestations in moderately affected hospitalized patients. ROC curve cutoff values pointed that VAS > 70 severity, > 9 h duration, > 5 headache days, and IL-6 > 43 pg/mL levels can be diagnostic for COVID-19 headache. GON blocks can effectively abort headache when patients are unresponsive to paracetamol, and other NSAIDs are avoided during the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Latent class cluster analysis identified hidden headache phenotypes in COVID-19: impact of pulmonary infiltration and IL-6"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages are an effective public health intervention, but can be difficult to implement in the absence of public support.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 1716 nurses across three university hospitals participated in this study. All had been employed for at least one year. Managers, part-timers, and those in the operating room and the outpatient ward were excluded from the study as it is limited to bedside preventive care. The original tool was translated into Japanese using the Brislin's translation model. A cross-sectional study was used to examine the reliability and validity of the measure within a Japanese sample. Assessment of the multiple-choice test items included analysis of the validity (item difficulty and discriminating index), construct validity, internal consistency, and stability (test-retest reliability). RESULTS The item difficulty indices ranged from 0.17 to 0.95, whereas values for item discrimination ranged from 0.15 to 0.45. Known group validity of the scale was confirmed; therefore, the higher-expertize group consisting of wound, ostomy, and continence nurses significantly outperformed nurses certified in other fields.

The CRIT-Cov-U pilot study generated a urinary proteomic biomarker consisting of 50 peptides (COV50), which predicted death and disease progression. Following the interim analysis demanded by the German government, the full dataset was analysed to consolidate findings and propose clinical applications. MethodsIn eight European countries, 1012 adults with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were followed up for death and progression along the 8-point WHO scale. Capillary electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry was used for urinary proteomic profiling. Statistical methods included logistic regression, receiver operating curve analysis with comparison of the area under curve (AUC) between nested models. Hospitalisation costs were derived from the care facility corresponding with the Markov chain probability of reaching WHO scores ranging from 3 to 8 and flat-rate hospitalistion costs standardised across countries. FindingsThe entry WHO scores were 1-3, 4-5 and 6 in 445 (44{middle dot}0%), 529 (52{middle dot}3%), and 38 (3{middle dot}8%) patients, of whom 119 died and 271 progressed.

The predictive accuracy of optimised COV50 thresholds were 74{middle dot}4% (95% CI, 71{middle dot}6-77{middle dot}1) for mortality (threshold 0{middle dot}47) and 67{middle dot}4% (64{middle dot}1-70{middle dot}3) for disease progression (threshold 0{middle dot}04). On top of covariables and the baseline WHO score, these thresholds improved AUCs from 0{middle dot}835 to 0{middle dot}853 (p=0{middle dot}0331) and from 0{middle dot}697 to 0{middle dot}730 (p=0{middle dot}0008) for death and progression, respectively. Of 196 ambulatory patients, 194 (99{middle dot}0%) did not reach the 0{middle dot}04 threshold.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From March 1, 2007, to February 28, 2010, among a surveillance population of 21,420 persons >5 years old in rural western Kenya, we collected blood for culture and malaria smears, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for quantitative real-time PCR for ten viruses and three atypical bacteria, and urine for pneumococcal antigen testing on outpatients and inpatients meeting a ARI case definition (cough or difficulty breathing or chest pain and temperature >38.0C or oxygen saturation <90% or hospitalization). We also collected swabs from asymptomatic controls, from which we calculated pathogen-attributable fractions, adjusting for age, season, and HIV-status, in logistic regression. We calculated incidence by pathogen, adjusting for health-seeking for ARI and pathogen-attributable fractions. Among 3,406 ARI patients >5 years old (adjusted annual incidence 12.0 per 100 person-years), influenza A virus was the most common virus (22% overall; 11% inpatients, 27% outpatients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria (16% overall; 23% inpatients, 14% outpatients), yielding annual incidences of 2.6 and 1.7 episodes per 100 person-years, respectively. Influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus were more prevalent in swabs among cases (22%, 6%, 8% and 5%, respectively) than controls. Adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parechovirus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were not more prevalent among cases than controls. Pneumococcus and non-typhi Salmonella were more prevalent among HIV-infected adults, but prevalence of viruses was similar among HIV-infected and HIV-negative individuals. ARI incidence was highest during peak malaria season. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNFICANCE: Vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus (by potential herd immunity from childhood vaccination or of HIV-infected adults) might prevent much of the substantial ARI incidence among persons >5 years old in similar rural African settings.","output":"Etiology and Incidence of Viral and Bacterial Acute Respiratory Illness among Older Children and Adults in Rural Western Kenya, 2007C2010"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Arenaviruses are one of the largest families of human hemorrhagic fever viruses and are known to infect both mammals and snakes. Arenaviruses package a large (L) and small (S) genome segment in their virions. For segmented RNA viruses like these, novel genotypes can be generated through mutation, recombination, and reassortment. Although it is believed that an ancient recombination event led to the emergence of a new lineage of mammalian arenaviruses, neither recombination nor reassortment has been definitively documented in natural arenavirus infections. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to survey the viral diversity present in captive arenavirus-infected snakes. From 48 infected animals, we determined the complete or near complete sequence of 210 genome segments that grouped into 23 L and 11 S genotypes. The majority of snakes were multiply infected, with up to 4 distinct S and 11 distinct L segment genotypes in individual animals. This S/L imbalance was typical: in all cases intrahost L segment genotypes outnumbered S genotypes, and a particular S segment genotype dominated in individual animals and at a population level. We corroborated sequencing results by qRT-PCR and virus isolation, and isolates replicated as ensembles in culture. Numerous instances of recombination and reassortment were detected, including recombinant segments with unusual organizations featuring 2 intergenic regions and superfluous content, which were capable of stable replication and transmission despite their atypical structures. Overall, this represents intrahost diversity of an extent and form that goes well beyond what has been observed for arenaviruses or for viruses in general. This diversity can be plausibly attributed to the captive intermingling of sub-clinically infected wild-caught snakes. Thus, beyond providing a unique opportunity to study arenavirus evolution and adaptation, these findings allow the investigation of unintended anthropogenic impacts on viral ecology, diversity, and disease potential.","output":"Widespread Recombination, Reassortment, and Transmission of Unbalanced Compound Viral Genotypes in Natural Arenavirus Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food waste undermines long-term resilience of the global food system by aggravating ecosystem damage. The global community must therefore work to reduce the amount of food that gets wasted. However, we should be mindful of some potential conflicts between food waste reduction and food system resilience. Over-production and over-supply are a contributing cause of waste, yet they also provide resilience in the form of redundancy. In this paper, we examine individual interventions designed to minimise food waste by scoring their impact on different aspects of resilience. We find that there are strong synergistic elements and interventions that support short- and long-term resilience, such as improved storage, which reduces the need to provide a constant flow of surplus food and replaces it with a stock of spare food. Some interventions carry a risk of trade-offs due to possible losses of redundancy, and investment lock-in that may reduce the ability of farmers to adapt by changing what and where they farm. Trade-offs do not mean that those interventions should not be pursuit, but they should be recognised so that can be adequately addressed with complimentary actions.

Here, we report the identification of pathogenic variants in GBF1 (Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1) in four unrelated families with individuals affected by sporadic or dominant HMN/CMT2. Genomic sequencing analyses in seven affected individuals uncovered four distinct heterozygous GBF1 variants, two of which occurred de novo. Other known HMN/CMT2-implicated genes were excluded. Affected individuals show HMN/CMT2 with slowly progressive distal muscle weakness and musculoskeletal deformities. Electrophysiological studies confirmed axonal damage with chronic neurogenic changes. Three individuals had additional distal sensory loss.

GBF1 is mainly involved in the formation of coatomer protein complex (COPI) vesicles, maintenance and function of the Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria migration and positioning. We demonstrate that GBF1 is present in mouse spinal cord and muscle tissues and is particularly abundant in neuropathologically relevant sites, such as the motor neuron and the growth cone.

Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) were used for qualitative and quantitative analyses of these samples to evaluate the diagnostic performance and applicability of the two methods. RESULTS: The positive detection rates of RT-qPCR and ddPCR were 93.3% and 100%, respectively. Among the 117 samples, 6 samples were tested single-gene positive by RT-qPCR but positive by ddPCR, and 3 samples were tested negative by RT-qPCR but positive by ddPCR. The viral load of samples with inconsistent results were relatively low (3.1-20.5 copies/test).

All 6 samples from this patient were tested negative by RT-qPCR, but 4 samples were tested positive by ddPCR with a low viral load. CONCLUSION: Qualitative analysis of COVID-19 samples can meet the needs of clinical screening and diagnosis, while quantitative analysis provides more information to the research community.

Due to its implications for and upregulation in a variety of diseases, including inflammatory conditions, fibrotic disorders, and tumor growth, YKL-40 has been considered as a significant therapeutic biomarker. Here, we used a phage display to develop novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting human YKL-40 (hYKL-40). Human synthetic antibody phage display libraries were panned against a recombinant hYKL-40 protein, yielding seven unique Fabs (Antigen-binding fragment), of which two Fabs (H1 and H2) were non-aggregating and thermally stable (75.5 C and 76.5 C, respectively) and had high apparent affinities (K(D) = 2.3 nM and 4.0 nM, respectively). Reformatting the Fabs into IgGs (Immunoglobulin Gs) increased their apparent affinities (notably, for H1 and H2, K(D) = 0.5 nM and 0.3 nM, respectively), presumably due to the effects of avidity, with little change to their non-aggregation property.

We designed a study with the objective of describing the frequency of respiratory viruses, especially rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) in hospitalized children with CAP. METHODS A 6-year prospective study was conducted in children <14 years old admitted to the Pediatrics Department of the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Spain) with CAP. We studied the frequency of 16 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates. Clinical characteristics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-only infections were compared with those of RV, HMPV and HBoV single infections. RESULTS A viral pathogen was identified in 649 (73.4%) of 884 hospitalized children with CAP. Viral coinfections were detected in 30%. The rate of viral detection was significantly greater in infants <18 months (83%) than in older children (67%) (P < 0.001). The most frequently detected virus was RSV with 41.6% of positive patients followed by RV (26.2%), HBoV (17.8%), adenovirus (17.8%), HMPV (7%) and parainfluenza (7%). RSV was the most frequent virus in children <18 months, but RV was most common in the eldest group (P < 0.001). After stratifying by age, we found some significant differences among RSV, RV, HBoV and HMPV-associated infections. CONCLUSIONS The high prevalence of viral infections supports the role of respiratory viruses, mainly RSV, RV, HBoV and HMPV in CAP of children requiring hospitalization. These findings help us to understand the etiologic disease burden and to guide research and public health policy.","output":"Spectrum of respiratory viruses in children with community-acquired pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work investigates how the COVID-19 related lockdown imposed in Spain in between March and June 2020 affected the national electricity sector and the share of photovoltaics in the energy mix The analysis is conducted by comparing actual electricity demand, generation and price data with forecasts based on their pre-lockdown trends The results show that the lockdown decreased the electricity demand by 11%, and affected even more severely the price of electricity, causing a total loss for the electricity sector of 6 1 million  per day These losses were unevenly distributed among the different power technologies of the energy mix The market share of photovoltaics raised by almost 1% because of the lockdown-related demand drop, even if it performed at capacity factors lower than expected Overall, because of the lockdown and of the recently installed capacity, photovoltaic provided, for the first time, more than 9% of the national electricity consumed in June 2020, more than twice the maximum share achieved in the previous years","output":"Short-Term Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on the Energy and Economic Performance of Photovoltaics in the Spanish Electricity Sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article deals with whether the COVID-19 regulation that prohibits parental visits to their children who are patients in hospital is invalid in terms of the Constitution of South Africa The article contends that the ban on visits by parents to their children in hospital is a violation of the children's rights provisions of the Constitution regarding the 'best interests of the child', and the 'best interests standard' in the Children's Act 38 of 2005 The article also points out that the regulations are not saved by the limitations clause of the Constitution, because the restriction is not 'reasonable and justifiable' and a 'less restrictive means' can be used to achieve the same purpose of preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus The article concludes that the relevant regulation is legally invalid, and hospitals would be fully justified in allowing parental visits to child patients provided proper precautions are taken to contain the virus","output":"Is the COVID-19 regulation that prohibits parental visits to their children who are patients in hospital invalid in terms of the Constitution?

The purpose of this study was to investigate the determinants of positive sentiment expressed in hospital Facebook reviews in Malaysia, as well as the association between hospital accreditation and sentiments expressed in Facebook reviews. From 2017 to 2019, we retrieved comments from 48 official public hospitals Facebook pages. We used machine learning to build a sentiment analyzer and service quality (SERVQUAL) classifier that automatically classifies the sentiment and SERVQUAL dimensions. We utilized logistic regression analysis to determine our goals. We evaluated a total of 1852 reviews and our machine learning sentiment analyzer detected 72.1% of positive reviews and 27.9% of negative reviews. We classified 240 reviews as tangible, 1257 reviews as trustworthy, 125 reviews as responsive, 356 reviews as assurance, and 1174 reviews as empathy using our machine learning SERVQUAL classifier. After adjusting for hospital characteristics, all SERVQUAL dimensions except Tangible were associated with positive sentiment.

However, current approaches to mediation analysis with multiple mediators either involve assumptions not verifiable by experiments, or estimate the effect when mediators are manipulated jointly which precludes the practical design of experiments due to curse of dimensionality, or are difficult to interpret when arbitrary causal dependencies are present. We propose a method for mediation analysis for multiple manipulable mediators with arbitrary causal dependencies. The proposed method is clinically relevant because the decomposition of the total effect does not involve effects under cross-world assumptions and focuses on the effects after manipulating (i.e. treating) one single mediator, which is more relevant in a clinical scenario.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate transmission potential of COVID-19 by examining viral load with respect to time. METHODS: Health care personnel (HCP) at Cleveland Clinic diagnosed with COVID-19, who recovered without needing hospitalization, were identified. Threshold cycle (Ct) for positive PCR tests were obtained and viral loads calculated. Association of viral load with days since symptom onset was examined in a multivariable regression model, which was reduced by stepwise backward selection to only keep variables significant at a level of 0.05. Viral loads by day since symptom onset were predicted using the model and transmission potential evaluated by examination of a viral load-time curve. RESULTS: Over six weeks, 230 HCP had 528 tests performed. Viral loads declined by orders of magnitude within a few days of symptom onset. The only variable significantly associated with viral load was time since onset of symptoms. Of the area under the curve (AUC) spanning symptom onset to 30 days, 96.9% lay within the first 7 days, and 99.7% within 10 days. Findings were very similar when validated using split-sample and 10-fold cross-validation. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with non-severe COVID-19, viral loads in upper respiratory specimens peak by two or three days from symptom onset and decrease rapidly thereafter.

One current focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID-19 is essentially unknown. Without this understanding, it is challenging to discover a successful treatment to be approved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS) that play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. These include why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of H2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why the amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced in the cell and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in phagocytosis for immune defense. Herein we propose a plausible amplification mechanism in immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions enhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological functions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling molecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100,000 fold in phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions in the stratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can cause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging and cancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of invading pathogens such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), cancer and other diseases, and provide a molecular mechanism of action of the drugs or candidates.","output":"Reaction Cycles of Halogen Species in the Immune Defense: Implications for Human Health and Diseases and the Pathology and Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mechanisms underlying severe COVID-19 disease remain poorly understood.

We used RNA interference to decrease endogenous PKR levels. RSV replication was not altered in cells deficient for PKR expression. However, RSV-mediated stress granule formation was significantly reduced in PKR-knockdown cells. As an alternative method to block PKR activation, we used treatment with the kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine (2-AP). We observed that 2-AP treatment significantly reduced viral replication. We also treated PKR-knockdown cells with 2-AP and inoculated with RSV. Under these conditions, 2-AP treatment diminished viral replication in the absence of PKR expression. These results suggest that PKR activation has a minimal effect on RSV replication and that the antiviral effect of 2-AP during RSV infection likely occurs via a PKR-independent mechanism.","output":"Activation of protein kinase R is required for induction of stress granules by respiratory syncytial virus but dispensable for viral replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Annual albuminuria screening detects the early stages of nephropathy in individuals with diabetes. Because early detection of albuminuria allows for interventions that lower the risk of developing chronic kidney disease, guidelines recommend annual testing for all individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and for those with type 1 diabetes for at least 5 years. However, at the Eskind Diabetes Clinic at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, testing occurred less frequently than desired. METHODS: A quality improvement team first analysed the clinics processes, identifying the lack of a systematic approach to testing as the likely cause for the low rate. The team then implemented two successive interventions in a pilot of patients seen by nurse practitioners in the clinic. In the first intervention, staff used a dashboard within the electronic health record while triaging each patient, pending an albuminuria order if testing had not been done within the past year. In the second intervention, clinic leadership sent daily reminders to the triage staff. A statistical process control chart tracked monthly testing rates. RESULTS: After 6 months, annual albuminuria testing increased from a baseline of 69% to 82%, with multiple special-cause signals in the control chart. CONCLUSIONS: This project demonstrates that a series of simple interventions can significantly impact annual albuminuria testing. This projects success likely hinged on using an existing workflow to systematically determine if a patient was due for testing and prompting the provider to sign a pended order for an albuminuria test. Other diabetes/endocrinology and primary care clinics can likely implement a similar process and so improve testing rates in other settings. When coupled with appropriate interventions to reduce the development of chronic kidney disease, such interventions would improve patient outcomes, in addition to better adhering to an established quality metric.","output":"Improving annual albuminuria testing for individuals with diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a fast emerging disease with deadly consequences The pulmonary system and lungs in particular are most prone to damage caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which leaves a destructive footprint in the lung tissue, making it incapable of conducting its respiratory functions and resulting in severe acute respiratory disease and loss of life There were no drug treatments or vaccines approved for SARS-CoV-2 at the onset of pandemic, necessitating an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics To this end, the innate RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism can be employed to develop front line therapies against the virus This approach allows specific binding and silencing of therapeutic targets by using short interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules In this review, we lay out the prospect of the RNAi technology for combatting the COVID-19 We first summarize current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virology and the host response to viral entry and duplication, with the purpose of revealing effective RNAi targets We then summarize the past experience with nucleic acid silencers for SARS-CoV, the predecessor for current SARS-CoV-2 Efforts targeting specific protein-coding regions within the viral genome and intragenomic targets are summarized Emphasizing non-viral delivery approaches, molecular underpinnings of design of RNAi agents are summarized with comparative analysis of various systems used in the past Promising viral targets as well as host factors are summarized, and the possibility of modulating the immune system are presented for more effective therapies We place special emphasis on the limitations of past studies to propel the field faster by focusing on most relevant models to translate the promising agents to a clinical setting Given the urgency to address lung failure in COVID-19, we summarize the feasibility of delivering promising therapies by the inhalational route, with the expectation that this route will provide the most effective intervention to halt viral spread We conclude with the authors' perspectives on the future of RNAi therapeutics for combatting SARS-CoV-2 Since time is of the essence, a strong perspective for the path to most effective therapeutic approaches are clearly articulated by the authors","output":"Prospects for RNAi Therapy of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outcomes of COVID-19 in patients treated with biologic agents are a subject of intense investigation.

For this purpose, they offer, among other things, a structured seminar program for post-graduate trainees in general practice (GP-trainees). During the Covid-19 pandemic the seminar program of the KWBW-Verbundweiterbildungplus? in Baden-Wrttemberg was converted to digital formats. The goal of the paper is to evaluate the acceptance by the GP-trainees and lecturers, to describe experiences with the conversion to e-learning and to derive recommendations with regard to the future orientation of seminar programs in post-graduate as well as continuing medical education. The implementation was based on a modified Kern-cycle and aimed at offering eight teaching units of 45 minutes each to a large number of GP-trainees. It tried to maintain the high quality of content and education as well as the interactive character of the previous seminars. For this purpose, the events were designed as synchronous webinars (six units) with asynchronous preparation and post-processing (two units) according to the flipped classroom method. The evaluation by the participating GP-trainees and lecturers was performed online using a multi-center developed and pre-piloted questionnaire. Results and discussion: N=101 GP-trainees participated in the evaluation of five individual seminar days in the second quarter of 2020 (response rate 97%). 58% (N=59) of the trainees were satisfied or very satisfied with the implementation. 82% (n=83) rated pre-tasks as helpful. 99% (n=100) would participate in an online seminar again. For 52% (n=53) of the trainees, the attitude towards e-learning had changed positively. The main advantages mentioned were no travel, save in time and costs as well as increased flexibility. The main disadvantages mentioned were less personal interaction and technical obstacles. The high acceptance of the new digital format showed the fundamental potential of e-learning in continuing medical education.

While such data are essential, public health restrictions provide clear signals of what is socially desirable in this context, creating a potential source of response bias in self-reported measures of compliance. In this research, we examine whether the results of a guilt-free strategy recently proposed to lessen this constraint are generalizable across twelve countries, and whether the treatment effect varies across subgroups. Our findings show that the guilt-free strategy is a useful tool in every country included, increasing respondents' proclivity to report non-compliance by 9 to 16 percentage points. This effect holds for different subgroups based on gender, age and education. We conclude that the inclusion of this strategy should be the new standard for survey research that aims to provide crucial data on the current pandemic.","output":"A guilt-free strategy increases self-reported non-compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures: Experimental evidence from 12 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tumor cells outcompeted T cells for methionine, causing epigenetic aberrations at Stat5 in T cells.","output":"Tumor Cells Deplete Methionine via SLC43A2, Causing T-cell Dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this review article is to summarize the contingency management guidelines of major orthodontic procedures to enable us set new norms for orthodontics keeping in mind the implications of the prevailing pandemic Studies on efficacy of stringent infection control during COVID 19 era for orthodontic procedures published in 2020 were retrieved from various databases like COVID 19 Open Research Dataset, PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar Thus, considering the unreliability and the worrisome environment of this COVID era it is evident that clear guidelines are required for defining orthodontic emergencies, prioritizing COVID 19 testing and PPE requirements for orthodontists and secure virtual consultation platforms Its extremely mandatory for us to evolve with the ever evolving world and successfully strive together as a community maintaining our patients trust as well as the standard of orthodontic care being offered by us This unity amongst us and balance of our duties need to become part of our daily lives and be adopted as a new normal","output":"Covidorthodontics: the new normal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has reached pandemic proportions.

The proportion of re-positive tests in discharged COVID-19 patients varied from 2.4 to 69.2% and persisted from 1 to 38 days after discharge, depending on population size, age of patients, and type of specimens. Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 patients are suggested, including false-negative, false-positive RT-PCR tests; reactivation; and re-infection with SARS-CoV-2, but the mechanism leading to these re-positive cases is still unclear. The prevention of re-positive testing in discharged patients is a fundamental measure to control the spread of the pandemic. In order to reduce the percentage of false-negative tests prior to discharge, we recommend performing more than two tests, according to the standard sampling and microbiological assay protocol. In addition, specimens should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA before discharge.

METHODS We reviewed the medical records of 193 women who underwent sacrocolpopexy with 2 different types of sutures attaching polypropylene mesh to the vagina: delayed absorbable sutures (median follow-up, 43 weeks) and permanent sutures (median follow-up, 106 weeks). Vaginal apical failure was defined as Point C greater than or equal to half of the total vaginal length. Anterior-posterior compartmental failures were defined as Point Ba and/or Point Bp more than 0 cm. Fisher exact and 2 tests were used to compare failure rates. There were no documented suture erosions in the delayed absorbable monofilament suture group during the review period. Two patients in the permanent suture group were found to have permanent suture in the bladder more than 30 weeks after the index procedure. RESULTS Failure rates for the 45 subjects in the delayed absorbable group and 148 subjects in the permanent suture group were similar (4.4% vs 3.4%, p = 0.74) and not statistically different in any compartment: apical (0% vs 1.4%, p = 0.43), anterior (4.4% vs 2%, p = 0.38), or posterior (0% vs 1.4%, p = 0.43).

The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed, and the relationship between them was analyzed. RESULTS: Totally, 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58 (73%) of the 80 patients had cough, and 61 (76%) of the 80 patients had high temperature levels. The most frequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%), and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%). Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12  6 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%), and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%).

Understanding heterogeneity seen in patients with COVIDARDS and comparing to non-COVIDARDS may inform tailored treatments. Objectives: To describe the trajectories of hypoxemia and respiratory compliance in COVIDARDS and associations with outcomes. Methods: A multidisciplinary team of frontline clinicians and data scientists created the Northwell COVIDARDS dataset (NorthCARDS) leveraging over 11,542 COVID-19 hospital admissions. Data was summarized to describe differences based on clinically meaningful categories of lung compliance, and compared to non-COVIDARDS reports. A sophisticated method of extrapolating PaO2 from SpO2, as well estimating FiO2 from non invasive oxygen delivery devices were utilized to create meaningful trends of derived PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F). Measurements and Main Results: Of the 1595 COVIDARDS patients in the NorthCARDS dataset, there were 538 (34.6%) who had very low lung compliance (<20ml/cmH2O), 982 (63.2%) with low-normal compliance (20-50ml/cmH2O), and 34 (2.2%) with high lung compliance (>50ml/cmH2O). The very low compliance group had double the median time to intubation compared to the low-normal group (107 hours(IQR 26.3, 238.3) vs. 37.9 hours(IQR 4.8, 90.7)). Oxygenation trends have improved in all groups after a nadir immediately post intubation. The P/F ratio improved from a mean of 109 to 155, with the very low compliance group showing a smaller improvement compared to low compliance group. The derived P/F trends closely correlated with blood gas analysis driven P/F trends, except immediately post intubation were the trends diverge as illustrated in the image. Overall, 67.5% (n=1049) of the patients died during the hospitalization. In comparison to non-COVIDARDS reports, there were less patients in the high compliance category (2.2%vs 12%, compliance equal or over 50mL/cmH20), and more patients with P/F less than 150 ( 57.8% vs. 45.6%). No correlation was apparent between lung compliance and P/F ratio. The Oxygenation Index was similar, (11.12(SD 5.67)vs 12.8(SD 10.8)). Conclusions: Heterogeneity in lung compliance is seen in COVIDARDS, without apparent correlation to degree of hypoxemia. Notably, time to intubation was greater in the very low lung compliance category. Understanding ARDS patient heterogeneity must include consideration of treatment patterns in addition to trajectories of change in patient-level data and demographics.","output":"Trajectories of Hypoxemia & Respiratory System Mechanics of COVID-19 ARDS in the NorthCARDS dataset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heart failure (HF) is the typical terminal stage of cardiac diseases involving inflammatory states.

The significant results of the study include: the definition of invariable characteristics of virtual mini-lectures (distance, virtuality, mediation, situational incorrigibility, multimodality), defining cognitive strategies of the speaker and the listener in an asynchronous lecture interaction, finding the points of contact (motivation and interest in transferring and receiving information) between them. The article also describes the linguistic features of virtual mini-lecture. These conclusions can find practical application in the development of methodology for the distance teaching of linguistic disciplines.","output":"Virtual Mini-Lecture in Distance Learning Space"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS\\\\Cov\\\\2 is a single\\\\stranded RNA virus composed of 16 non\\\\structural proteins (NSP 1\\\\16) with specific roles in the replication of coronaviruses.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale online experiment (N = 1,102), using a sample from four countries (UK, US, Germany, Sweden). As predicted, people perceived themselves to adhere to the COVID-19 guidelines more strictly than both the average citizen of their country and their close friends.

PURPOSE: : The objective of this study is to investigate whether CQ and HCQ could be ACE2 blockers and used to inhibit 2019-nCoV virus infection. METHODS: : In our study, we used CCK-8 staining, flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining to evaluate the toxicity and autophagy of CQ and HCQ, respectively, on ACE2 high-expressing HEK293T cells (ACE2(h) cells). We further analyzed the binding character of CQ and HCQ to ACE2 by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, 2019-nCoV spike pseudotyped virus was also used to observe the viropexis effect of CQ and HCQ in ACE2(h) cells.

Due to its high prevalence, it constitutes the first cause of disability among the Americas, where only a very low percentage of the population receives the adequate evidence-based psychological treatment. Internet-Based Interventions (IBIs) are a great alternative to reduce the treatment gap for mental disorders. Although there are several studies in low-and middle-income countries proving IBIs' feasibility and acceptability, there is still little evidence of the effectiveness in diverse social and cultural contexts such as Latin America. METHODS: Two studies will be described: Study 1 is focused on the cultural adaptation of a cognitive-behavioral IBI Smiling is Fun (Botella et al. 2012, 2015) for Ecuadorian population with depression based on the procedure by Salamanca-Sanabria et al. (2018). Study 2 describes the design of a randomized controlled trial to test the preliminary efficacy of the culturally adapted intervention in a Public Health Care setting. A total of 153 patients with mild to moderate degree of depression as assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) will be randomly assigned to either an IBI group using only automated support by the system; an IBI group including also minimal human support; or a waiting list group.

However, antibiotic dosing remains a challenge for clinicians as antibiotic dosing regimens are usually determined in non-critically ill hospitalized adult patients. The aim was to conduct a systematic review to identify and highlight studies comparing clinical outcomes of piperacillin tazobactam dosing regimens, continuous/prolonged infusion vs intermittent infusion in critically ill patients. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the overall effect of dosing regimen on clinical efficacy. METHODS: Studies were identified systematically through searches of PubMed and Science Direct, in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Following the systematic literature review, meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included in the analysis involving 3828 critically ill adult participants in total (continuous/prolonged infusion = 2197 and intermittent infusion = 1631) from geographically diverse regions. Continuous/prolonged resulted in significantly: higher clinical cure rates (Odds Ratio 1.56, 95% Confidence Interval 1.28C1.90, P = 0 .0001), lower mortality rates (Odds Ratio 0.68, 95% Confidence Interval 0.55C0.84, P = 0 .0003), higher microbiological success rates (Odds Ratio 1.52, 95% Confidence Interval 1.10C2.11, P = 0.01) and decreasing the length of hospital stay (Mean Difference ? 1.27, 95% Confidence Interval ? 2.450.08, P = 0.04) in critically ill patients. CONCLUSION: Results from this study show that there is a significant level of evidence that clinical outcome in critically ill patients is improved in patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam via continuous/prolonged infusion. However, more rigorous scientific studies in critically ill patients are warranted to reach a sufficient level of evidence and promote further implementation of C/PI as a dosing strategy.","output":"Comparing clinical outcomes of piperacillin-tazobactam administration and dosage strategies in critically ill adult patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory disease, but many patients also experience neurological complications.

Accurate diagnosis of FGS is crucial for effective case management, surveillance and control. However, current methods for diagnosis and morbidity assessment can be inaccessible to those at need, labour intensive, costly and unreliable. Molecular techniques such as PCR can be used to reliably diagnose FGS via the detection of Schistosoma DNA using cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples as well as lesser-invasive vaginal self-swab (VSS) and cervical self-swab samples. PCR is, however, currently unsuited for use in most endemic settings. As such, in this study, we assessed the use of a rapid and portable S. haematobium recombinase polymerase amplification (Sh-RPA) isothermal molecular diagnostic assay, coupled with simplified sample preparation methodologies, to detect S. haematobium DNA using CVL and VSS samples provided by patients in Zambia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: VSS and CVL samples were screened for FGS using a previously developed Sh-RPA assay. DNA was isolated from VSS and CVL samples using the QIAamp Mini kit (n = 603 and 527, respectively). DNA was also isolated from CVL samples using two rapid and portable DNA extraction methods: 1) the SpeedXtract Nucleic Acid Kit (n = 223) and 2) the Extracta DNA Tissue Prep Kit (n = 136). Diagnostic performance of the Sh-RPA using VSS DNA extacts (QIAamp Mini kit) as well as CVL DNA extracts (QIAamp Mini kit, SpeedXtract Nucleic Acid Kit and Extracta DNA Tissue Prep Kit) was then compared to a real-time PCR reference test. Results suggest that optimal performance may be achieved when the Sh-RPA is used with PuVSS samples (sensitivity 93.3%; specificity 96.6%), however no comparisons between different DNA extraction methods using VSS samples could be carried out within this study. When using CVL samples, sensitivity of the Sh-RPA ranged between 71.4 and 85.7 across all three DNA extraction methods when compared to real-time PCR using CVL samples prepared using the QIAamp Mini kit. Interestingly, of these three DNA extraction methods, the rapid and portable SpeedXtract method had the greatest sensitivity and specificity (85.7% and 98.1%, respectively). Specificity of the Sh-RPA was >91% across all comparisons. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results supplement previous findings, highlighting that the use of genital self-swab sampling for diagnosing FGS should be explored further whilst also demonstrating that rapid and portable DNA isolation methods can be used to detect S. haematobium DNA within clinical samples using RPA. Although further development and assessment is needed, it was concluded that the Sh-RPA, coupled with simplified sample preparation, shows excellent promise as a rapid and sensitive diagnostic tool capable of diagnosing FGS at the point-of-care in resource-poor schistosomiasis-endemic settings.","output":"Validation of the isothermal Schistosoma haematobium Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) assay, coupled with simplified sample preparation, for diagnosing female genital schistosomiasis using cervicovaginal lavage and vaginal self-swab samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on the operational readiness capacities of the grassroots health system in Vietnam while it plays a vital role as a first-line defense against health emergencies, including the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

METHODS: An online cross-sectional study using the respondent-driven sampling technique was conducted with 6029 health professionals and medical students in Vietnam from December 2019 to February 2020. The operational readiness capacities of the health system were assessed by the sufficiency of health professionals, administrative and logistics staffs, equipment and facilities, and general capacity of health professionals. Kruskal-Wallis test, Fisher exact test and (2) test were employed to identify the differences among variables. Tobit and censored regression models were operated to determine associated factors.

Serum neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses waned rapidly but spike (S)-specific IgG(+) memory B cells (MBCs) remained stable or increased over time. Analysis of 1,213 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from S-specific MBCs revealed a primarily de novo response that displayed increased somatic hypermutation, binding affinity, and neutralization potency over time, providing evidence for prolonged antibody affinity maturation. B cell immunodominance hierarchies were similar across donor repertoires and remained relatively stable as the immune response progressed. Cross-reactive B cell populations, likely re-called from prior endemic beta-coronavirus exposures, comprised a small but stable fraction of the repertoires and did not contribute to the neutralizing response. The neutralizing antibody response was dominated by public clonotypes that displayed significantly reduced activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging in Brazil and South Africa that harbor mutations at positions 501, 484 and 417 in the S protein.

To address recent concerns over age-based ICU decision-making we explored patient-assessed quality of life (QoL) in ICU survivors. METHODS We conducted a rapid database search of cohort studies published between January 2000 to April 2020, of elderly patients admitted to ICUs. We extracted data on self-reported QoL (EQ-5D composite score), study characteristics and demographic and clinical variables. Using a random-effects model, we then compared QoL scores at follow-up to scores either before admission, age-matched population controls or younger ICU survivors. Finally, we conducted follow-up quantitative analyses to explore potential moderators of these effects, and a qualitative synthesis of QoL subscores. A study protocol was registered prospectively on PROSPERO, ID: CRD42020181181. FINDINGS Our database search found 2536 studies and from these we reviewed 376 potentially relevant full texts. 21 of these studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis and 18 were also included in the meta-analysis (N= 2090 elderly adults). The follow-up periods ranged between 3-100 months. There was no significant difference in the elderlys QoL scores between one month before ICU and follow-up, or between follow-up and age-matched community controls. QoL in elderly ICU survivors was significantly worse than younger ICU survivors, with a small-to-medium effect size (d= .33 [.10 to .55]). Mortality rates and length of follow up were possible intermediary factors. The qualitative synthesis suggested that any reductions in QoL were primarily due to reductions in physical health, rather than mental health items. INTERPRETATION Overall, elderly ICU patients did not experience significantly impaired QoL at follow up, compared to before ICU or their healthy peers. Elderly patients who survive ICU can be expected to have slightly worse QoL compared to younger patients, especially in the long-term. The results suggest that the proportionality of age as a determinant of (population level) ICU resource allocation should be kept under close review and that subjective QoL outcomes (not only objective survival data) should inform person-centred decision making in elderly ICU patients.","output":"Quality of Life in elderly ICU survivors:A Rapid Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent coronavirus outbreak has made governments face an inconvenient trade-off choice, i.e. the choice between saving lives and saving the economy, forcing them to make immensely consequential decisions among alternative courses of actions without knowing what the ultimate results would be for the society as a whole.

In this study, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were evaluated in an industrial and urban area during the lockdown period due to COVID-19 in northern Colombia. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations obtained from the spaceborne MODIS (MOD04-3k) and the active fire data was obtained from VIIRS Active Fire. We measured surface contamination at several stations to quantify the PM10 and PM2.5 changes associated with the general closure of anthropogenic and industrial activities driven by COVID-19 and by the macroscale and/or mesoscale contributions. In the industrial zone, a slight decrease in daily concentrations was detected at the stations located near the mining operations. In the urban area, the decrease is more salient in COVID-19 lockdown. No visible impact on the daily levels of PM10 and PM2.5 was observed.

The origin and emergence of its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, in the human population remains mysterious, although bat and pangolin were proposed to be the natural reservoirs. Strikingly, unlike the SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses (CoVs) identified in bats and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 harbors a polybasic furin cleavage site in its spike (S) glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor to infect cells. Receptor recognition by the S protein is the major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. In an effort to search for the potential intermediate or amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, we examined receptor activity of ACE2 from 14 mammal species and found that ACE2s from multiple species can support the infectious entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the wild-type or furin cleavage site-deficient S protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 of human/rhesus monkey and rat/mouse exhibited the highest and lowest receptor activities, respectively. Among the remaining species, ACE2s from rabbit and pangolin strongly bound to the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and efficiently supported the pseudotyped virus infection. These findings have important implications for understanding potential natural reservoirs, zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, and use of animal models. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a primary receptor for host cell entry. Viral entry mediated by the interaction of ACE2 with spike protein largely determines host range and is the major constraint to interspecies transmission. We examined the receptor activity of 14 ACE2 orthologs and found that wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the furin cleavage site in S protein could utilize ACE2 from a broad range of animal species to enter host cells. These results have important implications in the natural hosts, interspecies transmission, animal models, and molecular basis of receptor binding for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Broad and Differential Animal Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 Receptor Usage by SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The talented team from CSU Channel Islands-Dang, Reyes Reilly, Soltys, and Soltys-provide a deep dive into how this can be applied to the independent variable in all our careers, whether or not the student will enroll.

SARS-CoV-2 Symptoms: Asymptomatic Medication: Clinical Procedure:  Specialty: Pediatrics and Neonatology OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious virus and is responsible for the current pandemic. It mainly infects cells of the lower respiratory tract and has been linked to severe respiratory complications. Although multiple routes of transmission have been reported in the literature, there is no definitive evidence for transplacental transmission. We present a case of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 likely due to transplacental transmission. CASE REPORT: 31-year-old Hispanic woman in the final week of pregnancy developed mild respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. She had a history of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and gestational diabetes. Two days later, she gave birth to a baby girl who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the first day after birth. She was delivered via elective cesarean section adhering to a strict infection control protocol. CONCLUSIONS: This report presents a case of a 31-year-old mother with mild symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia who was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and who gave birth to a baby girl who was also positive for SARS-CoV-2.

APC maturation and antigen processing is a subsequent prerequisite for T cell priming and anti-tumor immunity. In order to specifically target APC, nanoparticles, such as liposomes, can be used for the delivery of antigen and adjuvant. We have previously shown that liposomal inclusion of the ganglioside GM3, an endogenous ligand for CD169, led to robust uptake by CD169-expressing APC and resulted in strong immune responses when supplemented with a soluble adjuvant. To minimize the adverse effects related to a soluble adjuvant, immune stimulatory molecules can be incorporated in liposomes to achieve targeted delivery of both antigen and adjuvant. In this study, we incorporated TLR4 (MPLA) or TLR7/8 (3M-052) ligands in combination with inflammasome stimuli, 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PGPC) or muramyl dipeptide (MDP), into GM3 liposomes. Incorporation of TLR and inflammasome ligands did not interfere with the uptake of GM3 liposomes by CD169-expressing cells. GM3 liposomes containing a TLR ligand efficiently matured human and mouse dendritic cells in vitro and in vivo, while inclusion of PGPC or MDP had minor effects on maturation. Immunization with MPLA-containing GM3 liposomes containing an immunogenic synthetic long peptide stimulated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses, but additional incorporation of either PGPC or MDP did not translate into stronger immune responses. In conclusion, our study indicates that TLRL-containing GM3 liposomes are effective vectors to induce DC maturation and T cell priming and thus provide guidance for further selection of liposomal components to optimally stimulate anti-cancer immune responses.","output":"Incorporation of Toll-Like Receptor Ligands and Inflammasome Stimuli in GM3 Liposomes to Induce Dendritic Cell Maturation and T Cell Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Performing a proper nasal and oropharyngeal swab procedure is essential in the screening of COVID-19 infection.

METHODS: We evaluated clinical features and outcomes after COVID\\\\19 in 93 MG patients. RESULTS: Thirty\\\\five patients (38%) had severe pneumonia and we recorded 10 deaths (11%) due to COVID\\\\19. Higher forced vital capacity (FVC) values tested before COVID\\\\19 were shown to be protective against severe infection (95% CI 0.934C0.98) as well as good control of MG measured by the quantified myasthenia gravis score (95% CI 1.047C1.232). Long\\\\term chronic corticosteroid treatment worsened the course of COVID\\\\19 in MG patients (95% CI 1.784C111.43) and this impact was positively associated with dosage (p = 0.005). Treatment using azathioprine (95% CI 0.448C2.935), mycophenolate mofetil (95% CI 0.91C12.515) and ciclosporin (95% CI 0.029C2.212) did not influence the course of COVID\\\\19. MG patients treated with rituximab had a high risk of death caused by COVID\\\\19 (95% CI 3.216C383.971). Exacerbation of MG during infection was relatively rare (15%) and was not caused by remdesivir, convalescent plasma or favipiravir (95% CI 0.885C10.87). CONCLUSIONS: As the most important predictors of severe COVID\\\\19 in MG patients we identified unsatisfied condition of MG with lower FVC, previous long\\\\term corticosteroid treatment especially in higher doses, older age, the presence of cancer, and recent rituximab treatment.","output":"Predictive factors for a severe course of COVID\\\\19 infection in myasthenia gravis patients with an overall impact on myasthenic outcome status and survival"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Consumer behavior changes differently in emergencies. Understanding consumer food stockpiling behavior during COVID-19 pandemic can provide critical information for governments and policymakers to adjust inventory and response strategies. This paper analyzed consumer food stockpiling behavior, including the change of food reserve scale and willingness to pay for fresh food reserves in COVID-19. Our paper shows that the scale of food reserve extends from 3.37 to 7.37 days after the outbreak of COVID-19; if available, consumers on average are willing to pay 18.14 yuan (60.47%) premium for fresh products reserves. The result shows that food stockpiling behavior is fueled by a set of multiple motivations and subjective risk perception. Female, high education level and high-income consumers were more likely to reserve larger scale food reserves, but consumers' willingness to pay for fresh food reserves is determined by income. This study was conducted when new infection cases continued to rise in the world. The story of food stockpiling during the COVID-19 pandemic in China is similar with the rest of world.

Methods: Intraocular pressure was raised in rat eyes by injecting 2M hypertonic saline into the limbal veins. SNC-121 (1 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered to the animals for 7 days. Retinas were collected at days 7 and 42, post-injury followed by measurement of HDAC activities, mRNA, and protein expression by enzyme assay, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Results: The visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and pattern electroretinograms (ERGs) were declined in ocular hypertensive animals, which were significantly improved by SNC-121 treatment. Class I and IIb HDACs activities were significantly increased at days 7 and 42 in ocular hypertensive animals. The mRNA and protein expression of HDAC 1 was increased by 1.33  0.07-fold and 20.2  2.7%, HDAC 2 by 1.4  0.05-fold and 17.0  2.4%, HDAC 3 by 1.4  0.06-fold and 17.4  3.4%, and HDAC 6 by 1.5  0.09-fold and 15.1  3.3% at day 7, post-injury.

However, the measures adopted to control the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak culminated with closing of exercise facilities and fitness centers and, as a primary consequence, impaired aerobic exercise practice. This contributed to an increase in risk factors associated with physical inactivity such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, low-grade inflammation, weight gain, and mental health problems. The scenario is worrisome, and it is important to propose alternatives for exercise practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interval training (IT) emerges as an exercise mode that might be feasible, low-cost, and potentially safe to be performed in many different places. IT consists of interspersing relative brief bouts of high-intensity exercise with recovery periods and promotes similar or greater health benefits when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Among the different types of IT, sprint interval training and Tabata protocols might be particularly useful during social isolation. These protocols can be controlled and performed without the need of complex equipment and can be adapted to different places, including domestic environments. In this article, we present variations of IT as possible alternatives to cope physical inactivity during COVID-19 pandemics with a focus on its practical applications.

Therefore, it became mandatory to develop prognostic models to evaluate critical COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluate a cohort of consecutive COVID-19 critically ill patients admitted to ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. A multivariable Cox regression model including demographic, clinical and laboratory findings was developed to assess the predictive value of these variables. Internal validation was performed using the bootstrap resampling technique. The models discriminatory ability was assessed with Harrells C-statistic and the goodness-of-fit was evaluated with calibration plot. RESULTS: 242 patients were included [median age, 64 years (56C71 IQR), 196 (81%) males]. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (46.7%), followed by diabetes (15.3%) and heart disease (14.5%). Eighty-five patients (35.1%) died within 28 days after ICU admission and the median time from ICU admission to death was 11 days (IQR 6C18). In multivariable model after internal validation, age, obesity, procaltitonin, SOFA score and PaO(2)/FiO(2) resulted as independent predictors of 28-day mortality.

For the development of the severe disease, prognostic factors were a history of hemodialysis (HR=135), diabetes (HR=4.4), and an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (HR=1,004), while the lymphocyte count over 1,064 was a protective factor (HR=0.9). In the classification of patients, the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) score in the high and low-risk categories corresponded to the best performance. There was no difference between the treatments administered. Conclusions: The most important prognostic factors for mortality were being over 60 years of age, hypertension, diabetes, and cirrhosis, while for the development of severe disease they were chronic kidney disease with hemodialysis, NEWS2 with high risk at admission, increased levels of LDH and C reactive protein (CRP), and leukocytosis.","output":"Prognostic factors in hospitalized patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, Bogot, Colombia/ [Factores pronsticos en pacientes hospitalizados con diagnstico de infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 en Bogot, Colombia]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This retrospective and observational cohort study investigated chest computed tomography (CT) findings, cycle threshold (Ct) values in RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 and secondary infection occurrence to predict prognosis in COVID-19 patients.

By implementing semantic network analysis, results demonstrate that the two countries' social media users overlapped in themes concerning domestic vaccination policies, priority groups, challenges from COVID-19 variants, and the global pandemic situation. However, Twitter users were prone to disclose individual vaccination experiences, express anti-vaccine attitudes. In comparison, Weibo users manifested evident deference to authorities and exhibited more positive feelings toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Those disparities were explained by the cultural characteristics' differences between the two countries.

The clinical laboratory staff have always played an important role in the laboratory diagnosis of patients. Currently, there are many research studies on the mental health of the first-line doctors or nurses managing the COVID-19 outbreak, both domestically and overseas, but data of the mental health and associated factors among the clinical laboratory staff who handle the blood or biological samples of confirmed cases and are consequently exposed to COVID-19 are limited. Methods: This cross-sectional survey-based study was performed via an online survey in a single designated hospital from April 20 to April 23, 2020 in Yiwu,China. The online survey included questions on sociodemographic and clinical variables. Totally, 45 clinical laboratory staff and 20 nonmedical health workers participated. Mental health variables were assessed via 4 Chinese versions of validated measurement tools : Zungs Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). Results: Significant differences were observed in the SDS and SAS scores, between the clinical laboratory staff and the nonmedical health workers (P &lt; .001, P &lt; .003, respectively). The scores for exposure risk and neuroticism of participants were the main factors influencing both the SDS scores of the clinical laboratory staff (P = .002, P = .005, respectively), and also their SAS scores (P = .003 P = .006, respectively). Conclusions: The results showed that a significant proportion of clinical laboratory staff experienced anxiety and depression symptoms. Their scores for mental health problems, exposure risk, and neuroticism were associated with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. Therefore, the high-risk group of the clinical laboratory staff and those individuals with higher neuroticism scores may need special attention.","output":"Psychological Status of Clinical Laboratory Staff During the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mitochondria are key for cellular metabolism and signalling processes during viral infection.

In this study, we investigate whether discomfort increases monotonously with motion sickness and how the relation can best be characterized in a semantic experiment (Experiment 1) and a motion sickness experiment (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, 15 participants performed pairwise comparisons on the subjective discomfort associated with each item on the popular MIsery SCale (MISC) of motion sickness. In Experiment 2, 17 participants rated motion sickness using the MISC during exposures to four sustained motion stimuli, and provided (1) numerical magnitude estimates of the discomfort experienced for each level of the MISC, and (2) verbal magnitude estimates with seven qualifiers, ranging between feeling excellent and terrible. The data of Experiment 1 show that the items of the MISC are ranked in order of appearance, with the exception of 5 (severe dizziness, warmth, headache, stomach awareness, and sweating) and 6 (slight nausea), which are ranked in opposite order. However, in Experiment 2, we find that discomfort associated with each level of the MISC, as it was used to express motion sickness during exposure to a sickening stimulus, increases monotonously; following a power law with an exponent of 1.206. While the results of Experiment 1 replicate the non-linearity found in recent studies, the results of Experiment 2 suggest that the non-linearity is due to the semantic nature of Experiment 1, and that there is a positive monotonous relation between MISC and discomfort in practice.

Urgent and careful planning is needed to mitigate negative effects of pandemic on engineering education that has been traditionally content-centered, hands-on and design-oriented. To enhance engineering online education during the pandemic, we conducted an observational study at California State University, Long Beach (one of the largest and most diverse four-year university in the U.S.). A total of 110 faculty members and 627 students from six engineering departments participated in surveys and answered quantitative and qualitative questions to highlight the challenges they experienced during the online instruction in Spring 2020. Our results identified various issues that negatively influenced the online engineering education including logistical/technical problems, learning/teaching challenges, privacy and security concerns and lack of sufficient hands-on training. For example, more than half of the students indicated lack of engagement in class, difficulty in maintaining their focus and Zoom fatigue after attending multiple online sessions. A correlation analysis showed that while semi-online asynchronous exams were associated with an increase in the perceived cheating by the instructors, a fully online or open-book/open-note exams had an association with a decrease in instructor's perception of cheating. To address various identified challenges, we recommended strategies for educational stakeholders (students, faculty and administration) to fill the tools and technology gap and improve online engineering education. These recommendations are practical approaches for many similar institutions around the world and would help improve the learning outcomes of online educations in various engineering subfields.

However, continuous global immunosuppression may cause severe side effects, including tumors and infections. Mounting evidence has shown that cyclosporine (CsA), a common immunosuppressant used in clinic, impedes allograft tolerance by dampening regulatory T cells (Tregs), although it inhibits allograft rejection at the same time. Therefore, it is necessary to seek an alternative immunosuppressive drug that spares Tregs with high efficiency in suppression but low toxicity. In this study, we investigated the capacity of emodin, an anthraquinone molecule originally extracted from certain natural plants, to prolong transplant survival in a mouse model and explored the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its action. We found that emodin significantly extended skin allograft survival and hindered CD3(+) T cell infiltration in the allograft, accompanied by an increase in CD4(+)Foxp3(+) and CD8(+)CD122(+) Treg frequencies and numbers but a reduction in effector CD8(+)CD44(high)CD62L(low) T cells in recipient mice. Emodin also inhibited effector CD8(+) T cells proliferation in vivo. However, CD4(+)CD25(+), but not CD8(+)CD122(+), Tregs derived from emodin-treated recipients were more potent in suppression of allograft rejection than those isolated from control recipients, suggesting that emodin also enhances the suppressive function of CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs. Interestingly, depleting CD25(+) Tregs largely reversed skin allograft survival prolonged by emodin while depleting CD122(+) Tregs only partially abrogated the same allograft survival. Furthermore, we found that emodin hindered dendritic cell (DC) maturation and reduced alloantibody production posttransplantation. Finally, we demonstrated that emodin inhibited in vitro proliferation of T cells and blocked their mTOR signaling as well. Therefore, emodin may be a novel mTOR inhibitor that suppresses alloimmunity by inducing both CD4(+)FoxP3(+) and CD8(+)CD122(+) Tregs, suppressing alloantibody production, and hindering DC maturation. Thus, emodin is a newly emerging immunosuppressant and could be utilized in clinical transplantation in the future.","output":"A New Immunosuppressive Molecule Emodin Induces both CD4(+)FoxP3(+) and CD8(+)CD122(+) Regulatory T Cells and Suppresses Murine Allograft Rejection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We apply a general case replacement framework for quantifying the robustness of causal inferences to characterize the uncertainty of findings from clinical trials.

The RIR addresses known limitations of the Fragility Index by accounting for the observed rates of outcomes. It can be used for varying thresholds for inference, including clinical importance. CONCLUSION: Because the RIR expresses uncertainty in terms of patient experiences, it is more relatable to stakeholders than P-values alone.

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Data from an online panel survey. SAMPLE A Fall 2018 nationally representative sample of 3,415 (99.3% response rate) United States (US) adults 18-64 years old. MEASURES Policy support for prohibiting MUH smoking and e-cigarette use, sociodemographics, and tobacco perceptions and behaviors. ANALYSIS Weighted multivariate logistic regression examined predictors of support for prohibiting 1) cigarette use and 2) e-cigarette use in MUH. RESULTS Most respondents expressed support for prohibiting smoking (76.9%) and e-cigarette use (74.0%) in MUH. About 17% (n = 588) of the sample lived in MUH, and living in MUH was not predictive of support for either policy. For both cigarette and e-cigarette policies, current smokers (n = 630; OR = 0.44, p < 0.001; OR = 0.59, p < 0.01) and current e-cigarette users (n = 305; OR = 0.42, p < 0.001; OR = 0.22, p < 0.001) had lower odds of support. Notably, while most smokers supported prohibiting cigarette (51.4%) and e-cigarette use in MUH (51.1%), there was less support among current e-cigarette users for prohibiting cigarette (48.1%) and e-cigarette use in MUH (34.5%). CONCLUSION Majority support for prohibiting smoking and e-cigarette use in MUH is promising for policy adoption; however, lower support of both policies among e-cigarette users needs to be examined, as increasing use of e-cigarettes may be shifting social norms away from support for smoke free housing policies.","output":"Policy Support for Smoke-Free and E-Cigarette Free Multiunit Housing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global pandemics, such as COVID-19, significantly impact mental and physical well-being.

Methods: A total of 10 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients with mild to moderate illness, approved by RT-PCR, were followed daily. After 2 days of cessation of clinical symptoms, a nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal sample RT-PCR was taken. If the patients test had a negative result, a repeated RT-PCR was performed 24 hours later. Moreover, if two consecutive tests had negative results, the patient was considered definitively treated, and the follow-up was terminated. However, if RT-PCR was positive, the test was performed 3 days later. The infectivity period after symptom relief and total infectivity period were calculated. The SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were measured 1 month after symptom relief. The SPSS Software (version 20) was used for data analysis.

This finding highlights the importance of isolation and distancing in patients after recovery and the adoption of hygiene measures. ? 2022, Author(s).","output":"Infectivity Period After Symptom Relief in SARS-CoV-2 Patients: An Experimental Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The unprecedented outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia infection in Wuhan City caused global concern, the outflowing population from Wuhan was believed to be a main reason for the rapid and large-scale spread of the disease, so the government implemented a city closure measure to prevent its transmission considering the large amount of travelling before the Chinese New Year. METHODS: Based on the daily reported new cases and the population movement data between January 1 and 31, we examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the geographical expansion of the infection in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan in different scenarios of closing dates. RESULTS: We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of the 2019-nCoV cases. The spatial distribution of cases per unit outflow population indicated that some areas with large outflow population might have been underestimated for the infection, such as Henan and Hunan provinces. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could have been prevented, and if two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger for the transmission of 2019-nCoV infection in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to control the epidemic.","output":"Population movement, city closure in Wuhan and geographical expansion of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia infection in China in January 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is revolutionizing healthcare delivery. The aim of this study was to reach a consensus among experts as to the possible applications of telemedicine in the proctologic field.

The Telemedicine in Proctology Italian Working Group included 47 Italian Society of Colorectal Surgery nominated experts evaluating the appropriateness of each clinical practice recommendations based on published RAND/UCLA methodology in 2 rounds. RESULTS: Stakeholder median age was 53 years (interquartile range limits 40-60), and 38 (81%) were men. Nine (19%) panelists reported no experience with telemedicine before the pandemic. Agreement was obtained on a minimum of 3 to 5 years of practice in the proctologic field before starting teleconsultations, which should be regularly paid, with advice and prescriptions incorporated into a formal report sent to the patient by e-mail along with a receipt. Of the panelists, 35 of 47 (74%) agreed that teleconsultation carries the risk of misdiagnosis of cancer, thus recommending an in-person assessment before scheduling any surgery. Fifteen additional clinical practice recommendations were re-elaborated in the second round and assessed by 44 of 47 (93.6%) panelists. The application of telemedicine for the diagnosis of common proctologic conditions (eg, hemorrhoidal disease, anal abscess and fistula, anal condylomas, and anal fissure) and functional pelvic floor disorders was generally considered inappropriate. Teleconsultation was instead deemed appropriate for the diagnosis and management of pilonidal disease. CONCLUSION: This e-consensus revealed the boundaries of telemedicine in Italy.

Although significant effort has been invested in identifying antibodies that block infection, the ability of antibodies to target infected cells through Fc interactions may be vital to eliminate the virus. To explore the role of Fc activity in SARS-CoV-2 immunity, the functional potential of a cross-SARS-reactive antibody, CR3022, was assessed. CR3022 was able to broadly drive antibody effector functions, providing critical immune clearance at entry and upon egress. Using selectively engineered Fc variants, no protection was observed after administration of WT IgG1 in mice or hamsters. Conversely, the functionally enhanced Fc variant resulted in increased pathology in both the mouse and hamster models, causing weight loss in mice and enhanced viral replication and weight loss in the more susceptible hamster model, highlighting the pathological functions of Fc-enhancing mutations. These data point to the critical need for strategic Fc engineering for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Dissecting strategies to tune the therapeutic potential of SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibody CR3022"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic does not fit into prevailing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) models, or diagnostic criteria, yet emerging research shows traumatic stress symptoms as a result of this ongoing global stressor.

Yet, traumatic stress reactions to future, indirect trauma exposure, and non-Criterion A events exist, suggesting COVID-19 is also a traumatic stressor which could lead to PTSD symptomology. To examine this idea, we asked a sample of online participants (N = 1,040), in five western countries, to indicate the COVID-19 events they had been directly exposed to, events they anticipated would happen in the future, and other forms of indirect exposure such as through media coverage. We then asked participants to complete the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5, adapted to measure pre/peri/post-traumatic reactions in relation to COVID-19. We also measured general emotional reactions (e.g., angry, anxious, helpless), well-being, psychosocial functioning, and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. We found participants had PTSD-like symptoms for events that had not happened and when participants had been directly (e.g., contact with virus) or indirectly exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., via media). Moreover, 13.2% of our sample were likely PTSD-positive, despite types of COVID-19 \\"exposure\\" (e.g., lockdown) not fitting DSM-5 criteria.

The disease is highly infectious. In order to prevent and control the epidemic situation, the state has issued a series of measures to guide the prevention and control of the epidemic. At the same time, it also introduced the measure of home isolation for children with fever. However, due to the nature of children, the implementation of the home isolation turned out to be quite difficult, and questions regarding the home isolation were brought out by parents when seeing doctors. For this reason, we decided to conduct this study. AIM: To study factors that influence home quarantine compliance in children with fever during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: A total of 495 paediatric patients with respiratory tract infection and fever were selected from the general fever clinic at Xiamen Childrens Hospital from February 6-27, 2020. On day 8 after the hospital visit, follow-up was conducted by telephone to evaluate the compliance of home quarantine. RESULTS: Among the ten quarantine measures, the proportion of families adhering to keeping 1.5 m distance, proper hand hygiene, wearing masks at home, and proper cough etiquette was very low (< 30% for each measure). Our analysis showed that compliance was related to gender and age of children, gender and age of primary caregiver, number of children in the family, and intensity of information on quarantine measures. We observed that compliance increased with the age of children. Compared with children whose caregivers were young adults, children with elderly caregivers were 2.461 times more likely to show poor compliance. Furthermore, children who received intensive information on quarantine measures had significantly better compliance. CONCLUSION: Compliance of children with fever to quarantine measures at home is low during the COVID-19 epidemic. Strengthening education on the quarantine measures is critical to improve compliance, in particular in young children with elderly caregivers.","output":"Home quarantine compliance is low in children with fever during COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic precipitated a shift in the working practices of millions of people. Nearly half the British workforce (47%) reported to be working at home under lockdown in April 2020. This study investigated the impact of enforced home-working under lockdown on employee wellbeing via markers of stress, burnout, depressive symptoms, and sleep. Moderating effects of factors including age, gender, number of dependants, mental health status and work status were examined alongside work-related factors including work-life conflict and leadership quality. Method: Cross-sectional data were collected over a 12-week period from May to August 2020 using an online survey. Job-related and wellbeing factors were measured using items from the COPSOQIII. Stress, burnout, somatic stress, cognitive stress, and sleep trouble were tested together using MANOVA and MANCOVA to identify mediating effects. T-tests and one-way ANOVA identified differences in overall stress. Pearsons correlation coefficient assessed the moderating effects of work status. Regression trees identified groups with highest and lowest levels of stress and depressive symptoms. Results: : 81% of respondents were working at home either full or part-time (n=623, 62% female). Detrimental health impacts of home-working during lockdown were most acutely experienced by those with existing mental health conditions regardless of age, gender, or work status, and were exacerbated by working regular overtime. In those without mental health conditions, predictors of stress and depressive symptoms were being female, under 45 years, home-working part-time and two dependants, though men reported greater levels of work-life conflict. Place and pattern of work had a greater impact on women. Lower leadership quality was a significant predictor of stress and burnout for both men and women, and, for employees aged >45 years, had significant impact on level of depressive symptoms experienced. Conclusions: : Experience of home-working under lockdown varies amongst groups. Knowledge of these differences provide employers with tools to better manage employee wellbeing during periods of crisis. While personal factors are not controllable, the quality of leadership provided to employees, and the place and pattern of work, can be actively managed to positive effect.

Few studies have evaluated the effects of crawling on physical joints and velocity, especially in children. Based on motion capture technology, this study proposes a novel method of using wearable sensors to collect exposure (e.g., mean duration, frequency) on childrens joints to objectively quantify the impacts of different locomotion methods on physical characteristics. An on-site experiment was conducted in a kindergarten with 28 children (13 boys and 15 girls) of different ages (4C6 years old) who traveled up to 22 m in three different postures: upright walking (UW), stoop walking (SW), and knee and hand crawling (KHC). The results showed that: (1) The level of joint fatigue for KHC was heavier than bipedal walking (p < 0.05), which was evidenced by higher mean duration and frequency. There was no significant difference between UW and SW (p > 0.05). (2) The physical characteristics of the children in the different postures observed in this study were different (p < 0.05). The ankle was more fatigued than other joints during bipedal walking. Unlike infants, the wrists and hips of the children became fatigued while crawling. The key actions flexion/extension are more likely to induce joint fatigue vs. other actions. (3) Crawling velocity was significantly slower than the bipedal velocities, and UW was 10.6% faster than SW (p < 0.05). The bipedal walking velocity started to decrease after the children had travelled up to 13 m, while the KHC velocity started to decrease after traveling up to 11.6 m. (4) In a severe fire, the adoption of SW is suggested, as the evacuees can both evacuate quickly and avoid overworking their joints. (5) There were no significant differences in the age (p > 0.05) and gender (p > 0.05) of the children on the joints in any of the three postures. To conclude, KHC causes more damage to body joints compared to bipedal walking, as evidenced by higher exposure (mean duration, frequency), whereas UW and SW are similar in terms of the level of joint fatigue. The above findings are expected to provide a useful reference for future applications in the childrens risk assessment and in the prevention design of buildings.","output":"An Ergonomic Assessment of Different Postures and Children Risk during Evacuations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Publisher Summary This chapter provides an introduction to the book that focus on environmental microbiology.

To determine whether the QTQTN motif is critical to SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis, we generated a mutant deleting the QTQTN motif (QTQTN). Here we report that the QTQTN deletion attenuates viral replication in respiratory cells in vitro and attenuates disease in vivo. The deletion results in a shortened, more rigid peptide loop that contains the FCS, and is less accessible to host proteases, such as TMPRSS2. Thus, the deletion reduced the efficiency of spike processing and attenuates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, the QTQTN motif also contains residues that are glycosylated4, and disruption its glycosylation also attenuates virus replication in a TMPRSS2-dependent manner. Together, our results reveal that three aspects of the S1/S2 cleavage site C the FCS, loop length, and glycosylation C are required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis.","output":"QTQTN motif upstream of the furin-cleavage site plays key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous Michigan prisons emerged as national hotspots early in the coronavirus crisis.

We investigated the effect of this deletion on the clinical features of infection. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients who had been screened for the ?382 variant and recruited to the PROTECT studya prospective observational cohort study conducted at seven public hospitals in Singapore. We collected clinical, laboratory, and radiological data from patients' electronic medical records and serial blood and respiratory samples taken during hospitalisation and after discharge. Individuals infected with the ?382 variant were compared with those infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Exact logistic regression was used to examine the association between the infection groups and the development of hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen (an indicator of severe COVID-19, the primary endpoint). Follow-up for the study's primary endpoint is completed. FINDINGS: Between Jan 22 and March 21, 2020, 278 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened for the ?382 deletion and 131 were enrolled onto the study, of whom 92 (70%) were infected with the wild-type virus, ten (8%) had a mix of wild-type and ?382-variant viruses, and 29 (22%) had only the ?382 variant. Development of hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen was less frequent in the ?382 variant group (0 [0%] of 29 patients) than in the wild-type only group (26 [28%] of 92; absolute difference 28% [95% CI 14C28]).

Examining structural connections between brain regions involved in executive functioning may advance our understanding of sex biases in stress and depression. Here, we examined the role of the cingulum bundle in differentiating trajectories of depressive symptoms in males and females across adolescence and during the pandemic. Methods In a longitudinal study of 214 youth (121 females;ages 9C13 years at baseline), we examined whether fixel\\\\based properties of the cingulum bundle at baseline predict changes in females' and males' severity of depressive symptoms across four timepoints (4C7 years) in adolescence, including during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. We also tested whether cingulum properties predict self\\\\reported resilience and stress during the pandemic. Results Females had lower fiber density and cross\\\\section (FDC) of the cingulum than did males, a neural pattern that predicted greater increases in depressive symptoms, lower resilience, and higher stress during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Cingulum morphometry predicted changes in depressive trajectories in females, but not in males;specifically, females with lower FDC had significant increases in symptoms throughout adolescence, whereas females with higher cingulum FDC did not. Conversely, males had low, stable depressive symptoms throughout adolescence and higher resilience and lower stress during the pandemic compared to females. Higher cingulum FDC predicted higher resilience and lower stress in both sexes. Conclusions In adults, the cingulum has been implicated in sex differences in stress reactivity. We show that in adolescents, the cingulum reflects sex differences in reports of stress and resilience that might contribute to the increased risk of stress\\\\related mood disorders in females. Adolescent females might benefit from cognitive interventions that strengthen the structural properties of the cingulum and increase their perceived resilience during periods of adversity and disruption. We examined the role of the cingulum bundle in predicting males and females changes in depressive symptom severity across four timepoints of adolescence, including during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Compared to males, cingulum fiber density and cross\\\\section (FDC) was lower in females;this lower pattern of FDC in females predicted increases in depressive symptoms across adolescence, as well as lower resilience and higher stress during the pandemic. The cingulum may be an important marker of sex differences in stress sensitivity and vulnerability for depression during adolescence.","output":"Sex\\\\specific vulnerability to depressive symptoms across adolescence and during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: The role of the cingulum bundle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) applies positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and has been shown to reduce the need for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation in very low birth weight infants with respiratory distress syndrome. However, CPAP failure rates of 50% are reported in large randomized controlled trials. A possible explanation for these failure rates is the application of insufficient low levels of PEEP during nasal CPAP treatment to maintain adequate functional residual capacity shortly after birth. The optimum PEEP level to treat symptoms of respiratory distress in very low birth weight infants has not been assessed in clinical studies. The aim of the study is to compare two different PEEP levels during nasal CPAP treatment in preterm infants. METHODS: In this randomized multicenter trial, 216 preterm infants born at 26 + 0C29 + 6 gestational weeks will be allocated to receive a higher (6C8 cmH(2)O) or a lower (3C5 cmH(2)O) PEEP during neonatal resuscitation and the first 120 h of life. The PEEP level within each group will be titrated throughout the intervention based on the FiO(2) (fraction of inspired oxygen concentration) requirements to keep oxygenation within the target range. The primary outcome is defined as the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation for > 1 h or being not ventilated but reaching one of the two pre-defined CPAP failure criteria (FiO(2) > 0.5 for > 1 h or pCO(2)  70 mmHg in two consecutive blood gas analyses at least 2 h apart). DISCUSSION: Based on available data from the literature, the optimum level of PEEP that most effectively treats respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants is unknown, since the majority of large clinical trials applied a wide range of PEEP levels (4C8 cmH(2)O). The rationale for our study hypothesis is that the early application of a higher PEEP level will more effectively counteract the collapsing properties of the immature and surfactant-deficient lungs and that the level of inspired oxygen may serve as a surrogate marker to guide PEEP titration. Finding the optimum noninvasive continuous distending pressure during early nasal CPAP is required to improve CPAP efficacy and as a consequence to reduce the exposure to ventilator-induced lung injury and the incidence of chronic lung disease in this vulnerable population of very preterm infants.

OBJECTIVE This scoping review sought to identify studies that describe variation in individual hospitalist performance and to code this data to the domains of the STEEEP framework. METHODS Via a systematic search of peer-reviewed literature that assessed the performance of individual hospitalists in the Medline database, we identified studies that described measurement of individual hospitalist performance. Forty-two studies were included in the final review and coded into one or more domains of the STEEEP framework. RESULTS Studies in the Safe domain focused on transitions of care, both at discharge and within the hospital. Many studies were coded to more than one domain, especially Timely, Effective, and Efficient. Examples include adherence to evidence-based guidelines or Choosing Wisely recommendations. The Patient Centered domain was most frequently coded, but approaches were heterogeneous. No included studies addressed the domain Equitable. CONCLUSIONS Applying the STEEEP framework to the published literature on assessment of individual hospitalist performance revealed strengths and weaknesses. Areas of strength were assessments of transitions of care and application of consensus guidelines. Other areas, such as equity and some components of safe practice, need development. All domains would benefit from more practical approaches.

Any individual, however, reflects the sum of their life experiences. Therefore, this medicalization approach can miss key factors in determining health outcomes including social determinants of health. Just as importantly, this approach can miss issues of values, beliefs, and assumptions that older adults can bring into the encounter with service providers. This issue is especially important when dealing with older migrant communities.

BACKGROUND Many models of wireless pulse oximeters in the present market do not offer possibility of calibration and, therefore, they do not ensure patients' safety in daily clinical practice. DESIGN This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study. The sample of patients (140) was selected from such hospital units, and all of them had to fulfil inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation. METHODS The instruments used to carry out this research were a monitor (calibrated), two models of portable wireless pulse oximeters (used for 3 years by the nursing staff, without being calibrated), a tympanic thermometer and a weather meter. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was used to establish the concordance, whereas the Landis-Koch criteria were used to interpret the results. RESULTS The concordance among the three devices was considered as \\"good\\" (CCC: 0.925 and 0.974 (95%)).

Objectives The objective of the present work is to present the epidemiological variations in the production of fractures in the period of mandatory confinement in our reference population. Methods Analytical retrospective comparative study of two groups of patients: Group A: patients admitted before the state of alarm that forced confinement in the period from January 13 to March 13 compared to Group B: patients admitted in the two months of confinement, until the de-escalation period began, March 13-May 13. Epidemiological variables including age, personal history, type of fracture, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, and hospital stay were recorded. Results A total of 190 patients were included. 112 in the pre-confinement period and 78 in the confinement (30% decrease). The mean age (p = 0.007) and falls at home (p < 0.001) were higher in the confinement group. The postoperative (p = 0.006) and overall (p < 0.001) hospital stay were significantly less in the confinement group. No differences were found in the anatomical location of the lesion, sex, comorbidities, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, or death. Conclusions Based on the results of our study, the period of forced confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic has produced a drastic decrease in the total number of fractures admitted to the traumatology service of a third level hospital.

METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in five databases. Randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials of interventions (non-RCTs) for the surgical or non-surgical treatment of patients with traumatic or atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears were included. The review protocol was published in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42018100343). RESULTS Ten studies (three RCTs with 332 participants; seven non-RCTs with 650 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One year after treatment, shoulder function, measured with the 100-point Constant score, had improved by 6.7 points (95% confidence interval [2.3; 11.0]) and pain, measured with the 10-cm visual analog scale, by 1.1 cm (0.5; 1.7] in the full-thickness rotator cuff tears treated surgically compared with non-surgical treatment. In one study the difference in favor of surgery persisted after 10 years' follow-up. For other outcomes, such as range of motion, muscle strength, quality of life, and adverse events, the data were sparse and the group differences were similar. The findings of the non-RCTs were comparable with those of the RCTs. CONCLUSION With regard to functional improvement and pain reduction, surgical treatment of full-thickness rotator cuff tears was superior to non-surgical treatment in the short and the long term. Whether the differences between the groups are relevant for individual cases is uncertain, as the measured results were distributed below and above the threshold of clinical relevance.

We aimed to investigate the mental health status of the public during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and explore the level and related factors of anxiety and depression. METHODS: From February 8 to March 9, 2020, 3,180 public completed the Zungs Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for anxiety, Zungs Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, the ConnorCDavidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) for psychological resilience, and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) for the attitudes and coping styles. RESULTS: The number of people with depressive symptoms (SDS > 53) was 1,303 (the rate was 41.0%). The number of people with anxiety symptoms (SAS > 50) was 1,184 (the rate was 37.2%). The depressed group and anxiety group had less education, more unmarried and younger age, as well as had significant different in SDS total score (P < 0.001), SAS total score (P < 0.001), CD-RISC total score (P < 0.001), and SCSQ score (P < 0.001). The binary logistic regression showed that female (B = -0.261, P = 0.026), strength (B = -0.079, P = 0.000), and the subscales of active coping style in SCSQ (B = -0.983, P = 0.000) remained protective factors and passive coping style (B = 0.293, P = 0.003) and higher SAS score (B = 0.175, P = 0.000) were risk factors for depression.

METHODS: Adult patients with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 30, 2020, were included. LI was defined as peak levels of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase that were 3 times the ULN or peak levels in alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin that were 2 times the ULN. Mild elevation in liver enzymes (MEL) was defined as abnormal peak liver enzyme levels lower than the threshold for LI. Patients with MEL and LI were compared to a control group comprising patients with normal liver enzymes throughout hospitalization.

Although apparently a narrow issue, studying these extreme economies turns out to be quite illuminating in understanding the fundamentals of price level determination. It is also relevant in evaluating the broader claims that advocates of the fiscal theory of the price level have made. In Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983, 1986) we show that in pure fiat money models with rational expectations, where the government gives no backing whatsoever to currency, there is in fact no reasonable way to rule out speculative hyperinflations where the value of money goes to zero, even if the money supply itself is exogenous and constant. Such perverse equilibria are ruled out, however, if the government provides even a very small real backing to the currency C a fiscal mechanism, but one that comes into play only as a backstop. Indeed that backing does not have to be certain. Cochrane (2011, 2019), however, argues that this result is wrong, and that fractional currency backing is a Maginot line that is insufficient to rule out hyperinflation. We show here why, in fact, his analysis involves a subtle change in model specification that adds a distinct monetary fragility to our model.

However, the incidence of VTE after discharge and whether postdischarge thromboprophylaxis is beneficial and safe are unclear. In this prospective observational single-center study, we report the incidence of VTE 6 weeks after hospitalization and the use of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. METHODS Patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were invited to a multidisciplinary follow-up clinic 6 weeks after discharge. D-dimer and C-reactive protein were measured, and all patients were screened for deep vein thrombosis with venous duplex-ultrasound. Additionally, selected high-risk patients received computed tomography pulmonary angiogram or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan to screen for incidental pulmonary embolism. RESULTS Of 485 consecutive patients hospitalized from March through June 2020, 146 patients were analyzed, of which 39% had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Postdischarge thromboprophylaxis was prescribed in 28% of patients, but was used more frequently after ICU stay (61%) and in patients with higher maximal D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels during hospitalization. Six weeks after discharge, elevated D-dimer values were present in 32% of ward and 42% of ICU patients. Only one asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (0.7%) and one symptomatic pulmonary embolism (0.7%) were diagnosed with systematic screening. No bleedings were reported.

The high transmission rate of the virus demands the rapid identification of infected patients to reduce the spread of the disease. The current gold-standard test, Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), suffers from a high rate of false negatives. Diagnosis from CT-scan images as an alternative with higher accuracy and sensitivity has the challenge of distinguishing COVID-19 from other lung diseases which demand expert radiologists. In peak times, artificial intelligence (AI) based diagnostic systems can help radiologists to accelerate the process of diagnosis, increase the accuracy, and understand the severity of the disease. We designed an interpretable deep neural network to distinguish healthy people, patients with COVID-19, and patients with other lung diseases from chest CT-scan images. Our model also detects the infected areas of the lung and is able to calculate the percentage of the infected volume. We preprocessed the images to eliminate the batch effect related to CT-scan devices and medical centers and then adopted a weakly supervised method to train the model without having any label for infected parts and any tags for the slices of the CT-scan images that had signs of disease. We trained and evaluated the model on a large dataset of 3359 CT-scan images from 6 medical centers. The model reached a sensitivity of 97.75% and a specificity of 87% in separating healthy people from the diseased and a sensitivity of 98.15% and a specificity of 81.03% in distinguishing COVID-19 from other diseases.

As seen within the emerging literature in relation to COVID-19 and education from across the globe, this study indicates the variability of experience across children of different ages and different demographic groups, e.g. socio-economic status, maternal education. Lessons to be learned from this exceptional period for potential future restrictions are discussed.

In these models, the effect of climate and community behavior change on the reproductive number is modeled. A baseline scenario is also defined as letting the epidemic grow naturally, with no prevention/control interventions. Different levels of intervention are also defined based on the extent of population isolation. Outcomes of each scenario on the number of infected cases are computed. Modeling results shows that if effective isolation occurs in 10% of the population, 307,000 individuals will be infected with COVID-19 in Iran by May 20, 2020. For an isolation rate of 25%, started since March 10, 2020, cumulative number of deaths will be 13,450 individuals by May 20, 2020. If preventive efforts can reach a 32% effective isolation rate, a considerable decrease in the number of new cases would be expected during April and May, and the total number of deaths would decrease to 8,630. If the isolation rate increases to 40%, the total number of infected individuals is expected to be 6,030 individuals. It should be acknowledged that this model predicts the number of deaths of all COVID-19 cases, including those who will not be confirmed as COVID-19, because of non-testing or death prior to COVID-19 identification. This serious health issue requires both long-term and short-term planning and arrangements. Social distancing, and identification and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases are believed to be the most important and effective control measure, and should be strengthened soon.

Methods: We created a derivation rule and a validation rule for ICU admission using data from a national registry of a cohort of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted between March and August 2020 (N = 16,298). We analyzed the available demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory variables recorded at hospital admission. We evaluated the performance of the risk score by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Using the  coefficients of the regression model, we developed a score (0 to 100 points) associated with ICU admission. Results: The mean age of the patients was 67 years; 57% were men. A total of 1,420 (8.7%) patients were admitted to the ICU. The variables independently associated with ICU admission were age, dyspnea, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and presence of diffuse infiltrates on a chest X-ray. The model showed an AUROC of 0.780 (CI: 0.763-0.797) in the derivation cohort and an AUROC of 0.734 (CI: 0.708-0.761) in the validation cohort. A score of greater than 75 points was associated with a more than 30% probability of ICU admission while a score of less than 50 points reduced the likelihood of ICU admission to 15%. Conclusion: A simple prediction score was a useful tool for forecasting the probability of ICU admission with a high degree of precision.","output":"Derivacin y validacin de una puntuacin de riesgo de ingreso en la unidad de cuidados intensivos para pacientes con COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Public Health England has identified that in COVID-19, death rates among ethnic minorities far exceeds that of the white population. While the increase in ethnic minorities is likely to be multifactorial, to date, no studies have looked to see whether values for routine clinical biochemistry parameters differ between ethnic minority and white individuals. METHODS: Baseline biochemical data for 22 common tests from 311 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients presenting to hospital in April 2020 in whom ethnicity data were available was retrospectively collected and evaluated. Data comparisons between ethnic minority and white groups were made for all patient data and for the subset of patients subsequently admitted to intensive care. RESULTS: When all patient data were considered, the ethnic minority population had statistically significant higher concentrations of C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, while troponin T was higher in the white group. A greater proportion of ethnic minority patients were subsequently admitted to intensive care, but when the presenting biochemistry of this subset of patients was compared, no significant differences were observed between ethnic minority and white groups. CONCLUSION: Our data show for the first time that routine biochemistry at hospital presentation in COVID-19 differs between ethnic minority and white groups. Among the markers identified, CRP was significantly higher in the ethnic minority group pointing towards an increased tendency for severe inflammation in this group.","output":"Biochemical abnormalities in COVID-19: a comparison of white versus ethnic minority populations in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has affected more than 3 million patients globally. Previous data from Wuhan city showed that acute kidney injury (AKI), proteinuria and hematuria occurred frequently in patients with severe COVID-19. However, the prevalence of kidney injury in milder cases remains unclear. METHODS: This retrospective study included two major consecutive cohorts of COVID-19 patients in Sichuan Province. Baseline characteristics, laboratory data including renal function, proteinuria and dipstick hematuria, and other laboratory parameters were collected. A subgroup of patients was followed up for 2C4 weeks to evaluate the short-term outcome of renal impairment. RESULTS: Overall, 168 COVID-19-positive patients were included in the study. The majority of patients (79.7%) were diagnosed with mild or moderate disease. Half of patients presented with fever; however, in The Tibetan cohort, fever only occurred in 13.4% of patients. On hospital admission, proteinuria and dipstick hematuria were noted in 18.4% and 17.4% of patients, respectively, while AKI only occurred in one patient. Further analysis showed that severe or critical COVID-19 was associated with higher risk of proteinuria [relative risk (RR) 7.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.45C22.18, P = 3.8  10(?4)] and dipstick hematuria (RR 8.30, 95% CI 2.69C25.56, P = 2.3  10(?4)). Proteinuria, dipstick hematuria, or the combination of proteinuria and hematuria could significantly predict severe or critical severe COVID-19.

Because COVID-19 infection is associated with a devastating mortality rate and myriad complications, it is critical that clinicians better understand its pathophysiology to develop effective treatment. Cumulative evidence is suggestive of cerebral aneurysms being intertwined with the hyperinflammatory state and hypercytokinemia observed in severe COVID-19 infections. CASE DESCRIPTION: In case example 1, the patient presents with chills, a mild cough, and sore throat. The patient develops high-grade fever of 39.8 C, decreased oxygen saturation of 93% on room air, and an extensive spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the basal cisterns from a ruptured left posterior communicating artery aneurysm. In case example 2, the patient presents with a positive PCR test for COVID-19 2 weeks prior with spontaneous SAH and found to have a large multilobulated bulbous ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. Both patients symptoms and high-grade fever are consistent with hypercytokinemia and a hyperinflammatory state, with elevated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, M1P1A, and tumor necrosis factor- inflammatory mediators found to be elevated in COVID-19 intensive care unit admissions. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 effect on cerebral aneurysms requires future studies to clearly delineate correlation, however, hypercytokinemia and a hyperinflammatory state are strongly implicated to cause degenerative vascular changes that may predispose patients to cerebral aneurysm formation, change in size or morphology, and resultant aneurysm rupture.","output":"Ruptured cerebral aneurysms in COVID-19 patients: A review of literature with case examples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the arrival of the novel coronavirus, recommendations for public masking have emerged to decrease infection rates. For a variety of reasons, tolerating wearing a mask is challenging for many individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). Therefore, we evaluated behavioral strategies to promote compliance with wearing a mask with six hospitalized individuals diagnosed with IDDs. One participant was compliant with wearing the mask for extended durations during baseline while engaging in various activities (e.g., academics, leisure). For the other five individuals, engagement in activities alone was ineffective. Blocking mask removal, reinforcement for mask wearing, and noncontingent access to preferred activities or competing stimuli were then evaluated using a changing-criterion design in which the duration participants were required to tolerate the mask gradually increased. Increases in compliance with mask wearing were achieved with all participants; however, the terminal duration was attained for only four of the five individuals.

Consequently, alternative therapies for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) prevention, such as vitamin D supplementation, while hypothetically promising, require substantial evidence from countries affected by COVID-19. The present retrospective case-control study aims to identify differences in vitamin D status and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients screened for SARS-CoV-2, and determine associations of vitamin D levels with increased COVID-19 risk and mortality. METHODS: A total of 222 [SARS-CoV-2 (+) N = 150 (97 males; 53 females); SARS-CoV-2 (-) N = 72 (38 males, 34 females)] out of 550 hospitalized adult patients screened for SARS-CoV-2 and admitted at King Saud University Medical City-King Khalid University Hospital (KSUMC-KKUH) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from May-July 2020 were included. Clinical, radiologic and serologic data, including 25(OH)D levels were analyzed. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l) was present in 75% of all patients. Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower among SARS-CoV-2 (+) than SARS-CoV-2 (-) patients after adjusting for age, sex and body mass index (BMI) (35.8  1.5 nmol/l vs. 42.5  3.0 nmol/l; p = 0.037). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that significant predictors for SARS-CoV-2 include age > 60 years and pre-existing conditions (p < 0.05). Statistically significant predictors for mortality adjusted for covariates include male sex [Odds ratio, OR 3.3 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.2-9.2); p = 0.02], chronic kidney disease [OR 3.5 (95% CI 1.4-8.7); p = 0.008] and severe 25(OH)D deficiency (< 12.5 nmol/l), but at borderline significance [OR 4.9 (95% CI (0.9-25.8); p = 0.06].

METHODS: Four main search engines were used to identify potential studies which included: (1) Google Scholar, (2) ScienceDirect, (3) PubMed, and (4) Cochrane. Studies in English and published from 2010 to 2020 were considered. Studies on efficacy were limited to those in unseeded hospital environments, examining environmental disinfection, and with true experimental, randomized controlled trial, or quasi-experimental study designs. No additional criterion was used for safety studies due to the scarcity of literature. In the end, a total of 17 studies were selected. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Risk of bias assessment and manual data extraction and tabulation were done. RESULTS: Twelve eligible efficacy studies were identified together with five safety studies. It was found that UV-C irradiation had positive results when used as an adjunct for existing cleaning protocols. The germicidal effect of UV-C is potent against microorganisms including viruses, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Safety study results showed dermal effects of UV-C exposure including DNA lesions, formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in cells, and effects on the skins stratum corneum. CONCLUSION: It was found that UV-C can be utilized as an adjunct to terminal manual cleaning because of its efficacy as a germicidal agent. Further studies must still be done to exact a standard for safe exposure dose, especially for 222 nm germicidal lamps.

By contrast, the pandemic that killed the greatest numbers in world history-the Influenza of 1918-20 - was a pandemic of compassion. No one has yet to uncover this pandemic sparking collective violence or blaming any minorities for spreading the disease anywhere in the globe. The essay then explores the variety of charitable reactions and abnegation that cut across social divisions in communities from theatres of war in Europe to nations thousands of miles from the direct military encounters. Most remarkable, however, was the overflowing volunteerism of women, especially in the US, Canada, and Australia. To explain this widespread charitable reaction, the essay investigates the milieu of the First World War, showing how that context in domestic war settings was not conducive to risking life to aid total strangers, especially when those strangers came from different foreign countries classes, races, or religious faiths.

Here we describe four possible alternative future policy responses: (1) restoration of the previous economy, (2) removal of obstacles to economic growth, (3) green recovery and (4) transformative economic reconstruction. Each alternative offers opportunities and risks for conservation. They differ in the agents they emphasize to mobilize change (e.g. markets or states) and in the extent to which they prioritize or downplay the protection of nature. We analyse the advantages and disadvantages of these four options from a conservation perspective.

The study explores challenges that the leaders faced and how they dealt with them to remain standing despite their fears. The context is COVID-19 pandemic, which brought mass deaths, fear, confusion and frustration to congregations globally. Church leaders faced a challenge to show resilience amid fear because they too were directly affected. Governments introduced regulations that imposed lockdowns to control the spread of the virus. Limiting contact by restricting distance amongst citizens. The church was one sector that could not operate. Although some sectors were never declared essential services like churches, this left vulnerable communities without support in the face of fear. Spiritual leaders had to demonstrate resilience to support the congregants. The key question the researchers seek to understand is to what extent did the church remain resilient during COVID-19 pandemic? And how did the church leaders deal with fear despite anointing and expectations from the congregants and communities? A qualitative approach was used in this study. COVID-19 has shown that Church leaders are humans and they are also fearful, however their faith in God has assisted them to show resilience even at this difficult time. The study also asserts that governments should consult different groupings of faith-based organisations, not only those that are under organised bodies before embarking on restrictions for pandemic control.

As interactions between metaboreceptors and chemoreceptors have been previously observed, the purpose of this study was to isolate the metaboreflex while acutely stimulating or inhibiting the CC to determine whether the metaboreflex increased CC activity/sensitivity. Fourteen young healthy men (height: 177.0  2.1 cm, weight: 85.8  5.5 kg, age: 24.6  1.1 yr) performed three trials of 40% maximal voluntary contraction handgrip for 2 min, followed by 3 min of postexercise circulatory occlusion (PECO) to stimulate the metaboreflex. In random order, subjects either breathed room air, hypoxia (target SPo2 = 85%), or hyperoxia (FiO2 = 1.0) during the PECO to modulate the chemoreflex. After these trials, a resting hypoxia trial was conducted without handgrip or PECO. Ventilation (Ve), heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and muscle sympathetic nervous activity (MSNA) data were continuously obtained. Relative to normoxic PECO, inhibition of the CC during hyperoxic PECO resulted in lower MSNA (P = 0.038) and HR (P = 0.021). Relative to normoxic PECO, stimulation of the CC during hypoxic PECO resulted in higher HR (P < 0.001) and Ve (P < 0.001). The ventilatory and MSNA responses to hypoxic PECO were not greater than the sum of the responses to hypoxia and PECO individually, indicating that the CC are not sensitized during metaboreflex activation.

METHODS: The Learning Implementation of Guideline-based decision support system for Hypertension Treatment (LIGHT) trial is a pragmatic, four-stage, cluster-randomized trial conducted in 94 primary care sites in China. For each city-based stage, sites are randomly assigned to either implementation of the CDSS for hypertension management (which guides doctors treatment recommendations based on measured blood pressure and patient characteristics), or usual care. Patients are enrolled during the first 3 months after site randomization and followed for 9 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of hypertension management visits at which guideline-based treatment is provided. In a nested trial conducted within the CDSS, with the patient as the unit of randomization, the LIGHT-ACD trial, patients are randomized to receive different initial mono- or dual-antihypertensive therapy. The primary outcome of the LIGHT-ACD trial is the changes in blood pressure.

The severity of COVID-19 is highly variable and related to known (e.g., age, obesity, immune deficiency) and unknown risk factors. Since innate and adaptive immune responses are elicited in COVID-19 patients, we genotyped 94 Florida patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 89 healthy controls. We identified an HLA gene, HLA-DPA1, in which specific alleles were associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 disease.

It may result in withdrawal from sexual engagement, decreased work productivity, psychosocial problems including poor self-esteem and depression, and reduction in quality of life for both the affected men and their female partners. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of erectile dysfunction and associated factors among hypertensive patients attending governmental health institutions in Gondar city, Northwest Ethiopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 423 hypertensive men randomly selected using a systematic random sampling technique. Erectile dysfunction was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 tool. Sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors were also collected using pretested interviewer-administered questionnaires. Data were entered into EpiData version 4.6 and analyzed using Stata-14. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with erectile dysfunction. The level of significance was computed at a p value  0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants was 58.84  13.52 years. The prevalence of erectile dysfunction among hypertensive men was 46.34% (95% CI: 41.61, 51.12). About 28% of them had a mild form of erectile dysfunction while nearly 6% had severe forms. Age above 60 years (AOR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.62, 6.55), stage II hypertension (AOR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.63, 5.74), hypertension duration >10 years (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI:1.12, 4.19), comorbidity (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.15), depression (AOR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.31, 4.21), and being physically active (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.83) were factors significantly associated with erectile dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of the study participants had some form of erectile dysfunction, indicating the presence of a high burden of the problem.

Studies which reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with Covid-19 of any age were included. Data on clinical characteristics were independently extracted by two review authors. Study design specific critical appraisal tools were used to evaluate included studies: the Newcastle Ottawa scale for cohort and cross sectional studies, Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for case series and the Cochrane collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. RESULTS: The search yielded 78 studies presenting data on 77,443 people. Most studies (82%) were conducted in China. No studies included patients from low- and middle-income countries.

The whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the TLR7 gene could be implicated in the virus's pathogenesis since the virus includes ssRNA patterns that could bind to TLR7. AIM: The purpose of this study was to look into the function of the TLR7 (rs3853839) C/G polymorphism and the expression of TLR7 mRNA transcript in the development, severity and progression of COVID-19. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A case-control study included 285 participants who were divided into two groups: 150 middle-aged people with COVID 19 who had no previous co-morbidities and 135 healthy volunteers who served as controls. TaqMan test was used to genotype the TLR7 (rs3853839) C/G polymorphism, and real-time PCR was used to determine the relative expression of its mRNA transcript. The level of IL-6 in serum was determined using the ELISA method as an indicator of cytokine storm and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: The GG genotype was shown to be much more common in COVID-19 patients (38.7%) than controls (4.4%), with an OR of 19.86 (95% CI: 7.85; 50.22) and was linked to disease severity and poor clinical outcomes (hospitalization, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation). As a result, the G allele was considerably higher in cases (57.0%), while the C allele was significantly higher in controls (p = 0.001). The GG genotype was found to be substantially more common in patients who were severely/critically unwell. TLR7 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (2.44  0.89) than in controls (1.06  0.46) (p = 0.001). TLR7 mRNA levels were highest in COVID 19 patients with the GG genotype (rs3853839). Patients with the GG genotype had considerably lower WBC counts, but significantly higher serum ferritin, CRP, IL-6 and D dimer levels (P = 0.045, 0.001, 0.023, 0.033, 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The GG form of the TLR7 SNP (rs3853839) could be a genetic risk factor for COVID-19 infection, severe illness and poor clinical outcome. TLR7 mRNA expression was also elevated in COVID-19 patients who were severely/critically unwell and had a bad outcome, suggesting that they could be used as COVID-19 prognostic biomarkers.","output":"COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, clinical outcome and Toll-like receptor (7) mRNA expression driven by TLR7 gene polymorphism (rs3853839) in middle-aged individuals without previous comorbidities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the launch of the Knowledge-Based Bioeconomy by the European Commission in 2005 bioeconomy has developed from a research-oriented strategy towards a political model in more than 60 countries.

Despite its wide prevalence, knowledge of endometriosis symptoms, such as pelvic pain, and treatments remains relatively low. This not only leads to a trivialization of symptoms and delayed diagnosis but also fuels myths and misconceptions about pain symptoms. At the same time, the use of web-based platforms for information seeking is particularly common among people with conditions that are perceived as stigmatizing and difficult to discuss. The Sex, Pain, and Endometriosis website is an educational resource designed to provide evidence-based information on endometriosis and sexual pain to help people understand the condition, feel empowered, dispel myths, and destigmatize endometriosis-associated sexual pain. OBJECTIVE: The study objective is to evaluate the usability of the website and assess for destigmatizing properties of sexual healthCrelated web-based resources. METHODS: We conducted a usability analysis by using a think-aloud observation, a postsystem usability questionnaire, and follow-up interviews with 12 women with endometriosis. The think-aloud data were analyzed using the framework by Kushniruk and Patel for analyzing usability video data, the questionnaire data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the follow-up interviews were analyzed using simple content analysis. We conducted a usability assessment by deductively analyzing the interview data via a trauma-informed care framework and a content analysis approach. RESULTS: Through usability analysis, we found the website to be simple, uncluttered, satisfying, and easy to use. However, 30 minor usability problems related to navigation; website response; the comprehension of graphics, icons, and tabs; the understanding of content; and mismatch between the website and users expectations were reported. In our stigma analysis, we found the web content to be nonstigmatizing. The participants suggested ways in which websites could be designed to address stigma, including ensuring privacy, anonymity, inclusiveness, and factual and nonjudgmental content, as well as providing opportunities for web-based engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the participants found the website to be useful, easy to use, and satisfying. The usability problems identified were largely minor and informed the website redesign process. In the context of the limited literature on stigma and website design, this paper offers useful strategies on how sexual healthCrelated websites can be designed to be acceptable and less stigmatizing to individuals with sensitive health issues.","output":"Developing an Educational Website for Women With Endometriosis-Associated Dyspareunia: Usability and Stigma Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sickle cell disease is a major concern of public health significance in Africa.

Muscle loss is associated with a poor prognosis of the disease. The exact mechanism of muscle damage in COVID-19 patients, as well as the long-term consequences of muscle injury in disease survivors, are unclear. The current review briefly summarizes the literature for mechanisms, assessment measures, and interventions relevant to skeletal muscle insult in COVID-19 patients. Muscle injury is likely to be attributed to the cytokine storm, disease severity, malnutrition, prolonged physical inactivity during intensive care unit (ICU) stays, mechanical ventilation, and myotoxic drugs (e.g., dexamethasone). It has been assessed by imaging and non-imaging techniques (e.g., CT and electromyography), physical performance tests (e.g., six-minute walk test), anthropometric measures (e.g., calf circumference), and biomarkers of muscle dystrophy (e.g., creatine kinase). Interventions directed toward minimizing muscle loss among COVID-19 patients are lacking. However, limited evidence shows that respiratory rehabilitation improves respiratory function, muscle strength, quality of life, and anxiety symptoms in recovering older COVID-19 patients. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation may restore muscle condition in ICU-admitted patients, albeit empirical evidence is needed. Given the contribution of malnutrition to disease severity and muscle damage, providing proper nutritional management for emaciated patients may be one of the key issues to achieve a better prognosis and prevent the after-effects of the disease.

We studied the relationship between anti-spike ectodomain (ECD), anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG titers, and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization (VN) titers generated by two in vitro assays using convalescent plasma samples from 68 COVID-19 patients. We report a strong positive correlation between both plasma anti-RBD and anti-ECD IgG titers and in vitro VN titer. The probability of a VN titer 160, the FDA-recommended level for convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment, was 80% when anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers were 1:1350. Of all donors, 37% lacked VN titers 160. Dyspnea, hospitalization, and disease severity were significantly associated with higher VN titer. Frequent donation of convalescent plasma did not significantly decrease VN or IgG titers. Analysis of 2,814 asymptomatic adults found 73 individuals with anti-ECD IgG titers of 1:50 and strong positive correlation with anti-RBD and VN titers. Fourteen of these individuals had VN titers 1:160, all of which had anti-RBD titer 1:1350. We conclude that anti-RBD or anti-ECD IgG titers can serve as a surrogate for VN titers to identify suitable plasma donors.

Multiple parameters, including the molecular weight, relative concentration, polarity, and solubility, affect the physicochemical properties of the polymer blend. Here, molecular dynamics simulations with the united-atom 2016H66 force field are used to model the behavior of PLGA and PEG chains and thus predict the overall physicochemical features of the resulting blend. First, the model accuracy is validated against fundamental properties of pure PLGA and PEG samples. In agreement with previous experimental and theoretical observations, the PLGA solubility results to be higher in acetonitrile than in water, with Flory parameters ACN = 0.63  0.01 and W = 0.21  0.02, and the Young's modulus of PLGA and PEG equal to Y = 2.0  0.43 and 0.32  0.34 GPa, respectively. Next, four PEG/PLGA blending regimes are identified by varying the relative concentrations and molecular weights of the individual polymers. The computational results demonstrate that at low PEG concentrations (<8% w/w), homogeneous blends are generated for both low and high PEG molecular weights. In contrast, at comparable PEG and PLGA concentrations (50% w/w), short PEG chains are only partially miscible whereas long PEG chains segregate within the PLGA matrix. This behavior has been confirmed experimentally via differential scanning calorimetry and is in agreement with previous observations. Finally, the computed Young's modulus of PLGA/PEG blends is observed to decrease with the PEG content returning the lowest values for the partial and fully segregated regimens (Y  1.3 GPa). This work proposes a computational scheme for predicting the physicochemical properties of PLGA/PEG blends paving the way toward the rational design of polymer mixtures for biomedical applications.","output":"Predicting the Miscibility and Rigidity of Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/Polyethylene Glycol Blends via Molecular Dynamics Simulations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many educational institutions have adopted e-learning methods during the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain school teaching activities.

This pandemic has had a significant impact on patients with chronic diseases. Among patients with demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), concerns remain about the potential impact of COVID-19 on these patients given their treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. In this study, we review the existing literature investigating the impact of disease-modifying therapies(DMT) on COVID-19 risks in this group of patients. METHOD: For this systematic review, we searched PubMed from January 1, 2020, to December 3, 2020. The following keywords were used: \\"COVID-19\\" AND \\"Multiple Sclerosis\\" OR \\"Neuromyelitis Optica.\\" Articles evaluating COVID-19 in patients with demyelinating diseases of CNS were included. This study evaluates the different aspects of the DMTs in these patients during the COVID-19 era. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 262 articles were found. After eliminating duplicates and unrelated research papers, a total of 84 articles met the final inclusion criteria in our study. Overall, the experiences of 2493 MS patients and 37 NMOSD patients with COVID-19 were included in this review. Among them, 46(1.8%) MS patients died(the global death-to-case ratio of Covid-19 was reported about 2.1%). Among DMTs, Rituximab had the highest mortality rate (4%). Despite controversies, especially concerning anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapies, a relation between DMT-use and COVID-19 disease- course was not found in many studies. This observation reinforces the recommendation of not stopping current DMTs. Other variables such as age, higher expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores, cardiac comorbidities, and obesity were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. Despite the risks of infection, most patients were willing to continue their DMT during the pandemic because of more significant concern about the risk of relapse or worsening MS symptoms. After the infection, an immune response's attenuation was seen in the patients on Fingolimod and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. This may be a critical finding in future vaccinations.","output":"COVID-19 and disease-modifying therapies in patients with demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a Bayesian dialogue two individuals report their Bayesian updated belief about a certain event back and forth, at each step taking into account the additional information contained in the updated belief announced by the other at the previous step.

Certainly, if two individuals have diverging interests, truthfully reporting ones Bayesian updated belief at every step might not be optimal. This observation could lead to the intuition that always truthfully reporting ones Bayesian updated belief were the best that two individuals could do if they had perfectly coinciding interests and these were in line with coming to know the truth.

Baseline chest CT scan was performed in all patients. CT-based automated and semi-automated lung segmentation was performed using the Alma Medical workstation to calculate normal lung volume, lung opacities volume, total lung volume, and RLV. The primary end point of the study was mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS Overall, 84 men (61%) and 54 women (39%) with a mean age of 47.3 years (14.3 y) were included in the study. Overall mortality rate was 21% (29 patients) at a median time of 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 11 d). Univariate analysis demonstrated that age, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with death (P<0.01). Similarly, patients who died had lower normal lung volume and RLV than patients who survived (P<0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low RLV was the only independent predictor of death (odds ratio, 1.042; 95% confidence interval, 10.2-10.65). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that a RLV 64% significantly increased the risk of death (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-11.7).

Hyperglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose 5.6 mmol/L or hemoglobin A1c 5.7% (39 mmol/mol). The Youden index was used to identify the optimal cut-offs from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Further ROC analysis and multivariable log binomial regression were used to compare standard and data-derived cut-offs. RESULTS The prevalence of hyperglycemia was 58.9% (95% CI 54.7% to 63.0%). In women, optimal BMI and WC cut-offs (27 kg/m2 and 87 cm, respectively) performed similarly to standard cut-offs.

The database was searched with the terms migrants, migrant workers, COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown, migrant population, mental health issues, psychosocial issues to retrieve the published literature. Results: Initially, 48 research articles were retrieved and 10 of them were excluded as they had no sufficient information about mental and psychosocial challenges faced by the migrants. In the remaining 38 articles, 9 articles were original research work (n = 9) published from India related to the impact of COVID-19 on migrants. The second category consisted of editorials or commentary or letters to the editor or policy paper on psychosocial and mental health aspects of migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 17).

For those suffering from social anxiety, social distancing coincides with a tendency to avoid social interactions. We used this natural experiment imposed by a COVID-19 lockdown to examine how mandated low social exposure influenced socially anxious university students, and compared their anxiety to that of socially anxious students in preceding academic years with no social distancing. METHODS: Ninety-nine socially anxious students were assessed for social anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters. Students from the 2019C2020 academic year (which included a lockdown followed by social distancing measures at the end of the fall semester) were compared to students from preceding years (2016C2019) on social anxiety levels. RESULTS: Whereas social anxiety decreased in socially anxious students from the fall to the spring semester in the years preceding the pandemic, during the 2019C2020 academic year social anxiety levels remained high and unchanged. These results held when controlling for depressive symptoms and when analyzing social anxiety items that cannot be confounded with COVID-19-related anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that reduced exposure to social situations may play a role in the maintenance of social anxiety.

Medication nonadherence compromises patient clinical outcomes and patient safety as well as leading to an increase in unnecessary direct and indirect medical costs. Therefore, early identification of non-adherence by healthcare professionals using medication adherence scales should help in preventing poor clinical outcomes among patients with chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension. Unfortunately, there are very few validated medication adherence assessment scales in Arabic. Thus, the aim of this study was to validate a newly translated Arabic version of the Self-Efficacy for Appropriate Medication Use Scale (SEAMS) among patients with chronic diseases. Methods: In this single-center cross-sectional study that was conducted between March 2019 and March 2021 at the primary care clinics of King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the English version of SEAMS was translated to Arabic using the forwardCbackward method and piloted among 22 adults (18 yrs.) with chronic diseases. The reliability of the newly translated scale was examined using the testCretest and Cronbachs alpha methods. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine the construct validity of the Arabic version of SEAMS. Results: The number of patients who consented to participate and filled out the questionnaire was 202. Most of the participants were males (69.9%), aged 50 years (65.2%), and had diabetes (96.53%). The 13-item Arabic-translated SEAMS mean score was 32.37  5.31, and the scale showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha = 0.886) and reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.98). Total variance of the 13-item Arabic-SEAMS could be explained by two factors as confirmed by the factor analysis. Conclusion: The Arabic version of SEAMS should help in detecting poor self-efficacy for medication adherence among Arabic-speaking patient populations with chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension.

Latinx immigrants, in particular, face significant barriers to SARS-CoV-2 testing, including lack of insurance, language barriers, stigma, work conflicts, and limited transportation. METHODS In response to a disproportionately high SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate among Latinxs at the Johns Hopkins Health System, investigators implemented free community-based testing by partnering with religious leaders and leveraging the skill of trusted community health workers. Data were extracted from the electronic health record and a Research Electronic Data Capture database. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was evaluated per event stratified by race/ethnicity. Total rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and categorical patient characteristics were compared between groups using chi-square tests. RESULTS Between June 25, 2020 and October 15, 2020, a total of 1,786 patients (57.5% Latinx, 31.2% non-Hispanic White, 5.9% non-Hispanic Black, and 5.3% non-Hispanic other) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in 18 testing events. Among them, 355 (19.9%) tested positive. The positivity rate was 31.5% for Latinxs, 7.6% for non-Hispanic Blacks, 3.4% for non-Hispanic Whites, and 5.3% for patients of other races/ethnicities. Compared with Latinxs who tested negative, Latinxs who tested positive were more likely to report Spanish as their preferred language (91.6% vs 81.7%, p<0.001), be younger (30.4 vs 33.4 years, p<0.008), and have a larger household size (4.8 vs 4.3 members, p<0.002). CONCLUSIONS Community-based testing identified high levels of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission among primarily Latinxs with limited English proficiency.

P.1 has been linked to increased infectivity, higher mortality, and immune evasion, leading to reinfections and potentially reduced efficacy of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. METHODS: The samples of 276 patients from the State of Amazonas were sent to a central referral laboratory for sequencing by gold standard techniques, through Illumina MiSeq platform. Both global and regional phylogenetic analyses of the successfully sequenced genomes were conducted through maximum likelihood method. Multiple alignments were obtained including previously obtained unique human SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The evolutionary histories of spike and non-structural proteins from ORF1a of northern genomes were described and their molecular evolution was analyzed for detection of positive (FUBAR, FEL, and MEME) and negative (FEL and SLAC) selective pressures. To further evaluate the possible pathways of evolution leading to the emergence of P.1, we performed specific analysis for copy-choice recombination events. A global phylogenomic analysis with subsampled P.1 and B.1.1.28 genomes was applied to evaluate the relationship among samples. RESULTS: Forty-four samples from the State of Amazonas were successfully sequenced and confirmed as P.1 (Gamma) lineage. In addition to previously described P.1 characteristic mutations, we find evidence of continuous diversification of SARS-CoV-2, as rare and previously unseen P.1 mutations were detected in spike and non-structural protein from ORF1a. No evidence of recombination was found. Several sites were demonstrated to be under positive and negative selection, with various mutations identified mostly in P.1 lineage. According to the Pango assignment, phylogenomic analyses indicate all samples as belonging to the P.1 lineage. CONCLUSION: P.1 has shown continuous evolution after its emergence. The lack of clear evidence for recombination and the positive selection demonstrated for several sites suggest that this lineage emergence resulted mainly from strong evolutionary forces and progressive accumulation of a favorable signature set of mutations.","output":"Comparative Genomics and Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 P.1 (Gamma) Variant of Concern From Amazonas, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is highly contagious.

Conversely, the role of obesity as a factor influencing the demand for soft drinks remains largely unexplored. However, understanding potential changes in the demand for soft drinks, as a result of changes in the spread of obesity, may be useful to better design a comprehensive strategy to curb soft drink consumption. In this paper, we aim to answer the following research question: Does the prevalence of obesity affect the demand for soft drinks? For this purpose, we collected data in a sample of 97 countries worldwide for the period 2005-2019. To deal with problems of reverse causality, an instrumental variable approach and a two-stage least squares method were used to estimate the impact of the age-standardized obesity rate on the market demand for soft drinks. After controlling for several demographic and socio-economic confounding factors, we found that a one percent increase in the prevalence of obesity increases the consumption of soft drinks and carbonated soft drinks by about 2.37 and 1.11 L per person/year, respectively. Our findings corroborate the idea that the development of an obesogenic food environment is a self-sustaining process, in which obesity and unhealthy lifestyles reinforce each other, and further support the need for an integrated approach to curb soft drink consumption by combining sugar taxes with bans, regulations, and nutrition education programs.","output":"Does the Prevalence of Obesity Affect the Demand for Soft Drinks?

We calculate the basic reproduction number, which is independent of human mobility, and we prove the global stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria of the model. Furthermore, the study shows that the behavior that all travelers travel along the SNN may hinder the spread of disease if the SNN is not connected. However, the behavior that individuals travel along the metapopulation network coupled with its SNN contributes to the spread of disease. Thus for an emerging infectious disease, if the real network and its SNN keep the same connectivity, indirect transportations may be a potential threat and need to be controlled.

METHODS: This study involved a retrospective case notes review of patients referred to a single specialist paediatric centre with suspected PIMS-TS, with a focus on clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, treatment, and outcome in the context of an MDT framework. RESULTS: Nineteen children of median age 9.1 years fulfilled the definition of PIMS-TS and were managed within an MDT framework: 5/19 were female; 14/19 were of Black, Asian or minority ethnicity; 9/19 also fulfilled diagnostic criteria for complete or incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD).

Theological education in Malawi, Sub-Saharan Africa, has not been spared in experiencing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study argues that the effectiveness of theological education in Africa contributes towards the future of Christianity on the continent, because it serves as a foundation for a vibrant missional church. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided opportunities for creativity and innovation which could ensure the survival and sustainability of theological education in Africa. It is therefore crucial to critically reflect on how the provision of theological education in Malawi in particular, and in Sub-Saharan Africa, in general, can be sustained during the uncertain and challenging times when the COVID-19 pandemic is devastating the African continent and the entire world. This article investigated the challenges and opportunities for theological education in Malawi in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In view of this, the following five objectives emerged: (1) to evaluate the Malawi governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic;(2) to discuss the history and importance of theological education in Africa;(3) to examine the challenges of theological education in Malawi in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;and (4) to assess the prospects of theological education in Malawi in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative research methodology was used, namely a literature review and interviews with members of the faculty of theological institutions in Malawi. Six main findings were established: First, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented both challenges and opportunities for theological education in Africa. Second, the effectiveness of theological education in Africa has contributed towards the future of Christianity on the continent. Third, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the dominant models of theological education in Africa. This entails a shift from face-to-face teaching to online teaching and learning. Fourth, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided opportunities for the sustainability of theological education in Africa. Fifth, theological education has encountered misleading theologies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixth, theological education has the opportunity of constructing life-giving theologies in Africa.

Given limited resources and the significant economic, public health and operational challenges of the current 14-day quarantine recommendation, it is vital to understand if more efficient but equally effective quarantine and testing strategies can be deployed. To this end, we developed a mathematical model to quantify the probability of post-quarantine transmission that varied across a range of possible quarantine durations, timings of molecular testing, and entry uniformly across infection time course or entry as a traced contact. Assuming cases entering quarantine uniformly across infection time course and a one-day delay for testing and, we found that a 13-day quarantine with testing on entry, a seven-day quarantine with testing on exit, and a seven-day quarantine with testing on both entry and exit each provide equivalent or lower probability of post-quarantine transmission compared to a 14-day quarantine with no testing. We found that testing on exit from quarantine is more effective in reducing probability of post-quarantine transmission than testing upon entry. When conducting a single test, testing on exit was most effective for quarantines lasting up to six days. For longer quarantines, the optimal test day was day five or day six. These results differed by no more than one day for cases entering quarantine as traced contacts. Optimal timing of testing during quarantine will reduce the probability of post-quarantine transmission, as false-positive results become less likely, enabling case isolation. Based on 4,040 SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR tests, an exit test 96 hours after the start of quarantine for an offshore oil rig population was demonstrated to identify all known asymptomatic cases that previously tested negative at entry, andmoreoversuccessfully prevented an expected nine offshore transmission events, each a serious concern for initiating rapid spread and a disabling outbreak in the close quarters of an offshore rig.

Using COVID-19 clinical specimens, we have collected evidence that the RT-qPCR assay can feasibly be performed directly on patient sample material in virus transport medium (VTM) without an RNA extraction step, while still producing sensitive test results. If RNA extraction steps can be omitted without significantly affecting clinical sensitivity, the turn-around time of COVID-19 tests, and the backlog we currently experience can be reduced drastically. Furthermore, our data suggest that rapid RT-PCR can be implemented for sensitive and specific molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 in locations where sophisticated laboratory instruments are not available. Our USD 300 set up achieved rapid RT-PCR using thin-walled PCR tubes and a water bath setup using sous vide immersion heaters, a Raspberry Pi computer, and a single servo motor that can process up to 96 samples at a time. Using COVID-19 positive clinical specimens, we demonstrated that RT-PCR assays can be performed in as little as 12 min using untreated samples, heat-inactivated samples, or extracted RNA templates with our low-cost water bath setup. These findings can help rapid COVID-19 testing to become more accessible and attainable across the globe.","output":"A Rapid SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay for Low Resource Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we use an effective word embedding model (word2vec) to systematically track vaccine hesitancy and logistical challenges associated with the Covid-19 vaccines, in the USA. To that effect, we use news articles from reputed media sources and create dictionaries to estimate different aspects of vaccine hesitancy and logistical challenges. Using machine learning and natural language processing techniques, we have developed (i) three sub-dictionaries that indicate vaccine hesitancy, and (ii) another dictionary for logistical challenges associated with vaccine production and distribution. Vaccine hesitancy dictionaries capture three aspects: (a) general vaccine related concerns, mistrusts, skepticisms, and hesitancy, (b) discussions on symptoms and side-effects, and (c) discussions on vaccine related physical effects. The dictionary on logistical challenges includes the words and phrases related to the production, storage, and distribution of vaccines. Our results show that over time, as vaccine developers complete different phase trials and get approval for their respective vaccines, the number of vaccine related news articles increases sharply. Accordingly, we also see a sharp increase in vaccine hesitancy related topics in news articles. However, in January 2021, there has been a decrease in the vaccine hesitancy score, which will give some relief to the health administrators and regulators. Our findings further show that as we get closer to the breakthrough of effective Covid-19 vaccines, new logistical challenges continue to rise, even in recent months.","output":"Tracking COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and logistical challenges: A machine learning approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To demonstrate the feasibility and potential utility of high-resolution angioscopy during common endovascular interventions. METHODS A 3.7-F scanning fiber angioscope was used in 6 Yorkshire pigs to image branch vessel selection, subintimal dissection, wire snaring, and stent placement. The angioscope was introduced in a coaxial fashion within a standard 6-F guide catheter. A clear field of view was provided using continuous heparinized saline flush through the outer guide catheter. The flush flow rate was manually adjusted to provide clear imaging depending on the diameter of the vessel and local blood flow conditions. RESULTS The scanning fiber angioscope was compatible with off-the-shelf catheters and devices commonly used in peripheral and aortic interventions. Video-rate, high-resolution images were obtained during all the interventions tested and provided information that was complementary to simultaneously acquired fluoroscopy. The scanning fiber angioscope was able to detect subintimal dissection and branch vessel stent coverage with higher resolution than fluoroscopy alone. CONCLUSION Endoluminal imaging with the scanning fiber angioscope is feasible with current endovascular devices and provides additional relevant information that cannot be assessed fluoroscopically. The scanning fiber angioscope represents a novel optical platform on which new endovascular techniques may be developed that will minimize radiation and contrast doses for patients.","output":"High-Resolution Scanning Fiber Angioscopy as an Adjuvant to Fluoroscopy During Endovascular Interventions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Access to palliative care for marginalized communities is frequently problematized as a major challenge facing palliative care services. The traditional response of asking what services can do for the disadvantaged has been invigorated by a new wave of public health measures that embrace death and dying as social processes and ask, what can be done together with such communities as partners working in palliative care. Such work has generated a significant amount of academic, social and political interests over the last 20 years; however, we are yet to see a consistent and sustained change in approach from providers. We argue that this is due to inherent tensions that arise when modelling death, dying and loss as a unified and shared social process. Unresolved tensions destabilize the theoretical foundations and risk misrepresentation of core philosophies. In this integrative review of 75 articles, we present previously undiscussed areas of contention drawing from a pan-disciplinary field of theoretical and empirical evidence. We conclude that new public health approaches lack a consistent and unified theoretical approach. From philosophical, ontological and existential ideas relating to how different stakeholders conceptualize death, to the processes by which communities are motivated and their constituent members empowered through responsibilized notions of duty and reciprocity, there is little acknowledgement of the complex tensions at hand. Increasing academic and political initiative alone is not enough to progress this movement in a manner that achieves its full potential. Instead, we must pay greater attention to the tensions described. This article aims to work with such tensions to better define the landscape of collective moral responsibility in end-of-life care. We believe that this is crucial if palliative care is to avoid becoming a technical speciality with community and communitization reduced to a mere technical solution to more profound questions.","output":"New public health approaches to palliative care, a brave new horizon or an impractical ideal?

DESIGN: Single-center prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care University Hospital. PATIENTS: All adult patients admitted in either the first (from March 15 to May 15, 2020) or second (from October 1 to November 30, 2020) wave of coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. During the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, 33 patients (4.8%) were transferred due to overcrowding and excluded from analysis. There were 341 (first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) and 695 (second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to the hospital, with median age first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic as 68 (57C80) and second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic as 71 (60C80) (p = 0.15), and similar admission severity. For the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic versus second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, 30-day mortality was 74/341 (22%) and 98/662 (15%) (p = 0.007). In the ward, 11/341 (3.2%) and 404/662 (61%) received dexamethasone (p < 0.001); 6/341 (2%) and 79/662 (12%) received high-flow nasal oxygen (p < 0.0001); 2/341 (0.6%) and 88/662 (13.3%) received remdesivir (p < 0.0001); 249/341 (73%) and 0/662 (0%) received hydroxychloroquine (p < 0.0001); and 87/341 (26%) and 128/662 (19%) (p = 0.024) patients were transferred to ICU. On ICU admission, median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment was 6 (3C7) and 4 (3C6) (p = 0.02). High-flow nasal oxygen was given to 16/87 (18%) and 102/128 (80%) (p < 0.001); 69/87 (79%) and 56/128 (44%) received mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001) with durations 17 days (10C26 d) and 10 days (5C17 d) (p = 0.01). Median ICU length of stay was 14 days (5C27 d) and 6 days (3C11 d) (p < 0.001). Finally, 16/87 (18%) and 8/128 (6%) received renal replacement therapy (p = 0.0055); and 64/87 (74%) and 51/128 (40%) needed vasopressor support (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The main therapeutic changes between the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic were use of steroids, unrestrictive use of high-flow nasal oxygen for hypoxemic patients, and transfer of patients to other geographic areas in the case of ICU overcrowding.

Although the skin microbiome is considered important for skin health, the change of the skin microbiome after wearing PPE remain unknown. OBJECTIVE The present study aimed to characterize the diversity and structure of bacterial and fungal flora on skin surfaces of healthcare workers wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). METHODS A total of 10 Chinese volunteers were recruited and the microbiome of their face, hand, and back were analyzed before and after wearing PPE. Moreover, VISIA was used to analyze skin features. RESULTS Results of alpha bacterial diversity showed that there was statistically significant decrease in alpha diversity indice in the skin samples from face, hand, and three sites after wearing PPE as compared with the indice in the skin samples before wearing PPE. Further, the results of evaluated alpha fungal diversity show that there was a statistically significant decrease in alpha diversity indices in the skin samples from hand after wearing PPE as compared with the indices in the skin samples before wearing PPE (P<0.05). Results of the current study found that the main bacteria on the face, hand, and back skin samples before wearing the PPE were Propionibacterium spp. (34.04%), Corynebacterium spp. (13.12%), and Staphylococcus spp. (38.07%). The main bacteria found on the skin samples after wearing the PPE were Staphylococcus spp. (31.23%), Xanthomonas spp. (26.21%), and Cutibacterium spp. (42.59%). The fungal community composition was similar in three skin sites before and after wearing PPE. CONCLUSION It was evident that wearing PPE may affect the skin microbiota, especially bacteria. Therefore, it was evident that the symbiotic microbiota may reflect the skin health of medical workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Effects of wearing personal protective equipment during COVID-19 pandemic on composition and diversity of skin bacteria and fungi of medical workers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in the treatment of COVID-19 are highly debated.

Systematic literature search was carried out in different databases for eligible studies. The pooled relative risks (RRs) were measured using RevMan software where P<0.05 was set as statistical significance. In total, 10 studies were included in this analysis. After pooled estimation, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 positive patients taking ACEIs/ARBs were not associated with an increased risk of mortality compared to those not taking ACEIs/ARBs (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.64-1.23; P=0.48). Furthermore, the risk of composite severe clinical manifestations was not significantly different between the positive patients with or without ACEIs/ARBs users (RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.81-2.04; P=0.28).

Owing to the potential for serious side effects, current treatments have restrictions on their use and there is a need for novel compounds with favorable safety profiles. Trazpiroben (previously TAK-906) is a peripherally selective dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist being developed to treat chronic gastroparesis. Effects of trazpiroben on the central nervous system and pulmonary system in rats and on the cardiovascular system in dogs were assessed. Methods: Functional observational battery and locomotion assessments were conducted in groups of eight female rats receiving 0 (control), 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day oral trazpiroben for 2 days. Assessments were performed at baseline (pre-dosing) and 0.5 hours post-dose on day 2 of dosing. Pulmonary safety: following administration of the same trazpiroben doses, groups of eight male rats underwent heads-out plethysmography at baseline, through 6 hours post-dose, and approximately 24 hours post-dose on day 1. Four telemetry-instrumented male beagle dogs received 0 (control), 1, 10, or 30 mg/kg of oral trazpiroben in a Latin square crossover design on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Relevant parameters were continuously measured for approximately 18 hours post-dose. Results: No clinically meaningful effects on central nervous system, pulmonary, or cardiovascular assessments were observed at any trazpiroben dose. Significantly decreased locomotion occurred with increasing dose, including reduced horizontal/vertical ambulation at  300 mg/kg/day. Small transient decreases in systolic and pulse pressure at 10 mg/kg/day were observed, with compensatory increases in heart rate at 30 mg/kg/day. No trazpiroben-related effects on cardiovascular parameters (including QT interval corrected for heart rate) or body temperature were noted. No trazpiroben-related qualitative electrocardiogram abnormalities were observed. Discussion: Our results suggest that trazpiroben has limited central nervous system effects and a favorable cardiac safety profile.","output":"Non-Clinical Safety Pharmacology Evaluations of Trazpiroben (TAK-906), a Novel Dopamine D2/D3 Selective Receptor Antagonist for the Management of Gastroparesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The effects of amiodarone and lidocaine on the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in relation to time to treatment in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is not known. We conducted a post hoc analysis of the ROC ALPS (Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Amiodarone, Lidocaine, Placebo) randomized controlled trial examining the association of time to treatment (drug or placebo) with ROSC at hospital arrival. Methods and Results In the trial, adults with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with initial refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after at least 1 defibrillation were randomly assigned to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo. We used logistic regression to examine the association of time to treatment (911 call to study drug administration) with ROSC. An interaction term between treatment and time to treatment was included to determine the potential effect of time on treatment effects. Overall, 1112 (36.7%) patients had ROSC at hospital arrival (350 in the amiodarone arm, 396 in the lidocaine arm, and 366 in the placebo arm). The proportion of patients who had ROSC decreased as time to drug administration increased, in patients treated with amiodarone (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90-0.94 per minute increase), lidocaine (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.96), and placebo (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.96). With shorter times to drug administration, the proportion with ROSC was higher in amiodarone versus placebo recipients. Conclusions The probability of ROSC decreased as time to drug administration increased. The effect of amiodarone but not lidocaine to restore ROSC declined with longer times to drug administration, potentially attributable to its adverse hemodynamic effects.","output":"Effect of Time to Treatment With Antiarrhythmic Drugs on Return of Spontaneous Circulation in Shock-Refractory Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Current literature has shown that adult patients with perioperative Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) have increased rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality.

It is a known fact that co-morbidities, including Diabetes Mellitus, pose a higher risk of infection by COVID-19. Additionally, the outcomes following infection are far worse than in people without such co-morbities. Factors contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have long been established, yet this disease still bestows a substantial global burden. The aim was to provide a comprehensive review of the burden of diabetes pre-COVID-19 and the additional impact sustained by the diabetes population and healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, while providing recommendations of how this burden can be subsided. METHODOLOGY: Literature searches were carried out on Google Scholar and PubMed to identify relevant articles for the scope of this review. Information was also collected from reliable sources such as the World Health Organisation and the International Diabetes Federation. RESULTS: T2DM presented with economic, social and health burdens prior to COVID-19 with an significant Disability Adjusted Life Years impact. Whilst people with diabetes are more susceptible to COVID-19, enforcing lockdown regulations set by the Public Health department to reduce risk of infection brought about its own challenges to T2DM management. Through recommendations and adapting to new methods of management such as telehealth, these challenges and potential consequences of mismanagement are kept to a minimum whilst safeguarding the healthcare system.

We aimed to develop and validate a simple bedside prognostic score to predict the risk of hypoxaemia or death. 4035 patients were included in the development cohort and 2046 in the validation cohort. The primary outcome occurred in 961 (23.8%) and 548 (26.8%) patients in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The final model included 12 variables: age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, urea, C-reactive protein, sodium, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. In the validation cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) was 0.907 (95% CI, 0.892-0.922) and the Brier Score was 0.098.

Outpatient visit data were also collected to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on outpatient follow-up visits. RESULTS: A 37% decrease in surgical case volume was observed during the study period. No difference was found in operative mortality between the 2 time periods (3.3% vs. 2.6%, p=0.383). Overall postoperative complications were less frequent during this period, at 23% compared to 38% the previous year (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a dramatic decrease in surgical volume and outpatient medical follow-up. However, the pandemic and its attendant social restrictions did not yield a significant change in the surgical outcomes of our patients. Hence, it is reasonable to continue cardiac surgical care during global health crises, and this can be done with good results.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cardiac Surgery Practice and Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disease manifestations in COVID-19 range from mild to severe illness associated with a dysregulated innate immune response.

After seemingly being in control due to consequent lock-downs and social distancing, the majority of countries faces currently a second wave of exponentially increasing infections, hospital referrals and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2-mediated disease (COVID-19). To date, no effective vaccination has been found, and wearing masks and social distancing are the only effective approaches to reduce further spreading. However, unwillingness in the societies to distance again and consequently wear masks might be reasons for the second SARS-CoV-2 infection wave. User-friendly chemicals interfering at the host site with viral entry might be an approach to contain the pandemic. In addition, such an approach would work synergistic with vaccinations that miss new virus mutants. Nafamostat (NM) has been shown in vitro to interfere with cellular virus entry by inhibition of the host transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), an enzyme required for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein cleavage, a prerequisite for cell entry. We hypothesized that nasal application of NM in a liposomal layer (as additional mechanical barrier) could lower the nasal viral load and subsequently reduce the severity of COVID-19. We found, indeed, that nasal viral load one day post single NM application, was lowered in a hamster SARS-CoV-2 infection model. However, severity of subsequent local tissue destruction and weight loss due to pneumonitis was not favorably altered. In conclusion, a single NM application reduced nasal viral load, but did not favorably improve the outcome of COVID-19, likely due to the short half-time of NM. Improvement of NM stability or repetitive application (which was not permitted in this animal model according to Dutch law) might circumvent these challenges.","output":"Nafamostat Mesylate in lipid carrier for nasal SARS-CoV2 titer reduction in a hamster model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health care workers (HCWs) can acquire infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), from patients.

Evidence for both routes is strong for COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, but aerosol transmission is likely dominant for COVID-19. Key knowledge gaps about transmission processes and control strategies include the distribution of viable virus among respiratory aerosols of different sizes, the mechanisms and efficiency by which virus deposited on the facial mucous membrane moves to infection sites inside the body, and the performance of source controls such as face coverings and aerosol containment devices. To ensure that HCWs are adequately protected from infection, guidelines and regulations must be updated to reflect the evidence that respiratory viruses are transmitted via aerosols.

However, concerns have been raised about the infodemic, which includes the overabundance of online information and the spread of misleading information. Adequate eHealth literacy skills among world citizens have therefore been emphasized as vital during the pandemic. Persons with type 2 diabetes have been at increased risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19 disease. This study aimed to explore online COVID-19 information acquisition experiences among persons with type 2 diabetes and varying eHealth literacy. Fifty-eight participants filled out the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS), along with a qualitative questionnaire with free-text questions. Additionally, 10 participants were interviewed. Thematic analysis was applied to identify patterns in participants experiences. Two domains were identified: perceived challenges with online information about COVID-19, and coping strategies to manage challenges. The perceived challenges were: being exposed to information overload, dealing with conflicting information, and being strongly emotionally affected. The related coping strategies were: protecting oneself, trusting authorities, taking command, and using common sense. These strategies often involved triangulation of the information obtained, including participants consulting their common sense, various sources, or family and friends. This paper highlights the crucial role of authorities in delivering online information, that according to health literacy principles, is easy to access, understand, and use. Furthermore, our results reinforce the importance of diabetes nurses, as well as healthcare professionals in general, in encouraging patients to share their Internet findings, promote information from reliable sources, and deliver tailored information that suits individual needs. Because our results underline the importance of social support in eHealth literacy and the assessment of online health information, the inclusion of family and friends needs to be increasingly considered in diabetes care. Due to the small homogenous sample, the results of this study cannot be generalized. However, the reader can assess the transferability to other situations and settings based on our contextual descriptions.","output":"Experiences of Online COVID-19 Information Acquisition among Persons with Type 2 Diabetes and Varying eHealth Literacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease associated with high mortality, and traditional Chinese medicine decoctions (TCMDs) have been widely used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in China; however, the impact of these decoctions on severe and critical COVID-19-related mortality has not been evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to address this gap. In this retrospective cohort study, we included inpatients diagnosed with severe/critical COVID-19 at the Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University and grouped them depending on the recipience of TCMDs (TCMD and non-TCMD groups). We conducted a propensity score-matched analysis to adjust the imbalanced variables and treatments and used logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Among 282 patients with COVID-19 who were discharged or died, 186 patients (66.0%) received TCMD treatment (TCMD cohort) and 96 (34.0%) did not (non-TCMD cohort). After propensity score matching at a 1:1 ratio, 94 TCMD users were matched to 94 non-users, and there were no significant differences in baseline clinical variables between the two groups of patients. The all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the TCMD group than in the non-TCMD group, and this trend remained valid even after matching (21.3% [20/94] vs. 39.4% [37/94]). Multivariable logistic regression model showed that disease severity (odds ratio: 0.010; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.037; [Formula: see text]? 0.001) was associated with increased odds of death and that TCMD treatment significantly decreased the odds of in-hospital death (odds ratio: 0.115; 95% CI: 0.035, 0.383; [Formula: see text]? 0.001), which was related to the duration of TCMD treatment.

To contextualise these data, we compared mortality related to COVID-19 with all and common causes of death, stratifying by age and sex. We also calculated deaths as a proportion of the population by age and sex. Methods: COVID-19 related mortality and population statistics from seven European countries were extracted: England and Wales, Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Portugal and Netherlands. Available data spanned 14-16 weeks since the first recorded deaths in each country, except Spain, where only comparable stratified data over an 8-week time period was available. The Global Burden of Disease database provided data on all deaths and those from pneumonia, cardiovascular disease combining ischaemic heart disease and stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, road traffic accidents and dementia. Findings: Deaths related to COVID-19, while modest overall, varied considerably by age. Deaths as a percentage of all cause deaths during the time period under study ranged from <0.01% in children in Germany, Portugal and Netherlands, to as high as 41.65% for men aged over 80 years in England and Wales. The percentage of the population who died from COVID-19 was less than 0.2% in every age group under the age of 80.

Cyanobacterial carbohydrates have been discussed as an emerging renewable feedstock in industrial biotechnology for the production of fuels and chemicals, showing promising production rates when compared to crop-based feedstock. However, intrinsic capacities of cyanobacteria to produce biotechnological compounds are limited and yields are low. RESULTS Here, we present an approach to circumvent these problems by employing a synthetic bacterial co-culture for the carbon-neutral production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from CO2. The co-culture consists of two bio-modules: Bio-module I, in which the cyanobacterial strain Synechococcus elongatus cscB fixes CO2, converts it to sucrose, and exports it into the culture supernatant; and bio-module II, where this sugar serves as C-source for Pseudomonas putida cscAB and is converted to PHAs that are accumulated in the cytoplasm. By applying a nitrogen-limited process, we achieved a maximal PHA production rate of 23.8 mg/(L day) and a maximal titer of 156 mg/L. We will discuss the present shortcomings of the process and show the potential for future improvement. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate the feasibility of mixed cultures of S. elongatus cscB and P. putida cscAB for PHA production, making room for the cornucopia of possible products that are described for P. putida. The construction of more efficient sucrose-utilizing P. putida phenotypes and the optimization of process conditions will increase yields and productivities and eventually close the gap in the contemporary process. In the long term, the co-culture may serve as a platform process, in which P. putida is used as a chassis for the implementation of synthetic metabolic pathways for biotechnological production of value-added products.","output":"Photoautotrophic production of polyhydroxyalkanoates in a synthetic mixed culture of Synechococcus elongatus cscB and Pseudomonas putida cscAB."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has initiated a global pandemic and several vaccines have now received emergency use authorization. Using the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, we evaluated modes of transmission and the ability of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity to protect against infection in ferrets. Ferrets were semi-permissive to infection with the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. When transmission was assessed via the detection of vRNA at multiple timepoints, direct contact transmission was efficient to 3/3 and 3/4 contact animals in two respective studies, while respiratory droplet transmission was poor to only 1/4 contact animals. To determine if previously infected ferrets were protected against re-infection, ferrets were re-challenged 28 or 56 days post-infection. Following viral challenge, no infectious virus was recovered in nasal wash samples. In addition, levels of vRNA in the nasal wash were several orders of magnitude lower than during primary infection, and vRNA was rapidly cleared. To determine if intramuscular vaccination protected ferrets, ferrets were vaccinated using a prime-boost strategy with the S-protein receptor-binding domain formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant. Upon viral challenge, none of the mock or vaccinated animals were protected against infection, and there were no significant differences in vRNA or infectious virus titers in the nasal wash. Combined these studies demonstrate that in ferrets direct contact is the predominant mode of transmission of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained for at least 56 days. Our studies also indicate protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 will require vaccine strategies that mimic natural infection or induce site-specific immunity.Importance:The SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain is a CDC reference strain used by multiple research laboratories. Here, we show the predominant mode of transmission of this isolate in ferrets is by direct contact. We further demonstrate ferrets are protected against re-infection for at least 56 days even when levels of neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable. Last, we show that when ferrets were vaccinated by the intramuscular route to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ferrets remain susceptible to infection of the upper respiratory tract. Collectively, these studies suggest protection of the upper respiratory tract will require vaccine approaches that mimic natural infection.","output":"Transmission and protection against re-infection in the ferret model with the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 reference isolate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteopedia (proteopedia.org) is an open resource to explore the structure-function relationship of proteins and other biomolecules.

Methods: We included consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab and patients taking HCQ for SLE. A prolonged QTc was defined as an increase in QTc intervals 60 ms (compared with baseline) or as a QTc of 500 ms. Results: We enrolled 58 COVID19 patients (median age 70.5 years, IQR 25). HCQ, without or with azithromycin, was given to 26 (44.8%) and 15 patients (25.9%), respectively;17 (29.3%) had not received either drug. The median baseline QTc was 432 (IQR 36) and prolonged QTc was observed in 15 (26%) patients (12 QTc500 ms and 3 patients QTc60 ms).

The presence of symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a sense of threat due to the pandemic were assessed using the following screening tests: IES-R by Weiss and Marmar, PHQ-9 by Spitzer et al., and a self-constructed sliding scale for assessing COVID-19 anxiety. The study was carried out on a group of 57 firefighting cadets, hospitalized in a COVID-19 isolation room (M(age) = 23.01), staying in isolation due to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and a control group of 57 healthy men (M(age) = 41.38) staying at home during quarantine and national lockdown.

Inductive analysis produced five themes: (i) nutrition care is preferable to pharmacological intervention; (ii) patients report taking action for behaviour change; (iii) healthcare providers experience barriers to nutrition care; (iv) healthcare providers tend not to refer patients for nutrition care; and (v) there are contradictory findings around provision and receipt of nutrition care. This review has revealed the contradictions between patients' and healthcare providers' knowledge, attitudes and practices around nutrition care for prediabetes. Further research is needed to shed light on how to resolve these disconnects in care and to improve nutrition care practices for people with prediabetes.","output":"Understanding the knowledge, attitudes and practices of providing and receiving nutrition care for prediabetes: an integrative review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pneumothorax has been reported with the use of positive pressure ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia. Literature on spontaneous pneumothorax (PTX) in COVID-19 patients is scant. We present a case series of 7 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, who developed spontaneous pneumothorax without prior mechanical ventilation. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 7 cases was performed from two different hospitals in the US between 4/6/2020C5/15/2020. Hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR who developed spontaneous pneumothorax were included. Collected data included demographics, co-morbidities, inflammatory biomarkers, chest imaging and management strategies. Length of stay, transfer to intensive care unit and death were the assessed outcomes. A descriptive analysis was done. RESULTS: There were 3 patients from Henry Ford Health System, Michigan and 4 patients from Silver Cross Hospital, Illinois. Median age was 75 years and 6 out of 7 (85.7%) were males (Table 1). There were no co-morbidities associated with spontaneous pneumothorax except for one patient with COPD. None of the patients imaging prior to diagnosis of pneumothorax revealed any underlying blebs. Median time from symptom onset to diagnosis of pneumothorax was 17 days. One of the patients had tension pneumothorax, two had bilateral pneumothorax and three had pneumomediastinum (Figure 1). Four patients required chest tube placement, three required escalation to ICU, of which two died. Table 1.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a kind of inflammatory disease with end-stage lung pathological changes. It has complicated and unknown pathogenesis and is still lack of effective therapeutic drugs. LPS-induced inflammation is a common feature of many infectious inflammations such as pneumonia, bacteremia, glomerulonephritis, etc. Evodiamine, one of the main components of Evodia rutaecarpa, is an alkaloid with excellent antiinflammatory effects. In this study, we evaluated the protective capacities of evodiamine on LPS-induced inflammatory damages in vitro and in vivo. MTT method, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and other methods were used for in vitro study to determine the protective capacities of evodiamine. The results suggest that evodiamine can protect murine macrophages from the LPS-nigericin-induced damages by (a) inhibiting cellular apoptosis, (b) inhibiting inflammatory cytokines releasing, and (c) activating the apelin pathway. We also used the exogenous apelin-13 peptide co-cultured with LPS-nigericin in RAW264.7 cells and found that apelin-13 contributes to protecting the effects of evodiamine. In vivo, the ELISA method and immunohistochemistry were used to examine inflammatory cytokines, apelin, and histological changes. BALB/c mice were exposed to LPS and subsequent administration of evodiamine p.o.for some time, the results of the alveolar lavage fluid and the tissue slices showed that evodiamine treatment alleviated the pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, stimulated apelin expression and inhibited the inflammatory cytokines. These results provide a basis for the protective effect and mechanism of evodiamine in LPS-induced inflammation and suggest that it might be potential therapeutics in human pulmonary infections.","output":"Evodiamine alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis by activating apelin pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Replication-competent controlled virus vectors were derived from the virulent herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) wild-type strain 17syn+ by placing one or two replication-essential genes under the stringent control of a gene switch that is coactivated by heat and an antiprogestin. Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wild-type virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectorswhich may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccinesinduced detectable protection against lethality caused by wild-type virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and a second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated, vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific cellular immune responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus, as well as a hemagglutinin-specific cellular immune response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a severalfold enhancement of these immune responses. IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, the necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and by activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above-mentioned hypothesis and suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.","output":"Immunization by Replication-Competent Controlled Herpesvirus Vectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many hospitals face challenges to adapt to the changing environment and persistent diseases and after the emergence of the Corona crisis that caused by an increase in the number of cases of people living with HIV increased the need to accommodate more patients in spaces, which led to the momentum on hospitals to absorb increasing numbers of cases, which led to finding design solutions for the intensive care environment to continuously accommodate people while maintaining the privacy and safety of occupants and staff and increasing the rate of recovery, the goal of this paper is to identify the type of change in care spaces The status associated with the Covid-19 pandemic is the possibility of expanding within Iraqi hospitals and the possibility of providing solutions for its development, The paper has made use of the concept of negative pressurized areas, the flexible module, the entry to the operating department and the connection between the intensive care unit and the staff department with a strong spatial relationship, to increase the possibility of further development. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Evaluation of the Design of Intensive Care Spaces to Confront the Corona Virus - the Study Area, Baghdad City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Congenital intrahepatic bile duct dilatation without fibrosis is called Caroli disease (CD), and is called Caroli syndrome (CS) when it has fibrotic and cirrhotic liver morphology. The development of intrahepatic carcinoma is described in both conditions, but the reported incidence varies extensively. Potential risk factors for the malignant transformation were not described. Furthermore, conservative or surgical treatment is performed depending on the extent of cystic malformation, hepatic dysfunction and structural hepatic changes, but little is known about which treatment should be offered to patients with CD or CS and cancer. AIM To further investigate the malignant transformation in these conditions. METHODS A systematic review of the current literature until January 2019 was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. A search using Medline (PubMed) was performed using a combination of Medical Subject Headings terms \\"caroli disease\\", \\"caroli syndrome\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"malignant\\", and \\"cholangiocarcinoma\\". Only human studies published in English were used for this systematic review. The following parameters were extracted from each article: year of publication, type of study, number of patients, incidence of malignant tumor, duration of symptoms, age, sex, diagnostics, identification of tumor, surgical therapy, survival and tumor recurrence. RESULTS Twelve retrospective studies reporting the courses of 561 patients (53% females) were included in this systematic review. With a mean age of 41.6 years old (range 23 to 56 years old), patients were younger than other populations undergoing liver surgery. Depending on the size of the study population the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma varied from 2.7% to 37.5% with an overall incidence of 6.6%. There were only few detailed reports about preoperative diagnostic work-up, but a multimodal work-up including ultrasound of the liver, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was used in most studies. Disease duration was variable with up to several years. Most patients had episodes of cholangitis, sepsis, fever or abdominal pain. Tumor detection was an incidental finding of the surgical specimen in most cases because it is currently often impossible to detect tumor manifestation during preoperative diagnostics. Liver resection or liver transplantation was performed depending on the extent of the biliary pathology and additional alterations of the liver structure or function. No postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was reported, but chemotherapy was administered in selected cases of tumor recurrence. Overall survival rates after one year were low at 36% and a high recurrence rate of up to 75% during the observation period. CONCLUSION Only few retrospective studies reported a low tumor incidence. Despite the high rate of mortality and tumor recurrence, definite surgical treatment should be offered as soon as possible.","output":"Risk of malignancy in Caroli disease and syndrome: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, there are no proven pharmacologic interventions to reduce the clinical impact and prevent complications of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the cause of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

In 2020 we conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional survey of vaccination records to evaluate pneumococcal vaccination coverage and factors affecting uptake among adults 18C85. We found that nationwide coverage was 4.5% without significant regional differences. Coverage was comparable between men and women and between those aged 18C39 (3.0%) and 40C64 (3.2%). Coverage was significantly higher among those 65C85 (9.6%). While 2.7% of individuals reporting no health predisposition were vaccinated, 14.8% with asthma or chronic pulmonary disease, 27.1% with immunosuppression, 12.9% with diabetes, 11.6% with heart, liver, or kidney disease, and 25.9% with >1 health risk were vaccinated. Adjusted odds of vaccination for all health predispositions except heart, liver, or kidney disease were significantly increased. Among unvaccinated individuals not enough information about the topic and not suggested by a doctor/healthcare provider were the major reasons for abstaining from vaccination. Respondents reporting a health predisposition were significantly less likely to report not at increased risk due to chronic health conditions or age as a reason for not being vaccinated (3.7% vs. 29.1%) and were more likely to report willingness to be vaccinated in the future compared to those not-at-risk (54.2% vs. 39.9%). Our results indicate that pneumococcal vaccination coverage in Switzerland is low among both individuals 65C85 and among those with predisposing health risks.

Yet, we lack a general framework for linking ecological dynamics of infectious disease with underlying molecular and evolutionary change. As a model, we illustrate the linkage between ecological and evolutionary dynamics in rabies virus during its epidemic expansion into eastern and southern Ontario. We characterized the phylogeographic relationships among 83 isolates of fox rabies virus variant using nucleotide sequences from the glycoprotein-encoding glycoprotein gene. The fox rabies virus variant descended as an irregular wave with two arms invading from northern Ontario into southern Ontario over the 1980s and 1990s. Correlations between genetic and geographic distance suggest an isolation by distance population structure for the virus. The divergence among viral lineages since the most recent common ancestor correlates with position along the advancing wave front with more divergent lineages near the origin of the epidemic. Based on divergence from the most recent common ancestor, the regional population can be partitioned into two subpopulations, each corresponding to an arm of the advancing wave. Subpopulation A (southern Ontario) showed reduced isolation by distance relative to subpopulation B (eastern Ontario). The temporal dynamics of subpopulation A suggests that the subregional viral population may have undergone several smaller waves that reduced isolation by distance. The use of integrated approaches, such as the geographical analysis of sequence variants, coupled with information on spatial dynamics will become indispensable aids in understanding patterns of disease emergence.","output":"Unifying the spatial population dynamics and molecular evolution of epidemic rabies virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although prednisolone, granulocyte/monocyte apheresis, calcineurin inhibitor and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy are generally used, no treatment strategy for inflammatory bowel disease complicated with pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) has been established yet.

Airborne pollen monitoring was done following Spanish Aerobiological Network guidelines and dynamics of daily total pollen and six most abundant taxa were studied from June 2018 to June 2020. Among meteorological parameters, temperature and wind were the most correlated and influential parameters to airborne pollen concentration. Annual Pollen Integral (APIn) of Cannabis sativa (r = 0.52), Parthenium hysterophorus (r = 0.27), Poaceae (r = 0.32) and total pollen concentration (r = 0.30) showed a statistically significant positive correlation with temperature. In contrast, precipitation and relative humidity negatively correlated with APIn of total pollen concentration, Eucalyptus sp. and Poaceae except for Parthenium hysterophorus and Celtis occidentalis. Similar results were found with Seasonal Pollen Integral (SPIn) of total pollen concentration, six major taxa and meteorological variables. Spearman correlation performed for NOx showed a significant positive correlation among APIn and SPIn of Celtis occidentalis and insignificant among APIn and SPIn of Eucalyptus sp. and Morus alba. In contrast, except for Eucalyptus sp., PM10 and PM2.5 were negatively correlated among APIn and SPIn of total pollen concentration and other major taxa. Spearman's correlation of APIn and SPIn for each pollen taxon, meteorological parameters and air pollutants suggests that each taxon has a different pattern in response to all parameters.

Most of the critically ill patients received high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking. Methods We retrospectively collected the NCIP patients who received HFNC in two hospital of Chongqing, China from January 1st to February 18th, 2020. The clinical characteristics were collected. Patients who required upgrading to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) were defined as HFNC failure. Results We enrolled 17 patients in this study. Of them, 7 patients (41%) experienced HFNC failure (6 required upgrading to NIV, and one to NIV and further to intubation). The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6), 57% (4/7) and 75% (3/4) (p =0.03 between 3 groups) in patients with PaO2/FiO2 >200, 150-200, and <150 mmHg, respectively. In the successful patients, the respiratory rate, heart rate and PaO2/FiO2 significantly improved from initiation to termination of HFNC (273 vs. 212 breaths/min, p <0.01;8615 vs. 7612 beats/min, p =0.03;and 21349 vs. 299125 mmHg, p =0.04, respectively). However, in the unsuccessful patients, the respiratory rate and PaO2/FiO2 significantly deteriorated (223 vs. 253 breaths/min, p =0.04;and 16027 vs. 10524 mmHg, p =0.01, respectively). When they upgraded to NIV, the PaO2/FiO2 improved after 1-2 h of NIV (10524 vs. 202111 mmHg, p =0.04). In the total cohort, only PaO2/FiO2 at baseline was lower in unsuccessful patients than that in successful ones (21349 vs. 16027 mmHg, p =0.02). Conclusions This study firstly provides the experience of how to use HFNC in patients with NCIP. Patients with lower PaO2/FiO2 were more likely to experience HFNC failure. Among the failure patients, most of them can avoid intubation when they were ungraded to NIV.","output":"The experience of high flow nasal cannula in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirusCinfected pneumonia in Chongqing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sinovac is an inactive vaccine produced against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) for almost a year.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a contemporary picture of the risks from delayed treatment for urologic cancers to assist with triage. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A collaborative review using literature published as of April 2, 2020. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Patients with low-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer are unlikely to suffer from a 3-6-month delay. Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer are at risk of disease progression, with radical cystectomy delays beyond 12 wk from diagnosis or completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Prioritization of these patients for surgery or management with radiochemotherapy is encouraged. Active surveillance should be used for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Treatment of most patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa can be deferred 3-6 mo without change in outcomes. The same may be true for cancers with the highest risk of progression. With radiotherapy, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care. For surgery, although the added value of neoadjuvant ADT is questionable, it may be considered if a patient is interested in such an approach. Intervention may be safely deferred for T1/T2 renal masses, while locally advanced renal tumors (&#8805;T3) should be treated expeditiously. Patients with metastatic renal cancer may consider vascular endothelial growth factor targeted therapy over immunotherapy. Risks for delay in the treatment of upper tract urothelial cancer depend on grade and stage. For patients with high-grade disease, delays of 12 wk in nephroureterectomy are not associated with adverse survival outcomes. Expert guidance recommends expedient local treatment of testis cancer. In penile cancer, adverse outcomes have been observed with delays of &#8805;3 mo before inguinal lymphadenectomy. Limitations include a paucity of data and methodologic variations for many cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and clinicians should consider the oncologic risk of delayed cancer intervention versus the risks of COVID-19 to the patient, treating health care professionals, and the health care system. PATIENT SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to delays in the treatment of patients with urologic malignancies. Based on a review of the literature, patients with high-grade urothelial carcinoma, advanced kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and penile cancer should be prioritized for treatment during these challenging times.","output":"Risks from Deferring Treatment for Genitourinary Cancers: A Collaborative Review to Aid Triage and Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical distancing reduces transmission risks and slows the spread of COVID-19.

Using county-day measures of physical distancing derived from cell phone location data, we demonstrate that the proportion of people who stayed at home after shelter-in-place policies went into effect in March and April 2020 in the United States was significantly lower in counties with a high concentration of science skeptics. These results are robust to controlling for other potential drivers of differential physical distancing, such as political partisanship, income, education and COVID severity.

METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive, mechanically ventilated COVID-19-ARDS patients were compared to two historical ARDS sub-populations 1:1 matched for PaO2/FiO2 or for compliance of the respiratory system. Gas exchange, hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics were recorded at 5 and 15 cmH2O PEEP. CT scan variables were measured at 5 cmH2O PEEP. RESULTS: Anthropometric characteristics were similar in COVID-19-ARDS, PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS and Compliance-matched-ARDS. The PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS and COVID-19-ARDS populations (both with PaO2/FiO2 106  59 mmHg) had different respiratory system compliances (Crs) (39  11 vs 49.9  15.4 ml/cmH2O, p = 0.03). The Compliance-matched-ARDS and COVID-19-ARDS had similar Crs (50.1  15.7 and 49.9  15.4 ml/cmH2O, respectively) but significantly lower PaO2/FiO2 for the same Crs (160  62 vs 106.5  59.6 mmHg, p < 0.001). The three populations had similar lung weights but COVID-19-ARDS had significantly higher lung gas volume (PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS 930  644 ml, COVID-19-ARDS 1670  791 ml and Compliance-matched-ARDS 1301  627 ml, p < 0.05). The venous admixture was significantly related to the non-aerated tissue in PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS and Compliance-matched-ARDS (p < 0.001) but unrelated in COVID-19-ARDS (p = 0.75), suggesting that hypoxemia was not only due to the extent of non-aerated tissue. Increasing PEEP from 5 to 15 cmH2O improved oxygenation in all groups. However, while lung mechanics and dead space improved in PaO2/FiO2-matched-ARDS, suggesting recruitment as primary mechanism, they remained unmodified or worsened in COVID-19-ARDS and Compliance-matched-ARDS, suggesting lower recruitment potential and/or blood flow redistribution. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-ARDS is a subset of ARDS characterized overall by higher compliance and lung gas volume for a given PaO2/FiO2, at least when considered within the timeframe of our study.","output":"Physiological and quantitative CT-scan characterization of COVID-19 and typical ARDS: a matched cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work we study a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model coupled with a continuous opinion dynamics model.

The purpose of this retrospective observational study was to investigate the outcomes of emergency resuscitation after implementation of ICMs. Data were collected for the period 1 January to 4 July in 2003 from a 1732-bed tertiary care hospital in central Taiwan. Non-trauma patients who required emergency resuscitation were classified into two groups: before (period 1), and after (period 2), the date on which strict ICMs were implemented. The analysis variables included demographic data of patients, place of resuscitation, number of participating resuscitators, response time and duration of resuscitation, fever, pneumonia status and results of resuscitation. The response time was unchanged but the number of patient resuscitations without an emergency intubation, rapid sequence intubation or a do not resuscitate order increased from 88 (24.4%), 23 (6.4%) and 16 (4.4%) in period 1 to 103 (33.0%), 32 (10.3%) and 29 (9.3%) in period 2, respectively. The failure rate of resuscitation was significantly higher in period 2 (odds ratio: 1.59, 95% confidence interval: 1.17C2.16). The number of emergency resuscitations in patients with fever or pneumonia was not significantly different between these two periods. In conclusion, strict ICM implementation appeared to play a role in the increased failure rate in emergency resuscitation.

Objectives To examine differences in COVID-19 hospital mortality rates between Black and White patients and to assess whether the mortality rates reflect differences in patient characteristics by race or by the hospitals to which Black and White patients are admitted. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study assessed Medicare beneficiaries admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 to 1188 US hospitals from January 1, 2020, through September 21, 2020. Exposure Hospital admission for a diagnosis of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary composite outcome was inpatient death or discharge to hospice within 30 days of admission. We estimated the association of patient-level characteristics (including age, sex, zip code-level income, comorbidities, admission from a nursing facility, and days since January 1, 2020) with differences in mortality or discharge to hospice among Black and White patients. To examine the association with the hospital itself, we adjusted for the specific hospitals to which patients were admitted. We used simulation modeling to estimate the mortality among Black patients had they instead been admitted to the hospitals where White patients were admitted. Results Of the 44 217 Medicare beneficiaries included in the study, 24 281 (55%) were women; mean (SD) age was 76.3 (10.5) years; 33 459 participants (76%) were White, and 10 758 (24%) were Black. Overall, 2634 (8%) White patients and 1100 (10%) Black patients died as inpatients, and 1670 (5%) White patients and 350 (3%) Black patients were discharged to hospice within 30 days of hospitalization, for a total mortality-equivalent rate of 12.86% for White patients and 13.48% for Black patients. Black patients had similar odds of dying or being discharged to hospice (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.12) in an unadjusted comparison with White patients. After adjustment for clinical and sociodemographic patient characteristics, Black patients were more likely to die or be discharged to hospice (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19). This difference became indistinguishable when adjustment was made for the hospitals where care was delivered (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94-1.10). In simulations, if Black patients in this sample were instead admitted to the same hospitals as White patients in the same distribution, their rate of mortality or discharge to hospice would decline from the observed rate of 13.48% to the simulated rate of 12.23% (95% CI for difference, 1.20%-1.30%). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study found that Black patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had higher rates of hospital mortality or discharge to hospice than White patients after adjustment for the personal characteristics of those patients. However, those differences were explained by differences in the hospitals to which Black and White patients were admitted.","output":"Patient and Hospital Factors Associated With Differences in Mortality Rates Among Black and White US Medicare Beneficiaries Hospitalized With COVID-19 Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In our increasingly interconnected world, the potential for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) to spread globally is of paramount concern. Travel bans-herein defined as the complete restriction of travel from at least one geographic region to at least one other international geographic region-are a potential policy solution to control the global spread of disease. The social, economic, and health-related consequences of travel bans, as well as the available evidence on the effectiveness of travel restrictions in preventing the global spread of influenza, have been previously described. However, the effectiveness of travel bans in reducing the spread of noninfluenza EIDs, characterized by different rates and modes of transmission, is less well understood. This study employs an integrative review approach to summarize the minimal evidence on effectiveness of travel bans to decrease the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Zika virus disease (ZVD). We describe and qualify the evidence presented in six modeling studies that assess the effectiveness of travel bans in controlling these noninfluenza EID events.

We conducted three online surveys between March 2020 and March 2021 to collect longitudinal data on food security, use of food assistance programs, and job disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Food security was measured using the USDA six-item module. Among the 441 respondents, food insecurity rates increased significantly during the pandemic and remained above pre-pandemic levels a year after the start of the pandemic. Nearly a third (31.6%) of respondents experienced food insecurity at some point during the first year of the pandemic, with 53.1% of food-insecure households being classified as newly food-insecure. The odds of experiencing food insecurity during the pandemic varied based on socio-demographic factors.

While access to healthcare is an obvious issue of social justice during the pandemic, language plays a covert role in processes of access and inequality. Linguistic understanding influences social participation and during an epidemic crisis, access to language plays a significant role in improving responses of affected individuals. Although English is widely accepted as a common lingua franca in the country, it excludes those who are not proficient in the language. In this article, we analyse code-switching practices, translanguaging, and increasing African language usage among ministers of parliament during official COVID-19 speeches and briefings. We argue that the growing use of multilingual resources among South African politicians carries ramifications on language politics, i.e. a shift away from an unquestioned monolingual discourse purporting English as the lingua franca which has in the past characterised most national speeches. From this new multilingual perspective, the pandemic has effected an inward orientation rather than the previously dominating concern with international relations.

This systematic review aimed to assess the impacts of school feeding on educational and health outcomes of children and adolescents in LMICs. METHODS: Interventional studies on the effects of school feeding on nutritional and health outcomes of children and adolescents receiving primary or secondary education in LMICs were included. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and grey literature were searched (through December 2019) to identify eligible studies. We included randomized controlled trials and controlled before-after studies on school feeding conducted in LMICs among children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 who received primary or secondary education. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analyses were performed for outcomes available in three or more independent studies. Subgroup analyses were conducted by study design and school feeding modality whenever possible. RESULTS: Fifty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria for the review, including 44 randomized controlled trials and 13 controlled before-after studies; 19 articles were included in the meta-analysis. School feeding resulted in a significant increase in height (mean difference = 0.32 cm; confidence interval (CI) = 0.03, 0.61; P = 0.032) and weight (mean difference: 0.58 kg; 95% 95% CI = 0.22, 0.93; P = 0.001) over 12 months, compared to those in the control groups. School feeding also resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of school days attended (2.6%; 95% CI = 1.2%, 3.9%; P < 0.001).

Thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) is a promising method that can overcome the obstacles encountered during the production of semiconducting devices via conventional approaches by delivering precise dosages of reagent to etch monolayers of substrate surface material in a cyclic operation. However, thermal ALE has not been extensively studied and characterized to become fully embraced by the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Recent work by our group has led to the development of a multiscale computational fluid dynamics modeling framework that was used to optimally design a desirable reactor configuration for the thermal ALE process. Despite this progress, additional research is needed to ensure that the film quality is maintained in the presence of operational disturbances. Therefore, the present work is focused on the development of a multivariable Run-to-Run (R2R) control system to mitigate the impact of critical operational disturbances.

CONCLUSION: In conclusion, antibody responses of recovered patients COVID-19 diagnosed by both CT and qRT-PCR were much robust than the patients diagnosed by either one of the techniques or undiagnosed/disease-free participants suggesting that severity of the disease likely contributes to the antibody responses after vaccination with CoronaVac.","output":"Antibody responses after two doses of CoronaVac of the participants with or without the diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To grasp the complexity of biological processes, the biological knowledge is often translated into schematic diagrams of, for example, signalling and metabolic pathways. These pathway diagrams describe relevant connections between biological entities and incorporate domain knowledge in a visual format making it easier for humans to interpret. Still, these diagrams can be represented in machine readable formats, as done in the KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways databases. However, while humans are good at interpreting the message of the creators of diagrams, algorithms struggle when the diversity in drawing approaches increases. WikiPathways supports multiple drawing styles which need harmonizing to offer semantically enriched access. Particularly challenging, here, are the interactions between the biological entities that underlie the biological causality. These interactions provide information about the biological process (metabolic conversion, inhibition, etc.), the direction, and the participating entities. Availability of the interactions in a semantic and harmonized format is essential for searching the full network of biological interactions. We here study how the graphically-modelled biological knowledge in diagrams can be semantified and harmonized, and exemplify how the resulting data is used to programmatically answer biological questions. We find that we can translate graphically modelled knowledge to a sufficient degree into a semantic model and discuss some of the current limitations. We then use this to show that reproducible notebooks can be used to explore up- and downstream targets of MECP2 and to analyse the sphingolipid metabolism. Our results demonstrate that most of the graphical biological knowledge from WikiPathways is modelled into the semantic layer with the semantic information intact and connectivity information preserved. Being able to evaluate how biological elements affect each other is useful and allows, for example, the identification of up or downstream targets that will have a similar effect when modified.","output":"Understanding signaling and metabolic paths using semantified and harmonized information about biological interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) contains four structural genes that are homologous to genes found in other coronaviruses, and also contains six subgroup-specific open reading frames (ORFs). Expression of one of these subgroup-specific genes, ORF7a, resulted in apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway. Here, we observed that transient expression of ORF7a protein fused with myc or GFP tags at its N or C terminus inhibited cell growth and prevented BrdU incorporation in different cultural cells, suggesting that ORF7a expression may regulate cell cycle progression. Analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that ORF7a expression was associated with blockage of cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase in HEK 293 cells after 24 to 60 h post-transfection. Similar results were observed in COS-7 and Vero cells. Mutation analysis of ORF7a revealed that the domain spanning aa 44C82 of 7a protein was essential for its cytoplasmic localization and for induction of the cell cycle arrest. After analyzing the cellular proteins involving in regulation of cell cycle progression, we demonstrated that ORF7a expression was correlated with a significant reduction of cyclin D3 level of mRNA transcription and expression, and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein at ser795 and ser809/811, not with the expression of cyclin D1, D2, cdk4 and cdk6 in HEK 293 cells. These results suggest that the insufficient expression of cyclin D3 may cause a decreased activity of cyclin D/cdk4/6, resulting in the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation. Accumulation of hypo- or non-phosphorylated pRb thus prevents cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase.","output":"SARS coronavirus 7a protein blocks cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase via the cyclin D3/pRb pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a great threat to peoples lives worldwide.

The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exerted unique physical and emotional demands on healthcare workers, however little is known about the emotional wellbeing of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in resource-restricted settings. This study investigated the prevalence of psychological distress, and sleep problems in healthcare workers in a COVID-19 referral hospital in Nigeria. METHODS: A total of 303 healthcare workers were interviewed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to evaluate psychological distress, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess multidimensional aspects of sleep, including quality, latency, duration, habitual efficiency, disturbances, use of sleeping medications and daytime dysfunction. RESULTS: The participants were mostly males, 183(60.4%) and mean age was 38.8(SD = 8.9) years. Most of the participants were married (70.3%), had spent less than 10 years in service (72.9%), and had no medical comorbidity (92.1%). The prevalence of psychological distress was 23.4%, and six in every ten participants reported sleep problems. The largest proportion of participants reported difficulty in sleep latency (81.5%), duration (71.3%), and daytime dysfunction (69.6%), while approximately one third (32%) each reported using sleep medication, and had difficulty with sleep quality. Psychological distress was inter-related with poor sleep problems (p = 0.001; effect size = 0.2). CONCLUSION: The prevalence rates of psychological distress and sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic were several folds the rates previously reported in similar contexts. Preventative psychosocial support services for healthcare workers are indicated.

However, recent reports have shown that children may also develop the disease and its severe complications. These complications included shock, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and pneumonia in children. A previously healthy 14-month-old boy presented with fever, irritability, and skin rash, besides changes in the lips, conjunctiva, and tongue. His medical history, clinical presentations, treatment, laboratory data, and follow-up information were recorded. He was treated according to the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD). He had a history of close contact with a COVID-19 patient. However, the result of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for COVID-19 was negative. Immunoglobulin M for COVID-19 was positive (1.20), while immunoglobulin G was negative (0.37). Three weeks later, seroconversion of COVID-19 immunoglobulin G (1.42) occurred. Despite treatment with two doses of intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone, coronary artery ectasia was detected. On the sixth day of hospitalization, the patient experienced hypotension, which necessitated treatment with inotropic drugs and resulted in a change of diagnosis to MIS-C. The later echocardiography showed evidence of coronary artery aneurysm (CAA), which finally changed to giant CAA. Although the patient was treated with infliximab, the size of CAA showed a significant decrease in the one-month follow-up.

Massachusetts recognized in 1905, the basis of public health law, and its ability to limit constitutional rights, is the use of scientific data and empirical evidence. Far too often, this important fact is lost. Fear, misinformation, and politics frequently take center stage and drive the implementation of public health law. In the recent Ebola scare, political leaders passed unnecessary and unconstitutional quarantine measures that defied scientific understanding of the disease and caused many to have their rights needlessly constrained. Looking at HIV criminalization and exemptions to childhood vaccine requirements, it becomes clear that the blame cannot be placed on the hysteria that accompanies emergencies. Indeed, these examples merely illustrate an unfortunate array of examples where empirical evidence is ignored in the hopes of quelling paranoia. These policy approaches are not only constitutionally questionable, they generate their own risk to public health. The ability of the law to jeopardize public health approaches to infectious disease control can, and should, be limited through a renewed emphasis on science as the foundation of public health, coordination through all levels and branches of government, and through a serious commitment by the judiciary to provide oversight. Infectious disease creates public anxiety, but this cannot justify unwarranted dogmatic approaches as a response. If we as a society hope to ensure efficient, constitutional control over the spread of disease, it is imperative that science take its rightful place at the forefront of governmental decision-making and judicial review.

The benefits of prescribers including the reason for use on prescriptions is evident in the current literature. However, it is not standard practice to share this information with pharmacists. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to characterize the research on how including the reason for use on a prescription impacts pharmacists. METHODS We performed an interdisciplinary scoping review, searching literature in the fields of health care, informatics, and engineering. The following databases were searched between December 2018 and January 2019: PubMed, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), and EMBASE. RESULTS A total of 3912 potentially relevant articles were identified, with 9 papers meeting the inclusion criteria. The studies used different terminology (eg, indication, reason for use) and a wide variety of study methodologies, including prospective and retrospective observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and qualitative interviews and focus groups. The results suggest that including the reason for use on a prescription can help the pharmacist catch more errors, reduce the need to contact prescribers, support patient counseling, impact communication, and improve patient safety. Reasons that may prevent prescribers from adding the reason for use information are concerns about workflow and patient privacy. CONCLUSIONS More research is needed to understand how the reason for use information should be provided to pharmacists. In the limited literature to date, there is a consensus that the addition of this information to prescriptions benefits patient safety and enables pharmacists to be more effective. Future research should use an implementation science or theory-based approach to improve prescriber buy-in and, consequently, adoption.","output":"Including the Reason for Use on Prescriptions Sent to Pharmacists: Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As rates of new COVID-19 cases decline across Europe due to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing policies and lockdown measures, countries require guidance on how to ease restrictions while minimizing the risk of resurgent outbreaks.

We find that a resurgent continental epidemic could occur as many as 5 weeks earlier when well-connected countries with stringent existing interventions end their interventions prematurely. Further, we found that appropriate coordination can greatly improve the likelihood of eliminating community transmission throughout Europe. In particular, synchronizing intermittent lockdowns across Europe meant half as many lockdown periods were required to end community transmission continent-wide.","output":"Assessing the impact of coordinated COVID-19 exit strategies across Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we have trained several deep convolutional networks with introduced training techniques for classifying X-ray images into three classes: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19, based on two open-source datasets.

STUDY AIMS: (1) identify sociodemographic groups of the adult population at risk of anxiety and depression and (2) determine if the following social and psychological risk factors for poor mental health moderated these direct sociodemographic effects: loneliness, social support, threat perception, illness representations. METHODS: Cross-sectional nationally representative telephone survey in Scotland in June 2020. If available, validated instruments were used, for example, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. RESULTS: A total of 1006 participants; median age 53 years, 61.4% female, from all levels of area deprivation (i.e., 3.8% in the most deprived decile and 15.6% in the most affluent decile). Analyses show associations of anxiety and depression with sociodemographic (age, gender, deprivation), social (social support, loneliness) and psychological factors (perceived threat and illness representations). Mental health was poorer in younger adults, women and people living in the most deprived areas. Age effects were exacerbated by loneliness and illness representations, gender effects by loneliness and illness representations and deprivation effects by loneliness, social support, illness representations and perceived threat. In each case, the moderating variables amplified the detrimental effects of the sociodemographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the results of pre-Covid-19 pandemic studies about associations between sociodemographics and mental health.

However, preventive examinations such as cancer screenings should not be postponed during a pandemic. Because nationally representative studies describing postponed cancer screenings and identifying its determinants in Germany are lacking, our aim was to close this gap in knowledge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the nationally representative online-survey COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring in Germany (COSMO) (wave 17), which was conducted in July 2020. The analytical sample included 974 individuals (mean age was 45.9 years, SD: 16.5 years; 18 to 74 years). The outcome measure was whether cancer screening had been postponed since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic (no, attended as planned; yes, postponed). RESULTS: In total, slightly more than 10% of individuals stated to have postponed cancer screenings between March and July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly women and individuals aged 30 to 49 years. The likelihood of postponed cancer screening was positively associated with higher affect regarding COVID-19 (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.16C2.35), whereas it was negatively associated with younger age (eg, 18 to 29 years, OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.05C0.64, compared to individuals 30 to 49 years). CONCLUSION: Study findings showed that one out of ten individuals postponed cancer screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined two correlates of them (age and affect regarding COVID-19).

Most commonly, host-associated bacteria interfere with host gene expression to modulate the immune response to the infection. However, many of these bacteria also interfere with host cellular differentiation pathways to create a hospitable niche, resulting in the formation of novel cell types, tissues, and organs. In both of these situations, bacterial symbionts must interact with eukaryotic regulatory pathways. Here, we detail what is known about how bacterial symbionts, from pathogens to mutualists, control host cellular differentiation across the central dogma, from epigenetic chromatin modifications, to transcription and mRNA processing, to translation and protein modifications. We identify four main trends from this survey. First, mechanisms for controlling host gene expression appear to evolve from symbionts co-opting cross-talk between host signaling pathways. Second, symbiont regulatory capacity is constrained by the processes that drive reductive genome evolution in host-associated bacteria. Third, the regulatory mechanisms symbionts exhibit correlate with the cost/benefit nature of the association. And, fourth, symbiont mechanisms for interacting with host genetic regulatory elements are not bound by native bacterial capabilities. Using this knowledge, we explore how the ubiquitous intracellular Wolbachia symbiont of arthropods and nematodes may modulate host cellular differentiation to manipulate host reproduction. Our survey of the literature on how infection alters gene expression in Wolbachia and its hosts revealed that, despite their intermediate-sized genomes, different strains appear capable of a wide diversity of regulatory manipulations. Given this and Wolbachia's diversity of phenotypes and eukaryotic-like proteins, we expect that many symbiont-induced host differentiation mechanisms will be discovered in this system.","output":"Trends in Symbiont-Induced Host Cellular Differentiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by Covid-19 has had a huge effect in various parts of the world The global situation of COVID-19 as of January 20th, 2021 were 99 864 391 cases with a death rate of 2 2% with 183 countries infected by local transmission The COVID-19 situation in Indonesia as of January 27th, 2021 were 1 024 298 cases with a death rate of 2 8%, occurred within 182 regions by local transmission Bengkulu Province is one of the areas experiencing local transmission of Covid-19 since March 31st, 2020 and this condition continues to develop This study aimed to determine the regional vulnerability and temporal distribution of Covid-19 in Bengkulu There were 956 confirmed cases of Covid-19 within the period of July-October 2020 The overlay results between clustering analysis and population density were gathered by using the Kernel Density Estimation method and ArcGIS software version 10 3 The area that has a high risk of contracting the Covid-19 disease is Bengkulu City The use of technology-based information systems is indispensable in the digital era, including spatio-temporal analysis, disease and health mapping, geographic dimensions which can be the basis for decision making in an area","output":"ANALYSIS of VULNERABILITY and SPATIO-TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION TOWARD the SEVERITY LEVEL of COVID-19 in BENGKULU, INDONESIA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic is affecting mental health of global population and, particularly, of people suffering from preexisting mental disorders.

RESULTS: The symptom cluster associated with more prolonged RTP (lower chance over 40 days; %) (univariate analysis) was 'excessive fatigue' (75%; p<0.0001), 'chills' (65%; p=0.004), 'fever' (64%; p=0.004), 'headache' (56%; p=0.006), 'altered/loss sense of smell' (51%; p=0.009), 'Chest pain/pressure' (48%; p=0.033), 'difficulty in breathing' (48%; p=0.022) and 'loss of appetite' (47%; p=0.022). 'Excessive fatigue' remained associated with prolonged RTP (p=0.0002) in a multiple model. Compared with ARIOTH, the ARICOV subgroup had more severe disease (greater number, more severe symptoms) and more days to RTP (p=0.0043).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between diabetes and diabetes related cancers in a cohort design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The baseline survey was conducted as a community screening programme from 2007 to 2009 in a population over 30 years of age. Diabetes definition was based on fasting blood glucose level  126 mg/dl and self-reported diabetes history. Data on incident cancer cases and pathological types were obtained from the Izmir Cancer Registry between 2007-2013. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated for the relationship between diabetes and diabetes-related cancer types for men and women separately and adjusted for BMI and age. Odds Ratio and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using logistic regression models in IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0. RESULTS: Data from 10,375 women (65.4%) and 5,494 men (34.6%) who did not declare any cancer in 2007 were evaluated. The cumulative incidence of diabetes related cancers was 2,293 per 100,000 in men and 1,455 per 100,000 in women. Total diabetes related cancer incidence was higher in diabetics (3,770 per 100,000) than nondiabetics (2,109 per 100,000) in men.

In Brazil, the fragile political situation, together with the socioeconomic and ethnic diversity, could result in substantially different IFR estimates. Methods:We infer the IFR in Brazil in 2020 by combining three datasets. We compute the prevalence via the population-based seroprevalence survey EPICOVID19-BR. For the fatalities we obtain the absolute number using the public Painel Coronavrus dataset and the age-relative number using the public SIVEP-Gripe dataset. The time delay between the development of antibodies and subsequent fatality is estimated via the SIVEP-Gripe dataset. We obtain the IFR for each survey stage and 27 federal states. We include the effect of fading IgG antibody levels by marginalizing over the test detectability time window. Results:We infer a country-wide average IFR (maximum posterior and 95% CI) of 1.03% (0.88C1.22%) and age-specific IFR: 0.032% (0.023C0.041%) [< 30 years], 0.22% (0.18C0.27%) [30C49 years], 1.2% (1.0C1.5%) [50C69 years], 3.0% (2.4C3.9%) [[Formula: see text] 70 years]. We find that the fatality ratio in the country increases significantly in the end of June, 2020, likely due to the increased strain in the health system.

Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics under special conditions such as separation policies enforced by governments. Mathematical and computational models, like the compartmental model or the agent-based model, are being used for this purpose. This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID-19, under social distancing policies. INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of a specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogot city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of social distancing policies indicates that it is possible to establish a 'medium' (i.e., close 40% of the places) social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction in the disease transmission.","output":"INFEKTA-An agent-based model for transmission of infectious diseases: The COVID-19 case in Bogot, Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to examine the potential of Lebanese banks to address the economic challenges posed by COVID-19 These banks faced the disturbances of the 2011 Arab Spring, and these two crises have resulted in similar economic conditions, leading to an assessment of how Lebanese banks are dealing with the pandemic-led challenges Exploratory analysis revealed the common features in the two events, and confirmatory analysis examined the hypotheses underlying a theoretical framework Triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data helped to scrutinize the two events Content analysis of data collected from semi-structured interviews with seven senior banking professionals confirms that the Lebanese banking sectors experience gained during the Arab Spring is a valuable asset for bankers, the Banque du Liban (BDL), and the government, which can be used to anticipate and deal with the COVID-driven economic crisis The study finds three key moderating factors: trust deficit, inherited characteristics of the economy, and fiscal and monetary policy Most of these conditions are permanent in nature and require long-term planning As this research was conducted before the catastrophe caused by the August 2020 Beirut explosion, no aspects of the financial consequences to the Lebanese banking sector and economy resulting from this immerse shock are included ?

We investigated the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) for streamlining and enhancing the value of borescope inspection of endoscope working channels. Methods We applied a deep learning AI approach to borescope inspection videos of the working channels of 20 endoscopes in use at our academic institution. We evaluated the sensitivity, accuracy, and reliability of this software for detection of endoscope working channel findings. Results Overall sensitivity for AI-based detection of borescope inspection findings identified by gold standard endoscopist inspection was 91.4 %.

A systematic review and meta-analysis which included various studies across the world showed that the risk of mortality in cancer patients with COVID-19 infection is 21.1% and the risk of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19 appears to be higher in patients with hematological malignancies likely due to immunosuppression induced by both the underlying disease and intensive treatment. The experts suggest individualization of treatment based on the prevalence of COVID-19 infection, available infrastructure and social support. Guidelines are driven by opinion from a clinician's perspective. There is a need to evaluate a patient's preference in the present situation when they are faced with the dual problem of cancer and a potentially life-threatening infection. Purpose of study: To document the patients preferences and perspectives using a structured questionnaire when they are on cancer-directed chemo/immune or targeted therapy or treatment naive in our hospital during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: The primary objective was to determine the proportion of patients who opt to continue on full intensity therapy. The secondary objectives were - to study the factors that lead to treatment discontinuation or dose reduction, to study the level of perceived risk at which patients opt for treatment discontinuation or dose reduction, to study the preferences for treatment continuation in different scenarios (COVID-19 adverse event and different relapse risk) (table 2 and 3) and to understand the difference in preferences for therapy between patients and oncologists/hematologists. Material and methods: This prospective survey was conducted between July 10, 2020 and October 16, 2020. A preconceived standard questionnaire was administered to each patient along with their caregivers (Figure 1). Along with this, we subjected the survey questionnaire separately to the set of medical oncologists/hematologists who were not a part of the patient's treating team and the responses were recorded and studied. Sample Size Assuming that 50% of the patients will continue the full intensity therapy, a sample of 203 will produce a two-sided 90% confidence interval with a precision of 12%. Considering a non-response proportion of 5%, a sample size of 213 was required to achieve primary objective. Results: A total of 200 patients were enrolled in this study with male to female ratio of 1.9:1 and a median age of 42 years (15- 78). Most common hematological malignancy in our study is acute leukemia (29%) followed by CML (23%), NHL (22%), multiple myeloma (16%). Baseline details are represented in Table 1. In this study, 47% patients were willing to receive full intensity chemotherapy (95% CI: 40.4 -54.7). Nature of disease (slow growing vs fast growing) and the intent of treatment (cure vs control of disease) were shown to significantly affect preferences of patients. There was no impact of various socio-economic or logistic factors in their preference for therapy. As high as 50% of the patients were willing to accept only 5% risk of covid 19 related complications to receive full intensity therapy. The acceptable risk of relapse over and above the baseline to receive lesser intensity chemotherapy was 5% for almost 1/3 rd of the patients. If covid related complications are mild, 40% of patients are ready to accept only 1 % risk of relapse to receive lesser intensity chemotherapy. As the risk of covid related complications increases from mild to severe, almost 50% of the patients are ready to accept  20% risk of relapse to receive lesser intensity chemotherapy (table 4). There was a statistically significant disagreement between physician and patient responses at 5%, 20%, 30% and 40% risk of covid related complications to receive full intensity therapy. When we consider the risk of relapse if lesser intensity therapy is opted, patient and physician responses are in good agreement at 1, 5, 10 and 20% risk levels. Conclusion: Almost 50% of patients are willing to opt for reduced intensity therapy because of fear of covid related complications and there is significant disagreement between patient and physician perspectives in certain clinical contexts.

Anaesthesia was induced with propofol, sufentanil and rocuronium. RESULTS A total of 54 patients were included in this study. There was no correlation between BPV and the dose of propofol, sufentanil and rocuronium during anaesthesia induction. Bivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that PWTT (r = -0.54), age (r = 0.34) and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.31) significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV). Only PWTT (r = -0.38) was significantly correlated with diastolic blood pressure variability (DBPV). Patients were stratified into high PWTT and low PWTT groups according to the mean PWTT value (96.8  17.2 ms).

Coagulation disorders in COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury have not been characterized. METHODS We analyzed the data of five COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury who had D-dimer surge (defined as a rapid increase in the D-dimer level in 72 h, from <5-21 g/mL) during hospitalization, which were extracted from a registered retrospective study (ChiCTR2000031301). Clinical data and data on changes in coagulation parameters were collected, verified, and characterized. RESULTS Among these five patients, four had pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. D-dimer surge was accompanied with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and reduced platelet count (PLT) and fibrinogen level. Three patients had an ISTH DIC score of 5 and met the criteria for overt DIC. All five patients needed invasive ventilation support and were incubated 0 to 6 days after the first D-dimer upper reference limit (URL) was reached. All five patients died within 10 days after the first D-dimer URL was reached. All five patients had observed D-dimer URL results 1 to 3 days before death. CONCLUSION D-dimer surge in COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury surely leads to worse in-hospital outcome. D-dimer surge and concomitant DIC can be the leading causes of in-hospital death. Pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases might pose a higher risk for developing these coagulation disorders.

In ATSD, the individual is both the causative actor and casualty. As a result, in ATSD, distinctive negative psychological sequelae are grafted onto the usual distressing symptoms of PTSD, differentiating them from both PTSD and complex-PTSD. Whether the actions were intentional or unintentional and regardless of complications by comorbid psychiatric disorders, individuals with ATSD additionally experience some or all of the following symptoms stemming from actions for which they were responsible, wholly or in part: severe and unrelenting reality-based guilt, shame, remorse, regret, bitterness, self-betrayal, inability to trust oneself, and moral injury. Empirical studies investigating trauma-associated guilt and moral injury provide evidence to support these formulations. Clinical vignettes illustrate a range of circumstances leading to ATSD, in each instance adding significantly to the individual's distress, impeding recovery, and often requiring specific psychotherapeutic attention over and above that required for PTSD or complex-PTSD. These psychotherapeutic strategies have included intense, prolonged, noninterruptive, open-minded listening; avoiding premature whitewashing of responsibility and guilt; facilitating grief over lost innocence; helping create personal narratives that permit self-acceptance despite permanently altered damaged self-image; and, for some individuals, guiding repentance and restorative actions. Systematic case series and additional studies are necessary to ascertain how intentionality, self-harm versus harming others, and various comorbidities shape ATSD presentations, and to better delineate effective treatment strategies.","output":"Autotraumatic Stress Disorders: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Variants When the Victim Bears Responsibility for the Trauma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Simple plastic face shields have numerous practical advantages over regular surgical masks. In light of the spreading COVID-19 pandemic, the potential of face shields as a substitution for surgical masks was investigated. In order to determine the efficacy of the protective equipment we used a cough simulator. The protective equipment considered was placed on a manikin head that simulated human breathing. Concentration and size distribution of small particles that reached the manikin respiration pathways during the few tens of seconds following the cough event were monitored. Additionally, water sensitive papers were taped on the tested protective equipment and the manikin face. In the case of frontal exposure, for droplet diameter larger than 3 m, the shield efficiency in blocking cough droplets was found to be comparable to that of regular surgical masks, with enhanced protection for portions of the face that the mask does not cover. Additionally, for finer particles, down to 0.3 m diameter, a shield blocked about 10 times more fine particles than the surgical mask. When exposure from the side was considered, the performance of the shield was found to depend dramatically on its geometry. While a narrow shield allowed more droplets and aerosol to penetrate in comparison to a mask under the same configuration, a slightly wider shield significantly improved the performance. The source control potential of shields was also investigated. A shield, and alternatively, a surgical mask, were placed on the cough simulator, while the breathing simulator, situated 60 cm away in the jet direction, remained totally exposed. In both cases, no droplets or particles were found in the vicinity of the breathing simulator. Conducted experiments were limited to short time periods after expiratory events, and do not include longer time ranges associated with exposure to suspended aerosol.

A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published both in scientific journals and through non-peer-reviewed channels to investigate the genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. However, a systematic investigation of phylogenetic information and sampling bias in the available data is lacking. Although the number of available genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 is growing daily and the sequences show increasing phylogenetic information, country-specific data still present severe limitations and should be interpreted with caution. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the quality of the currently available SARS-CoV-2 full genome data in terms of sampling bias as well as phylogenetic and temporal signals to inform and guide the scientific community. METHODS: We used maximum likelihood-based methods to assess the presence of sufficient information for robust phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in several SARS-CoV-2 sequence alignments assembled from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) data released between March and April 2020. RESULTS: Although the number of high-quality full genomes is growing daily, and sequence data released in April 2020 contain sufficient phylogenetic information to allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 data sets still present severe limitations.

Weekly indicators for the period JanuaryCJuly 2020 were compared with the corresponding average for 2018C2019; comparisons were performed within 3 sub-periods: pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown. The weekly trend of hospitalisations for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) showed a 40% reduction, but the proportion of STEMI patients with a primary PTCA did not significantly change from previous years. Malignant neoplasms surgery volumes differed substantially by site, with a limited reduction for lung cancer (< 20%) and greater declines (30C40%) for breast and prostate cancers. The percentage of timely surgery for femoral neck in the elderly remained constantly higher than the previous 2 years whereas hip and knee replacements fell dramatically. Hospitalisations have generally decreased, but the capacity of a timely and effective response in time-dependent pathways of care was not jeopardized throughout the period.

This paper aims to explore the impact of numerical features extracted from user profiles in retweet prediction from the real-time raw feed of tweets. The originality of this work comes from the fact that the proposed model is based on simple numerical features with the least computational complexity, which is a scalable solution for big data analysis. This research work proposes three new features from the tweet author profile to capture the unique behavioral pattern of the user, namely Author total activity, Author total activity per year, and Author tweets per year. The features set is tested on a dataset of 100 million random tweets collected through Twitter API. The binary labels regression gave an accuracy of 0.98 for user-profile features and gave an accuracy of 0.99 when combined with tweet content features. The regression analysis to predict the retweet count gave an R-squared value of 0.98 with combined features. The multi-label classification gave an accuracy of 0.9 for combined features and 0.89 for user-profile features. The user profile features performed better than tweet content features and performed even better when combined. This model is suitable for near real-time analysis of live streaming data coming through Twitter API and provides a baseline pattern of user behavior based on numerical features available from user profiles only.","output":"Role of twitter user profile features in retweet prediction for big data streams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations in the peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase domain containing 1 (PTRHD1) gene have been recently identified in consanguineous Iranian and African families with juvenile parkinsonism and intellectual disability.

METHODS: Seven focus groups with 28 undergraduate physical therapist students were conducted following the transitioning to full eLearning as a result of strict physical distancing measures. Focus group questions explored the students' experiences of the transition from face-to-face to full eLearning approach and the students' recommendations for improving future eLearning experiences. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The 3 themes identified were: (1) students presenting heightened negative feelings such as anxiety, stress, and reduced motivation to study; (2) students continuing to value the face-to-face learning, as it provided social support and facilitated feedback from peers and tutors; (3) student recommendations for eLearning included having online lectures and supplementary videos but face-to-face practical classes and developing healthy learning habits such as scheduled times for studying, exercise, and other activities that regulate stress. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to a full eLearning approach in an undergraduate physical therapist education program during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that students had heightened negative emotions due to the pandemic. Students valued face-to-face practical classes to learn and receive social support from peers and tutors. Student recommendations to future eLearning suggested changes to curriculum development geared toward a greater blended approach to learning. Blended learning may include using online lectures instead of face-to-face lectures and online resources to supplement student learning of practical skills. IMPACT: As higher education moves toward a more blended approach, lessons learned from this study can help educators design future physical therapist education programs.

OA affects 60C70% of the population above 65 years of age all over the world, and is associated with a high cost of healthcare. The main method of treatment of OA, apart from pharmacotherapy and surgery, is comprehensive rehabilitation. Advances in medical technology have resulted in the possibility of using computer-assisted interventions in rehabilitation. The present narrative review is aimed at investigating the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) in the rehabilitation of elderly patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis, including patients after arthroplasty. This literature review based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was carried out in five databases: PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus and PEDro. It includes ten randomized controlled trials focused on the application of games and biofeedback in the rehabilitation of patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis. There are no conclusive reports that interventions based on VR are more effective than standard physical therapy. Moreover, evidence regarding patients after total hip arthroplasty (THA) is very scarce. The effectiveness of VR-based rehabilitation is unclear, although interventions based on VR are promising in view of pain management, postural and proprioception training.

TAZ activation is associated with the development of pancreatic cancer in humans, but it is unclear whether TAZ directly affects the structure and function of the pancreas. So we sought to identify the TAZ function in the normal pancreas. TAZ defect caused structural changes in the pancreas, particularly islet cell shrinkage and decreased insulin production and -cell markers expression, leading to hyperglycemia. Interestingly, TAZ physically interacted with the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), a key insulin transcription factor, through the N-terminal domain of TAZ and the homeodomain of PDX1. TAZ deficiency decreased the DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of PDX1, whereas TAZ overexpression promoted PDX1 activity and increased insulin production even in a low glucose environment. Indeed, high glucose increased insulin production by turning off the Hippo pathway and inducing TAZ activation in pancreatic -cells. Ectopic TAZ overexpression along with PDX1 activation was sufficient to produce insulin in non--cells. TAZ deficiency impaired the mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into insulin-producing cells (IPCs), whereas TAZ recovery restored normal IPCs differentiation. Compared to WT control, body weight increased in TAZ-deficient mice with age and even more with a high-fat diet (HFD). TAZ deficiency significantly exacerbated HFD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Therefore, TAZ deficiency impaired pancreatic insulin production, causing hyperglycemia and exacerbating HFD-induced insulin resistance, indicating that TAZ may have a beneficial effect in treating insulin deficiency in diabetes.","output":"TAZ promotes PDX1-mediated insulinogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To determine the susceptibility of the oocytes, embryos, granulosa and cumulus cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: To address this question, we retrospectively examined the gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases in human granulosa cells (GCs), cumulus cells (CCs), mature oocytes, day 3 embryos, blastocysts and trophectoderm cells obtained from our previously described Affymetrix microarray data from assisted reproduction patients. Human GCs and CCs (n=17), mature oocytes (n=6), and preimplantation embryos (n=20) were analyzed and gene expression levels of receptors and proteases closely related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported. For each gene, the number of samples with the probe set 'present', based on the detection call was studied. Each probe set was classified according to the signal intensity value median, as low (<100), medium (100-200) or high expression level (>200). Results: ACE2, BSG, CTSL, CTSA were detectable at high expression level in all mature oocyte samples, while only CTSL was strongly expressed in all day 3 embryos. The most representative dual co-expression of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptor and protease (60% of samples) during the embryonic genome activation stage (EGA) was ACE2-CTSL and BSG-CTSL. In blastocysts, ACE2, BSG, CTSL, CTSA and FURIN were detectable in the entire cohort at high expression level, and the prevalence of the different dual co-expression of SARS-CoV-2-associated proteases and receptors was optimal (100% of samples). Interestingly, only CTSL was detectable in all trophectoderm samples and a prevalence of 60% was found for the BSG-CTSL co-expression. ACE2, BSG, CTSL and CTSA were present at high expression level in CCs samples. In contrast, ACE2 and BSG expression was very low while CTSL and CTSA showed a high expression level in GCs. A prevalence of 100% was reported for ACE2-CTSL, ACE2-CTSA co-expression for both cell types. In addition, BSG-CTSL and BSG-CTSA co-expression were also present in all CCs against 70% in GCs samples. This data suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection either GC or early embryo development. Conclusions: Transcriptomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases strongly suggest that blastocysts are most permissive to SARS-CoV-2 compared with mature oocytes and day 3 embryos.

This is particularly critical for some classes of migrants involved in stigmatised, unregulated or illegal activities. Escorting services or high-end prostitution are well-paid activities that attract workers all around the world. In this paper, we study international migration patterns of sex-workers by using network methods. Using an extensive international online advertisement directory of escorting services and information about individual escorts, we reconstruct a migrant flow network where nodes represent either origin or destination countries. The links represent the direct routes between two countries. The migration network of sex-workers shows different structural patterns than the migration of the general population. The network contains a strong core where mutual migration is often observed between a group of high-income European countries, yet Europe is split into different network communities with specific ties to non-European countries. We find non-reciprocal relations between countries, with some of them mostly offering while others attract workers. The GDP per capita is a good indicator of country attractiveness for incoming workers and service rates but is unrelated to the probability of emigration. The median financial gain of migrating, in comparison to working at the home country, is 15.9%. Only sex-workers coming from 77% of the countries have financial gains with migration and average gains decrease with the GDPc of the country of origin.

JAK inhibitors carry a black box warning for their association with severe infections especially when used in combination with other immunosuppressants. Although there is a strong association, there are very few reports of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) caused by upadacitinib. We describe a case of PJP due to upadacitinib use in rheumatoid arthritis. Case presentation: A 44-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presented with 2 weeks of dyspnea, dry cough and fever after recently starting upadacitinib. She was noted to be tachypneic, tachycardic and hypoxemic on admission. Initial laboratory tests were within normal limits and lactate dehydrogenase was 304. Respiratory viral panel and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were negative. Computerized tomography of the chest revealed diffuse multi-focal ground glass and consolidative opacities. The patient's respiratory status rapidly deteriorated, requiring admission to medical intensive care unit where she was initiated on invasive mechanical ventilation. A 1,3-beta-D-glucan serology test was positive and PJP polymerase chain reaction in bronchoalveolar lavage was positive. She was started on intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 400mg three times a day and intravenous methylprednisolone 500mg twice a day for three days. Her oxygen requirements rapidly improved and she was extubated on day 4 of admission. The patient was discharged without a supplemental oxygen requirement to complete a course of oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and prednisone. Discussion:JAK inhibitors are increasingly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Other less selective JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib and baricitinib have been associated with PJP in rheumatoid arthritis. Upadacitinib is a selective JAK1 inhibitor which is thought to give it an improved side effect profile compared to other less selective JAK inhibitors. This represents one of the first cases of PJP associated with the use of upadacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor. PJP should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with upadacitinib who present with fever, hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates.

Core stiffness has been proposed to perform several functions including reducing pain by minimising joint micro-movements, and enhancing strength and speed performance. This study probes the links between a training approach and immediate but temporary changes in stiffness. Passive and active stiffness was measured on 24 participants; 12 having little to no experience in core training (inexperienced), and the other 12 being athletes experienced to core training methods; before and after a 15 min bout of isometric core exercises. Passive stiffness was assessed on a \\"frictionless\\" bending apparatus and active stiffness assessed via a quick release mechanism. Short-term isometric core training increased passive and active stiffness in most directions for both inexperienced and experienced participants, passive left lateral bend among experienced participants being the exception (P < 0.05).

Throughout history, Smis have been living close to nature. Working with reindeer husbandry, fishing-farming, hunting, herding, and harvesting for food supplies, has traditionally been an integral part of their lives. Currently, only 2,500 of the ~65,000 Smis in Norway are operating reindeer husbandry (2019). Most Smis today work in mainstream jobs, and the fishing-farming culture gradually become more like the mainstream societies where Smis live. Fieldwork with participant observation and semi-structured interviews carried out at Riddu Riu Festivala in the period 2009C2018. In addition, the governing bodies of seven other Smi festivals have been interviewed. All together 46 in-depth interviews and participant observations conducted, in addition to document analysis of the festivals. The aim was to study how physical and outdoor activities included in the festivals create indigenous people's identities and cultural understanding and how the activities at the festivals might develop climate and environmental awareness. Indigenous festivals and their governing bodies offer many different forms of physical and cultural activities from Smis and different indigenous peoples to the youth and children taking part. Further, the study shows that important aims for the organizers are to spread the knowledge about Smis (i.e., local coastal Smis and regional reindeer/Inland Smis) and other indigenous peoples, and making environment-friendly festivals. They are trying to educate the children and youth in the cultural practices of their forefathers and foremothers. The manifold of activities offered at the festivals seem to create sustainable ties between persons, which equip the participants with social and cultural capital in addition to networks across festivals organizations internationally. The participants further express that taking part in the festival activities create symbolic capital, due to that they might express their indigeneity at the festivals both for people living in the region and for a greater audience. According to the participants, the festivals have equipped the participants with cultural awareness, as well as the children and youth taught an appreciation of nature so they can enjoy and respect nature and develop climate and environmental awareness.","output":"Development of Cultural and Environmental Awareness Through Smi Outdoor Life at Smi/Indigenous Festivals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Residual and recurrent stones remain one of the most important challenges of hepatolithiasis and are reported in 20 to 50% of patients treated for this condition. To date, the two most common surgical procedures performed for hepatolithiasis are choledochojejunostomy and T-tube drainage for biliary drainage. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic safety and perioperative and long-term outcomes of choledochojejunostomy versus T-tube drainage for hepatolithiasis patients with sphincter of Oddi laxity (SOL). METHODS/DESIGN In total, 210 patients who met the following eligibility criteria were included and were randomized to the choledochojejunostomy arm or T-tube drainage arm in a 1:1 ratio: (1) diagnosed with hepatolithiasis with SOL during surgery; (2) underwent foci removal, stone extraction and stricture correction during the operation; (3) provided written informed consent; (4) was willing to complete a 3-year follow-up; and (5) aged between 18 and 70 years. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial will be the incidence of biliary complications (stone recurrence, biliary stricture, cholangitis) during the 3 years after surgery. The secondary outcomes will be the surgical, perioperative and long-term follow-up outcomes. DISCUSSION This is a prospective, single-centre and randomized controlled two-group parallel trial designed to demonstrate which drainage method (Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy or T-tube drainage) can better reduce biliary complications (stone recurrence, biliary stricture, cholangitis) in hepatolithiasis patients with SOL.

The aim of the present study was to examine the longitudinal relations between time perspectives and COVID-19 risk perception and preventive behaviors. Using a six-month longitudinal design, we explored the mediating role of risk perception on the relations between the Zimbardos time perspectives, and preventive behaviors to protect from COVID-19.

However, the fragile heros or health care worker's attitude toward the vaccine is of paramount importance to promote its acceptance. So, the current review aims to provide the latest assessment of healthcare workers attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccination and its contributing factor worldwide. METHODS: Peer-reviewed surveys in English indexed via an electronic database in Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed were systematically searched. The review was carried out per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA-2009) and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021265534). RESULTS: Originally 8039 articles were searched from three databases PubMed, Science direct, and Google scholar. Finally, 24 studies met the inclusion criteria and made the root for the estimates of the attitude of COVID -19 vaccinations. In about two-thirds of the studies, respondents showed a positive attitude (50%) toward COVID-19 vaccination. However, in about one-quarter of the studies, a negative attitude (<50%) against vaccination was reported. Factors related to the attitude of healthcare workers toward COVID-19 vaccination include age, sex, profession, concerns about the safety of vaccines and fear of COVID-19, trust in the accuracy of the measures taken by the government, flu vaccination during the previous season, comorbid chronic illness, history of recommendation, and depression symptoms in the past week. CONCLUSION: Although most studies report that healthcare workers have a positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination, quite a few surveys mention negative attitudes towards the use of vaccines, which may reflect missed opportunities or challenges for the international efforts aimed at mitigating the pandemic. Still, we need to continue to make more efforts to change the attitudes of the uncertain healthcare workers to increase the uptake of the vaccine and deal with the multi-faceted impact of infection.","output":"Attitude Towards COVID-19 Vaccination Among Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper focuses on investigating the time-varying influence of geopolitical risks (GPR) and trade policy uncertainty (TPU) on commodity prices by using time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model with stochastic volatility (TVP-VAR-SV).

Deaths among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are partially attributed to venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboses. Anticoagulants prevent thrombosis formation, possess anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, and may be particularly effective for treating patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate whether initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission is associated with decreased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN. Observational cohort study. SETTING. Nationwide cohort of patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. PARTICIPANTS. All patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection March 1 to July 31, 2020, without a history of therapeutic anticoagulation. EXPOSURES. Prophylactic doses of subcutaneous heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or direct oral anticoagulants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES. 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation. RESULTS. Of 4,297 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 3,627 (84.4%) received prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission. More than 99% (n=3,600) received subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin. We observed 622 deaths within 30 days of admission, 513 among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation. Most deaths (510/622, 82%) occurred during hospitalization. In inverse probability of treatment weighted analyses, cumulative adjusted incidence of mortality at 30 days was 14.3% (95% CI 13.1C15.5) among those receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and 18.7% (95% CI 15.1C22.9) among those who did not. Compared to patients who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation, those who did had a 27% decreased risk for 30-day mortality (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66C0.81). Similar associations were found for inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation. Quantitative bias analysis demonstrated that results were robust to unmeasured confounding (e-value lower 95% CI 1.77). Results persisted in a number of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE. Early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with a decreased risk of mortality.

The effectiveness of such mitigation efforts relies on individual compliance (e.g., avoiding to travel or to gather). Crucially, adhering to the required behavioral recommendations places substantial burdens on those who are asked to follow them. One particularly likely outcome of adherence should be the experience of boredom. Thus, people might get bored by bothering. Drawing from research and theorizing on reward-based decision making, we conducted a high-powered study (N = 1553 US participants) to investigate whether the value and effort people ascribe to adherence to containment measures directly and indirectly (i.e., mediated by adherence) affects their experience of boredom. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed that high value and low effort predicted compliance with behavioral recommendations. Moreover, higher compliance was linked to more boredom, meaning that high value and low effort increased boredom via compliance. In contrast, high value and low effort had direct effects on boredom in the opposite direction (i.e., decreasing boredom). Attesting to their robustness and generalizability, these findings held for both prospective (with respect to upcoming winter holidays) and retrospective behavior (with respect to previous thanksgiving holidays), across US states, which had or had not enforced behavioral restrictions, individual differences in boredom proneness, and demographic variables. Taken together, our results provide evidence that people can indeed get bored by bothering: Complying with nonpharmacological containment measures like avoiding to travel and to gather can come at the cost of getting bored, an experience that was strongly linked to negative affect in our study.","output":"Bored by bothering?

The aim of this study was to identify suspected sADRs reported after ivermectin administration in VigiBase, the World Health Organizations global individual case safety reports database and analyze their frequency relative to the frequency of these events after other antinematodal drugs reported in SSA and other areas of the world (ROW). METHODS: All antinematodal-related sADRs were extracted from VigiBase. Disproportionality analyses were conducted to investigate nervous, cutaneous, psychiatric, respiratory, renal, hepatic and cardiac suspected sADRs reported after ivermectin and benzimidazole drug administration across the world, in SSA and RoW. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 2041 post-ivermectin or post-benzimidazole suspected sADRs were identified including 667 after ivermectin exposure (208 in SSA and 459 in the RoW).

DESIGN: We compared Army households that recently transitioned into marginal food insecurity with those households that remained highly food secure (n 2832) to better understand how these households differ in their resilience to food insecurity during economic downturns using data from a military installation in the USA in 2020. SETTING: A US military installation in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: Active duty US Army soldiers. RESULTS: Prior to the pandemic, the prevalence of marginal food insecurity among Army households was similar to that reported for households in the general population. Marginal food insecurity among Army households increased over 15-fold C from 19 % to 33 % C with the onset of the pandemic. Relative to Army households with consistently high food security, the Army households that transitioned into marginal food insecurity after the onset of the pandemic were more likely to report concerns about financial insecurity and the job security of their family members. CONCLUSIONS: Army households, like their civilian counterparts, are vulnerable to food insecurity because of instability in their income during periods of economic uncertainty.

Methods: HCWs at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust were prospectively enrolled and sampled at two time points. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested using an in-house assay for IgG and IgA reactivity against Spike and Nucleoprotein (sensitivity 9947%, specificity 9956%). Data were analysed using three statistical models: a seroprevalence model, an antibody kinetics model, and a heterogeneous sensitivity model. Results: As of 12th June 2020, 244% (n=311/1275) of HCWs were seropositive. Of these, 392% (n=122/311) were asymptomatic. The highest adjusted seroprevalence was measured in HCWs on the Acute Medical Unit (411%, 95% CrI 300-529) and in Physiotherapists and Occupational Therapists (392%, 95% CrI 244-565). Older age groups showed overall higher median antibody titres. Further modelling suggests that, for a serological assay with an overall sensitivity of 80%, antibody titres may be markedly affected by differences in age, with sensitivity estimates of 89% in those over 60 years but 61% in those 30 years. Conclusions: HCWs in acute medical units working closely with COVID-19 patients were at highest risk of infection, though whether these are infections acquired from patients or other staff is unknown.

A total of 272 individuals from 185 families were included in the study, out of the 400 eligible individuals for inclusion, resulting in a non-response rate of 32%. The post stratified prevalence of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 was 45.2% (95% CI: 39.4C51.0%), with a proportion of asymptomatic cases of 30.2% (95% CI: 23.3C38.0%). This population-based serosurvey identified a greater prevalence of infected individuals by SARS-CoV-2 compared to data from the beginning of the pandemic, and from a recent citywide serosurvey, with a similar proportion of asymptomatic individuals. It demonstrated the value of primary healthcare services for disease surveillance activities, and the importance of more focused serosurveys, especially in vulnerable locations, and the need to evaluate new surveillance strategies to take into account asymptomatic cases.","output":"A seroprevalence survey of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among individuals 18 years of age or older living in a vulnerable region of the city of S?o Paulo, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had major consequences for the organization of care.

In recent years, with advancements in technology, electric vehicles (EVs) have shown a new potential to meet many of the challenges being faced by humanity. These challenges include increasing dependence on fossil fuels, environmental concerns, challenges posed by rapid urbanization, urban mobility, and employment. However, the adoption of electric vehicles has remained challenging despite consumers having a positive attitude toward EVs and big policy pushes by governments in many countries. Marketers from the electric vehicle (EV) industry are finding it difficult to identify genuine buyers for their products. In this context, the present study attempts to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a person would Buy or Wont Buy an electric vehicle in India. To develop the model, an exploration of EV context was done first by conducting a text analysis of online content relating to electric vehicles. The objective was to find frequently occurring words to gain a meaningful understanding of the consumers interests and concerns relating to electric vehicles. The machine learning model indicates that age, gender, income, level of environmental concerns, vehicle cost, running cost, vehicle performance, driving range, and mass behavior are significant predictors of electrical vehicle purchase in India.

OBJECTIVE To describe a novel technique of occlusion angiography using intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan (CEUS) for zero-ischaemia robot-assisted PN (RAPN). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used a prospective cohort evaluation of five patients who had imaging suspicious of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated at a single centre. SURGICAL PROCEDURE We used computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction to identify renal arterial anatomy and its relationship to the tumour. Then, RAPN was performed with selective clamping and demonstration of a nonperfused segment of kidney (occlusion angiography) using intraoperative CEUS. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS We prospectively collected data on baseline, perioperative, and postoperative parameters. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS We describe the effects seen on ultrasound contrast administration. Contrast flare is seen in the segment of the kidney that is perfused. When selective clamping is performed, a watershed (line of demarcation) between the perfused and nonperfused segments of the kidney is clearly seen, allowing excision of the tumour in a relatively avascular plane and ensuring an adequate oncologic margin, when feasible. The mean age was 68.2 yr of age (range: 36-85), and the mean tumour size was 29.6mm (range: 20-42). The mean intraparenchymal extension of the tumour was 22.6mm (range: 12-30). Three tumours were located on the right kidney and two on the left. The mean blood loss was 420ml (range: 200-1000). The histology revealed clear cell RCC in two patients, oncocytoma in two patients, and type 1 papillary RCC in one patient. All the surgical specimens had negative surgical margins. The mean decrease in glomerular filtration rate was 8.4ml (range: 0-24). The mean follow-up was 6.4 mo (range: 5-8), with no evidence of recurrence in any patient. The only limitation in adopting this technique is the need for an intraoperative ultrasound probe with a CEUS mode. However, most specialists who perform minimally invasive surgery for small renal tumours believe that intraoperative ultrasound scan imaging is essential to achieving adequate resection margins. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative CEUS can be a useful adjunct in determining whether zero-ischaemia RAPN is feasible by delineating the area of nonperfusion. This technique has several advantages over the currently available techniques, such as indigo carmine green and Doppler probes.","output":"Occlusion angiography using intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan (CEUS): a novel technique demonstrating segmental renal blood supply to assist zero-ischaemia robot-assisted partial nephrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac amyloidosis, the majority of cases of which are due to immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), affects different aspects of the heart and cardiovascular system.

This collaborative research with the Professional Association of Congolese Midwives (SCOSAF), sought to understand how certain midwives in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have overcome barriers to successfully integrate MVA for post abortion care. Specifically, in order to provide locally-driven solutions to the problem of inadequate post abortion care in the DRC, this study aimed to identify examples of positive deviance, or midwives who had successfully integrated MVA in complex working environments following an in-service training facilitated by their midwifery association, SCOSAF. METHODS: Creswells mixed method comparative case study design was used to identify positive deviant midwives who had practiced MVA one or more times post training and to explore their strategies and enabling factors. Other midwives who had not practiced MVA post training permitted for a comparison gro cup and further interpretations. Sources of data included a sequential survey and semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: All 102 midwives invited to be surveyed were recruited and 34% reported practicing MVA post training (positive deviant midwives). No statistical significance was found between the two groups demographics and practice facility type. Overall, both groups had positive attitudes regarding midwifery-led MVA and legalization of abortion. Positive deviant midwives demonstrated and described more confidence and competence to practice and teach MVA. They were more likely to identify as teachers and overcome interprofessional barriers by teaching MVA to physicians, medical students and other midwives and position themselves as experts during post abortion emergencies. CONCLUSION: Results provided important insight to midwives integration of post abortion care in Kinshasa. Strategies used by positive deviant midwives in emergencies allowed them to navigate challenging contexts in order to practice MVA, while simultaneously increasing the credibility of their profession and the dissemination of evidenced-based MVA practice. Programs designed to work with and promote positive deviant midwives as knowledge brokers could be tested for their overall impact on the diffusion of midwifery-led MVA to improve access to safe, respectful reproductive care.

In a thin market, the number of job postings is relatively small, and the share of empty cells increases substantially when aggregating the data into finer categories. Using Australian job postings collected by Burning Glass Technologies and the RWET approach, our empirical evidence shows that the overall labour demand in Australia as of July 2020 is slowly recovering from its lowest 45 per cent dip at the beginning of May. Our results also suggest that the impacts of the pandemic are relatively evenly distributed across skill levels, but vary substantially across states, industries and occupations.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the telephone-based screening and triage services in the promoted primary healthcare system with regard to the Covid-19 outbreak, in terms of reducing unnecessary referrals to the hospital. METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in two stages on 1,406,635 households during March/April 2020 in Ardabil province for screening and early detection of Covid-19 disease. In the first stage, conducted by trained healthcare providers through telephone, individuals suspected of Covid-19 were identified. In the second stage, the individuals were referred to the second level of service in comprehensive healthcare centers (16- or 24-h centers) for clinical evaluation by a physician. RESULTS: The results showed that before establishing a screening and triage system for patients in comprehensive healthcare centers, all patients were referred directly to the hospital, while after the implementation of the program, a significant reduction in hospital visits was observed and a large number of patients undertook the care and triage services in comprehensive healthcare centers.

The new coronavirus (CoV) does not appear to have intrinsic procoagulant effects itself. The coagulation changes in COVID-19 are likely a result of the inflammatory response. Significant inflammation is present in COVID-19, based on elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6). This inflammation associated with COVID-19 results in coagulopathy, based on elevated D-dimer (). An endotheliopathy appears to contribute to microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19. Aim of this study is to confirm the coagulation abnormalities in 100 severe COVID-19 patients having lung involvement and their association with the severity and prognosis. Methods: Inflammation, endothelial and coagulation indicators were performed and compared between severe and mild disease. Findings: IL-6 and TNF-a, and TF and VWF, exceeded in severe COVID-19 as well as D-dimer, TAT, and Fibrinogen. As PF4 hasa rapid removal from plasma, we also measured b-TG levels which exceeded the plasma levels of PF4 in severe COVID-19 patients as well as increased platelet adhesion was observed. Shortened CT and CFT, high MCF and low LY at 30 minutes were present in 100% of severe COVID-19 patients compared with mild COVID-19 patients. It is reported that TFPI is a natural anticoagulant that lowes inflammation and coagulation. Therefore, we measuredTFPI levels which exceeded without shutdown of the inflammation and coagulation.

Wnt3a overexpression significantly decreased cell viability, promoted the generation of apoptotic cells, and enhanced hypoxia-induced injury in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. This was partially through the upregulation of Caspase-3 mRNA levels and cleaved PARP-1 protein levels. In addition, we observed that Wnt3a exacerbated hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cytosolic release of cytochrome C. Furthermore, we found that Sirt3, a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase that modulates mitochondrial metabolism and homeostasis, was negatively regulated by Wnt3a. Conversely, Sirt3 overexpression repressed Wnt3a expression and ameliorated the hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

While obesity seems to aggravate the course of disease, the actual impact of the BMI and the cutoff which increases illness severity are still under investigation. The aim of the study was to analyze whether the BMI represented a risk factor for respiratory failure, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death. Research design and methods: A retrospective cohort study of 482 consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalised between March 1 and April 20, 2020. Logistic regression analysis and Cox proportion Hazard models including demographic characteristics and comorbidities were carried out to predict the endpoints within 30 days from the onset of symptoms. Results: Of 482 patients, 104 (21.6%) had a BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2. At logistic regression analysis, a BMI between 30 and 34.9 kg/m2 significantly increased the risk of respiratory failure (OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.31-4.09, P = 0.004) and admission to the ICU (OR: 4.96; 95% CI: 2.53-9.74, P < 0.001).

Using data from a cluster\\\\randomized non\\\\inferiority trial conducted between August 2017 and July 2019, we evaluated costs to providers and costs to patients of community\\\\based differentiated models of multi\\\\month delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Lesotho. METHODS: The trial of multi\\\\month dispensing compared 12\\\\month retention in care among three arms: conventional care, which required quarterly facility visits and ART dispensation (3MF); three\\\\month community adherence groups (CAGs) (3MC) and six\\\\month community ART distribution (6MCD). We first estimated the average total annual cost of providing HIV care and treatment followed by the total cost per patient retained 12 months after entry for each arm, using resource utilization data from the trial and local unit costs. We then estimated the average annual cost to patients in each arm with self\\\\reported questionnaire data. RESULTS: The average total annual cost of providing HIV care and treatment per patient was the highest in the 3MF arm ($122.28, standard deviation [SD] $23.91), followed by 3MC ($114.20, SD $23.03) and the 6MCD arm ($112.58, SD $21.44). Per patient retained in care, the average provider cost was $125.99 (SD $24.64) in the 3MF arm and 6% to 8% less for the other two arms ($118.38, SD $23.87 and $118.83, SD $22.63 for the 3MC and 6MCD respectively). There was a large reduction in patient costs for both differentiated service delivery arms: from $44.42 (SD $12.06) annually in the 3MF arm to $16.34 (SD $5.11) annually in the 3MC (63% reduction) and $18.77 (SD $8.31) annually in 6MCD arm (58% reduction). CONCLUSIONS: Community\\\\based, multi\\\\month models of ART in Lesotho are likely to produce small cost savings to treatment providers and large savings to patients in Lesotho. Patient cost savings may support long\\\\term adherence and retention in care.","output":"Economic evaluation of differentiated service delivery models for HIV treatment in Lesotho: costs to providers and patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health emergencies, especially major infectious diseases, may cause global crises. Timely and effective communication is essential for response to such incidents. However, the emergency response to such incidents usually lasts longer and break out repeatedly, and the existing static emergency communication network (ECN) analysis cannot fully reflect the dynamic information interaction between organizations during the emergency process. Therefore, this article takes the recent COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China as a case, and uses social network analysis to reveal the dynamic evolution of communication networks, positions, roles, and tasks of organizations from the time dimension. The results show that: (1) the ECN has changed from concentrated to decentralized over time; (2) the positions and roles of participating organizations in the ECN has changed, but there are still a few key organizations that at the central position in all phases of emergency communication; (3) the core tasks have changed due to emergency needs at each stage; (4) under the concentrated management system, the core organization of the ECN mainly comes from government organizations. The research results reveal the dynamic evolution of communication networks between different types of emergency organizations, which is beneficial to guide emergency management of public health emergencies. In actual emergency, the emergency communication mode should be dynamically adjusted based on the characteristics of the emergency situation at different stages, comprehensively using the advantages of the concentrated and decentralized emergency network. In addition, communication between different types of organizations such as governments, research institutions, and enterprises should be strengthened, and channels for diversified organizations to participate in emergency communication should be set up. The research helps to improve communication between emergency response organizations and is of great significance to controlling and reducing the harm caused by public health emergencies.","output":"Dynamic analysis of emergency inter-organizational communication network under public health emergency: a case study of COVID-19 in Hubei Province of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 4(th) November 2021, the first oral antiviral drug for COVID-19, molnupiravir (Lagevrio(?)), received full regulatory approval from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK.

This paper evaluates COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies proposed to date, focusing on their stated goals; the mechanisms through which the selected allocations affect the course and burden of the pandemic; and the main epidemiological, economic, logistical, and political issues that arise when setting the prioritization strategy. The paper uses a simple, age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to quantitatively assess the performance of alternative prioritization strategies with respect to avoided deaths, avoided infections, and life-years gained. We demonstrate that prioritizing essential workers is a viable strategy for reducing the number of cases and years of life lost, while the largest reduction in deaths is achieved by prioritizing older adults in most scenarios, even if the vaccine is effective at blocking viral transmission. Uncertainty regarding this property and potential delays in dose delivery reinforce the call for prioritizing older adults. Additionally, we investigate the strength of the equity motive that would support an allocation strategy attaching absolute priority to essential workers for a vaccine that reduces infection-fatality risk.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation: Modeling Health Outcomes and Equity Implications of Alternative Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by hyperactive neutrophils has recently been recognized to play an important role in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Here, we aimed to evaluate autoantibodies targeting NETs in patients with primary APS, and to determine their potential functions and clinical associations. METHOD: We measured global anti-NET activity in 76 patients with primary APS, 23 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus without antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), 11 patients with history of unprovoked venous thrombosis without aPL, and 44 healthy controls. The ability of APS sera to degrade NETs was also assessed. RESULT: We found markedly elevated levels of anti-NET IgG and IgM in patients with primary APS as compared with healthy controls (IgG mean optical density 0.55  0.34 vs. 0.33  0.17; IgM mean optical density 0.76  0.51 vs. 0.26  0.23). This anti-NET activity did not correlate with levels of traditional aPL and was relatively stable over time. Mechanistically, anti-NET antibodies (especially of the IgG isotype) impaired the ability of patient sera to degrade NETs (r=0.4, p=0.003). Levels of anti-NET IgM inversely correlated with complement C4 (r=0.4, p=0.019). Clinically, anti-NET antibodies associated with certain APS clinical manifestations, and in particular recurrent venous thrombosis (OR=4.3, p=0.002). Interestingly, anti-NET antibodies also appeared to associate with unprovoked venous thrombosis in the general population (IgM mean optical density 0.67  0.34 vs. 0.26  0.23). CONCLUSION: These data reveal high levels of anti-NET antibodies in patients with primary APS, which may impair NET clearance and activate the complement cascade. These findings may ultimately enable more effective risk stratification.","output":"Anti-NET antibodies and impaired NET degradation in antiphospholipid syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 is a kind of viral pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the mechanism whereby SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells remains poorly understood. Here we used SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses to infect human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing HEK293T cells and evaluated virus infection. We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 entry was dependent on ACE2 and sensitive to pH of endosome/lysosome in HEK293T cells. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses is independent of dynamin, clathrin, caveolin and endophilin A2, as well as macropinocytosis. Instead, we found that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses was cholesterol-rich lipid raft dependent. Cholesterol depletion of cell membranes with methyl-?-cyclodextrin resulted in reduction of pseudovirus infection. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses resumed with cholesterol supplementation. Together, cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, and endosomal acidification, are key steps of SARS-CoV-2 required for infection of host cells. Therefore, our finding expands the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism and provides a new anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategy.","output":"Dependence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cholesterol-rich lipid raft and endosomal acidification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused public lockdowns around the world. We analyzed if the public lockdown altered the referral pattern of Code Stroke patients by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to our Comprehensive Stroke Center. METHODS: Retrospective single-center study at a Bavarian Comprehensive Stroke Center. Patients who were directly referred to our stroke unit by EMS between the 1st of January 2020 and the 19th of April 2020 were identified and number of referrals, clinical characteristics and treatment strategies were analyzed during the public lockdown and before. The public lockdown started on 21st of March and ended on 19th April 2020. RESULTS: In total 241 patients were referred to our center during the study period, i.e. 171 before and 70 during the lockdown. The absolute daily number of Code Stroke referrals and the portion of patients with stroke mimics remained stable. The portion of female stroke patients decreased (55% to 33%; p = 0.03), and stroke severity as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (median 3 (IQR 0-7) versus 6 (IQR 1-15.5) points; p = 0.04) increased during the lockdown. There was no difference of daily numbers of patients receiving thrombolysis and thrombectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Referral of Code Stroke patients by EMS could be maintained sufficiently despite the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. However, patients' health care utilization of the EMS may have changed within the public lockdown.

It has reached clinical trials for the treatment of several cancers and human papilloma virus warts. Onconase targets different RNAs in the cell cytosol but Onconase-treated cells present features that are different from a simple arrest of protein synthesis. We have used microarray-derived transcriptional profiling to identify Onconase-regulated genes in two ovarian cancer cell lines (NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR-8). RT-qPCR analyses have confirmed the microarray findings. We have identified a network of up-regulated genes implicated in different signaling pathways that may explain the cytotoxic effects exerted by Onconase. Among these genes, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) plays a central role in the key events triggered by Onconase in treated cancer cells that finally lead to apoptosis. This mechanism, mediated by ATF3, is cell-type independent. Up-regulation of ATF3 may also explain the antiviral properties of this ribonuclease because this factor is involved in halting viral genome replication, keeping virus latency or preventing viral oncogenesis. Finally, Onconase-regulated genes are different from those affected by nuclear-directed ribonucleases.","output":"Activating transcription factor 3 is crucial for antitumor activity and to strengthen the antiviral properties of Onconase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas, which involve the heart in up to 25% of patients. Cardiac sarcoidosis can lead to life threatening arrhythmias and heart failure. While corticosteroids have been used as a treatment for over 50 years, they are associated with hypertension, diabetes, and weight gain, further increasing cardiovascular risk. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is the prototypical proinflammatory cytokine that works to activate the nuclear transcription factor NF-kB, one of the targets of glucocorticoids. IL-1 also plays an important role also in the pathophysiology of heart disease including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and myocarditis. METHODS: Building on a network of research collaborators developed in the Cardiac Sarcoidosis Consortium, we will investigate the feasibility and tolerability of treatment of CS with anakinra at two National Institute of Health Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs with expertise in cardiac sarcoidosis. In this pilot study, up to 28 patients with cardiac sarcoidosis will be recruited to compare the administration of an IL-1 blocker, anakinra, 100 mg daily on top of standard of care versus standard of care only for 28 days and followed for 180 days. Utilizing surrogate endpoints of changes in systemic inflammatory biomarkers and cardiac imaging, we aim to determine whether IL-1 blockade with anakinra can combat systemic and cardiac inflammation in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis.

Cyclic oligochalcogenides (COCs) have been identified as privileged scaffolds to enable and inhibit thiol-mediated uptake because they can act as dynamic covalent cascade exchangers, i.e., every exchange produces a new, covalently tethered exchanger. In this study, our focus is on the essentially unexplored COCs of higher oxidation levels. Quantitative characterization of the underlying dynamic covalent exchange cascades reveals that the initial ring opening of cyclic thiosulfonates (CTOs) proceeds at a high speed even at a low pH. The released sulfinates exchange with disulfides in aprotic but much less in protic environments. Hydrophobic domains were thus introduced to direct CTOs into hydrophobic pockets to enhance their reactivity. Equipped with such directing groups, fluorescently labeled CTOs entered the cytosol of living cells more efficiently than the popular asparagusic acid. Added as competitive agents, CTOs inhibit the uptake of various COC transporters and SARS-CoV-2 lentivectors. Orthogonal trends found with different transporters support the existence of multiple cellular partners to account for the diverse expressions of thiol-mediated uptake. Dominant self-inhibition and high activity of dimers imply selective and synergistic exchange in hydrophobic pockets as distinguishing characteristics of thiol-mediated uptake with CTOs. The best CTO dimers with hydrophobic directing groups inhibit the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 lentivectors with an IC(50) significantly lower than the previous best CTO, below the 10 M threshold and better than ebselen.

However, the industry is sensitive to external shocks such as natural and/or human-induced disasters. This book documented the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global tourism industry. This chapter (also serving as a policy brief) presents emerging key findings and conclusions, as well as policy recommendations that are embedded within the Sendai Framework of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and management. Drawing from past disasters, the emphasis is placed on building back better (BBB) global tourism systems post-COVID-19. The decision to pivot the chapter on the DRR and management framework that embraces the BBB concept is informed by the inevitable new global normal. The new global normal is characterised by increasing and more intense disasters across all spatial levels, from a local to a global scale, which normally results in severe negative impacts on all economic sectors as experienced during the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in 2004 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019/2020. This orientation is further informed by the futuristic thinking that incorporates matters of building resilience and adaptation to disaster risks within the tourism industry. Therefore, the chapter provides the tourism industry and its key stakeholders with both immediate ideas for quick and big wins post-COVID-19 recovery pathways and future ideas to build resilience that permits adaptation of the tourism industry to future disasters. The development of globally accepted protocols enhancing health and safety, especially for the tourist and those working in the tourism and related industries, is recommended. Should these measures be fully upheld, then international travel, which is critical in the tourism sector, may resume sooner rather than later, with spill over effects on exciting domestic tourism too.","output":"Conclusions and Policy Recommendations: Building Back Better Global Tourism Systems Post-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of X-ray crystal structure models continues to provide a strong stimulus to drug discovery, through the direct visualisation of ligandCreceptor interactions.

The maximum cumulative clinician-reported grade  2 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Scale v. 5.0) acute genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were 11.8% (6/51) and 2.0% (1/51), respectively, while grade  2 subacute GU and GI toxicities were 2.3% (1/43) each. Patient-reported urinary, bowel, and hormonal domain summary scores were reduced at 1 month, then gradually returned to baseline levels, with the exception of the sexual domain. The finding of low toxicity supports the accumulation of clinical evidence for 1.5T MRgSBRT in localized PC. ABSTRACT: Background: Magnetic resonance-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (MRgSBRT) offers the potential for achieving better prostate cancer (PC) treatment outcomes. This study reports the preliminary clinical results of 1.5T MRgSBRT in localized PC, based on both clinician-reported outcome measurement (CROM) and patient-reported outcome measurement (PROM). Methods: Fifty-one consecutive localized PC patients were prospectively enrolled with a median follow-up of 199 days. MRgSBRT was delivered in five fractions of 7.25C8 Gy with daily online adaptation. Clinician-reported gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) adverse events based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Scale v. 5.0 were assessed. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Questionnaire was collected at baseline, 1 month, and every 3 months thereafter. Serial prostate-specific antigen measurements were longitudinally recorded. Results: The maximum cumulative clinician-reported grade  2 acute GU and GI toxicities were 11.8% (6/51) and 2.0% (1/51), respectively, while grade  2 subacute GU and GI toxicities were 2.3% (1/43) each. Patient-reported urinary, bowel, and hormonal domain summary scores were reduced at 1 month, then gradually returned to baseline levels, with the exception of the sexual domain. Domain-specific subscale scores showed similar longitudinal changes. All patients had early post-MRgSBRT biochemical responses.

Protection against viruses and often even their deactivation is one of a great variety of graphene applications. The structural changes of the non-glycosylated monomer of the spike glycoprotein trimer (denoted as S-protein in this work) triggered by its adsorption onto graphene at the initial stage are investigated by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The adsorption of the S-protein happens readily during the first 10 ns. The shape of the S-protein becomes more prolate during the adsorption but this trend, albeit less pronounced, is observed also for the freely relaxing S-protein in water. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the free and adsorbed S-protein manifests itself as the most rigid fragment of the whole S-protein. The adsorption even enhances the rigidity of the whole S-protein as well as its subunits. Only one residue of RBD involved in the specific interactions with ACE2 during the cell infection is involved in the direct contact of the adsorbed S-protein with the graphene. The new intramolecular hydrogen bonds formed during the S-protein adsorption replace the S-protein-water hydrogen bonds; this trend though less apparent, is observed also during the relaxation of the free S-protein in water. In the initial phase, the secondary structure of the RBD fragment specifically interacting with ACE2 receptor is not affected during the S-protein adsorption onto the graphene.","output":"Structural Behavior of Monomer of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein during Initial Stage of Adsorption on Graphene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In coping with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, cities adopted social isolation and lockdown measures; however, little is known about the impacts of these restrictions on household food security. OBJECTIVE: This study provides a timely assessment of household food insecurity (HFI) in the Chinese city of Wuhan during the COVID-19 epidemic period and also investigates its determinant factors. DESIGN: We collected valid data on food insecurity from 653 households in Wuhan via an online questionnaire in March 2020. The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale Score (HFIASS) was used to measure HFI, and a multiple linear regression model was used to determine the HFIASS. RESULTS: The mean HFIASS in Wuhan was 9.42 (standard deviation: 5.82), with more than 50% of the households had an HFIASS < 9. Compared with normal conditions, lockdown measures had a huge negative impact on household food security. The results revealed that socio-demographic characteristics remained the underlying determinants of HFIASS during the epidemic. Households in Wuhan with local Hukou (city household registration) and self-owned property had a lower risk of food insecurity. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: After the restriction of conventional food access channels, intermediary food purchase methods such as group purchasing, shopping with the help of neighborhood committees, property management agents, and volunteers became the most important or the only channel for residents to access food. There were similarities in the use of these intermediary channels. Based on the probability that the epidemic will continue and the probability of similar public health-related outbreaks in the future, the study calls for a more resilient and responsive sustainable food supply system by harnessing the capacity of communities, e-commerce and rapid logistics.","output":"Factors determining household-level food insecurity during COVID-19 epidemic: a case of Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been confirmed to be a novel coronavirus (CoV), namely SARS-CoV. Developing safe and effective SARS-CoV vaccines is essential for us to prevent the possible reemergence of its epidemic. Previous experiences indicate that inactivated vaccine is conventional and more hopeful to be successfully developed. Immunogenicity evaluation of an experimental inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in rabbits was conducted and reported in this paper. METHODS The large-scale cultured SARS-CoV F69 strain was inactivated with 0.4% formaldehyde and purified, then used as the immunogen combined with Freund's adjuvant. Eight adult New Zealand rabbits were immunized four times with this experimental inactivated vaccine. Twelve sets of rabbit serum were sampled from the third day to the seventy-fourth day after the first vaccination. The titers of specific anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody were determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the neutralizing antibody titers were detected with micro-cytopathic effect neutralization test. RESULTS Rapid and potent humoral immune responses were induced by the inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in all the eight test rabbits. Titers of both specific IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody peaked at about six weeks after first vaccination, with the maximum value of 1:81 920 and 1:20 480, respectively. After that, serum antibody levels remained at a plateau or had a slight decrease, though two boosters were given in the succedent 4 to 5 weeks. Cross neutralization response existed between SARS-CoV F69 strain and Z2-Y3 strain. CONCLUSIONS The inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine made from F69 strain owns strong immunogenicity, and the cross neutralization response between the two different SARS-CoV strains gives a hint of the similar neutralizing epitopes, which provide stable bases for the development of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines.","output":"Humoral immune responses in rabbits induced by an experimental inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine prepared from F69 strain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity and its associated diseases represent a growing health concern. Despite a strong correlation between gut microbiota and obesity, a limited study is available to suggest the direct involvement of fungus in host physiology. Candida albicans survives as a commensal fungus in the gastrointestinal tract, and its excessive growth causing infections in immune-suppressed individuals is widely accepted. However, any mutualistic relationship that may exist between C. albicans and the host remains outstanding. Here we show that the dietary C. albicans do not cause any noticeable infections, and our metagenomics analyses suggest that it colonizes in the gut and modulates microbiome dynamics which in turn negates the high-fat diet induced uncontrolled body weight gain, metabolic hormonal imbalances, and inflammatory response. Interestingly, adding C. albicans to a non-obesogenic diet stimulates the appetite regulated hormones and helped the mice gain healthy body weight. In concert, our results suggest a mutualism between C. albicans and the host, therefore, contrary to the notion, C. albicans is not always an adversary rather a bonafide admirable companion of the host.

Most recently, digital contact-tracing apps have been developed to collect individuals' donated contact and health data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. As the effectiveness of contact-tracing apps hinges critically on widespread app installation and continuous usage, we investigate whether monetary incentives can stimulate adoption and data donations: In a randomized controlled online experiment, the effects of different monetary incentive mechanisms on participants' verified installations as well as short- and long-term usage of the German Corona-Warn-App (CWA) are evaluated. We find monetary incentives to be effective in the short run as they significantly increase app installations and app usage 14 days after installation, tripling the number of users compared to no compensation. An additional choice of non-monetary compensation in the form of an optional charity donation is found to be ineffective in promoting installations or usage beyond outcomes of monetary incentives, suggesting that there is no substantial crowding-out of intrinsic motives in the short run. However, the positive adoption stimulus of monetary incentives vanishes in the long run: After eight months, adopters in treatments with extrinsic monetary incentives are significantly more likely to have stopped using the app than intrinsically motivated adopters who do not receive monetary incentives. This suggests that one-time payments are not sufficient to promote app usage and continuous data donations in the long run. Finally, we present experimental evidence that empirical analyses based on hypothetical scenarios without verified actions are prone to over-estimating individuals' pro-social behavior in the context of data donations.","output":"Data Donations for Digital Contact-Tracing: Short- and Long-term Effects of Monetary Incentives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant recipients are considered to be at high-risk of developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related complications. The optimal treatment for this patient group is unknown. Consequently, the treatment of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients should be determined individually, considering patient age and comorbidities, as well as graft function, time of transplant, and immunosuppressive treatment. Immunosuppressive treatments may give rise to severe COVID-19. On the contrary, they may also lead to a milder and atypical presentation by diminishing the immune system overdrive. CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year old female kidney transplant recipient presented to the transplant clinic with a progressive dry cough and fever that started three days ago. Although the COVID-19 test was found to be negative, chest computed tomography images showed consolidation typical of the disease; thus, following hospital admission, anti-bacterial and COVID-19 treatments were initiated. However, despite clinical improvement of the lung consolidation, her creatinine levels continued to increase. Ultrasound of the graft showed no pathology. The tacrolimus blood level was determined and the elevation in creatinine was found to be related to an interaction between tacrolimus and azithromycin. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, various single or combination drugs have been utilized to find an effective treatment regimen. This has increased the possibility of drug interactions. A limited number of studies published in the literature have highlighted some of these pharmacokinetic interactions. Treatments used for COVID-19 therapy; azithromycin, atazanavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, ribavirin, and tocilizumab, interact with immunosuppressive treatments, most importantly with calcineurin inhibitors.

We examined the role of PTX3 in Coronavirus murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1)-induced acute lung injury, a previously reported animal model for SARS. PTX3 deficient mice (129/SvEv/C57BL6/J) and their wild type littermates were intranasally infected MHV-1. These mice were also treated with recombinant PTX3. Effects of PTX3 on viral binding and infectivity were determined in vitro. Cytokine expression, severity of lung injury, leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses were examined in vivo. In PTX3wild type mice, MHV -1 induced PTX3 expression in the lung and serum in a time dependent manner. MHV-1 infection led to acute lung injury with greater severity in PTX3 deficient mice than that in wild type mice. PTX3 deficiency enhanced early infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung. PTX3 bound to MHV-1 and MHV-3 and reduced MHV-1 infectivity in vitro. Administration of recombinant PTX3 significantly accelerated viral clearance in the lung; attenuated MHV-1 induced lung injury, and reduced early neutrophil influx and elevation of inflammatory mediators in the lung.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is primarily spread person to person through respiratory droplets. Nationwide, the meat and poultry processing industry, an essential component of the U.S. food infrastructure, employs approximately 500,000 persons, many of whom work in proximity to other workers (1). Because of reports of initial cases of COVID-19, in some meat processing facilities, states were asked to provide aggregated data concerning the number of meat and poultry processing facilities affected by COVID-19 and the number of workers with COVID-19 in these facilities, including COVID-19-related deaths. Qualitative data gathered by CDC during on-site and remote assessments were analyzed and summarized. During April 9-27, aggregate data on COVID-19 cases among 115 meat or poultry processing facilities in 19 states were reported to CDC. Among these facilities, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 4,913 (approximately 3%) workers, and 20 COVID-19-related deaths were reported. Facility barriers to effective prevention and control of COVID-19 included difficulty distancing workers at least 6 feet (2 meters) from one another (2) and in implementing COVID-19-specific disinfection guidelines.* Among workers, socioeconomic challenges might contribute to working while feeling ill, particularly if there are management practices such as bonuses that incentivize attendance. Methods to decrease transmission within the facility include worker symptom screening programs, policies to discourage working while experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and social distancing by workers. Source control measures (e.g., the use of cloth face covers) as well as increased disinfection of high-touch surfaces are also important means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Mitigation efforts to reduce transmission in the community should also be considered. Many of these measures might also reduce asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (3).

METHODS: We surveyed all physicians (N=148), from October 17 to 25, 2020, who attended the clinical informatics PhD program at West China Medical School, Sichuan University, China. The physicians came from 57 hospitals in 16 provinces (ie, municipalities) across China, 54 of which are 3A-level hospitals, two are 3B-level hospitals, and one is a 2A-level hospital. RESULTS: Among 148 physicians, a survey response rate of 87.2% (129/148) was attained.

The consequence is that we have more clinical data on COVID-19 than on any other epidemic in history, but we have failed to analyze this information quickly enough to make a difference. In this viewpoint, we expose this situation and suggest concrete ideas that health systems could implement to dynamically analyze their routine clinical data, becoming learning health systems and reversing the current situation.","output":"Why We Are Losing the War Against COVID-19 on the Data Front and How to Reverse the Situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Optimisation of antibiotic prescribing is critical to combat antimicrobial resistance.

These themes focused on clinicians views about proposed trial design and novel POCTs, clinicians perspectives about trial set-up, and specific trial procedures. Participants were overall positive about the proposed trial and POCTs. Potential issues centred around the limited space and technology available and participant retention to follow-up. Additionally, impact on clinic workload was an important consideration.

Recent studies found platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) in both clinically ill Covid-19 patients and vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) patients. Here, we use various tools to identify the binding reaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SP) with PF4 that results in immunogenic platelet-activating PF4/SP complexes. This binding is evidenced by an increase in mass, optical intensity, and stable binding force observed by quartz crystal microbalance, enzyme immune assay, and force spectroscopy, respectively. The SP induced an increase in the size of PF4 and switched the surface zeta potential of the PF4 from positive to negative values as evaluated by dynamic light scattering. The SP-induced platelet aggregation was identified by functional assay and flow cytometry but in a concentration-dependent manner. Our results indicated that the formed PF4/SP complexes can, on one hand, trigger the formation of PF4-antibodies and on the other hand mediate/activate platelets followed by inducing thrombotic events, which is the mechanism for excessive procoagulant activity observed in Covid-19 patients. With vector-based vaccines, we suggest that soluble SP are produced during the transcription process, forming antigenic PF4/SP complexes that result in a high rate of clotting effects in vaccinated individuals with Ad26.COV2.S and ChAdOx1nCoV-19 vaccines. An additional consideration of PF4/SP complexes in the current guidelines for the diagnosis of VITT will improve the treatment in patients.

Therefore, different scientific discovery strategies need to be connected, to generate a rational treatment which can be made available as rapidly as possible. This relies on a solid theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and host responses, which is coupled to the practical experience of clinicians that are treating patients. Because SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), targeting ACE2 to prevent such binding seems an obvious strategy to combat infection. However, ACE2 performs its functions outside the cell and was found to enter the cell only by angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-induced endocytosis, after which ACE2 is destroyed. This means that preventing uptake of ACE2 into the cell by blocking AT1R would be a more logical approach to limit entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell. Since ACE2 plays an important protective role in maintaining key biological processes, treatments should not disrupt the functional capacity of ACE2, to counterbalance the negative effects of the infection. Based on known mechanisms and knowledge of the characteristics of SARS-CoV we propose the hypothesis that the immune system facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication which disrupts immune regulatory mechanisms. The proposed mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes disease immediately suggests a possible treatment, since the AT1R is a key player in this whole process. AT1R antagonists appear to be the ideal candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AT1R antagonists counterbalance the negative consequences of angiotesnin II and, in addition, they might even be involved in preventing the cellular uptake of the virus without interfering with ACE2 function. AT1R antagonists are widely available, cheap, and safe. Therefore, we propose to consider using AT1R antagonists in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"The mechanistic overview of SARS-CoV-2 using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to enter the cell for replication: possible treatment options related to the reninCangiotensin system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human health is increasingly threatened by rapid and widespread changes in the environment and climate, including rising temperatures, air and water pollution, disease vector migration, floods, and droughts.

With symptoms, which are very similar to the ones reported but are not caused by SARS-CoV-2, the occurrence of functionally active autoantibodies (fAABs) targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR-fAABs) has been discussed to be involved. We, therefore investigated, whether GPCR-fAABs are detectable in 31 patients suffering from different Long-COVID-19 symptoms after recovery from the acute phase of the disease. The spectrum of symptoms was mostly of neurological origin (29/31 patients), including post-COVID-19 fatigue, alopecia, attention deficit, tremor and others. Combined neurological and cardiovascular disorders were reported in 17 of the 31 patients. Two recovered COVID-19 patients were free of follow-up symptoms. All 31 former COVID-19 patients had between 2 and 7 different GPCR-fAABs that acted as receptor agonists. Some of those GPCR-fAABs activate their target receptors which cause a positive chronotropic effect in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the read-out in the test system for their detection (bioassay for GPCR-fAAB detection). Other GPCR-fAABs, in opposite, cause a negative chronotropic effect on those cells. The positive chronotropic GPCR-fAABs identified in the blood of Long-COVID patients targeted the ?2-adrenoceptor (?2-fAAB), the &#945;1-adrenoceptor (&#945;1-fAAB), the angiotensin II AT1-receptor (AT1-fAAB), and the nociceptin-like opioid receptor (NOC-fAAB).

The topic is perceived to be of significant importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use data for more than 225 banks in 18 countries in the MENA region to test whether increased competition causes banks to hold higher capital ratios. Employing panel data techniques, and distinguishing between Islamic and conventional banks, we show that banks tend to hold higher capital ratios when operating in a more competitive environment. We also provide evidence that banks in the MENA region increase their capitalization levels in response to a higher risk and vice versa. Further, banking concentration (measured by the HH-index) and credit risk have a significant and positive impact on capital ratios of IBs, whereas competition does play a restrictive role in determining the level of their capital. The results hold when controlling for ownership structure, regulatory and institutional environment, bank-specific and macroeconomic characteristics.

The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors involved in developing air leaks and the consequences of PAL. METHODS All patients undergoing lung resection between January 2002 and December 2007 in our hospital were studied retrospectively. Univariate analysis to predict risk factors for developing post-operative air leaks included patient demographics, smoking status, pulmonary function tests, disease aetiology (benign, malignant), neoadjuvant therapy (pre-operative radiotherapy/chemotherapy), extent and type of resection, and different consultant surgeons' practice. A logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS A total of 1,911 lung resections were performed over the 6-year study period. An air leak lasting more than 6 days post-operatively was present in 129 patients (6.7%). This included 100 out of the 1,250 patients (8%) from the lobectomy group and 29 out of the 661 patients (4.4%) from the wedge/segmentectomy group. Using the multivariate analysis, the risk factors for developing an air leak included a low predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (pFEV(1)) (p<0.001), performing an upper lobectomy (p=0.002) and different consultant practice (p=0.02). PAL was associated with increased length of stay (p<0.0001), in-hospital mortality (p=0.003) and intensive care unit readmission (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS Air leaks after pulmonary resections were at an acceptable rate in our series. Particular patients are at a higher risk but meticulous surgical technique is vital in reducing their incidence.

The authors present American adult educator Jack Mezirows theory of transformative learning (TL) as an appropriate learning framework for lifelong learning. They draw on the work of American philosopher Richard Rorty and German philosopher and sociologist Jrgen Habermas to re-shape TL so that it supports the kind of learning that is sufficiently complex and nuanced to enable us to deal with contradictions, ambivalence and meaning-making in a world where not-knowing is the new normal.","output":"Transformative dimensions of lifelong learning: Mezirow, Rorty and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Immunogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has waning antibody over time. With the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant, which requires higher neutralizing antibody to prevent infection, a booster dose is needed. Objective: To evaluate immunogenicity and reactogenicity of standard- versus low-dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine booster after CoronaVac in healthy adults. Methods: A double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of adult, aged 18-59 years, with completion of 2-dose CoronaVac at 21-28 days apart for more than 2 months was conducted. Participants were randomized to receive AZD1222 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) intramuscularly; standard dose (SD, 5x1010 viral particles) or low dose (LD, 2.5x1010 viral particles). Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) against wild type and delta variant, and anti-spike-receptor-binding-domain IgG (anti-S-RBD IgG) were compared as geometric mean ratio (GMR) at day 14 and 90 between LD and SD arms. Results: From July-August 2021, 422 adults with median age of 44 (IQR 36-51) years were enrolled. The median interval from CoronaVac to AZD1222 booster was 77 (IQR 64-95) days. At baseline, geometric means (GMs) of sVNT against delta variant and anti-S-RBD IgG were 18.1%inhibition (95%CI 16.4-20.0) and 111.5 (105.1-118.3) BAU/ml. GMs of sVNT against delta variant and anti-S-RBD IgG in SD were 95.6%inhibition (95%CI 94.3-97.0) and 1975.1 (1841.7-2118.2) BAU/ml at day 14, and 89.4%inhibition (86.4-92.4) and 938.6 (859.9-1024.4) BAU/ml at day 90, respectively. GMRs of sVNT against delta variant and anti-S-RBD IgG in LD compared to SD were 1.00 (95%CI 0.98-1.02) and 0.84 (0.76-0.93) at day 14, and 0.98 (0.94-1.03) and 0.89 (0.79-1.00) at day 90, respectively. LD recipients had significantly lower rate of fever (6.8%vs25.0%) and myalgia (51.9%vs70.7%) compared to SD. Conclusion: Half-dose AZD1222 booster after 2-dose inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination had non-inferior immunogenicity, yet lower systemic reactogenicity. Fractional low-dose AZD1222 booster should be considered especially in resource-constrained settings.","output":"A randomized clinical trial of a booster dose with low versus standard dose of AZD1222 in adult after 2 doses of inactivated vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we examine the relationship between global stock markets, as respectively represented by the FTSE All-World Series and the MSCI Emerging Markets indexes, and the S&P GSCI Precious Metals index from 01 September 1999 to 03 May 2021. We employ the conditional correlation multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) to investigate this stock-precious metals nexus in terms of return and volatility spillovers. The study assesses impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the stock-precious metals nexus and further examine this relationship by supplementing the Twitters Daily Happiness Sentiment index to the methodological framework for the period from 01 January 2020 to 03 May 2021. We find that precious metals positively influence stock markets before the Covid-19 outbreak and firmly play a valuable role due to their hedge and safe haven characteristics. In contrast, the bivariate GARCH framework does not provide statistically significant evidence on the stock-precious metals nexus during the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the tri-variate GARCH approach with stock markets, precious metals, and happiness sentiment indexes reveals sufficiently complicated interactions between these return series. Prominently, past change in the happiness index negatively affects the stock returns but positively drives the performance of precious metals. These findings indirectly demonstrate the stock-precious metals nexus under impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and reflect the demand of precious metals during crisis periods. Accordingly, we suggest a reasonable method of adjusting the proxies when no interaction effect is significantly found during unprecedented outbreaks.","output":"The relationship between global stock and precious metals under Covid-19 and happiness perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Integrated community healthcare Hubs may offer a 'one stop shop' for service users with complex health and social needs, and more efficiently use service resources. Various policy imperatives exist to implement Hub models of care, however, there is a dearth of research specifically evaluating Hubs targeted at families experiencing adversity. To contribute to building this evidence, we propose to co-design, test and evaluate integrated Hub models of care in two Australian community health services in low socioeconomic areas that serve families experiencing adversity: Wyndham Vale in Victoria and Marrickville in New South Wales. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This multisite convergent mixed-methods study will run over three phases to (1) develop the initial Hub programme theory through formative research; (2) test and, then, (3) refine the Hub theory using empirical data. Phase 1 involves co-design of each Hub with caregivers, community members and practitioners. Phase 2 uses caregiver and Hub practitioner surveys at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after Hub implementation, and in-depth interviews at 12 months. Two stakeholder groups will be recruited: caregivers (n=100-200 per site) and Hub practitioners (n=20-30 per site). The intervention is a co-located Hub providing health, social, legal and community services with no comparator. The primary outcomes are caregiver-reported: (i) identification of, (ii) interventions received and/or (iii) referrals received for adversity from Hub practitioners. The study also assesses child, caregiver, practitioner and system outcomes including mental health, parenting, quality of life, care experience and service linkages. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed by examining change in proportions/means from baseline to 6 months, from 6 to 12 months and from baseline to 12 months. Service linkages will be analysed using social network analysis. Costs of Hub implementation and a health economics analysis of unmet need will be conducted. Thematic analysis will be employed to analyse qualitative data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Royal Children's Hospital and Sydney Local Health District ethics committees have approved the study (HREC/62866/RCHM-2020). Participants and stakeholders will receive results through meetings, presentations and publications.

It is important to understand dialysis and transplant center providers existing practices and identified barriers to increasing the number of dialysis patients who are evaluated for and get wait-listed for a transplant. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of dialysis unit and transplant center staff in End Stage Renal Disease Network 6 (Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina). SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-one transplant staff from all 9 transplant centers in the region and 421 dialysis staff from 421 facilities responded to the survey. PREDICTORS: N/A OUTCOME: Provider perceptions of barriers faced by patients in the kidney transplant evaluation process and suggestions for improving care. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Mixed methods. Descriptive analyses of responses to multiple-choice questions and qualitative analysis of open-ended survey responses. RESULTS: The top 5 barriers to kidney transplantation as reported by transplant staff were transportation (63.7%), low health literacy (50.5%), lack of understanding about the transplant process (37.4%), distance to transplant center (29.7%), and low socioeconomic status (28.6%). When asked how dialysis units can help patients complete the evaluation process, the most common responses from transplant center staff were educating patients about transplant (54%), helping patients through steps in the process (35%), and better communication with transplant centers (15%). When dialysis unit staff were asked what could be done to help the facility improve its transplant wait-list rate, the most common responses were educational materials for patients and staff (55%), better communication with transplant centers (12%), and transportation and financial assistance (9%).

However, it is unclear whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, gains access to the CNS and whether it causes neuropathological changes. We investigated the brain tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 for glial responses, inflammatory changes, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS. METHODS: In this post-mortem case series, we investigated the neuropathological features in the brains of patients who died between March 13 and April 24, 2020, in Hamburg, Germany. Inclusion criteria comprised a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and availability of adequate samples. We did a neuropathological workup including histological staining and immunohistochemical staining for activated astrocytes, activated microglia, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the olfactory bulb, basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum. Additionally, we investigated the presence and localisation of SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR and by immunohistochemistry in selected patients and brain regions. FINDINGS: 43 patients were included in our study. Patients died in hospitals, nursing homes, or at home, and were aged between 51 years and 94 years (median 76 years [IQR 70C86]). We detected fresh territorial ischaemic lesions in six (14%) patients. 37 (86%) patients had astrogliosis in all assessed regions. Activation of microglia and infiltration by cytotoxic T lymphocytes was most pronounced in the brainstem and cerebellum, and meningeal cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration was seen in 34 (79%) patients. SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the brains of 21 (53%) of 40 examined patients, with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins found in cranial nerves originating from the lower brainstem and in isolated cells of the brainstem. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS was not associated with the severity of neuropathological changes. INTERPRETATION: In general, neuropathological changes in patients with COVID-19 seem to be mild, with pronounced neuroinflammatory changes in the brainstem being the most common finding. There was no evidence for CNS damage directly caused by SARS-CoV-2. The generalisability of these findings needs to be validated in future studies as the number of cases and availability of clinical data were low and no age-matched and sex-matched controls were included.

This approach is not justified in children less than 2 years of age and this for several reasons. First, AOM is an acute inflammation of the middle ear caused in about 70% of cases by bacteria. Redness and bulging of the tympanic membrane are characteristic findings in bacterial AOM. Second, AOM is associated with long-term dysfunction of the inflamed eustachian tube (ET), particularly in children less than 2 years of age. In this age group, the small calibre of the ET together with its horizontal direction result in impaired clearance, ventilation and protection of the middle ear. Third, recent prospective studies have shown poor long-term prognosis of AOM in children below 2 years with at least 50% of recurrences and persisting otitis media with effusion (OME) in about 35% 6 months after AOM. Viruses elicit AOM in about 30% of children. A prolonged course of AOM has been observed when bacterial and viral infections are combined because viral infection is also associated with ET dysfunction in young children. Bacterial and viral testing of the nasopharyngeal aspirate is an excellent tool both for initial treatment and recurrence of AOM. Antibiotic treatment of AOM is mandatory in children less than 2 years of age to decrease inflammation in the middle ear but also of the ET particularly during the first episode. The best choice is amoxicillin because of its superior penetration in the middle ear. Streptococci pneumoniae with intermediary bacterial resistance to penicillin are particularly associated with recurrent AOM. Therefore the dosage of amoxicillin should be 90 mg/kg per day in three doses. In recurrent AOM with -lactamase-producing bacilli, amoxicillin should be associated with clavulanic acid at a dose of 6.4 mg/kg per day. The duration of the treatment is not established yet but 10 days is reasonable for a first episode of AOM. OME may be a precursor initiating AOM but also a complication thereof. OME needs a watchful waiting approach. When associated with deafness for 2C3 months in children over 2 years of age, an antibiotic should be given according to the results of the bacterial resistance in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. The high rate of complications of tympanostomy tube insertion outweighs the beneficial effect on hearing loss. The poor results of this procedure are due to the absence of effects on ET dysfunction. Pneumococcal vaccination has little beneficial effects on recurrent AOM and its use in infants needs further studies. Treatment with amoxicillin is indicated in all children younger than 2 years with a first episode of AOM presenting with redness and bulging of the tympanic membrane. Combined amoxicillin and clavulanic acid should be given in patients with -lactamase-producing bacteria. The duration of treatment is estimated to be at least 10 days depending on the findings by pneumo-otoscopy and tympanometry. Bacterial and viral testing of the nasopharyngeal aspirate is highly recommended particularly in children in day care centres as well as for regular follow-up. The high recurrence rate is due to the long-lasting dysfunction of the eustachian tube and the immune immaturity of children less than 2 years of age.","output":"What is new in otitis media?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the global shortage of PPE caused by increasing number of COVID-19 patients in recent months, many hospitals have had difficulty procuring adequate PPE for the clinicians who care for these patients.

The impact of SG formation on virus replication varies among different viruses, and the significance of SGs in coronavirus (CoV) replication is largely unknown. The present study examined the biological role of SGs in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV replication. The MERS-CoV 4a accessory protein is known to inhibit SG formation in cells in which it was expressed by binding to double-stranded RNAs and inhibiting protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated phosphorylation of the  subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Replication of MERS-CoV lacking the genes for 4a and 4b (MERS-CoV-p4), but not MERS-CoV, induced SG accumulation in MERS-CoV-susceptible HeLa/CD26 cells, while replication of both viruses failed to induce SGs in Vero cells, demonstrating cell type-specific differences in MERS-CoV-p4-induced SG formation. MERS-CoV-p4 replicated less efficiently than MERS-CoV in HeLa/CD26 cells, and inhibition of SG formation by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of the SG components promoted MERS-CoV-p4 replication, demonstrating that SG formation was detrimental for MERS-CoV replication. Inefficient MERS-CoV-p4 replication was not due to either the induction of type I and type III interferons or the accumulation of viral mRNAs in the SGs. Rather, it was due to the inefficient translation of viral proteins, which was caused by high levels of PKR-mediated eIF2 phosphorylation and likely by the confinement of various factors that are required for translation in the SGs. Finally, we established that deletion of the 4a gene alone was sufficient for inducing SGs in infected cells. Our study revealed that 4a-mediated inhibition of SG formation facilitates viral translation, leading to efficient MERS-CoV replication.IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes respiratory failure with a high case fatality rate in patients, yet effective antivirals and vaccines are currently not available. Stress granule (SG) formation is one of the cellular stress responses to virus infection and is generally triggered as a result of stress-induced translation arrest. SGs can be beneficial or detrimental for virus replication, and the biological role of SGs in CoV infection is unclear. The present study showed that the MERS-CoV 4a accessory protein, which was reported to block SG formation in cells in which it was expressed, inhibited SG formation in infected cells. Our data suggest that 4a-mediated inhibition of SG formation facilitates the translation of viral mRNAs, resulting in efficient virus replication. To our knowledge, this report is the first to show the biological significance of SG in CoV replication and provides insight into the interplay between MERS-CoV and antiviral stress responses.","output":"Inhibition of Stress Granule Formation by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 4a Accessory Protein Facilitates Viral Translation, Leading to Efficient Virus Replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: This study aims to compare inflammatory parameters in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)-infected pregnant women and age-matched nonpregnant women. Materials and methods: It was a cross-sectional study, and data were collected retrospectively. Pregnant women (cases) with COVID infection admitted to the hospital between July 2020 and December 2020 were included in the study. Age-matched nonpregnant women who were also COVID-positive were taken as controls. Their demographic data, comorbidities, and inflammatory markers were compared. The results were compared using descriptive analysis (clinical profile and outcome of patients). Bivariate analysis was done using Chi-square/Fischer exact test;t-test was used to compare the mean biochemical/pathological parameters between the groups. The clinical outcomes (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, O2 requirement, and mortality) were also noted. Results: A total of 228 women (116 pregnant and 112 nonpregnant) were enrolled in the study. The average age of cases was 27 years, while that of controls was 29 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of comorbidities (anemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypothyroidism) between the two groups. Compared to the controls, pregnant women did not have any significant difference in the levels of D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and serum ferritin, but there were significant differences (p <0.05) in the values of total count neutrophils, lymphocytes, interleukin-6, and international normalized ratio. We did not have any mortality in either group, and only one patient from the study group needed ICU admission.

In contrast, cells with the O-2A progenitor phenotype (O4 + only) were increased in number at one week post viral inoculation (1 WPI) and were the only immunostained cells labeled at that time by a 2-h in vivo pulse of tritiated thymidine. Both GFAP+ only and GFAP+, O4+ astrocytes were also increased in the spinal cord at 1 WPI. Between two and four WPI, the infected spinal cord was characterized by the loss of (CNP+, O4+) oligodendrocytes within demyelinating lesions and the presence of O-2A progenitor cells and O4+, GFAP+ astrocytes, both of which could be labeled with thymidine. As remyelination proceeded, CNP immunostaining returned to near normal and tritiated thymidine injected previously during the demyelinating phase now appeared in CNP+ oligodendrocytes. Thus O4 positive O-2A progenitor cells proliferate early in the course of the demyelinating disease, while CNP positive oligodendrocytes do not. The timing of events suggests that the O-2A progenitors may give rise to new oligodendrocytes and to type 2 astrocytes, both of which are likely to be instrumental in the remyelination process.","output":"In vivo analysis of glial cell phenotypes during a viral demyelinating disease in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are living an ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic which is associated with a considerable number of fatal cases worldwide1 .

In this study we aimed to evaluate the role of the arrival electrolytes and symptoms in prediction of Lung damage in CT scan based on the CO-RADS system. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analytical study. We included patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection, June 15 to July 7. Patients were included in study if there were no previous history of kidney disease. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and CO-RADS High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of lung report were collected. Univariate logistic regression was employed first to identify the effective, correlated items. All statistics were performed with SPSS version 18.0. Results: In the current study, 36 (20 male- 16 female) patients with mean age of the 54.7 (STD:17.5) years old were studied. Most common symptom at the arrival was the Fever (52.8%), followed by Fatigue (18%), and dyspnea (44.4%). Computed tomography assessment revealed CO-RADS 2 in 4 (11.1%) patients, CO-RADS 3 in 1 (2.8%), CO-RADS 4 in 20 (55.6%), and CO-RADS 5 in 11 (30.6%) patients. In the comparison with the study groups based on the HRCT status (CO-RADS II,III vs. CO-RADS IV,V), patients with severe HRCT damage had significantly lower level of Phosphorus (P<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that only one factors was associated with HRCT damage status (Phosphorus, P=0.040). Phosphorus upper than 4.5 was associated with better HRCT results with OR ratio of 3.71 (X2(1)=5.69; p=0.017).

Our goal is to further study the interaction mechanism of viruses in homologous, sensitive, and repeatable C6/36 cell vectors. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology was applied to the host transcript profiles of C6/36 cells infected with DENV2. Then, bioinformatics analysis was used to identify significant differentially expressed genes and the associated biological processes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to verify the sequencing data. A total of 1239 DEGs were found by transcriptional analysis of Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells that were infected and uninfected with dengue virus, among which 1133 were upregulated and 106 were downregulated. Further bioinformatics analysis showed that the upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in signaling pathways such as the MAPK, Hippo, FoxO, Wnt, mTOR, and Notch; metabolic pathways and cellular physiological processes such as autophagy, endocytosis, and apoptosis. Downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in DNA replication, pyrimidine metabolism, and repair pathways, including BER, NER, and MMR.

It has been reported previously that HBV invasion can extensively alter transcriptome, the proteome of exosomes and host cell lipid rafts. The impact of HBV on host proteins through regulating their global post-translational modifications (PTMs), however, is not well studied. Viruses have been reported to exploit cellular processes by enhancing or inhibiting the ubiquitination of specific substrates. Nevertheless, host cell physiology in terms of global proteome and ubiquitylome has not been addressed yet. Here by using HBV-integrated HepG2.2.15 model cell line we first report that HBV significantly modify the host global ubiquitylome. As currently the most widely used HBV cell culture model, HepG2.2.15 can be cultivated for multiple generations for protein labeling, and can replicate HBV, express HBV proteins and secrete complete HBV Dane particles, which makes it a suitable cell line for ubiquitylome analysis to study HBV replication, hepatocyte immune response and HBV-related HCC progression. Our previous experimental results showed that the total ubiquitination level of HepG2.2.15 cell line was significantly higher than that of the corresponding parental HepG2 cell line. By performing a Ubiscan quantification analysis based on stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) of HepG2.2.15 and HepG2 cell lines, we identified a total of 7188 proteins and the protein levels of nearly 19% of them were changed over 2-folds. We further identified 3798 ubiquitinated Lys sites in 1476 host proteins with altered ubiquitination in response to HBV. Our results also showed that the global proteome and ubiquitylome were negatively correlated, indicating that ubiquitination might be involved in the degradation of host proteins upon HBV integration. We first demonstrated the ubiquitination change of VAMP3, VAMP8, DNAJB6, RAB8A, LYN, VDAC2, OTULIN, SLC1A4, SLC1A5, HGS and TOLLIP. In addition, we described 5 novel host factors SLC1A4, SLC1A5, EIF4A1, TOLLIP and BRCC36 that efficiently reduced the amounts of secreted HBsAg and HBeAg. Overall, the HBV-mediated host proteome and ubiquitylome change we reported will provide a valuable resource for further investigation of HBV pathogenesis and host-virus interaction networks.

To understand the high morbidity mucormycosis coinfection, the cell surface Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (CS-GRP78) was docked to the virus ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 RBD to create the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-GRP78 complex which facilitates the virus entrance into the cell. The spore coat protein homolog 3 (CotH3) of mucormycosis was modeled and docked to the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-GRP78 complex. The binding energies of CotH3 with RBD, ACE2, and GRP78 were calculated. The binding results show that GRP78 substrate-binding domain beta weakly binds to the spike RBD combined with ACE2 of the spike RBD-ACE2 complex. Its main function is to stabilize the binding between RBD and ACE2, while CotH3 has a strong affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, but not for ACE2 or GRP78. The CotH3 appeared to have the same affinity to RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 lineages with some preference to the lineage B.1.617.2 (Delta variant).

KSK supplementation decreased LPS mediated TLR-4 production and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines including IL-6, TNF-, COX-2 and PGE-2. Moreover, it inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO) and thereby inhibited the expression of iNOS in the cell. The Western blot analysis further confirmed that KSK strongly prevented the LPS-induced degradation of IB which is normally required for the activation of NF-B and hereby suppressed nuclear translocation of NF-B. The protein expression of iNOS, COX-2 was significantly decreased with the presence of KSK treatment. Results suggested that KSK manipulates its anti-inflammatory effects mainly through blocking the TLR mediated NF-B signal transduction pathways. CONCLUSIONS: . Together, this study has proven that KSK could be a potential therapeutic drug for alleviating excessive inflammation in many inflammation-associated diseases like COVID-19.","output":"Anti-inflammatory effect of Kaba Sura Kudineer (AYUSH approved COVID-19 drug)-A Siddha poly-herbal formulation against lipopolysaccharide induced inflammatory response in RAW-264.7 macrophages cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most severe cases of COVID-19, and the highest rates of death, are among the elderly. There is an urgent need to search for an agent to treat the disease and control its progression. Boswellia serrata is traditionally used to treat chronic inflammatory diseases of the lung. This review aims to highlight currently published research that has shown evidence of potential therapeutic effects of boswellic acids (BA) and B. serrata extract against COVID-19 and associated conditions. We reviewed the published information up to March 2021. Studies were collected through a search of online electronic databases (academic libraries such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Egyptian Knowledge Bank). Several recent studies reported that BAs and B. serrata extract are safe agents and have multiple beneficial activities in treating similar symptoms experienced by patients with COVID-19. Because of the low oral bioavailability and improvement of buccal/oral cavity hygiene, traditional use by chewing B. serrata gum may be more beneficial than oral use. It is the cheapest option for a lot of poorer people. The promising effect of B. serrata and BA can be attributed to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, cardioprotective, anti-platelet aggregation, antibacterial, antifungal, and broad antiviral activity. B. serrata and BA act by multiple mechanisms. The most common mechanism may be through direct interaction with IB kinases and inhibiting nuclear factor-B-regulated gene expression. However, the most recent mechanism proposed that BA not only inhibited the formation of classical 5-lipoxygenase products but also produced anti-inflammatory LOX-isoform-selective modulators. In conclusion a small to moderate dose B. serrata extract may be useful in the enhancing adaptive immune response in mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19. However, large doses of BA may be beneficial in suppressing uncontrolled activation of the innate immune response. More clinical results are required to determine with certainty whether there is sufficient evidence of the benefits against COVID-19.","output":"Boswellic acids/Boswelliaserrata extract as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic agent in the elderly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study investigates the involvement of circadian rhythm in photoperiodic expressions of GnRH-I and GnIH in the hypothalamus controlling seasonal reproduction in the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus). Groups of photosensitive birds were exposed for four weeks to resonance light dark cycles comprising of a light phase of 6 h (L) combined with dark phase of different durations (D) such that the period of LD cycles varied by 12 h increments viz. 12- (6 L/6D), 24- (6 L/18D), 36- (6 L/30D), 48- (6 L/42D), 60- (6 L/54D) and 72- (6 L/66D)h. In addition, a control group (C) was maintained under long day length (14 L/10D). Observations, recorded at the beginning and end of experiment, revealed significant testicular growth with corresponding increase in the hypothalamic expression of GnRH-I peptide but low levels of GnIH mRNA and peptide in the birds exposed to resonance cycles of 12, 36 and 60 h which were read as long days. On the other hand, birds experiencing resonance cycles of 24, 48 and 72 h read them as short days wherein they maintained their quiescent gonads and low levels of GnRH-I peptide but exhibited significant increase in GnIH mRNA and peptide expressions. Thus, sparrows responded to resonance light dark cycles differently despite the fact that each of them contained only 6 h of light. These findings suggest that an endogenous circadian rhythm is involved in photoperiodic expressions of above molecules and indicate a shift in their expressions depending upon whether the light falls in the photoinducible or non-photoinducible phase of an endogenous circadian rhythm.","output":"Circadian rhythm in photoperiodic expressions of GnRH-I and GnIH regulating seasonal reproduction in the Eurasian tree sparrow, Passer montanus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global health problem and, given the high mortality and transmission rate of this infection and the lack of approved or specific treatments for it so far, the exploitation of the potentials of existing drugs is of paramount importance, hence, we aimed to investigate all possible COVID-19-related mechanisms of systemic retinoids We systematically searched all related evidence in various data bases about the effect of retinoic acids on respiratory failure as the most important COVID-19-related complication and the other important potentials of this drug to affect COVID pathomechanism Considering the various behaviors and presentations of this virus in different people, paying attention to the underlying diseases, physical conditions, genetics, and medications that cause these differences may be helpful in reducing the mortality and morbidity of the disease In the field of dermatology, retinoids are a group of drugs that have controversial evidence regarding their effects when administered to patients with COVID-19 On one hand, these drugs offer immunomodulatory, immune-enhancing, antiviral, and antiangiogenesis activity, and can stimulate the differentiation and repair of epithelial cells On the other hand, they can increase inflammation and cause the fragility of oral and nasal mucosae When prescribe systemic retinoids, all of these aspects should be considered in all fields of the medicine and dermatology is not an exception","output":"Systemic retinoids in the COVID-19 era - are they helpful, safe, or harmful?

With the introduction of external female urinary catheters, we can now substitute this type of device for an indwelling urinary catheter in many patients, decreasing their risk of catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). METHODS In this retrospective study, we analyzed the impact of a hospital-wide implementation of an external female urinary catheter at a large academic medical center. The study included female patients, greater than 18 years of age. We compared a 12-month period before and after device implementation to assess the impact on indwelling urinary catheter utilization and CAUTI rate. RESULTS Data included over 220,000 patient days, over 10,000 external urinary catheter days and 33,000 indwelling urinary catheter days. We found a statistically significant decrease in indwelling urinary catheter utilization following the implementation of the external female urinary catheter, but only in intensive care units.

At the same time, it also exposed the problems of the community prevention and control epidemic system in terms of infrastructure, human resources, and internal systems. Based on this, this article suggests that we should improve the hardware facilities of community, improve the internal mechanism of the community, strengthen the stability of the community talent team, improve the level of linkage between the community and other departments to prevent and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, effectively use information technology and actively mobilize social forces to help community prevention and control COVID-19.","output":"\\"A community system\\": A critical foundation for the epidemic prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Hypoglycaemia is a leading cause of admissions to neonatal units. A major risk factor for neonatal hypoglycaemia is maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Since 2013, diagnosis of GDM in the UK has relied upon the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 28 weeks of pregnancy. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, guidance released by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [RCOG] (2020) advised replacing OGTT with alternative measures such as HbA1C and random blood glucose (RBG) measurement. Objectives 1. Compare the number of neonatal admissions for hypoglycaemia to a level two unit before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2. Detect differences in diagnostic modalities used for gestational diabetes in mothers of newborns admitted with hypoglycaemia before and during COVID-19. 3. Compare outcomes of neonates admitted with hypoglycaemia before and during COVID-19. Methods Neonates admitted with hypoglycaemia to our unit during two time periods - April to August 2019 and April to August 2020 - were identified using an online portal and formed the two groups for auditing. Maternal and neonatal health records were then retrospectively reviewed to determine: (1) the presence of risk factors for GDM during pregnancy among mothers of neonates in both groups, and (2) the diagnostic methods for GDM performed in mothers of neonates in each group. We further collected data on selected outcomes for neonates, including length of stay, IV glucose delivery, umbilical venous cannulation (UVC) and parenteral feeding, in both groups. Results The number of neonatal admissions with hypoglycaemia to the unit doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic (group 2 [n=32] vs group 1 [n=17]). Fewer newborns admitted during COVID-19 had a mother with a diagnosis of GDM (group 2 [15.6%] vs group 1 [23.5%]) despite mothers of newborns in this group being more likely to be at risk for GDM (group 2 [69.6%] vs group 1 [64.3%]). In all, less OGTTs were performed in mothers of neonates admitted with hypoglycaemia during COVID-19 than before (group 2 [31.3%] vs group 1 [35.3%]) and HbA1C and RBG measurements were more likely to be performed (group 2 [25%] vs group 1 [0%] and group 2 [15.6%] vs group 1 [11.8%], respectively). Nevertheless, median length of admission for newborns was shorter during the COVID- 19 pandemic (group 2 [4 days;IQR 2-16] vs group 1 [7 days;IQR 3-11.5]) and the proportion receiving treatments such as intravenous glucose did not increase [53.1% vs 58.8%]). Conclusions The number of admissions to NICU of newborns with hypoglycaemia increased considerably during the COVID- 19 pandemic. This rise is likely, at least in part, to reflect missed diagnoses of GDM in pregnancy, resulting in less access to treatment for mothers and delays in identification of newborns at risk for hypoglycaemia. As there exists some overlap among our COVID-19 group as to when changes to maternal screening for GDM were introduced and when OGTT was still in use, we have extended this study and further data collection is underway which may reveal greater differences between our groups.","output":"Nicu admissions for hypoglycaemia during the COVID-19 pandemic after changes to practice in diagnosis of gestational diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmembrane domains of fusion proteins are known to be important for their fusogenic activity. In an effort to systematically investigate the structure/function relationships of transmembrane domains we had previously designed LV-peptides that mimic natural fusion protein TMDs in their ability to drive fusion after incorporation into liposomal membranes. Here, we investigate the impact of different structural features of LV-peptide TMDs on inner and outer leaflet mixing. We find that fusion driven by the helical peptides involves a hemifusion intermediate as previously seen for natural fusion proteins. Helix backbone dynamics enhances fusion by selectively promoting outer leaflet mixing. Furthermore, the hydrophobic length of the peptides as well as covalent attachment of long acyl chains affects outer and inner leaflet mixing to different extents. Different structural features of transmembrane domains thus appear to differentially influence the rearrangements of lipids in fusion initiation and the hemifusion-to-fusion transition.

The Center performed a mixed-method assessment including a series of focus groups and key informant interviews followed by a survey of over 300 responding providers. Over 85% of providers reported sustaining behavioral health services using a variety of telemental health strategies. While traditional referral networks and client volume were significantly disrupted, temporary relaxation of Medicaid regulatory and reimbursement policies appeared to be a key facilitator of telemental health adoption and continued services. Shifting to telemental health relied on providers quick adaptations, engaging clients with a hybrid of teleconferencing platforms, calls/texts, and socially-distanced in-person visits. Larger multi-clinician providers and evidence-based practice (EBP) providers were better equipped to support the adoption of telemental health. Rural and EBPs providers disproportionately discontinued services. Although many practitioners viewed the original COVID-19 pandemic as a short-lived condition, the recent emergence of Delta and other variants has shown the impact on the BH care system may be lasting.

METHODS A systematic review and a meta-analysis were performed on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library in March 2020. Safety was evaluated through the reported side effects and effectiveness through the scores used. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and the Downs and Black checklist. For each outcome, the quality of evidence was graded according to GRADE guidelines. RESULTS Twenty-four studies (21 for OA, 3 for OLT) were included on hyaluronic acid (HA), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), saline, methylprednisolone, botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and prolotherapy. No severe adverse events were reported. For OLT, a comparison was possible between HA and PRP showing no significant difference. For ankle OA, a significant difference favouring HA versus saline was documented at six months (p < 0.001). The GRADE level of evidence was very low. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis supports the safety of intra-articular treatment for ankle OA and OLT, while only a very low evidence supports the efficacy of HA in terms of better results versus placebo for the treatment of ankle OA, and other conclusions are hindered by the scarcity of the available literature. This urges further and stronger trials to specifically investigate potential and limitations of these different injective approaches for the treatment of OLT and ankle OA.","output":"Evidence on ankle injections for osteochondral lesions and osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on the tenets of family stress theory, the aim of this study is to examine parents' perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and associated risk- and protective factors across demographic subgroups during in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Norwegian parents (N = 2868; 79.5% mothers) with >1 child under 18 years of age completed an online survey two weeks after the implementation of government-initiated distancing measures. The survey includes measures of COVID-related risk factors (parental stress, burnout, depression, anxiety, anger of parents towards children, difficulty working from home, and positive beliefs about worry) and protective factors (self-efficacy and social support). Mothers, parents living with more than one child, and parents with a psychiatric diagnosis reported greater levels of parental stress, more burnout, and more anger towards their children, as well as less social support. Almost 25% of the parents reported anxiety and depression that are clinically significant. Parents who followed distancing measures reported significantly higher distress. Anger of parents towards children explains 41% of the variation in parental stress. These findings indicate that parents have experienced symptoms of deteriorated mental health due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, including parental stress, anxiety, and depression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diagnostic Radiology (DR) studies and Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures at a single tertiary-care teaching institution between 2015 and 2020 were reviewed. DR was divided by section: body, cardiothoracic, musculoskeletal (MSK), neuroradiology, nuclear medicine, pediatrics, and women's imaging. IR was divided by procedural types: arterial, venous, lymphatic, core, neuro, pediatrics, dialysis, cancer embolization or ablation, noncancer embolization, portal hypertension, and miscellaneous. Impact on didactic education was also assessed. ANOVA, t test, and multiple comparison correction were used for analysis. RESULTS: DR and IR caseloads decreased significantly in April 2020 compared to April of the prior 5 years (both p < 0.0001). Case volumes were reduced in body (49.2%, p < 0.01), MSK (54.2%, p < 0.05), neuro (39.3%, p < 0.05), and women's imaging (75.5%, p < 0.05) in DR, and in arterial (62.6%, p < 0.01), neuro IR (57.6%, p < 0.01) and core IR (42.6%, p < 0.05) in IR. IR trainee average caseload in April 2020 decreased 51.9% compared to April of the prior 5 years (p < 0.01). Utilization of online learning increased in April. Trainees saw significant increases in overall DR didactics (31.3%, p = 0.02) and no reduction in IR didactics, all online. Twelve major national and international DR and IR meetings were canceled or postponed between March and July. CONCLUSION: Decreases in caseload and widespread cancellation of conferences have had significant impact on DR/IR training during COVID-19 restrictions. Remote learning technologies with annotated case recording, boards-style case reviews, procedural simulation and narrated live cases as well as online lectures and virtual journal clubs increased during this time. Whether remote learning can mitigate lost opportunities from in-person interactions remains uncertain. Optimizing these strategies will be important for potential future restricted learning paradigms and can also be extrapolated to augment trainee education during unrestricted times.","output":"Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Case Volume and Education in the Age of Pandemics: Impact Analysis and Potential Future Directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 4 million people worldwide, with a death toll over 280,000.

Our results showed that (i) RT-LAMP-based trials can be completed in approximately 12 to 23 min and (ii) the detection limit for the H7 gene is around 10 copies per reaction, similar to that of the real-time PCR, whereas the detection limit for its counterpart the N9 gene is 5 copies per reaction, a 100-fold-higher sensitivity than the WHO-recommended method. Indeed, this excellent performance of our method was also validated by the results for a series of clinical specimens.

Despite recent advances in telecommunication technologies, the field of orthopaedics has been slow to adopt these resources in offsetting barriers to care. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced departments to change their clinical approach, lending unprecedented opportunity to better understand how telehealth may bridge this care gap in foot and ankle practices. The purpose of this study was to assess patient-reported outcomes of telemedicine encounters, including comfort and patient satisfaction. Our hypothesis was that patients would be significantly less satisfied with telemedicine when compared to in-office appointments for all non-emergent visit types. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients seen via telemedicine between April 13, 2020, to June 19, 2020, by one surgeon in the Emory Orthopedics Foot and Ankle department was conducted. Patients were contacted by one of the study authors via telephone to complete a questionnaire; satisfaction and other visit characteristics were assessed with a modified Likert scale from 1 to 5. Patients were designated as either New or Established based on whether or not they had completed an in-office clinic visit within the last year. Anatomy and pathology of disorder were determined by chief complaint and billing code. Patient demographics were recorded, and data were analyzed using paired and independent t-tests for parametric continuous data, Fishers exact and chi-square tests for non-continuous data. RESULTS: 338 eligible patients were contacted via telephone, with 216 (63.9%) completing the telemedicine questionnaire. The patient cohort had an average age of 50.6 (19-84) years old and was 73.6% female (n=159). Overall mean satisfaction for telemedicine visits (4.69) was significantly lower than in-office visits (4.86) (p<0.001). In a subgroup analysis of patient satisfaction, patients seeking fracture care had significantly higher telemedicine satisfaction when compared to those receiving non-fracture care (4.90 vs. 4.64, p=0.001). Telemedicine satisfaction was also significantly greater in patients traveling more than 50 miles from their home to clinic (4.96 vs. 4.67, p<0.001). Patients with median household income less than the Georgia state median ($55,679) were more satisfied with their telemedicine visits than those with greater income, though the difference was non-significant. CONCLUSION: our data suggest those with significantly hindered mobility such as increased distance from clinic, lower socioeconomic status, and those seeking care for fractures had higher telemedicine satisfaction than their peers. Further study is needed to detail the precise and safe use of telemedicine in practice, but these data illuminate the high ceiling telemedicine offers in expanding patient care. Our hope is that this study aids as a supportive rationale for the continued use of telehealth visits past the period of the pandemic and encourages a more nuanced view of what visit types may be best-suited for telehealthcare","output":"Is Telemedicine Suited for Lower Extremity Pathologies?

Due to privacy concerns and critical communication bottlenecks, it can become impractical to send the FL updated models to a centralized server. Thus, this paper studies the potential of hierarchical FL in IoT heterogeneous systems and propose an optimized solution for user assignment and resource allocation on multiple edge nodes. In particular, this work focuses on a generic class of machine learning models that are trained using gradient-descent-based schemes while considering the practical constraints of non-uniformly distributed data across different users. We evaluate the proposed system using two real-world datasets, and we show that it outperforms state-of-the-art FL solutions. In particular, our numerical results highlight the effectiveness of our approach and its ability to provide 4-6% increase in the classification accuracy, with respect to hierarchical FL schemes that consider distance-based user assignment.

METHODS: A questionnaire survey of 105 centers that had treated at least five COVID-19 patients on dialysis was conducted in August 2021. RESULTS: Sixty-six centers (62.9%) responded to the questionnaire. Antivirals were administered in 27.7% of facilities treating mild disease (most patients received favipiravir) and 66.7% of facilities treating moderate disease (most patients with moderate or more severe conditions received remdesivir). Whether and how remdesivir is administered varies between centers. Steroids were initiated most frequently in moderate II disease (50.8%), while 43.1% of the facilities initiated steroids in mild or moderate I disease. The type of steroid, dose, and the duration of administration were generally consistent, with most facilities administering dexamethasone 6 mg orally or 6.6 mg intravenously for 10 days.

There was limited experience of polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column-direct hemoperfusion and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The discharge criteria for patients receiving dialysis therapy were longer than those set by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in 22.7% of the facilities.

In this case study, the virtual ethnographic method was used with the intention of carrying out a detailed study and advancing theoretical knowledge of the phenomenon in question. The recovery and analysis of the information was carried out during the months of March to July 2020. A total of 113 memes were captured, of which 55 (48.7%) expressed emotions linked to the pandemic. The results show that the meme is a complex system involving cognitive processes and language games specific to the culture in which they are used, promoting expressiveness and ways of sharing and being affectionate during the pandemic. The expression of negative emotions such as pessimism, despair, fear and loneliness prevails;positive emotions such as astonishment, optimism and serenity are also expressed. The results lead to a partial verification of the research assumption in the understanding that the predominant emotions, although negative, are not the emotions that have been identified as part of the historical-socio-cultural premises of emotional expression in Mexicans. We discuss the edifying function of memes in delineating expressive patterns of valuation and planning of the new reality by constituting referents that operate as cultural units that articulate communicative acts to provide meaning and identity to users.","output":"Expression and emotional experience of the covid-19 pandemic through memetics in a facebook profile of mexican college students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to adapt port rapid detection of food borne norovirus, presently we developed a new typed detection method based on F(0)F(1)-ATPase molecular motor biosensor.

Higher lethality in men, evident in the first reports from China, was confirmed in the subsequent Italian outbreak. Newspapers and scientific journals commented on this finding and the preexisting conditions, biological processes, and behavioral differences that may underlie it. However, little appeared to be released about sex differences in severity of disease, comorbidities, rate of recovery, length of hospital stay, or number of tests performed. Systematic analysis of official websites for 20 countries and 6 US states revealed a wide disparity in sex-disaggregated data made available to the public and scholars. Only a handful reported cases by sex. None of the other characteristics, including deaths, were stratified by sex at the time. Beyond suboptimal sex disaggregation, we found a paucity of usable raw data sets and a generalized lack of standardization of captured data, making comparisons difficult. A second round of data capture in April found more complete, but even more disparate, information. Our analysis revealed a wide range of sex ratios among confirmed cases. In countries where a male bias was initially reported, the proportion of women dramatically increased in 3 weeks. Analysis also revealed a complex pattern of sex ratio variation with age. Accurate, peer-reviewed, analysis of harmonized, sex-disaggregated data for characteristics of epidemics, such as availability of testing, suspected source of infection, or comorbidities, will be critical to understand where the observed disparities come from and to generate evidence-based recommendations for decision-making by governments.","output":"Paucity and Disparity of Publicly Available Sex-Disaggregated Data for the COVID-19 Epidemic Hamper Evidence-Based Decision-Making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organization, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created situations that have a negative effect on people and threaten their mental health. Paraguay announced the Estado de Emergencia Sanitaria (Presidential Decree No. 3456) on March 16, 2020, which was followed by the imposition of a 24-h restriction on movement order on March 21. Self-quarantine at home may have been the most effective method of preventing the spread of infectious diseases; however, with the global pandemic becoming more prolonged and the consequent lengthening of the 24-h self-quarantine period, it is highly probable that both physical and psychological problems will arise. METHODS: In this study, a web-based cross-sectional method was used to analyze the factors influencing COVID-19-induced depressive feelings in Paraguayan public officials. RESULTS: Public officials reported a high level of depressive symptoms with a high level of apprehension in early stage of COVID-19. In addition, this study identified that when the self-quarantine period increased, levels of depressive feelings also increased. Since self-quarantine is characterized by the requirement that individuals endure an undetermined period within a confined area, it may have caused stress and anxiety, as well as the consequent experience of depressive feelings. CONCLUSIONS: Paraguayan government should develop a program for the delivery of mental health care and services to public officials in COVID-19 Pandemic period. Moreover, a program is required for people facing deteriorating mental health due to social isolation and loneliness caused by social distancing during the prolonged period of self-quarantine. Finally, mental health care programs should be organized in a community-focused way by utilizing online systems to enhance the effectiveness of mental health recovery.","output":"Depression in public officials during the COVID-19 pandemic in Paraguay: a web-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Neurological manifestations can occur during coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Several pathogenic mechanisms have been hypothesized, without conclusive results. In this study, we evaluated the most frequent neurological symptoms in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and also investigated the possible relationship between plasmatic inflammatory indices and olfactory disorders (ODs) and between muscle pain and creatine kinase (CK). METHODS: We consecutively enrolled hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A structured questionnaire concerning typical and neurological symptoms, focusing on headache, dizziness, ODs, taste disorders (TDs), and muscle pain, was administrated by telephone interviews. RESULTS: Common neurological symptoms were reported in the early phase of the disease, with a median onset ranging from 1 to 3 days. Headache showed tension-type features and was more frequently associated with a history of headache. Patients with ODs less frequently needed oxygen therapy. Inflammatory indices did not significantly differ between patients with and without ODs. Muscle pain did not show any association with CK level but was more frequently associated with arthralgia and headache. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, ODs were an early symptom of COVID-19, more frequently reported by patients with milder forms of disease. Headache in association with arthralgia and muscle pain seems to reflect the common symptoms of the flu-like syndrome, and not COVID-19 infection-specific.","output":"Early neurological manifestations of hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims COVID-19 has infected the world on a wide spectrum, from mild to severe and causing death.

Although many studies have pointed to the role of systemic racism in COVID-19 racial/ethnic disparities, few studies have examined the contribution of racial segregation. Residential segregation is associated with differing health outcomes by race/ethnicity for various diseases, including HIV. This commentary documents differing HIV and COVID-19 outcomes and service delivery by race/ethnicity and the crucial role of racial segregation. Using publicly available Census data, we divide US counties into quintiles by percentage of non-Hispanic white residents and examine HIV diagnoses and COVID-19 per 100,000 population. HIV diagnoses decrease as the proportion of white residents increase across US counties. COVID-19 diagnoses follow a similar pattern: Counties with the highest proportion of white residents have the fewest cases of COVID-19 irrespective of geographic region or state political party inclination (i.e., red or blue states). Moreover, comparatively fewer COVID-19 diagnoses have occurred in primarily white counties throughout the duration of the US COVID-19 pandemic. Systemic drivers place racial minorities at greater risk for COVID-19 and HIV. Individual-level characteristics (e.g., underlying health conditions for COVID-19 or risk behavior for HIV) do not fully explain excess disease burden in racial minority communities.

Most viral and bacterial enteropathogens of diarrheic sheep and goats are considered foodborne pathogens with a potential to be zoonotic. The present study investigated the prevalence of some viral and bacterial enteropathogens in diarrheic sheep and goats between October 2015and February 2016 in Medina, Saudi Arabia. A total of 310 fecal samples were collected from diarrheic sheep (n=193) and goats (n=117). The samples were screened for the presence of rotavirus and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) using Sandwich (ELISA) technique. The bacterial enteropathogens were isolated and identified biochemically and the virulence factors of Escherichia coli were determined by using PCR. Escherichia coli was the most prevalent agent in both sheep and goats (34.7% and 30.7%, respectively). According to the expressed virulence genes, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) was detect in 34.3% of sheep isolates and 30.6% of goats isolates. Salmonella species was isolated from 3.6% of sheep and 2.6% of goats. Klebsiella species was isolated from 1.6% of sheep but not from goats. Regarding viral agents, rotavirus was found in 31.6% of sheep and 27.4% of goats, while BCoV was detected in 19.6% of the sheep and 16.2% of the goats. The prevalence of bacterial and viral enteropathogens was significantly higher in the 0-12 months age group compared to the older age groups. Double infection was the most common (53.0%) infection pattern compared to single (37.5%) and triple (9.5%) infections. Rotavirus infection was significantly associated with ETEC infection. In conclusion, we report high prevalence of rotavirus and ETEC in sheep and goats, which are of veterinary and public health importance.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on coronavirus disease 2019 patients, included between March 10, and April 30, 2020. SETTING: ICU of an University Hospital in Belgium. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Critically ill adult mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients were eligible if they underwent a CT pulmonary angiography, as part of the routine management in case of persistent hypoxemia or respiratory deterioration. The primary endpoint of this study was the occurrence of pulmonary embolism according to the use of standard thromboprophylaxis (i.e. subcutaneous enoxaparin 4,000 international units once daily) or high regimen thromboprophylaxis (i.e. subcutaneous enoxaparin 4,000 international units bid or therapeutic unfractioned heparin). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 49 mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019, 40 underwent CT pulmonary angiography after a median of 7 days (4C8 d) since ICU admission and 12 days (9C16 d) days since the onset of symptoms. Thirteen patients (33%) were diagnosed of pulmonary embolism, which was bilateral in six patients and localized in the right lung in seven patients. D-dimers on the day of CT pulmonary angiography had a predictive accuracy of 0.90 (95% CIs: 0.78C1.00) for pulmonary embolism. The use of high-regimen thromboprophylaxis was associated with a lower occurrence of pulmonary embolism (2/18; 11%) than standard regimen (11/22, 50%odds ratio 0.13 [0.02C0.69]; p = 0.02); this difference remained significant even after adjustment for confounders. Six patients with pulmonary embolism (46%) and 14 patients without pulmonary embolism (52%) died at ICU discharge (odds ratio 0.79 [0.24C3.26]; p = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, one third of coronavirus disease 2019 mechanically ventilated patients have a pulmonary embolism visible on CT pulmonary angiography.

Therefore, this study examined the motives for online news sharing, the newsworthiness criteria applied by Nigerian social media users while selecting and sharing COVID-19related news and implications of this practice for users' general knowledge about the virus. Online survey with 349 social media users and five Focus Group Discussion sessions with purposively selected social media users provided data for the study. Findings show that 94.8 per cent of the respondents shared news items about confirmed cases (48.7 per cent) and recoveries (46.1 per cent), while only 5.2 per cent of the respondents shared information about COVID-19 fatalities. Apart from fact-checking stories to confirm their veracity, users applied various newsworthiness criteria such as intensity (25.2 per cent), proximity (14.0 per cent), consequence (12.3 per cent), bizarre (11.2 per cent) and personality (10.9 per cent). Findings further show that the respondents applied 44.076 times the messages they were exposed to through social media to protect themselves against COVID-19.

We wanted to investigate this profile of mixed viral-bacterial infection and to compare it to monomicrobial bacterial or viral CAP. METHODS: We measured baseline serum procalcitonin (PCT), C reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell (WBC) count in 171 patients with CAP with definite etiology admitted to a tertiary hospital: 59 (34.5%) bacterial, 66 (39.%) viral and 46 (27%) mixed (viral-bacterial). RESULTS: Serum PCT levels were higher in mixed and bacterial CAP compared to viral CAP. CRP levels were higher in mixed CAP compared to the other groups. CRP was independently associated with mixed CAP. CRP levels below 26 mg/dL were indicative of an etiology other than mixed in 83% of cases, but the positive predictive value was 45%. PCT levels over 2.10 ng/mL had a positive predictive value for bacterial-involved CAP versus viral CAP of 78%, but the negative predictive value was 48%.

The results of our interviews with these experienced teachers indicate that the social robots currently used in education pose little threat to the social-emotional development of children. Children with special needs seem to be more sensitive to social-affective bonding with a robot compared to regular children. This bond seems to have positive effects in enabling them to more easily connect with their human peers and teachers. However, when robots are being introduced more regularly, daily, without the involvement of a human teacher, new issues could arise. For now, given the current state of technology and the way social robots are being applied, other (ethical) issues seem to be more urgent, such as privacy, security and the workload of teachers.

In the absence of any approved vaccines for infants, understanding the risk factors for hospitalization and severe disease from COVID-19 in this age group will help inform clinical management and targeted public health interventions. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, disease severity, and risk factors for hospitalization among infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Canada. METHODS: This is a nationwide prospective observational study using the infrastructure of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program. All cases of infants aged < 1 year of age with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported from April 8(th) 2020 to May 11(th) 2021, and classified by disease severity, and primary cause of hospitalization. Logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for hospitalization and severe disease. RESULTS: A total of 393 cases were reported, including 229 (58.3%) non-hospitalized and 164 (41.7%) hospitalized infants. The most common symptoms included fever (63.4%), runny nose (45.0%), cough (35.1%) and decreased oral intake (24.9%). Significant risk factors for hospitalization included younger age and presence of comorbid conditions (excluding prematurity), as shown in the Table.

Our model of city-level transmission of an infectious agent (SEIR model) characterises spread via a (a) scale-free contact network (no control); (b) a random graph (elimination of mass gatherings); and (c) small world lattice (partial to full lockdown - 'social' distancing). This model exhibits good qualitative agreement between simulation and data from the 2020 pandemic spread of a novel coronavirus. Estimates of the relevant rate parameters of the SEIR model are obtained and we demonstrate the robustness of our model predictions under uncertainty of those estimates.

Humoral vaccination response is impaired in these patients when circulating B cells are lacking. We aimed to analyze B-cell subsets at the time of vaccination to identify potential predictors of humoral vaccination response. Methods Patients (n=120) receiving B-cell-depleting therapy (n=41), those suffering from inborn errors of immunity (n=25) and hematologic malignancies (n=56), and healthy controls (n=79) were vaccinated twice with BNT162b2 or mRNA 1273. B-cell subsets were analyzed prior to vaccination. Two independent anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassays targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or trimeric S protein (TSP) were performed three to four weeks after the second vaccination. Results Seroconversion occurred in 100% of the healthy controls, in contrast to 67% (RBD) and 82% (TSP) of the patients, while only 32% (RBD) and 22% (TSP) achieved antibody levels comparable to those of healthy controls. The number of circulating naive B cell was strongly associated with antibody levels (r=0.761, P<0.001) across all immunosuppressive treatments or conditions. In multivariable analysis, the number of naive B cells was an independent predictor for achieving antibody levels comparable to healthy controls, and receiver operating characteristic analysis predicted that at least six naive B cells per microL were required.

The EU-supported projectVIZIER (Comparative Structural Genomics of Viral Enzymes Involved in Replication, FP6 Project: 2004-511960) was instigated with an ultimate view of contributing to the development of antiviral therapies for RNA viruses, including the alphaviruses [Coutard, B., Gorbalenya, A.E., Snijder, E.J., Leontovich, A.M., Poupon, A., De Lamballerie, X., Charrel, R., Gould, E.A., Gunther, S., Norder, H., Klempa, B., Bourhy, H., Rohayemj, J., Lhermite, E., Nordlund, P., Stuart, D.I., Owens, R.J., Grimes, J.M., Tuckerm, P.A., Bolognesi, M., Mattevi, A., Coll, M., Jones, T.A., ?qvist, J., Unger, T., Hilgenfeld, R., Bricogne, G., Neyts, J., La Colla, P., Puerstinger, G., Gonzalez, J.P., Leroy, E., Cambillau, C., Romette, J.L., Canard, B., 2008.

The IId subtype family (SF) is one of the most prevalent subtypes of C. parvum. Some clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein systems have been developed to detect nucleic acid with high flexibility, sensitivity and specificity. METHODS: By integrating recombinase polymerase amplification and the Cas12a/crRNA trans-cleavage system (termed ReCTC), we established end-point diagnostics by observing fluorescence readouts with the naked eye under blue light and on-site diagnostics using a lateral flow strip (LFS) biosensor. RESULTS: Our ReCTC-based diagnoses can detect as little as a single copy of a cloned C. parvum 60-kDa glycoprotein (GP60) gene, 10 oocysts per gram (OPG), clinical fecal sample without tedious extraction of genomic DNA and have no cross-reactivity with other SFs of C. parvum or other common enteric parasitic protozoa. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a new strategy for direct identification of the IId SF of C. parvum free of highly trained operators and expensive special equipment.

The basic prerequisite for this therapy is the availability of the required drugs in accordance with the current guideline recommendations. It is currently unclear whether this is guaranteed nationwide. There is no uniform standard regarding which drugs must be stocked in emergency medical services (EMS) vehicles staffed by physicians in Germany. The aim of the present study is to identify important diagnoses and the drugs required for their therapy. In a second step, medical directors throughout Germany were interviewed about current drugs available in their physician-staffed EMS vehicles and these were compared with the previously defined diagnosis-dependent drug lists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a structured guideline search, tracer diagnoses were defined and relevant drugs were assigned to them. The levels of evidence and recommendations were also considered. In a second step, this was compared with the current drugs available in physician-staffed EMS vehicles. RESULTS: A total of 156 different medications were identified. The median number of medications stocked was 58; the minimum number of medications stocked was 35 at one site, while multiple sites stocked a maximum of 77 medications . DISCUSSION: The present study investigated stocked medications in physician-staffed EMS vehicles. Overall, compared to a 2011 study, drug availability has improved. Most of the recommended medications are available in physician-staffed vehicles in Germany. The data from this study can be used by EMS throughout Germany to evaluate their preparedness.","output":"Medikament?se Ausstattung arztbesetzter Rettungsmittel C ist eine pr?klinische Therapie nach aktuellen Leitlinien m?glich?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While increasingly more application-specific blockchains, or ledgers, are being implemented and deployed, exchanging information between these ledgers remains an open problem.

PDCoV-related diarrhea first occurred in the USA in 2014 and was subsequently reported in South Korea, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Lao People's Democratic Republic, leading to massive economic losses and posing a threat to the swine industry worldwide. Currently, no treatments or vaccines for PDCoV are available. The critical step in the development of potential vaccines against PDCoV infection is the isolation and propagation of PDCoV in cell culture. This chapter provides a detailed protocol for isolation and propagation of PDCoV in swine testicular (ST) and LLC porcine kidney (LLC-PK) cell cultures supplemented with pancreatin and trypsin, respectively. Filtered clinical samples (swine intestinal contents or feces) applied to ST or LLC-PK cells produce cytopathic effects characterized by rounding, clumping, and detachment of cells. PDCoV replication in cells can be quantifiably monitored by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence assays, and immune-electron microscopy. Infectious viral titers can be evaluated by using plaque assays or 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assays. The ST or LLC-PK cells efficiently supported serial passage and propagation of PDCoV.

The discovery and development of anti-viral drugs and vaccines are being conducted worldwide and the understanding of the molecular responses of a single cell to SARS-CoV-2 is in urgent need. The comparative analysis of gene expression in SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoV infected Calu-3 cells reveals that although the coronaviruses cause similar acute respiratory distress syndromes, the molecular responses of Calu-3 cells to SARS-CoVs infections showed a unique signature. A total of 64 correlated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in this study. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses indicated that the DEGs were significantly involved in biological process of Response to interferon-á, Viral life cycle, Phagosome and Epstein-Barr virus infection. STRING analysis showed that the DEGs that were up-regulated after SARS-CoVs infections but down-regulated after MERS-CoV infections showed a strong interaction network.

To explain this discrepancy, we hypothesised that colonic adaptation to increased wheat fibre intake takes many months but eventually results in increased SCFA production and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. Thus, the primary objective was to determine the time-course of the effects of increased wheat fibre intake on plasma acetate, butyrate and GLP-1 concentrations in hyperinsulinaemic human subjects over 1 year. Subjects with fasting plasma insulin >or= 40 pmol/l were randomly assigned by computer to receive either a high-wheat fibre cereal (fibre group; 24 g fibre/d; twenty assigned; six dropped out, fourteen included) or a low-fibre cereal (control group; twenty assigned; six dropped-out, fourteen included) daily for 1 year. Acetate, butyrate and GLP-1 were measured during 8 h metabolic profiles performed every 3 months. There were no differences in body weight in the fibre group compared with the control group. After 9 months baseline-adjusted mean 8 h acetate and butyrate concentrations were higher on the high-fibre than the control cereal (P < 0.05). After 12 months on the high-fibre cereal, baseline-adjusted mean plasma GLP-1 was 1.3 (95 % CI 0.4, 2.2) pmol/l (P < 0.05) higher than at baseline (about 25 % increase) and 1.4 (95 % CI 0.1, 2.7) pmol/l (P < 0.05) higher than after 12 months on control. It is concluded that wheat fibre increased SCFA production and GLP-1 secretion in hyperinsulinaemic humans, but these effects took 9-12 months to develop. Since GLP-1 may increase insulin sensitivity and secretion, these results may provide a mechanism for the epidemiological association between high cereal fibre intake and reduced risk for diabetes.","output":"Adaptation of colonic fermentation and glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion with increased wheat fibre intake for 1 year in hyperinsulinaemic human subjects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plant-made or biofarmed viral vaccines are some of the earliest products of the technology of plant molecular farming, and remain some of the brightest prospects for the success of this field.

Two thousand and one hundred sequences representing the seven clades of the SARS-CoV-2 were included. Patterns of genetic diversifications and nucleotide evolutionary rate were estimated for the spike genomic region. The haplotype networks showed a star shape, where multiple haplotypes with few nucleotide differences diverge from a common ancestor. Four hundred seventy-nine different haplotypes were defined in the seven analyzed clades. The main haplotype, named Hap-1, was the most frequent for clades G (54%), GH (54%), and GR (56%) and a different haplotype (named Hap-252) was the most important for clades L (63.3%), O (39.7%), S (51.7%), and V (70%). The evolutionary rate for the spike protein was estimated as 1.08  10-3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year. Moreover, the nucleotide evolutionary rate after nine months of the pandemic was similar for each clade. In conclusion, the present evolutionary analysis is relevant as the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the target for most therapeutic candidates; besides, changes in this protein could have consequences on viral transmission, response to antivirals and efficacy of vaccines.

During LIHR, 13 attending surgeons and fellows experienced in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and 19 novice surgeons (postgraduate years [PGYs], 3-5) were evaluated at four teaching hospitals by the attending surgeon, a trained observer, and self-assessment using GOALS-IH, and by a previously validated 5-item general laparoscopic rating scale (GOALS). Interrater reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation (ICC), and internal consistency of rating items was assessed by Cronbach's alpha. Known-groups construct validity was assessed by using the t-test and by correlating of the number of self-reported LIHR cases with the total score. Concurrent validity was assessed by correlating the GOALS-IH score with the GOALS general rating scale. Data are presented as mean and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS Interrater reliability for the total GOALS-IH score was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.60-0.89) between observers and attending surgeons, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.58-0.92) between participants and attending surgeons, and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.76-0.96) between participants and observers.

The nighttime light (NTL) index, formulated using satellite imagery, was used as a provincial proxy of monthly socioeconomic conditions. Local indicators of spatial association statistics were applied to identify the localised bivariate association between COVID-19 incidence rate and the year-on-year change of NTL index. A statistically significant negative association was observed between the COVID-19 incidence rate and the NTL index in some central and southern provinces in both major pandemic waves. Regression analyses were also conducted using the spatial lag model (SLM) and the spatial error model (SEM). The obtained slope coefficient, for both major waves of the pandemic, revealed a statistically significant negative association between the year-on-year change of NTL index and COVID-19 incidence rate (SLM: coefficient= -0.0078 and -0.0064 with P<0.001 and 0.056, respectively;and SEM: coefficient= -0.0086 and -0.0083 with P=0.067 and 0.056, respectively).

Guideline-based care during antenatal and post-partum periods aims to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus and lower the risk of liver complications in mothers. This qualitative study explored knowledge of hepatitis B and experiences of hepatitis B related care among pregnant women and mothers. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirteen women with hepatitis B who were attending antenatal or post-partum hepatitis B care. The interviews were thematically analysed to assess knowledge and understanding of hepatitis B. Participants were recruited from specialist clinics in metropolitan Melbourne between August 2019 and May 2020. RESULTS: Four major themes were identified from interviews: (1) knowledge and understanding of hepatitis B, (2) treatment pathways, (3) accessing hepatitis B related care, and (4) disclosing status to friends. Most participants displayed an understanding of hepatitis B transmission, including mother to child transmission. The main motivator of post-partum attendance was reassurance gained concerning their childs health. Sources of hepatitis B information included doctors, online information and family. Participants identified parents and siblings as sources of support and reported an unwillingness to disclose hepatitis B status to friends. CONCLUSIONS: Women attending antenatal or post-partum care reported having overall positive experiences, particularly regarding reassurance of their childs health, but displayed misconceptions around horizontal transmission. Knowledge gained from these results can contribute to the development of targeted models of care for pregnant women and mothers with young children to ensure their successful linkage to care.

ARDS is mainly associated with an uncontrolled overproduction of immune cells and cytokines, called cytokine storm syndrome; it appears 7C15 days following the onset of symptoms, leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure. Because they are well-known metabolic precursors of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 LC-PUFAs) could help improve the resolution of the inflammatory balance, limiting therefore the level and duration of the critical inflammatory period. Omega-3 LC-PUFAs may also interact at different stages of the viral infection, notably on the virus entry and replication. In the absence of demonstrated treatment and while waiting for vaccine possibility, the use of omega-3 LC-PUFAs deserve therefore to be considered, based on previous clinical studies suggesting that omega-3 supplementation could improve clinical outcomes of critically ill patients at the acute phase of ARDS. In this context, it is crucial to remind that the omega-3 PUFA dietary intake levels in Western countries remains largely below the current recommendations, considering both the omega-3 precursor -linolenic acid (ALA) and long chain derivatives such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

Electronic nose (eNose) technology is an emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosis and phenotyping of a wide variety of respiratory diseases. Hence, the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by eNose was assessed for the discrimination between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: This was a prospective real-world study of individuals (18 years of age) presenting to a public testing center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, August 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Baseline breath profiles were obtained using the SpiroNose [1,2], a cloud-connected eNose, after sampling of a combined throat and nasopharyngeal swab. A SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive molecular amplification test at baseline and/or 7 days after inclusion. Data-analysis involved advanced signal processing, ambient correction and statistics based on independent t-tests followed by linear discriminant and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis [2]. The accuracy of the diagnostic model based on eNose sensor data was subsequently assessed in an independent validation set and in a replication set including newly presented individuals to the testing facilities in November 2020. Results: 1808 individuals with (n=68) and without (n=1760) SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, divided in a training (n=904) and validation (n=904) set. The eNose sensors were combined into a composite biomarker with an ROC-area under the curve (AUC) of 0.948 (95% Confidence Interval (CI):0.929-0.967) in the training set. These results were confirmed in the validation set (0.957;CI:0.942-0.971) and externally validated in a replication set with newly presented individuals (n=1089) with (n=151) and without (n=938) SARS-CoV-2 infection (0.935;CI:0.921-0.952) (Figure 1). A SARS-CoV-2 infection percentage score of 0.30 selected from the training set resulted in 100% sensitivity and 78% specificity in the validation set indicating that in 75% of individuals SARS-CoV-2 infection could have been reliably ruled out (0% false negative). In the replication set, the score resulted in 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Conclusions: Exhaled breath analysis by eNose can reliably distinguish between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health setting. This quick and non-invasive method can therefore be used as a screening instrument, eliminating the need for additional time-consuming, stressful, and expensive diagnostic tests. Thereby the number of required SARS-CoV-2 molecular amplification tests can be reduced by more than 70-75%. [1]de Vries R, Sterk PJ. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2020 [2]de Vries R, Muller M, et al.

Here we examined the functionality of classical CD14+ monocytes as a main myeloid cell component in well-defined cohorts of patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 during the acute phase of infection and compared them to that of healthy individuals. We found that ex vivo isolated CD14+ monocytes from mild and moderate COVID-19 patients display specific patterns of costimulatory and inhibitory receptors that clearly distinguish them from healthy monocytes, as well as altered expression of histone marks and a dysfunctional metabolic profile. Decreased NF{kappa}B activation in COVID-19 monocytes ex vivo is accompanied by an intact type I IFN antiviral response. Subsequent pathogen sensing ex vivo led to a state of functional unresponsiveness characterized by a defect in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, NF{kappa}B-driven cytokine responses and defective type I IFN response in moderate COVID-19 monocytes. Transcriptionally, COVID-19 monocytes switched their gene expression signature from canonical innate immune functions to a pro-thrombotic phenotype characterized by increased expression of pathways involved in hemostasis and immunothrombosis. In response to SARS-CoV-2 or other viral or bacterial components, monocytes displayed defects in the epigenetic remodelling and metabolic reprogramming that usually occurs upon pathogen sensing in innate immune cells. These results provide a potential mechanism by which innate immune dysfunction in COVID-19 may contribute to disease pathology.","output":"Transcriptional reprogramming from innate immune functions to a pro-thrombotic signature upon SARS-CoV-2 sensing by monocytes in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Vietnamese Mekong Delta is predicted to be one of the regions most impacted by climate change, causing increased temperature and salinity in inland waters. We hypothesized that the increase in temperature and salinity may impact the microcystin (MC) production of two Microcystis strains isolated in this region from a freshwater pond (strain MBC) and a brackish water pond (strain MTV). The Microcystis strains were grown at low (27 C), medium (31 C), high (35 C) and extremely high (37 C) temperature in flat photobioreactors (Algaemist). At each temperature, when cultures reached a stable state, sea salt was added to increase salinity to 4?, 8?, 12? and 16?. MC concentrations and cell quota were reduced at high and extremely high temperatures. Salinity, in general, had comparable effects on MC concentrations and quota. At a salinity of 4? and 8?, concentrations of MC per mL of culture and MC cell quota (based on chlorophyll, dry-weight and particle counts) were higher than at 0.5?, while at the highest salinities (12? and 16?) these were strongly reduced. Strain MBC produced five MC variants of which MC-RR and MC-LR were most abundant, followed by MC-YR and relatively low amounts of demethylated variants dmMC-RR and dmMC-LR. In strain MTV, MC-RR was most abundant, with traces of MC-YR and dmMC-RR only in cultures grown at 16? salinity. Overall, higher temperature led to lower MC concentrations and cell quota, low salinity seemed to promote MC production and high salinity reduced MC production. Hence, increased temperature and higher salinity could lead to less toxic Microcystis, but since these conditions might favour Microcystis over other competitors, the overall biomass gain could offset a lower toxicity.","output":"Warming and Salt Intrusion Affect Microcystin Production in Tropical Bloom-Forming Microcystis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, also commonly known as coronavirus, is presently declared a pandemic disease by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Recommendations are in place to limit medical personnel attending to the neurosurgical patient as a protective measure and to conserve personal protective equipment. However, the complexity of the neurosurgical patient proves to be a challenge and an opportunity for innovation. The goal of our study was to determine if telemedicine delivered through smart glasses was feasible and effective in an alternative method of conducting ward round on neurocritical care patients during the pandemic. METHODS: A random pair of neurosurgery resident and specialist conducted consecutive virtual and physical ward rounds on neurocritical patients. A virtual ward round was first conducted remotely by a specialist who received real-time audiovisual information from a resident wearing smart glasses integrated with telemedicine. Subsequently, a physical ward round was performed together by the resident and specialist on the same patient. The management plans of both ward rounds were compared, and the intrarater reliability was measured. On study completion a qualitative survey was performed. RESULTS: Ten paired ward rounds were performed on 103 neurocritical care patients with excellent overall intrarater reliability. Nine out of 10 showed good to excellent internal consistency, and 1 showed acceptable internal consistency.

We used data for midlife Americans surveyed in 1995-96 with mortality follow-up through December 31, 2020 to investigate whether the association between extroversion and mortality changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that excess mortality during the pandemic will be greater for extroverts than for introverts. Results were based on a Cox model estimating age-specific mortality controlling for sex, race/ethnicity, the period trend in mortality, and an additional indicator for the pandemic period (Mar-Dec 2020). We interacted extroversion with the pandemic indicator to test whether the relationship differed between prepandemic and pandemic periods. Prior to the pandemic, extroversion was associated with somewhat lower mortality (HR=0.93 per SD, 95% CI 0.88-0.97), but the relationship reversed during the pandemic: extroverted individuals appeared to suffer higher mortality than their introverted counterparts, although the effect was not significant (HR=1.20 per SD, 95% CI 0.93-1.54). Extroversion was associated with greater pandemic related excess mortality (HR=1.20/0.93=1.29 per SD, 95% CI 1.00-1.67). Compared with someone who scored at the mean level of extroversion, mortality rates prior to the pandemic were 10% lower for a person who was very extroverted (i.e., top 12% of the sample at Wave 1), while they were 12% higher for someone who was very introverted (i.e., 11th percentile). In contrast, mortality rates during the pandemic appeared to be higher for very extroverted individuals (HR=1.15, 95% CI 0.77-1.71) and lower for those who were very introverted (HR=0.70, 95% CI 0.43-1.14) although the difference was not significant because of limited statistical power. In sum, the slight mortality advantage enjoyed by extroverts prior to the pandemic disappeared during the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains to be seen whether that pattern continued into 2021-22. We suspect that the mortality benefit of introversion during the pandemic is largely a result of reduced exposure to the risk of infection, but it may also derive in part from the ability of introverts to adapt more easily to reduced social interaction without engaging in self-destructive behavior (e.g., drug and alcohol abuse).

In addition, we described the emergency structured pathway adopted by an Italian University Hub Stroke Unit in the cross-border Italy-Slovenia area. METHODS: We analyzed admitted patients' clinical features and outcomes between 9th March 2020 and 9th April 2020 (first month of lockdown), and compared them with patients admitted during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: Total admissions experienced a reduction of 45% during the lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 (16 vs 29, respectively), as well as a higher prevalence of severe stroke (NIHSS>10) at admission (n = 8, 50% vs n = 8, 28%).

The patients conditions, along with the lack of human and technical resources, often become barriers to achieving early mobilisation after the introduction of mechanical ventilation. We plan to verify the usefulness of a mobile patient lift for early mobilisation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a single-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial. The inclusion criteria are as follows: age 18 years, independent walking before admission and expected mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours. The participants will be randomly divided into groups with (intervention group) or without (control group) a mobile lift protocol. A mobile lift will be used in the intervention group. The primary endpoint will be the number of days required to achieve an ICU mobility scale of 4 (standing position). The results of the two groups will be analysed using the Students t-test. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the approval of the Toho University Omori Medical Center Ethics Committee (approval number M20259). The results of this study will be presented internationally at academic conferences and published in the literature.

With limited mobility, increased reports of intimate partner violence, changes in living patterns of migrants, delays in accessing contraception and safe abortion care, and potential changes to decisions about parenting, there may be an increased need for abortion services in India due to the pandemic. The use of technology for providing abortion information and services has been well documented in global literature. The safety of abortion provision using telehealth has been established in several contexts including the United States and Australia. The importance of hotlines and other support systems that use technology to provide information and support to clients through their abortion is also highlighted in the literature. Several countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, and Pakistan are now allowing the use of technology for abortion/post-abortion care in light of the pandemic; however, Indias telemedicine guidelines do not include abortion. In a country where the majority of abortions take place outside the health system, allowing the use of telemedicine for abortion can help bring legality to users, and expand access to those facing additional barriers in accessing the care they deserve. We outline models for telemedicine provision of abortion in India and discuss the regulatory changes required to make telehealth for abortion a reality in India.","output":"The case for the use of telehealth for abortion in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The treatment of severe cases of COVID\\\\19 disease remains a dilemma so far, because there is no approved therapy for it. This study aimed to estimate the therapeutic efficacy of tocilizumab and its role in reducing the need for mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, mortality rate for these cases. METHOD: The study included 25 adult patients with confirmed severe COVID\\\\19 infection. Treatment of all patients followed Egyptian Ministry of Health COVID\\\\19 protocol in addition to tocilizumab IV (400\\\\800 mg) as a single dose and then the dose was repeated after at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours from the previous dose. All laboratory and clinical parameters were assessed before and within 24 hours after tocilizumab administration. RESULTS: After receiving TCZ, all patients showed significantly lower median IL 6, LDH, CRP, ferritin , TLC at P < .001, and D\\\\Dimer at P = .223 than their baseline levels. Also, the number of patients who required mechanical ventilation decreased from 11 to 8. Only five patients died after TCZ treatment. A moderate correlation was found between therapeutic failure and death outcomes and mechanical ventilation need at baseline. The median days of hospitalisation (IQR) were 10 (6\\\\16). CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab treatment in patients with severe COVID\\\\19 is safe and has significant therapeutic effects and a significant role in the improvement of all laboratory parameters. Also TCZ plays a significant role in the reduction of the length of stay in hospital and ICU, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality rate. WHATS KNOWN: IL\\\\6 plays the main role in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe COVID\\\\19 infection. Consequently, serum IL\\\\6 can be considered as an important target in therapeutic management of severe COVID\\\\19 patients. WHATS NEW: Prospective study, carried on 25 adult patients with confirmed severe COVID\\\\19 infection using tocilizumab, showed significant improvement in their case. Tocilizumab, as an IL\\\\6 inhibitor, not only lowered IL\\\\6 level put also showed a significant reduction on median LDH, CRP, ferritin , TLC at P < .001 and D\\\\Dimer at P = .223 than their baseline levels.

To date it was unknown if documentation activities are related to the workload that nurses perceive. A distinction between clinical documentation and organizational documentation seems relevant. This study aims to gain insight into community nurses views on a potential relationship between their clinical and organizational documentation activities and their perceived nursing workload. METHODS: A convergent mixed-methods design was used. A quantitative survey was completed by 195 Dutch community nurses and a further 28 community nurses participated in qualitative focus groups. For the survey an online questionnaire was used. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon signed-ranked tests, Spearmans rank correlations and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to analyse the survey data. Next, four qualitative focus groups were conducted in an iterative process of data collection - data analysis - more data collection, until data saturation was reached. In the qualitative analysis, the six steps of thematic analysis were followed. RESULTS: The majority of the community nurses perceived a high workload due to documentation activities. Although survey data showed that nurses estimated that they spent twice as much time on clinical documentation as on organizational documentation, the workload they perceived from these two types of documentation was comparable. Focus-group participants found organizational documentation particularly redundant. Furthermore, the survey indicated that a perceived high workload was not related to actual time spent on clinical documentation, while actual time spent on organizational documentation was related to the perceived workload. In addition, the survey showed no associations between community nurses perceived workload and the user-friendliness of electronic health records. Yet focus-group participants did point towards the impact of limited user-friendliness on their perceived workload. Lastly, there was no association between the perceived workload and whether the nursing process was central in the electronic health records. CONCLUSIONS: Community nurses often perceive a high workload due to clinical and organizational documentation activities. Decreasing the time nurses have to spend specifically on organizational documentation and improving the user-friendliness and intercommunicability of electronic health records appear to be important ways of reducing the workload that community nurses perceive.","output":"Nursing documentation and its relationship with perceived nursing workload: a mixed-methods study among community nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Although Saudi Arabia harbors a large number of confirmed cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Kingdom is characterized by a low case fatality rate, compared to that of other parts of the world. Patient-specific factors can play a role in this observation. Thus, we conducted the present retrospective study to investigate the epidemiologic characteristics of all fatalities resulting from COVID-19 infection in Saudi Arabia as of April 27, 2020. Materials and Methods: The present study was a multicentric, retrospective study that retrieved the data of all confirmed COVID-19-related deaths in Saudi Arabia from March 2 to April 27, 2020. Only records of the cases who underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction laboratory tests to confirm the presence of COVID-19 were retrieved. The data of COVID-19 fatalities in Saudi Arabia were obtained from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network of the Ministry of Health. Results: Up to April 27, 2020, 147 cases of COVID-19-related deaths were reported in Saudi Arabia. Almost two-thirds of them were aged above 50 years and majority of them were male (83.7%). Health-care workers represented 3.1% of the dead cases (n = 4 cases). The vast majority of the cases were from Makkah (44.9%) and Madinah (21.8%). Among males, the number of Saudi cases was much lower than non-Saudi cases with 22 and 101 deaths, respectively. Over 80% of the included cases had reported signs and symptoms before death, mainly fever and cough. Out of the 129 cases who had available data regarding comorbidities, 104 cases (80.6%) had one or more comorbidities. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) time from the onset of symptoms till test result confirmation was 5.5 (5) days, while the median (IQR) time from sample collection till test result confirmation was 1 (2) day. On the other hand, the median time from symptom onset till hospitalization and that till death was 1 (3) and 7 (8) days, respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a growing pandemic with unprecedented spread rate and profound impact on the health of specific subsets of affected patients. In the present report, we demonstrated that fatalities from COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia are more common in older age groups, male patients, and non-Saudi residents. Besides, the presence of comorbidities is highly prevalent among fatalities from COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi health-care system has the advantage of fast-track diagnosis, which, in return, could have contributed to the low case fatality rate observed in the Kingdom. Further studies are required to identify the independent predictors of mortality for patients with COVID-19. ? 2021 Journal of Nature and Science of Medicine.","output":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of fatalities from covid-19 in Saudi Arabia: A Multicentric, retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The outbreak of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes a respiratory disease and individuals with pre-existing cardiometabolic disorders display worse prognosis through the infection course. The aim of this minireview is to present epidemiological data related to metabolic comorbidities in association with the SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a narrative mini-review with Pubmed search until April 23, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, treatment of coronavirus and following terms: diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, ACE-inhibitors, cytokine storm, immune response and vitamin D. RESULTS: Studies indicate that obese individuals are more likely to develop infections, and that adipose tissue serves as a pathogen reservoir. In diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes is seen due to constant glucose recognition by C type lectin receptors. Hypertensive individuals, usually grouped with other conditions, are treated with drugs to reduce blood pressure mostly through ACEi and ARB, that leads to increased ACE2 expression, used by SARS-CoV-2 for human's cell entry. Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon. Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases.

The impact on resident physicians, including minority providers, had not yet been reported. We aimed to assess how primary care residents perceived increased TM in clinics during the pandemic, and assess resident burnout. Materials and Methods: An online survey was sent to 60 internal medicine (IM) and 18 family medicine (FM) residents who used TM to treat underserved patients, from March to May 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire included questions on resident demographics, satisfaction with TM, screening capability for COVID-19, effectiveness for patient education on COVID-19, impact on patient interactions and time management. Burnout was assessed with the Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results: A majority (62 of 78) eligible residents (79.5%) responded to the survey. Ninety-one percent of residents agreed that TM was a secure alternative to face-to-face encounters. Seventy-nine percent used it to screen for signs/symptoms of COVID-19 and 93% provided patient education on COVID-19. Average visit length decreased by 10-20 min with TM. Post-TM, scores for overall burnout were decreased (p = 0.0003) and less residents in total exhibited burnout (p = 0.0156). Discussion and Conclusions: IM and FM residents viewed TM as an efficient way to screen for and provide education on COVID-19, as well as a secure alternative to face-to-face encounters.

The current preregistered study examined purpose in life as a psychological resource that may buffer against loneliness and increase intentions to engage in health protective behaviors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 517 adults (mean=37.71, SD=11.30; range=19-73) reported their levels of purpose in life, current and pre-pandemic levels of loneliness, and degrees to which they intended to engage in behaviors known to prevent the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: Across age, having a stronger sense of purpose in life was associated with lower loneliness, as well as greater intentions to engage in COVID protective behaviors. Higher loneliness was associated with lower intentions to maintain social distance and engage in additional health promotion behaviors such as handwashing. However, this link was not present at higher levels of purpose in life. Older age was also associated with less loneliness, but not for individuals with lower levels of purpose in life. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Results suggest that psychological resources such as purpose in life are associated with increased protective health behaviors. Further, purpose in life may reduce loneliness and counteract negative effects of stressors that diminish the willingness to engage in health protective behaviors.

Also, measured as age-standardized all-cause excess mortality in the first half of 2020 compared to previous years Sweden failed in comparison with the other Nordic countries, but only among the elderly. Sweden has large socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality. Geographical, ethnic, and socioeconomic inequalities in mortality can be due to differential exposure to the virus, differential immunity, and differential survival. Most of the country differences are due to differential exposure, but the socioeconomic disparities are mainly driven by differential survival due to an unequal burden of comorbidity. Sweden suffered from an unfortunate timing of tourists returning from virus hotspots in the Alps and Sweden's government response came later and was much more limited than elsewhere. The government had an explicit priority to protect the elderly in nursing and care homes but failed to do so.

Global spread, promptness, and dialogic potentials make these platforms ideal for public health monitoring and emergency communication in crises such as COVID-19. Objective Drawing on the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication framework, we sought to examine how leading health organizations use Instagram for communicating and engaging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We manually retrieved Instagram posts together with relevant metadata of four health organizations (WHO, CDC, IFRC, and NHS) shared between January 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. Two coders manually coded the analytical sample of 269 posts related to COVID-19 on dimensions including content theme, gender depiction, person portrayal, and image type. We further analyzed engagement indices associated with the coded dimensions. Results The CDC and WHO were the most active of all the assessed organizations with respect to the number of posts, reach, and engagement indices. Most of the posts were about personal preventive measures and mitigation, general advisory and vigilance, and showing gratitude and resilience. An overwhelming level of engagement was observed for posts representing celebrity, clarification, and infographics. Conclusions Instagram can be an effective tool for health organizations to convey their messages during crisis communication, notably through celebrity involvement, clarification posts, and the use of infographics.

The Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS) is a brief instrument designed to assess a broad range of trauma-related symptoms with no available validation in the Italian population. Aims: This study aimed at examining the factor structure of the Italian version of the GPS in a general population sample exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic and at evaluating trauma-related symptoms in the Italian population in the context of specific COVID-19 related risk factors associated with the implementation of lockdown measures and social distancing. Methods: Cross-sectional web-based observational study, as part of a long-term monitoring programme of mental health outcomes in the general population. 18147 participants completed a self-report online questionnaire to collect key demographic data and to evaluate trauma-related symptoms using the GPS, PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and PSS. Validation analyses included both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and correlation analyses. Results: Exploratory factor analyses supported both a two-factor and a three-factor model. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a one-factor solution that was used as a baseline comparison showed acceptable fit indices, the two-factor solution showed good fit indices, but the best fitting model was a three-factor solution, with Negative Affect (symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, irritability), core Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) (avoidance, re-experiencing, hyperarousal and insomnia) and Dissociative symptoms. GPS Risk factors as well as specific COVID-19 related stressful events, were associated with GPS total as well as the three factor scores. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a wide range of trauma-spectrum symptoms were reported by a large Italian sample during the COVID-19 pandemic. The GPS symptoms clustered best in three factors: Negative Affect symptoms, Core PTSS, and Dissociative symptoms. In particular high rates of core PTSS and negative affect symptoms were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and should be routinely assessed in clinical practice.","output":"Trauma-spectrum symptoms among the Italian general population in the time of the COVID-19 outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10 1177/1179547621996306 ]","output":"Corrigendum to \\"Diagnosis of Adult Onset Still's Disease in a Patient Who has recovered from Coronavirus-19\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing major surgery are at risk of complications, so-called serious adverse events (SAE).

In the model, nodes correspond to locations or communities that are connected by links indicating travel and commuting between different locations. While this proposed modelling framework can be applied on all levels of spatial granularity and different countries, we consider Ireland as a case study. The network comprises 3440 electoral divisions (EDs) of the Republic of Ireland and 890 superoutput areas (SOAs) for Northern Ireland, which corresponds to local administrative units below the NUTS 3 regions. The local dynamics within each node follows a phenomenological SIRX compartmental model including classes of Susceptibles, Infected, Recovered and Quarantined (X) inspired from Science 368, 742 (2020). For better comparison to empirical data, we extended that model by a class of Deaths. We consider various scenarios including the 5-phase roadmap for Ireland. In addition, as proof of concept, we investigate the effect of dynamic interventions that aim to keep the number of infected below a given threshold. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting containment measures on a national scale, which could also be implemented at a regional (county) or local (ED/SOA) level. We find that - in principle - dynamic interventions are capable to limit the impact of future waves of outbreaks, but on the downside, in the absence of a vaccine, such a strategy can last several years until herd immunity is reached.","output":"A metapopulation network model for the spreading of SARS-CoV-2: Case study for Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a commonly discarded tissue, the umbilical cord contains a rich source of mesenchymal stromal cells, which are therefore obtained non-invasively.

The planned development of technical healthcare models for prognosis and improved treatment outcomes that take into account not only genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, materials science perspectives but also the possible contribution of advanced digital technologies is best strategies for early diagnosis and infections control. In view of current pandemic, a Healthier Healthcare Management Model is proposed here as a source of standardized care having technology support, medical consultation, along with public health model of sanitization, distancing and contact less behaviours practices. Effective healthcare managements have been the main driver of healthier society where, positive action at identified research, technology and management segment more specifically public health, patient health, technology selection and political influence has great potential to enhanced the global response to COVID-19. The implementation of such practices will deliver effective diagnosis and control mechanism and make healthier society.","output":"The Healthier Healthcare Management Models for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The well-recognized genome editing ability of the CRISPR-Cas system has triggered significant advances in CRISPR diagnostics. This has prompted an interest in developing new biosensing applications for nucleic acid detection. Recently, such applications have been engineered for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Increased demand for testing and consumables of RT-qPCR assays has led to the use of alternate testing options in some cases. Here we evaluate the accuracy and performance of a novel fluorescence based assay that received EUA authorization from the FDA for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) technology forms the basis of the Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit using the CRISPR-Cas13a system. Our experimental strategy included selection of COVID-19 patient samples from previously validated RT-qPCR assays. Positive samples were selected based on a broad range of cycle thresholds. A total of 50 COVID-19 patient samples were correctly diagnosed with 100% accuracy (relative fluorescence ratios: N gene 95% CI 23.2-36.3, ORF1ab gene 95% CI 27.6- 45.4). All controls, including RNase P, showed expected findings. Overall ratios were robustly distinct between positive and negative cases relative to the pre-established 5-fold change in fluorescence read output. We have evaluated the accuracy of detecting conserved targets of SARS-CoV-2 across a range of viral loads using the SHERLOCK CRISPR collateral detection reaction in a clinical setting. These findings demonstrate encouraging results, especially at a time when COVID-19 clinical diagnosis is in high demand; often with limited resources. This approach highlights new thinking in infectious disease identification and can be expanded to measure nucleic acids in other clinical isolates.","output":"CRISPR-cas13 enzymology rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 fragments in a clinical setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To establish effective infection control protocols, understanding pathogen transmission pathways is essential. Non-infectious surrogate tracers may safely explore these pathways and challenge pre-existing assumptions. We used silica nanoparticles with encapsulated DNA (SPED) for the first time in a real-life hospital setting to investigate potential transmission routes of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in the context of a prolonged outbreak. METHODS: The two study experiments took place in the 900-bed University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. A three-run Patient experiment investigated pathogen transmission via toilet seats in a two-patient room with shared bathroom. First, various predetermined body and fomite sites in a two-bed patient room were probed at baseline. Then, after the first patient was contaminated with SPED at the subgluteal region, both patients sequentially performed a toilet routine. All sites were consequently swabbed again for SPED contamination. Eight hours later, further spread was tested at predefined sites in the patient room and throughout the ward. A two-run Mobile device experiment explored the potential transmission by mobile phones and stethoscopes in a quasi-realistic setting. All SPED contamination statuses and levels were determined by real-time qPCR. RESULTS: Over all three runs, the Patient experiment yielded SPED in 59 of 73 (80.8%) predefined body and environmental sites. Specifically, positivity rates were 100% on subgluteal skin, toilet seats, tap handles, and entertainment devices, the initially contaminated patients hands; 83.3% on patient phones and bed controls; 80% on intravenous pumps; 75% on toilet flush plates and door handles, and 0% on the initially not contaminated patients hands. SPED spread as far as doctors keyboards (66.6%), staff mobile phones (33.3%) and nurses keyboards (33.3%) after eight hours. The Mobile device experiment resulted in 16 of 22 (72.7%) positive follow-up samples, and transmission to the second patient occurred in one of the two runs. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time SPED were used to investigate potential transmission pathways in a real hospital setting. The results suggest that, in the absence of targeted cleaning, toilet seats and mobile devices may result in widespread transmission of pathogens departing from one contaminated patient skin region.","output":"Silica nanoparticles with encapsulated DNA (SPED) to trace the spread of pathogens in healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The tremendous global health burden related to COVID-19 means that identifying determinants of COVID-19 severity is important for prevention and intervention. We aimed to explore long-term exposure to ambient air pollution as a potential contributor to COVID-19 severity, given its known impact on the respiratory system. METHODS We used a cohort of all people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, aged 20 years and older and not residing in a long-term care facility in Ontario, Canada, during 2020. We evaluated the association between long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3), and risk of COVID-19-related hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. We ascertained individuals' long-term exposures to each air pollutant based on their residence from 2015 to 2019. We used logistic regression and adjusted for confounders and selection bias using various individual and contextual covariates obtained through data linkage. RESULTS Among the 151 105 people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ontario in 2020, we observed 8630 hospital admissions, 1912 ICU admissions and 2137 deaths related to COVID-19. For each interquartile range increase in exposure to PM2.5 (1.70 g/m3), we estimated odds ratios of 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.12), 1.09 (95% CI 0.98-1.21) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.90-1.11) for hospital admission, ICU admission and death, respectively. Estimates were smaller for NO2. We also estimated odds ratios of 1.15 (95% CI 1.06-1.23), 1.30 (95% CI 1.12-1.50) and 1.18 (95% CI 1.02-1.36) per interquartile range increase of 5.14 ppb in O3 for hospital admission, ICU admission and death, respectively.

In March 2020, stringent national restrictions were enforced in the UK to protect public health and slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Restrictions were likely to have resulted in collateral consequences for the health and welfare of horses and ponies, especially those at risk of obesity and laminitis and this issue warranted more detailed exploration. The current study utilised qualitative methodology to investigate the implications of COVID-19 related policies upon equine management and welfare with a focus on horses and ponies at risk of laminitis and obesity. Twenty-four interviews with five sub-groups of key equestrian welfare stakeholders in the UK were conducted between May and July of 2020 to understand the challenges facing equine welfare in the context of laminitis and obesity susceptible animals. Thematic analysis revealed lockdown-associated factors with the potential to compromise welfare of horses and ponies at risk of obesity and laminitis. These included: disparate information and guidance, difficulties enacting public health measures in yard environments, and horses having reduced exercise during the pandemic. Positive examples of clear and consistent information sharing by farriers were reported to have improved horse owner understanding of routine hoof care during lockdown. Analysis suggested that the recommendations for supporting the management-based needs of horses under reduced supervision were not clearly defined, or were not sufficiently disseminated, across the equine industry. These findings support the development of guidelines specific to the care of horses and ponies at risk of obesity and laminitis through collaborative input from veterinary and welfare experts, to reduce the negative impacts of future lockdown events in the UK.","output":"COVID-19 impacts equine welfare: Policy implications for laminitis and obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has become a challenge for the entire healthcare system.

Some countries have started reopening their economies under the threat of a second wave because studies show that only 4% of the population is infected so far and more waves will be needed to achieve herd immunity. Lockdowns have been used with a primary purpose of regulating the demand for healthcare while ignoring the economic consequences. Contrary to the lockdown strategy, some countries such as Brazil have given priority to their economy leading to very high infection and mortality rates. After a first wave of the pandemic, we now know something critically importantthose who are likely to become seriously ill and potentially die if SARS-CoV-2 infection is not prevented. That information cannot be ignored in our strategy and is used to control the pandemic. The paper proposes to focus on managing the risk of the virus being transmitted to the vulnerable rather than focusing on controlling all who can potentially transmit it. It argues that only 4% of the global population is at high risk of severe COVID-19 and would require hospital admission if infected. We propose to target this 4% of the population for preventive efforts. Protecting the vulnerable via lockdowns and other measures will be more effective and efficient than locking down the entire population and destroying their economies that are equally critical to life. We hypothesize that such targeted prevention strategies are more likely to help achieve our goals: 1) reduce mortality by preventing the infection reaching its potential victims, 2) spend the resources efficiently by knowing the target of our preventive efforts, and 3) achieve effective and efficient control of the pandemic without causing disruption to the socio-economic activities until an effective vaccine is available.","output":"Targeted Prevention of COVID-19, a Strategy to Focus on Protecting Potential Victims, Instead of Focusing on Viral Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: Intracellular communication is crucial to many biological processes, such as differentiation, development, homeostasis, and inflammation.

METHOD We conducted an annual survey of all freshmen for the period of 2016-2018 in a Chinese comprehensive university, with a sample size of 23,206. An online questionnaire including standardized self-report instruments was used to assess sociodemographic factors, childhood experiences of left-behind (CELB), and maltreatments (CEMTs) including beating (CEB), neglect (CEN), sexual abuse (CESA), recent stress, and current depression (measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire).

Patients were tested either prior to radiotherapy simulation or after simulation but prior to treatment initiation. Patients tested for indications of ILI symptoms were excluded from this analysis. Management of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients was individualized based on disease site and acuity. Results: Over a three-month period, a total of 385 tests were performed in 336 asymptomatic patients either prior to simulation (n=75), post-simulation, prior to treatment (n=230), or on-treatment (n=49). A total of 5 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, for a pre-treatment prevalence of 1.3% (2.6% in North/Central NJ and 0.4% in Southern NJ/Southeast PA). The median age of positive patients was 58 years (range: 38-78 years). All positive patients were white and were relatively equally distributed with regard to gender (2 male, 3 female) and ethnicity (2 Hispanic and 3 non-Hispanic). The median Charlson comorbidity score among positive patients was 5.

The goal of this paper was to review the literature to date regarding possible links between SARS-CoV-2 infection and neuroimmune demyelinating diseases such as MS and its related disorders, with the aim of positing a hypothesis for disease exacerbation.

We hypothesize that a glial inflammatory response may contribute to damaged oligodendrocytes and blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, allowing a second route for CNS invasion and lymphocyte infiltration. Potential for molecular mimicry and the stimulation of autoreactive T cells against myelin is also described. It is imperative that further studies on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion address the adverse effects of the virus on myelin and exacerbation of MS symptoms, as nearly 3 million people suffer from MS worldwide.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and Multiple Sclerosis: Potential for Disease Exacerbation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past 20 years, major progress has been made in our understanding of critical aspects of rabies epidemiology and control. This paper presents results of recent research, highlighting methodological advances that have been applied to burden of disease studies, rabies epidemiological modelling and rabies surveillance. These results contribute new insights and understanding with regard to the epidemiology of rabies and help to counteract misperceptions that currently hamper rabies control efforts in Africa. The conclusion of these analyses is that the elimination of canine rabies in Africa is feasible, even in wildlife-rich areas, through mass vaccination of domestic dogs and without the need for indiscriminate culling to reduce dog population density. Furthermore, the research provides valuable practical insights that support the operational planning and design of dog vaccination campaigns and rabies surveillance measures.","output":"The changing landscape of rabies epidemiology and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many to work remotely from home, collaborating solely through digital technologies, a growing population of remote home workers are faced with profound wellbeing challenges. Passive sensing devices and ambient feedback have great potential to support the wellbeing of the remote workers, but there is a lack of background and understanding of the domestic workplace in terms of physical and affective dimensions and challenges to wellbeing. There are profound research gaps on wellbeing in the domestic workplace, with the current push for remote home and hybrid working making this topic timely. To address these gaps and shape a starting point for an ambient workspaces agenda, we conducted an exploratory study to map physical and affective aspects of working from home. The study involved both qualitative and quantitative measures of occupant experience, including sensor wristbands, and a custom web application for self-reporting mood and aspects of the environment. It included 13 participants for a period of 4 weeks, during a period of exclusive home working. Based on quantitative and qualitative analysis, our study addresses wellbeing challenges of the domestic workplace, establishes correlations between mood and physical aspects, and discusses the impact of feedback mechanisms in the domestic workplace on the behavior of remote workers. Insights from these observations are then used to inform a future design agenda for ambient technologies that supports the wellbeing of remote workers;addressing the design opportunities for ambient interventions in domestic workspaces. This work offers three contributions: 1) qualitatively and quantitatively informed understandings of the experiences of home-workers;2) a future design agenda for ambient home workspaces;and 3) we propose three design concepts for ambient feedback and humanCAI interactions in the built environment, to illustrate the utility of the design agenda. ?

Their compromised living environment and limited physical and socioeconomic facilities make them highly sensitive to COVID-19. The Government of Bangladesh and international aid agencies have applied WHO's IPC (Infection, Prevention, and Control) guidelines to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 outbreaks and enhance their resilience. However, Rohingyas often disregard these guidelines or become reluctant to follow them. Building on 10 in-depth interviews, 66 questionnaires, and observation, the study investigates the limitations and challenges of implementing these guidelines toward building community resilience. It assesses their resilience, focusingon Kutupalong camp, Cox's Bazar?one of the world's largest refugee camps. Findings reveal that Rohingya's past experience associated with their psychological trauma largely influences their current actions and demotivates them fromfollowing the health guidelines. Their deep mistrust of and disrespect to healthcare providers and aid agencies discourage them to follow the IPC. Also, insufficient built infrastructure and unhygienic living conditions, including improper WASH management, increase their risk to COVID-19. The study highlights a need for understanding their socio-psychological values and cultural narratives and recommends a set of guidelines for policymakers and aid agencies to build community resilience to COVID -19.","output":"Investigating the resilience of refugee camps to COVID-19: A case of Rohingya settlements in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Marketers are adopting increasingly sophisticated ways to engage with customers throughout their journeys. We extend prior perspectives on the customer journey by introducing the role of digital signals that consumers emit throughout their activities. We argue that the ability to detect and act on consumer digital signals is a source of competitive advantage for firms. Technology enables firms to collect, interpret, and act on these signals to better manage the customer journey. While some consumers desire for privacy can restrict the opportunities technology provides marketers, other consumers desire for personalization can encourage the use of technology to inform marketing efforts. We posit that this difference in consumers willingness to emit observable signals may hinge on the strength of their relationship with the firm. We next discuss factors that may shift consumer preferences and consequently affect the technology-enabled opportunities available to firms.

However, the epidemiology and outcomes of bloodstream infections (BSI) in COVID-19 patients (pts) remains undefined. We report the utilization of blood cultures, risk factors and mortality associated with BSI in a large cohort of COVID-19 pts. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of all COVID-19 pts that had BC performed during hospitalization at HFHS, a 5-hospital system in southeast Michigan. BSI was defined using NHSN criteria. Demographics, comorbidities, severity of illness, and outcome of pts with and without BSI were compared. RESULTS: From 3/10/2020 to 4/28/2020, 2541 pts were hospitalized with lab-confirmed COVID-19. 1393 (55%) of these pts had BC performed and 80 (5.74%) met criteria for BSI. Of the 84 pathogens identified, Staphylococcus aureus was most common (Figure 1). As compared to 1313 COVID-19 pts without BSI, those with BSI were older (70.1 vs 64.5 years, P = 0.0024). Other factors significantly associated with BSI included chronic kidney disease, higher mSOFA score, ICU stay and mechanical ventilation (all P < 0.0001) (Table 1). Multivariate analysis revealed age (OR, 1.07 CI [1.06C1.08]), ICU stay (OR, 7.91 [CI: 5.75C10.87]) and mSOFA score (OR, 1.29 [CI: 1.13C1.47]) were independent risk factors associated with mortality. BSI was not associated with increased mortality (Table 3). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Although more than half of hospitalized COVID-19 pts had BC done, the number of BSI were low suggesting overutilization of BC. BSI was associated with older age and disease severity. Mortality was not affected by BSI but was primarily driven by age and severity of illness.

The initial concept of an enteromammary immunologic axis in monogastrics originated from studies of lactogenic immunity to TGEV in swine. These studies revealed that infection of pregnant swine with virulent TGEV stimulated high titers of SIgA antibodies in milk which correlated with protection of suckling pigs against TGE; parenteral or oral inoculation with live attenuated or killed TGEV vaccines induced mainly IgG antibodies in milk which generally provided poor protection to suckling pigs. The recent appearance of PRCV infections in swine and continuing studies of TGEV infections, present a unique model for further studies of mucosal immunity. Research using these viruses has increased our understanding of the various components of the common mucosal immune system and their interactions. Although the most important consideration in designing an effective vaccine for TGEV is the stimulation of GALT through intestinal virus replication, studies addressing the contribution of BALT to immunity to TGEV and PRCV may provide insights for alternative vaccine approaches. The mechanism by which exposure to PRCV elicits a variable degree of immunity to TGEV challenge is unknown. Virus replication in the gut or respiratory tract is a major factor affecting the magnitude of the immune response at the respective site and may be necessary for the recruitment of specific immune cells from other mucosal inductive sites, i.e., GALT to BALT and BALT to GALT migration. Further studies on the induction and immune regulation of specific responses to TGEV and PRCV that affect the distribution patterns of IgM-, IgG- and IgA-antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and T lymphocytes should provide valuable insights for optimizing vaccine regimens to elicit the highest mucosal immune responses and optimal protection against TGEV challenge.","output":"Immunity to transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus infections in swine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to rapid acceleration in the deployment of new digital technologies to improve both accessibility to and quality of care, and to protect staff. Mixed-reality (MR) technology is the latest iteration of telemedicine innovation; it is a logical next step in the move toward the provision of digitally supported clinical care and medical education. This technology has the potential to revolutionize care both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This pilot project sought to deploy the HoloLens2 MR device to support the delivery of remote care in COVID-19 hospital environments. METHODS: A prospective, observational, nested cohort evaluation of the HoloLens2 was undertaken across three distinct clinical clusters in a teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Data pertaining to staff exposure to high-risk COVID-19 environments and personal protective equipment (PPE) use by clinical staff (N=28) were collected, and assessments of acceptability and feasibility were conducted. RESULTS: The deployment of the HoloLens2 led to a 51.5% reduction in time exposed to harm for staff looking after COVID-19 patients (3.32 vs 1.63 hours/day/staff member; P=.002), and an 83.1% reduction in the amount of PPE used (178 vs 30 items/round/day; P=.02). This represents 222.98 hours of reduced staff exposure to COVID-19, and 3100 fewer PPE items used each week across the three clusters evaluated. The majority of staff using the device agreed it was easy to set up and comfortable to wear, improved the quality of care and decision making, and led to better teamwork and communication. In total, 89.3% (25/28) of users felt that their clinical team was safer when using the HoloLens2. CONCLUSIONS: New technologies have a role in minimizing exposure to nosocomial infection, optimizing the use of PPE, and enhancing aspects of care. Deploying such technologies at pace requires context-specific information security, infection control, user experience, and workflow integration to be addressed at the outset and led by clinical end-users. The deployment of new telemedicine technology must be supported with objective evidence for its safety and effectiveness to ensure maximum impact.","output":"Use of the HoloLens2 Mixed Reality Headset for Protecting Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Prospective, Observational Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to a substantial decline in pancreas transplantation (PT) across the United States over the past 15 years, we sought to understand the perceptions and practices of US PT programs.

One hundred twenty three responses were recorded from 56 unique programs. Program characteristics were obtained from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Respondents were transplant surgeons (71%), transplant nephrologists (17%), trainees (9%), and allied professionals (3%). Programs were defined according to annual volume as: low (<5 PT/year), intermediate (6-20), or high (>20). High-volume programs reported that these factors were most important for increased PT: expansion of recipient selection, more aggressive donor utilization, and hiring of PT program-specific personnel. At both the program and national level, the vast majority (82% and 79%, respectively) felt the number of PTs currently performed are not in balance with patients' needs. Overall, programs reported that the option of PT is not offered adequately to diabetic patients and that strategies to maintain higher PT volume are most evident at intermediate, and especially, high-volume programs.

SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has significantly reduced the risk of symptomatic disease. Several studies have reported the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy, with no adverse effect on obstetric outcomes. However, obstetric outcomes following a booster dose of the SARS CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy have yet been published. Objective To examine the association between booster dose of the SARS CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy and obstetric outcomes. Methods A retrospective cohort study of women who delivered between July and October 2021 at a large tertiary medical center. We compared women who received the booster vaccine during pregnancy to women who were not vaccinated and to those who had only received two vaccines. Primary outcomes were the incidence of preterm labor and of small for gestational age. Secondary outcomes were other maternal and neonatal complications. A secondary analysis investigating the association between the timing from vaccination to delivery and outcomes was also performed. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to adjust for potential confounders. Results There were 6507 women who met the inclusion criteria: 294 women received three vaccines, 2,845 women received only two vaccines and 3,368 were unvaccinated. Patients receiving three vaccines were older and more likely to smoke compared to unvaccinated patients. No differences were noted between triple-vaccinated, twice-vaccinated and unvaccinated groups with regards to preterm birth and small for gestational age. Regarding secondary outcomes, women in the triple vaccine group had higher rates of PPH (9.5 vs 3.21%, P<0.001), gestational diabetes (12.2 vs. 8.3 %, p=0.02), and were less likely to have hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (0% vs 1.4%, p=0.041) compared to the unvaccinated group. Compared to twice-vaccinated patients, patients with three vaccines were more likely to experience PPH (9.5 vs. 3.5%, p<0.001), and were less likely to have a low umbilical artery pH (0.7 vs 6.1%, p<0.001). In the sensitivity analysis comparing patients delivered within 2 weeks of the third vaccination (n=53) to those delivered at least 6 weeks after vaccination (n=96), there were no differences in the rates of SGA, preterm birth, PPH, or cesarean delivery. Conclusion The booster dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with adverse obstetric outcomes compared to unvaccinated or twice-vaccinated women. However, higher rates of PPH were observed. Further studies on a larger scale are needed to confirm these findings.","output":"Safety of 3rd SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (booster dose) during pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural disasters and epidemics can strain already-fragile health systems, diverting resources away from essential sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, threatening supply chains, and adversely impacting access to health facilities.

There may be needs specific to black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations in these circumstances that remain thus far unexplored. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with dementia and their family carers of BAME backgrounds, in relation to their experiences of community dementia care and the impact on their daily lives. DESIGN: 15 participants (persons with dementia and carers) were recruited for semistructured qualitative interviews. Respondents were of South Asian and Afro-Caribbean backgrounds. We used thematic analysis to analyse our data from a constructivist perspective, which emphasises the importance of multiple perspectives, contexts and values. RESULTS: There were a number of ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted BAME persons with dementia and carers with regard to their experiences of dementia community care and the impact on their everyday lives. In particular we identified eight key themes, with subthemes: fear and anxiety, food and eating (encompassing food shopping and eating patterns), isolation and identity, community and social relationships, adapting to COVID-19, social isolation and support structures, and medical interactions. Fear and anxiety formed an overarching theme that encompassed all others. DISCUSSION: This paper covers unique and underexplored topics in a COVID-19-vulnerable group.

This study aims to describe patients lived experiences, challenges faced by people with chronic conditions, their coping strategies, and the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a qualitative study using a syndemic framework to understand the patients experiences of chronic disease care, challenges faced during the lockdown, their coping strategies and mitigators during the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of socioecological and biological factors. A diverse sample of 41 participants with chronic conditions (hypertension, diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular diseases) from four sites (Delhi, Haryana, Vizag and Chennai) in India participated in semistructured interviews. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, translated, anonymised and coded using MAXQDA software. We used the framework method to qualitatively analyse the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on health, social and economic well-being. RESULTS: Participant experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic were categorised into four themes: challenges faced during the lockdown, experiences of the participants diagnosed with COVID-19, preventive measures taken and lessons learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic. A subgroup of participants faced difficulties in accessing healthcare while a few reported using teleconsultations. Most participants reported adverse economic impact of the pandemic which led to higher reporting of anxiety and stress. Participants who tested COVID-19 positive reported experiencing discrimination and stigma from neighbours. All participants reported taking essential preventive measures. CONCLUSION: People with chronic conditions experienced a confluence (reciprocal effect) of COVID-19 pandemic and chronic diseases in the context of difficulty in accessing healthcare, sedentary lifestyle and increased stress and anxiety.

Most prefer in-person appointments for more serious tests detecting cancer (54%) and fetal miscarriage (53%). Excluding sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing, there are no clinically significant differences in preference between respondents previously diagnosed with the condition in question and respondents without such experience. When weighing the possibility of a 3-week wait to hear from their provider, most patients want automatic release of cholesterol (94%), strep throat (90%), genetic (68%), and STD (60%) test results, but the majority say it is unacceptable to receive Alzheimers (52%), fetal miscarriage (51%), and cancer (59%) test results this way.

Based on these effects, we therefore postulated the hypothesis that patients with acute bronchitis would also benefit from therapy with Cineole. METHODS: As part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center-study, a total of 242 patients with confirmed acute bronchitis was randomly selected to participate. Over a period of 10 days, all patients were administered 3 x 200 mg of Cineole, or a respective placebo, per day. The primary outcome measure was a Bronchitis Sum Score, which summarises the relevant symptoms of acute bronchitis. RESULTS: After 4 days of treatment it was notable, that the patient group treated with Cineole, showed significantly more improvements of the bronchitis-sum-score than those of the placebo group (p = 0.0383). The statistical significant difference of the individual outcome measures was especially underlined by the frequency of cough fits by p = 0.0001 after 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of Cineole in the treatment of acute bronchitis were clearly measurable and could be proven after a treatment period of merely 4 days. This study corroborates the fact that Cineole actively and significantly reduces cough frequency after four days. Therefore it has been shown to have a great socioeconomic impact.

METHODS: All COVID-19 patients admitted to the only two hospitals covering the whole South-Limburg region between February 27, 2020 and January 4, 2021 were included. Incidence rates for hospitalization due to COVID-19 were determined for the IBD (n = 4980) and general population (n = 597,184) in South-Limburg. RESULTS: During a follow-up of 4254 and 510,120 person-years, 20 IBD patients (0.40%; 11 ulcerative colitis (UC), 9 Crohns disease (CD)) and 1425 (0.24%) patients from the general population were hospitalized due to proven COVID-19 corresponding to an incidence rate of 4.7 (95% Confidence interval (CI) 3.0C7.1) and 2.8 (95% CI 2.6C2.9) per 1000 patient years, respectively (Incidence rate ratio: 1.68, 95% CI 1.08C2.62, p = 0.019).

Compounds 1-7 were isolated for the first time from the plant. The isolated compounds were virtually screened against four critical components of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the main protease (Mpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Stilbene dimers 1-4 showed remarkable binding affinities towards the investigated targets (binding energy &lt;?7.6 kcal/mol). Compounds 1, 3 and 4 interacted with the catalytic dyad (Cys145-His41) at the active pocket of Mpro which is essential for achieving good inhibitory activity. Compounds 1-3 showed molecular interaction with the conserved ubiquitin-specific protease residues of PLpro, responsible for binding ability at different active sites of nsp13, which are crucial for decreasing the resistance caused by viral immune evasion. Compounds 2 and 3 showed the ability to bind at different active sites of nsp13, which is a key binding site for reducing antiviral resistance. Finally, compounds 1-3 showed the ability to bind with RdRp before and after RNA binding. Our findings suggested that the dimeric stilbene skeleton is a promising candidate for developing anti-COVID-19 drugs.

This is most commonly performed on respiratory secretions obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab. Due to supply chain limitations and high demand worldwide because of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to commercial nasopharyngeal swabs has not been assured. 3D printing methods have been used to meet the shortfall. For longer-term considerations, 3D printing may not compare well with injection molding as a production method due to the challenging scalability and greater production costs of 3D printing. METHODS: To secure sufficient nasopharyngeal swab availability for our national healthcare system, we designed a novel injection molded nasopharyngeal swab (the IM2 swab). We performed a clinical diagnostic study comparing the IM2 swab to the Copan FLOQSwab. Forty patients with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 and 10 healthy controls were recruited. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the same nostril of each participant and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. RESULTS: When compared to the Copan FLOQswab, results from the IM2 swab displayed excellent overall agreement and positive percent agreement of 96.0% and 94.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference in mean RT-PCR cycle threshold values for the ORF1ab (28.05 vs. 28.03, p = 0.97) and E-gene (29.72 vs. 29.37, p = 0.64) targets, respectively. We did not observe any significant adverse events and there was no significant difference in patient-reported pain. CONCLUSION: In summary, the IM2 nasopharyngeal swab is a clinically safe, highly accurate option to commercial nasopharyngeal swabs.

Study Selection Randomized clinical trials of pharmacological treatments for neonatal abstinence syndrome alone or in combination with adjuvant treatments. Abstract, title, and full-text screening were conducted independently by 2 reviewers (T.D. and C.G.). Data Extraction and Synthesis Data extraction was conducted independently by 2 reviewers (T.D. and C.G.) according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)-Network Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and data were pooled with fixed-effect models as a result of the low number of trials that were included in the analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the length of treatment. The length of stay, need for adjuvant therapy, and adverse events were considered as secondary outcomes. Results Eighteen trials (N = 1072) were eligible for inclusion. The treatments that were included in the length of treatment analysis were buprenorphine, clonidine, diluted tincture of opium and clonidine, diluted tincture of opium, morphine, methadone, and phenobarbital. Sublingual buprenorphine was considered the optimal treatment for a reduction in the length of treatment (days: mean difference vs morphine, -12.75 [95% CI, -17.97 to -7.58]; median rank, 1 [3-1]) and length of stay (days: mean difference vs morphine, -11.43 [95% CI, -16.95 to -5.82]; median rank, 1 [3-1]) but not the need for adjuvant treatment (odds ratio vs morphine, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.46-3.44]; median rank, 3 [5-1]). The results were robust to bias but sensitive to imprecision. Conclusions and Relevance The current evidence suggests that buprenorphine is the optimal treatment for neonatal abstinence treatment, but limitations are considerable and wide-scale adoption requires a large multisite trial. Morphine, which is considered standard of care in most hospitals, was the lowest-ranked opioid for length of treatment and length of stay.","output":"Pharmacological Treatments for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mechanisms of [8 + 2] cycloaddition reactions between dienylfurans/dienylisobenzofurans and the activated alkyne, DMAD (dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate), have been investigated by DFT calculations. The former [8 + 2] reaction is stepwise, starting from attack of the diene substituent on furan, not the furyl moiety in dienylfurans, to DMAD to give a diradical intermediate, which then undergoes ring closure to form the second bond between DMAD and the furan moiety, generating the final [8 + 2] cycloadducts. In contrast, the latter [8 + 2] reaction starts from [4 + 2] cycloaddition of the diene in the furan ring of dienylisobenzofurans toward DMAD, followed by the rate-determining stepwise [1,5]-vinyl shift, forming the [8 + 2] products. The different mechanisms of [8 + 2] reactions are attributed to the facts that for dienylfurans, the reactive diene part is the diene substituent on furan, but in the case of dienylisobenzofurans, it is the diene in the furan ring (its reaction with DMAD to generate an aromatic benzene ring is the driving force for this regiochemistry). Consequently, the [8 + 2] reactions begin with the reaction of the most reactive part of tetraene (either the diene substituent on furan for dienylfurans or the diene in the furan ring for dienylisobenzofurans) with DMAD. FMO analysis and kinetic study have been carried out to gain more information of the reaction mechanisms. Two [8 + 2] reactions of dienylisobenzofurans with different substituents toward DMAD have also been further analyzed by DFT calculations in this paper.","output":"Density Functional Theory Study of Mechanisms of [8 + 2] Cycloadditions of Dienylfurans/Dienylisobenzofurans with DMAD."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: : Chronic liver diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are associated with COVID-19 progression.

Amid growing concerns regarding an infodemic, ensuring the quality of information is a crucial vector of public health. Investigating whether and how Wikipedia remained up to date and in line with science is key to formulating strategies to counter misinformation. Using citation analyses, we asked which sources informed Wikipedias COVID-19Crelated articles before and during the pandemics first wave (JanuaryCMay 2020). RESULTS: We found that coronavirus-related articles referenced trusted media outlets and high-quality academic sources. Regarding academic sources, Wikipedia was found to be highly selective in terms of what science was cited. Moreover, despite a surge in COVID-19 preprints, Wikipedia had a clear preference for open-access studies published in respected journals and made little use of preprints. Building a timeline of English-language COVID-19 articles from 2001C2020 revealed a nuanced trade-off between quality and timeliness. It further showed how pre-existing articles on key topics related to the virus created a framework for integrating new knowledge. Supported by a rigid sourcing policy, this scientific infrastructure facilitated contextualization and regulated the influx of new information. Last, we constructed a network of DOI-Wikipedia articles, which showed the landscape of pandemic-related knowledge on Wikipedia and how academic citations create a web of shared knowledge supporting topics like COVID-19 drug development.

We defined pulmonary hypertension as increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of &#8805; 25 mm Hg at rest. In our literature search, we identified 4 articles with details on pulmonary hypertension. Among these, two reported various echocardiographic details for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension.

Italy is the hardest hit country after China. Considering the deleterious consequences of malnutrition, which certainly can affect patients with COVID-19, the aim of this article is to present a pragmatic protocol for early nutritional supplementation of non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease. It is based on the observation that most patients present at admission with severe inflammation and anorexia leading to a drastic reduction of food intake, and that a substantial percentage develops respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation or even continuous positive airway pressure. Methods High-calorie dense diets in a variety of different consistencies with highly digestible foods and snacks are available for all patients. Oral supplementation of whey proteins as well as intravenous infusion of multivitamin, multimineral trace elements solutions are implemented at admission. In the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficit, cholecalciferol is promptly supplied. If nutritional risk is detected, two to three bottles of protein-calorie oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are provided. If <2 bottles/d of ONS are consumed for 2 consecutive days and/or respiratory conditions are worsening, supplemental/total parenteral nutrition is prescribed.

The development of targeted drugs is held back due to a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the perturbation of cell physiology observed after viral infection. Recently, several approaches, aimed at identifying cellular proteins that may contribute to COVID-19 pathology, have been reported. Albeit valuable, this information offers limited mechanistic insight as these efforts have produced long lists of cellular proteins, the majority of which are not annotated to any cellular pathway. We have embarked in a project aimed at bridging this mechanistic gap by developing a new bioinformatic approach to estimate the functional distance between a subset of proteins and a list of pathways. A comprehensive literature search allowed us to annotate, in the SIGNOR 2.0 resource, causal information underlying the main molecular mechanisms through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and related coronaviruses affect the host-cell physiology. Next, we developed a new strategy that enabled us to link SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins to cellular phenotypes via paths of causal relationships. Remarkably, the extensive information about inhibitors of signaling proteins annotated in SIGNOR 2.0 makes it possible to formulate new potential therapeutic strategies. The proposed approach, which is generally applicable, generated a literature-based causal network that can be used as a framework to formulate informed mechanistic hypotheses on COVID-19 etiology and pathology.","output":"A Resource for the Network Representation of Cell Perturbations Caused by SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundUp-to-date seroprevalence estimates are critical to describe the SARS-CoV-2 immune landscape in the population and guide public health measures.

The role of potential risk factors such as disruption of normal life, perceived threat of the disease, acquaintance with someone infected and gender; and protective factors, such as adherence to a daily routine and altruism was evaluated. An online questionnaire entailing demographics, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), measures of life disruption, perceived threat and adherence to a daily routine and an altruism scale was completed by 1018 undergraduates. Increased levels of depression, anxiety, stress and negative affect were found. Life disruption and perceived threat of the disease were risk factors in all psychological distress measures, while a stable, satisfying daily routine and altruism mitigated the negative consequences.

It has created an unanticipated global public health crisis that is spreading rapidly in India as well, posing a serious threat to 1350 million persons. Among the factors, population density is foremost in posing a challenge in controlling the COVID-19 contagion. In such extraordinary times, evidence-based knowledge is the prime requisite for pacifying the effect. In this piece, we have studied the district wise transmissions of the novel coronavirus in five south Indian states until 20th July 2020 and its relationship with their respective population density. The five states are purposefully selected for their records in better healthcare infrastructure vis--vis other states in India. The study uses Pearsons correlation coefficient to account for the direct impact of population density on COVID-19 transmission rate. Response surface methodology approach is used to validate the correlation between density and transmission rate and spatiotemporal dynamics is highlighted using Thiessen polygon method. The analysis has found that COVID-19 transmission in four states (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana) strongly hinges upon the spatial distribution of population density. In addition, the results indicate that the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to differ with demographic density.

However, it remains unclear how the acceptance and uptake of these apps can be improved. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the coverage of the SwissCovid app and the reasons for its nonuse in Switzerland during a period of increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We collected data between September 28 and October 8, 2020, via a nationwide online panel survey (COVID-19 Social Monitor, N=1511). We examined sociodemographic and behavioral factors associated with app use by using multivariable logistic regression, whereas reasons for app nonuse were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Overall, 46.5% (703/1511) of the survey participants reported they used the SwissCovid app, which was an increase from 43.9% (662/1508) reported in the previous study wave conducted in July 2020. A higher monthly household income (ie, income >CHF 10,000 or >US $11,000 vs income &#8804;CHF 6000 or <US $6600 [reference]: odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.40-2.64), more frequent internet use (ie, daily [reference] vs less than weekly: OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.85), better adherence to recommendations for wearing masks (ie, always or most of the time [reference] vs rarely or never: OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.52), and nonsmoker status (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01-1.71) were associated with an increased likelihood for app uptake. Citizenship status (ie, non-Swiss citizenship vs. Swiss [reference]: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.87), and language region (French vs Swiss German [reference]: OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.80) were associated with a lower likelihood for app uptake. Further analysis in a randomly selected subsample (n=712) with more detailed information showed that higher levels of trust in government and health authorities were also associated with a higher likelihood for app uptake (ie, high vs low [reference] trust: OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.58-6.22). The most frequent reasons for app nonuse were lack of perceived benefit of using the app (297/808, 36.8%), followed by the lack of a compatible phone (184/808, 22.8%), and privacy concerns (181/808, 22.4%).

The method is based on a microwave-assisted solid-liquid extraction approach (MA-SLE), using an aqueous solution of an ionic liquid (IL)-based surfactant as extraction phase. The method does not require organic solvents, nor any clean-up step, apart from filtration prior to the injection in the analytical system. Two IL-based surfactants were evaluated, and the method was optimized by using experimental designs, resulting in the use of small amounts of sample (100 mg) and extraction phase (2.25 mL), low concentrations of the selected 1-hexadecyl-3-butyl imidazolium bromide IL (0.1 mM), and 30 min of extraction time. The proposed methodology was applied for the determination of the polyphenolic pattern of six different varieties of Vitis vinifera leaves from the Canary Islands, using high-performance liquid chromatography and photodiode array detection for the quantification of the compounds. The proposed MA-SLE approach was greener, simpler, and more effective than other methods, while the results from the analysis of the leaves samples demonstrate that these by-products can be exploited as a source of natural compounds for many applications.","output":"Sustainable Micro-Scale Extraction of Bioactive Phenolic Compounds from Vitis vinifera Leaves with Ionic Liquid-Based Surfactants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Onco-hematologic patients are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, once infected, frequently develop COVID-19 due to the immunosuppression caused by tumor growth, chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy.

Furthermore, radiologists' image quality requirements vary with the scan type and diagnostic task. Therefore, the same score may have different implications for different scans.

Image rulers address varying quality standards and provide a concrete way of interpreting raw scores from the CNN. The model supports assessments of two of the most common artifacts in MRI: noise and motion. It achieves accuracies of around 90%, 6% better than the best previous method examined, and 3% better than human experts on noise assessment.

Baseline testing included anthropometrics, physical fitness status, and evaluation of PALs, while follow-up included only PALs (evaluated by a standardized questionnaire through an internet application). The results showed a significant influence of the living environment on the decrease of PAL, with a larger decrease in urban adolescents. Logistic regression showed a higher likelihood for normal PALs at baseline in adolescents who had better fitness status, with no strong confounding effect of the urban/rural environment. The fitness status of urban adolescents predicted their PALs at follow-up. The differences between urban and rural adolescents with regard to the established changes in PALs and relationships between the predictors and PALs are explained by the characteristics of the living communities (lack of organized sports in rural areas), and the level of social distancing in the studied period and region/country.","output":"Levels and changes of physical activity in adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Contextualizing urban vs. Rural living environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency Medicine staff in Australia and New Zealand are at the forefront of the healthcare response to COVID-19.

Within this article, we focus on the challenges within primary health care and hospital organization, cooperation between primary and specialist care, and access to health care services: In Lombardy, neglected primary health care with a comparatively low availability of general practitioners (GPs) per inhabitant, the initial prioritization of hospitals during the pandemic while neglecting primary health care in terms of personal protective equipment (PPE), the lack of testing resources, and a failure to achieve coordinated support contributed to a quick overburdening of hospitals, where the dissolution of traditional departments into macro-areas may favor nosocomial infections during an ongoing pandemic. Neither specialized medicine nor privatization, but rather flexible public healthcare services working in consistent cooperation with GPs, show better efficiency in containing viral spread and managing patients. Strengthening the primary health care sector with regard to human and technical resources and supporting the coordination between the different levels of health care providers help to avoid overcrowded hospitals, while protecting patients and health care workers during large-scale health emergencies.

AIMS The current study was designed to determine the incidence and types of bacteria present in the synovial fluid of native knee joints from adult patients with diagnoses of septic arthritis and OA. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients were enrolled between October 2010 and January 2013. Synovial fluid samples from the affected knee were collected and evaluated with both traditional microbial culture and polymerase chain reaction-electrospray ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (molecular diagnostics [MDx]) to prospectively characterize the microbial content. Patients were grouped by diagnosis into one of two cohorts, those with clinical suspicion of septic arthritis (n = 44) and those undergoing primary arthroplasty of the knee for OA (n = 21). In all cases where discrepant culture and MDx results were obtained, we performed species-specific 16S rRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as a confirmatory test. RESULTS MDx testing identified bacteria in 50% of the suspected septic arthritis cases and 29% of the arthroplasty cases, whereas culture detected bacteria in only 16% of the former and 0% of the latter group. The overall difference in detection rates for culture and MDx was very highly significant, p-value = 2.384  10-7. All of the culture-positive cases were typed as Staphylococcus aureus. Two of the septic arthritis cases were polymicrobial as was one of the OA cases by MDx. FISH testing of the specimens with discordant results supported the MDx findings in 91% (19/21) of the cases, including one case where culture detected S. aureus and MDx detected Streptococcus agalactiae. CONCLUSIONS MDx were more sensitive than culture, as confirmed by FISH. FISH only identifies bacteria that are embedded or infiltrated within the tissue and is thus not susceptible to contamination. Not all suspected cases of septic arthritis contain bacteria, but a significant percent of patients with OA, and no signs of infection, have FISH-confirmed bacterial biofilms present in the knee.","output":"Polymerase Chain Reaction-Electrospray-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Versus Culture for Bacterial Detection in Septic Arthritis and Osteoarthritis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first cases of influenza A/H1N1 (swine flu) were confirmed in the UK on 27th April 2009, after a novel virus first identified in Mexico rapidly evolved into a pandemic. The swine flu outbreak was the first pandemic in more than 40 years and for many, their first encounter with a major influenza outbreak. This study examines public understandings of the pandemic, exploring how people deciphered the threat and perceived they could control the risks. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used to recruit seventy three people (61 women and 12 men) to take part in 14 focus group discussions around the time of the second wave in swine flu cases. RESULTS: These discussions showed that there was little evidence of the public over-reacting, that people believed the threat of contracting swine flu was inevitable, and that they assessed their own self-efficacy for protecting against it to be low. Respondents assessed a greater risk to their health from the vaccine than from the disease. Such findings could have led to apathy about following the UK Governments recommended health protective behaviours, and a sub-optimal level of vaccine uptake. More generally, people were confused about the difference between seasonal influenza and swine flu and their vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests a gap in public understandings which could hinder attempts to communicate about novel flu viruses in the future. There was general support for the government's handling of the pandemic, although its public awareness campaign was deemed ineffectual as few people changed their current hand hygiene practices.

This changing world can evoke negative emotions that have been traditionally linked to higher anxiety. Researches have been focused on the positive outcomes of trait emotional intelligence (TEI) preventing psychological disorders. However, the possibility that TEI might have a dark side has been neglected. Hence, this study aimed to explore the mediating effect of the three dimensions of TEI in the relationship between negative affect and anxiety symptoms among college students. Participants of this research were 467 undergraduates who completed an online self-reported questionnaire including the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger et al., 1970), and Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24, Salovey et al., 1995). The global serial mediation model showed that the total amount of variance explained by the global model was 30.8% (R(2) = 0.31). Negative affectivity and age accounted for the 15.1% of state anxiety variance (R(2) = 0.15; c: B = 0.63, p < 0.001) while 15.7% of the variance of state anxiety was attributed to the direct or indirect effect of the three dimensions of TEI (R(2) = 0.16). Five indirect effects presented statistical significance (95% BootCI). The contrast analyses between mediators showed that three indirect effects had higher statistical weigh; the ability of negative affect to increase state anxiety through (i) emotional attention; (ii) emotional clarity, and (iii) serially through emotional clarity and mood repair. Our results indicated that students negative emotions lead to higher emotional attention which in turn may enhance state anxiety in two ways: by a direct effect of emotional attention on state anxiety and by a serial effect through emotional clarity. Moreover, when negative affect is associated with lower emotional clarity, anxiety symptoms may also arise. However, when attention and clarity are connected, the negative effect is reversed into a positive one, decreasing state anxiety.","output":"Lights and Shadows of Trait Emotional Intelligence: Its Mediating Role in the Relationship Between Negative Affect and State Anxiety in University Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human-animal interface is as ancient as the first bipedal steps taken by humans.

We explored subjective cognitive functioning and mental health changes and their possible interplay related to COVID-19-lockdown. We also investigated potential risk factors to identify more vulnerable groups. Across Italy, 1215 respondents completed our Qualtrics-based online-survey during the end of a seven to 10-week imposed lockdown and home confinement (from April 29 to May 17, 2020). We found subjective cognitive functioning and mental health severely changed in association with the lockdown. Under government regulations, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in routine tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functions-with no changes in language abilities. A paradoxical effect was observed for memory, with reduced forgetfulness compared to pre-lockdown. We found higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, abnormal sleep, appetite changes, reduced libido and health anxiety: with mild-to-severe depression and anxiety prevalence climbing to 32 and 36 percent, respectively, under restrictions. Being female, under 45 years, working from home or being underemployed were all identified as relevant risk factors for worsening cognition and mental health. Frequent consumers of COVID-19 mass media information or residents in highly infected communities reported higher depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly hypochondria in the latter. If similar restrictions are reimposed, governments must carefully consider these more vulnerable groups in their decisions, whilst developing effective global and long-term responses to the cognitive and mental health challenges of this type of pandemic; as well as implementing appropriate psychological interventions with specific guidelines: particularly regarding exposure to COVID-19 mass-media reports.","output":"Cognitive and mental health changes and their vulnerability factors related to COVID-19 lockdown in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtual strategies for health care visits during a pandemic must not exclude marginalized patients.","output":"A Patient With COVID-19 Is Left Behind As Care Goes Virtual."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on phenotypic screening, the major advantages of phosphorus dendrimers and dendrons as drugs allowed the discovery of new therapeutic applications, for instance, as anti-cancer and anti-tuberculosis agents.

To improve communication between healthcare staff of signs and symptoms of infection we developed an instrument, using qualitative data from observations by nursing assistants when they suspected infection. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of nursing assistants observations by developing and testing the instrument for early detection of infection in elderly nursing home residents. METHODS The early detection of infection (EDIS) instrument was based on data from focus interviews with nursing assistants. Over one year the nursing assistants used EDIS to document episodes of suspected early signs and symptoms of infection in 204 nursing home residents. Two physicians classified documented episodes as \\"no infection\\", \\"possible infection\\", and \\"infection\\". The content validity of the 13 items of the EDIS was established to explore the relationships between the items. The construct validity was used to explore the relationship between the items and the presence or absence of infection. The predictive value of the developed model was evaluated by the percentage of correct classifications of the observed cases. Generalized linear model (ordinal multinomial distribution and logit link) was used. RESULTS Of the 388 events of suspected infection, 20 % were assessed as no infection, 31 % as possible infection and 49 % as infection. Content validity analysis showed that 12/13 of the items correlated significantly with at least one other statement. The range in number of significant inter-correlations was from 0 (\\"pain\\") to 8 (\\"general signs and symptoms of illness\\"). The construct validity showed that the items \\"temperature\\" , \\"respiratory symptoms\\" and \\"general signs and symptoms of illness\\" were significantly related to \\"infection\\", and these were also selected in the model-building. These items predicted correct alternative responses in 61 % of the cases. CONCLUSION The validation of EDIS suggests that the observation of \\"general signs and symptoms of illness\\", made by nursing assistants should be taken seriously in detecting early infection in frail elderly. Also, the statement \\"He/She is not as usual\\" should lead to follow-up.","output":"Nursing assistants: \\"he seems to be ill\\" - a reason for nurses to take action: validation of the Early Detection Scale of Infection (EDIS)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which targets the pulmonary vasculature is supposed to induce an intrapulmonary right to left shunt with an increased pulmonary blood flow. We report here what may be, to the best of our knowledge, the first videoendoscopic descriptions of an hypervascularization of the bronchial mucosa in two patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Cases Presentation: Two patients, 27- and 37-year-old, were addressed to our Pneumology department for suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia. Their symptoms (fever, dry cough, and dyspnoea), associated to pulmonary ground glass opacities on thoracic CT, were highly suggestive of a COVID-19 disease despite repeated negative pharyngeal swabs RT-PCR. In both patients, bronchoscopy examination using white light was unremarkable but NBI bronchoscopy revealed a diffuse hypervascularization of the mucosa from the trachea to the sub-segmental bronchi, associated with dilated submucosal vessels. RT-PCR performed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) confirmed the presence of Sars-CoV-2. Conclusions: These two case reports highlight the crucial importance of the vascular component of the viral disease. We suggest that such bronchial hypervascularization with dilated vessels contributes, at least in part, to the intrapulmonary right to left shunt that characterizes the COVID-19 related Acute Vascular Distress Syndrome (AVDS).

The objective of this study is to analyze the incidence of peripheral neuropathy in patients with RA and its association with the occurrence of falls. METHODS: Patients were assessed by an electroneuromyography (ENMG) exam and by a questionnaire on accidental falls occurrence in the previous 12 months. They were also assessed on balance by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), functionality by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), disease activity by the Disease Activity Score (DAS-28), neuropathic pain by the Questionnaire for the Diagnosis of Neuropathic Pain (DN4), and cutaneous sensitivity of the feet by the monofilament testing of SemmesCWeinstein. Monthly calls on falls were made in the subsequent six months. Data analysis was performed using the ShapiroCWilk test for normality and Spearman, Chi-square, and T-student correlation tests, with a significant P level  0.05. RESULTS: A sample of 33 patients were evaluated. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 48.5%, of which 68.7% were axonal and 31.3% myelinic. The sensorimotor type was present in 64.7%, motor in 17.6%, and sensorial in 11.7% of the cases. Neuropathy was associated to balance (P = 0.026), neuropathic pain (P = 0.016), deep tendon reflexes absence (P = 0,049), altered skin sensitivity of the feet (P = 0.029) and fear of falling (P = 0.001). No association was found between peripheral neuropathy and age, gender, disease activity, or functionality. No significant association was found between peripheral neuropathy and occurrence of falls, in a 12-month retrospective and 6-month prospective evaluation.

Professional medical societies endorse LARC use in AYAs and, more recently, have emphasized the importance of using a reproductive justice framework when providing LARC. This article reviews reproductive justice, discusses contraceptive coercion, examines bias, and highlights interventions that promote equitable reproductive healthcare. RECENT FINDINGS Research indicates that both bias and patient characteristics influence provider LARC practices. AYA access to comprehensive LARC services is limited, as counseling, provision, management, and removal are not offered at all sites providing reproductive healthcare to AYAs. Interventions aimed at addressing provider bias and knowledge, clinic policies, confidentiality concerns, insurance reimbursement, and systems of oppression can improve AYA access to equitable, comprehensive contraceptive care. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequities in reproductive healthcare, as well as provided unique innovations to decrease barriers, including telemedicine LARC services. SUMMARY Clinicians who care for AYAs should honor reproductive autonomy by approaching contraceptive services with a reproductive justice lens. This includes implementing patient-centered contraceptive counseling, increasing access to LARC, eliminating barriers to LARC removal, and committing to systemic changes to address healthcare inequities.","output":"Addressing long-acting reversible contraception access, bias, and coercion: supporting adolescent and young adult reproductive autonomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome continue to be significant causes of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care setting.

The immunogenic response associated with the use of alternative schemes to complete the scheme was not explored. METHODS: We did two non-inferiority randomized clinical trials with outcomes measures blinded to investigators on adults aged 21C65 years, vaccinated with a single dose of rAd26  30 days before screening and no history of SARS-CoV-2. Participants were assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive either rAd5; ChAdOx1; rAd26; mRNA-1273 or BBIBP-CorV. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentration at 28 days after the second dose, when comparing rAd26/rAd5 with rAd26/ChAdOx1, rAd26/rAd26, rAd26/mRNAmRNA-1273 and rAd26/BBIBP-CorV. Serum neutralizing capacity was evaluated using wild type SARS-CoV-2 reference strain 2019 B.1. The safety outcome was 28-day rate of serious adverse. The primary analysis included all participants who received  1 dose. The studies were registered with NCT04962906 and NCT05027672. Both trials were conducted in Buenos Aires, Argentina. FINDINGS: Between July 6 and August 3, 2021, 540 individuals (age 567 [SD 73]; 243 (45%) women) were randomly assigned to received rAd5 (n=150); ChAdOx1 (n=150); rAd26 (N=87); mRNAmRNA-1273 (n=87) or BBIBP-CorV (n=65). 524 participants completed the study. As compared with rAd26/rAd5 (100), the GMR (95%CI) at day 28 was 065 (051C084) among those who received ChAdOx1; 047 (034C066) in rAd5; 353 (268C465) in mRNA-1273 and 023 (016C033) in BBIBP-CorV.

RECENT FINDINGS Permanent contraception remains the most commonly used form of contraception in the United States with the majority of procedures performed during birth-hospitalization. Many people live in regions with a high Catholic hospital market share where individual contraceptive plans may be refused based on religious doctrine. Obesity should not preclude an individual from receiving a postpartum tubal ligation as recent studies find that operative time is clinically similar with no increased risk of complications in obese compared with nonobese people. The largest barrier to provision of permanent contraception remains the federally mandated consent for sterilization for those with Medicaid insurance. State variation in enforcement of the Medicaid policy additionally contributes to unequal access and physician reimbursement. Although significant barriers exist in policy that will take time to improve, hospital-based interventions, such as listing postpartum tubal ligation as an 'urgent' procedure or scheduling interval laparoscopic salpingectomy prior to birth-hospitalization discharge can make a significant impact in actualization of desired permanent contraception for patients.

We considered the suspected-infected-removed (SIR) model and performed a maximum likelihood-based grid search to determine the removal rate (?). The transmission was modeled as a stochastic random walk process, and sequential Monte Carlo simulation was run 100 times with bootstrap fits to infer the transmission rate () and R(t). According to the simulation, the (real) peak daily incidence of 3,600 would be followed by a steady decline, reaching below 1,000 in late January 2021. Thus, the model predicted that there would still be more than 300 cases/day even after a year. However, with proper interventions, a much steeper decline would be achieved following the peak.

MethodsWithin an adult subset of the Virus Watch community cohort study, we sought to identify which non-household activities increased risk of acquisition of COVID-19 infection and which accounted for the greatest proportion of non-household acquired COVID-19 infections during the second wave of the pandemic. Among participants who were undertaking antibody tests and self-reporting PCR and lateral flow tests taken through the national testing programme, we identified those who were thought to be infected outside the household during the second wave of the pandemic. We used exposure data on attending work, using public or shared transport, using shops and other non-household activities taken from monthly surveys during the second wave of the pandemic. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess the relative independent contribution of these exposures on risk of acquiring infection outside the household. We calculated Adjusted Population Attributable Fractions (APAF - the proportion of non-household transmission in the cohort thought to be attributable to each exposure) based on odds ratios and frequency of exposure in cases. ResultsBased on analysis of 10475 adult participants including 874 infections acquired outside the household, infection was independently associated with: leaving home for work (AOR 1.20 (1.02 - 1.42) p=0.0307, APAF 6.9%); public transport use (AOR for use more than once per week 1.82 (1.49 - 2.23) p<0.0001, APAF for public transport 12.42%); and shopping (AOR for shopping more than once per week 1.69 (1.29 - 2.21) P=0.0003, APAF for shopping 34.56%). Other non-household activities such as use of hospitality and leisure venues were rare due to restrictions and there were no significant associations with infection risk. ConclusionsA high proportion of the second wave of the pandemic was spent under conditions where people were being advised to work from home where possible, and to minimize exposure to shops, and a wide range of other businesses were subject to severe restrictions. Vaccines were being rolled out to high-risk groups. During this time, going to work was an important risk factor for infection but public transport use likely accounted for a lot of this risk. Only a minority of the cohort left home for work or used public or shared transport. By contrast, the majority of participants visited shops and this activity accounted for about one-third of non-household transmission.","output":"Relative contribution of leaving home for work or education, transport, shopping and other activities on risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection outside the household in the second wave of the pandemic in England and Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related headache is the fifth most frequent symptom and the most common neurologic manifestation of the disease with a prevalence of 6.5%-27.9%.

The optimal technique for stoma formation is unknown although recent studies have focused on whether placement of prophylactic mesh at stoma formation can reduce PSH rates. The aim of this study was to systematically review use of prophylactic mesh versus no mesh with regard to occurrence of PSH and peristomal complications. Methods A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Embase? and the Cochrane Library to identify randomised controlled trials that analysed placement of prophylactic mesh versus no mesh at time of initial surgery. Meta-analysis was performed using random effects methods. Results A total of 506 studies were identified by our search strategy. Of these, 8 studies were included, involving 430 patients (217 mesh vs 213 no mesh). Prophylactic mesh placement resulted in a significantly lower rate of PSH formation (42/217 [19.4%] vs 92/213 [43.2%]) with a combined risk ratio of 0.40 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.75, p=0.004). Placement of prophylactic mesh did not result in increased peristomal complications (15/218 [6.9%] vs 16/227 [7.0%]) with a combined risk ratio of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.49-2.01, p=0.990). Conclusions Prophylactic placement of mesh at primary stoma formation may reduce the incidence of PSH, without an increase in peristomal complications. However, the overall quality of the randomised controlled trials included in the meta-analysis was poor, and should prompt caution regarding the applicability of the findings of the individual studies and the meta-analysis to everyday practice.","output":"Prophylactic mesh use during primary stoma formation to prevent parastomal hernia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly responsible for respiratory involvement but cardiac complications are also reported.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of baricitinib plus standard of care versus standard of care alone (which included systemic corticosteroids and remdesivir) in patients hospitalized in the United States with COVID-19. Methods An economic model was developed in Microsoft Excel to simulate the inpatient stay, discharge to post-acute care, and recovered patients. Costs modelled included payer costs, hospital costs, and indirect costs. Benefits modelled included life years, quality-adjusted life years, deaths avoided, and use of mechanical ventilation avoided. The primary analysis was performed from a payer perspective over a lifetime horizon; a secondary analysis was also performed from the hospital perspective. The base case analysis modelled the numerical differences in treatment effectiveness observed in the COV-BARRIER trial. Scenario analyses were also performed in which the clinical benefit of baricitinib was limited to the statistically significant reduction in mortality demonstrated in the trial. Findings In the base case payer perspective, combination treatment with baricitinib plus standard of care resulted in an incremental total cost of $17,276, a total quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.6703, and a total life-year gain of 0.837 compared with standard of care alone. The addition of baricitinib also increased survival by 5.1% and reduced the use of mechanical ventilation by 1.6%. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $25,774 per QALY gained and $20,638 per life year gained; the mortality only scenario analysis yielded similar results of $26,862 per QALY gained and $21,433 per life year gained. For the hospital perspective, combination treatment with baricitinib plus standard of care was more effective and less costly than standard of care alone in the base case, and it resulted in an incremental cost of $38,964 per death avoided in the mortality only scenario. Implications Our study showed that adding baricitinib to standard of care is cost effective for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States. Cost effectiveness was demonstrated for both payer and hospital perspectives. These findings were robust to sensitivity analyses and to conservative assumptions limiting the clinical benefits of baricitinib to the statistically significant reduction in mortality demonstrated in the COV-BARRIER trial.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of Baricitinib Compared with Standard of Care in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 in the United States: A Modelling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serum samples from 14 lions (Panthera leo) from Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, were collected during 1998 and 1999 to determine infectious disease exposure in this threatened population.

Pre-mRNA splicing, for instance, relies on the spatial proximity of the splice junctions that can be separated by very long introns. Similar effects appear in the processing of RNA virus genomes. Albeit a crude measure, the distribution of spatial distances in thermodynamic equilibrium harbors useful information on the shape of the molecule that in turn can give insights into the interplay of its functional domains. RESULT: Spatial distance can be approximated by the graph-distance in RNA secondary structure. We show here that the equilibrium distribution of graph-distances between a fixed pair of nucleotides can be computed in polynomial time by means of dynamic programming. While a na?ve implementation would yield recursions with a very high time complexity of O(n(6)D(5)) for sequence length n and D distinct distance values, it is possible to reduce this to O(n(4)) for practical applications in which predominantly small distances are of of interest. Further reductions, however, seem to be difficult. Therefore, we introduced sampling approaches that are much easier to implement. They are also theoretically favorable for several real-life applications, in particular since these primarily concern long-range interactions in very large RNA molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The graph-distance distribution can be computed using a dynamic programming approach. Although a crude approximation of reality, our initial results indicate that the graph-distance can be related to the smFRET data.

METHODS During the study period (August and September 2020) 843 patients (THA n = 394, KA n = 449) from ten centres in the UK reported their EuroQol five dimension (EQ-5D) scores and completed a waiting list questionnaire (2020 group). Patient demographic details, procedure, and date when listed were recorded. Patients scoring less than zero for their EQ-5D score were defined to be in a health state \\"worse than death\\" (WTD). Data from a retrospective cohort (January 2014 to September 2017) were used as the control group. RESULTS The 2020 group had a significantly worse EQ-5D score compared to the control group for both THA (p < 0.001) and KA (p < 0.001). Over one-third (35.0%, n = 138/394) of patients waiting for a THA and nearly a quarter (22.3%, n = 100/449) for KA were in a health state WTD, which was significantly greater than the control group (odds ratio 2.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 2.93) and 2.08 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.70), respectively; p < 0.001). Over 80% (n = 680/843) of the 2020 group felt that their quality of life had deteriorated while waiting. Each additional month spent on the waiting list was independently associated with a decrease in quality of life (EQ-5D: -0.0135, p = 0.004). There were 117 (13.9%) patients who wished to defer their surgery and the main reason for this was health concerns for themselves and or their family (99.1%, n = 116/117).

METHODS: Due to the complex eligibility criteria for COVID-19 tests and the EHR implementationCrelated challenges of ordering these tests, care providers have faced obstacles in selecting the appropriate test modality. As test choice is dependent upon specific patient criteria, we built a decision tree within the EHR to automate the test selection process by using a branching series of questions that linked clinical criteria to the appropriate SARS-CoV-2 test and triggered an EHR flag for patients who met our institutional persons under investigation criteria. RESULTS: The percentage of tests that had to be canceled and reordered due to errors in selecting the correct testing modality was 3.8% (23/608) before CDS implementation and 1% (262/26,643) after CDS implementation (P<.001). Patients for whom multiple tests were ordered during a 24-hour period accounted for 0.8% (5/608) and 0.3% (76/26,643) of pre- and post-CDS implementation orders, respectively (P=.03). Nasopharyngeal molecular assay results were positive in 3.4% (826/24,170) of patients who were classified as asymptomatic and 10.9% (1421/13,074) of symptomatic patients (P<.001). Positive tests were more frequent among asymptomatic patients with a history of exposure to COVID-19 (36/283, 12.7%) than among asymptomatic patients without such a history (790/23,887, 3.3%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The leveraging of EHRs and our CDS algorithm resulted in a decreased incidence of order entry errors and the appropriate flagging of persons under investigation. These interventions optimized reagent and personal protective equipment usage. Data regarding symptoms and COVID-19 exposure status that were collected by using the decision tree correlated with the likelihood of positive test results, suggesting that clinicians appropriately used the questions in the decision tree algorithm.","output":"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record and Computerized Provider Order Entry Data for Resource Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Development of a Decision Tree"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This article provides an insight into the behaviour of adolescents during the COVID-19 crisis through a comparison with the life of young people living in France under German occupation during the Second World War. METHOD: We conducted a literature review of articles in the CAIRN, SCOPUS and PsycINFO databases using the keywords zazou, adolescent and COVID-19. RESULTS: The zazou movement was a manifestation of young people's denial of the war through derision. Initially discredited, it was subsequently violently repressed by collaborationists and supporters of Marshal Petain, as it was interpreted as an enemy of politics. In particular, it ran contrary to the Vichy regime's desire that young French men should spearhead the national revolution. The reaction among young people was to feel that they were being used by ageing politicians, who they considered were out of touch with reality. With respect to adolescents during the COVID-19 crisis, our review found that the French government has pressurised them to make sacrifices for the rest of the population, and has ignored their greater need for social links with peers. Many adolescents feel that they have been forgotten, in the midst of measures that have been imposed upon them with no explanation. This may have led, as in the 1940s, to a feeling of being instrumentalised and demonised by politicians. CONCLUSION: We argue that, in both cases, the dominant oppressive atmosphere has fostered similar behaviours and mental mechanisms. We therefore recommend that, rather than demonising young people, efforts should be made to include them in decision-making processes, in order to improve their understanding of the situation and encourage them to feel included.","output":"Can We Compare the Behaviour of the Zazous in the 1940s and Adolescents during the COVID-19 Crisis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inadequate supply of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) for healthcare workers during a pandemic such as the novel coronavirus outbreak (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health issue. The aim of this study was to synthesize existing data on the effectiveness of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) for N95 FFR decontamination. A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020176156) was conducted on UVGI in N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined eligibility and extracted predefined variables. Original research reporting on function, decontamination, or mask fit following UVGI were included. Thirteen studies were identified, comprising 54 UVGI intervention arms and 58 N95 models. FFRs consistently maintained certification standards following UVGI. Aerosol penetration averaged 1.19% (0.70-2.48%) and 1.14% (0.57-2.63%) for control and UVGI arms, respectively. Airflow resistance for the control arms averaged 9.79 mm H2O (7.97-11.70 mm H2O) vs 9.85 mm H2O (8.33-11.44 mm H2O) for UVGI arms. UVGI protocols employing a cumulative dose >20,000 J/m2 resulted in a 2-log reduction in viral load. A >3-log reduction was observed in seven UVGI arms using >40,000 J/m2. Impact of UVGI on fit was evaluated in two studies (16,200; 32,400 J/m2) and no evidence of compromise was found. Our findings suggest that further work in this area (or translation to a clinical setting) should use a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m2 or greater, and confirm appropriate mask fit following decontamination.","output":"Decontaminating N95 and SN95 masks with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation does not impair mask efficacy and safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has produced substantial impacts on our society. Wastewater surveillance has increasingly been introduced to support the monitoring, and thus mitigation, of COVID-19 outbreaks and transmission. Monitoring of buildings and sub-sewershed areas via a wastewater surveillance approach has been a cost-effective strategy for mass testing of residents in congregate living situations such as universities. A series of spatial and spatiotemporal data are involved with wastewater surveillance, and these data must be interpreted and integrated with other information to better serve as guidance on response to a positive wastewater signal. The management and analysis of these data poses a significant challenge, in particular, for the need of supporting timely decision making. In this study, we present a web-based spatial decision support system framework to address this challenge. Our study area is the main campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. We develop a spatiotemporal data model that facilitates the management of space-time data related to wastewater surveillance. We use spatiotemporal analysis and modeling to discover spatio-temporal patterns of COVID-19 virus abundance at wastewater collection sites that may not be readily apparent in wastewater data as they are routinely collected. Web-based GIS dashboards are implemented to support the automatic update and sharing of wastewater testing results. Our web-based SDSS framework enables the efficient and automated management, analytics, and sharing of spatiotemporal data of wastewater testing results for our study area.

Although various molecular diagnostic methods based on nucleic acid amplification have been suggested as gold standards for identifying different species, these methods are not suitable for the rapid diagnosis of pathogens owing to their long result acquisition times and complexity. In this study, we developed a rapid bio-optical sensor that uses a ball-lensed optical fiber (BLOF) probe and an automatic analysis platform to precisely diagnose infectious pathogens. The BLOF probe is easy to align and has a high optical sensing sensitivity (1.5-fold) and a large detection range (1.2-fold) for an automatic optical sensing system. Automatic signal processing of up to 250 copies/reaction of DNA of Q-fever-causing Coxiella burnetii was achieved within 8 min. The clinical utility of this system was demonstrated with 18 clinical specimens (9 Q-fever and 9 other febrile disease samples) by measuring the resonant wavelength shift of positive or negative samples for Coxiella burnetii DNA. The results from the system revealed the stable and automatic optical signal measurement of DNA with 100% accuracy.

In addition to being historically significant, the current sample was unusual in that those quarantined were all members of a Modern Orthodox Jewish community and were connected via religious institutions at which exposure may have occurred. We sought to explore the community and religious factors unique to this sample, as they relate to the psychological and public health impact of quarantine. Community organizations were trusted more than any other source of COVID-19-related information, including federal, state and other government agencies, including the CDC, WHO and media news sources. This was supported qualitatively with open-ended responses in which participants described the range of supports organized by community organizations. These included tangible needs (i.e., food delivery), social support, virtual religious services, and dissemination of COVID-19-related information. The overall levels of distress and anxiety were elevated and directly associated with what was reported to be largely inadequate and inconsistent health-related information received from local departments of health. In addition, the majority of participants felt that perception of or concern about future stigma related to a COVID-19 diagnosis or association of COVID-19 with the Jewish community was high and also significantly predicted distress and anxiety. The current study demonstrates the ways in which religious institutions can play a vital role in promoting the well-being of their constituents. During this unprecedented pandemic, public health authorities have an opportunity to form partnerships with religious institutions in the common interests of promoting health, relaying accurate information and supporting the psychosocial needs of community members, as well as protecting communities against stigma and discrimination.","output":"A Look at the First Quarantined Community in the USA: Response of Religious Communal Organizations and Implications for Public Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chemotherapeutic enteritis is a major dose-limiting adverse reaction to chemotherapy, with few effective drugs in clinic. Intestinal ischemic injury plays prominent role in chemotherapeutic enteritis clinically. However, mechanism is not clear. In this article, irinotecan (CPT-11) was used to establish chemotherapeutic enteritis mice model. Western blotting, gelatin zymography, immunohistochemistry (IHC), Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) were used to detect the pathogenesis of ischemia-hypoxia injury. CPT-11 increased levels of tissue factor (TF) both in the blood and in intestines, and decreased the intestinal blood flow in mice. Interestingly, the elevation of TF in the blood displayed \\"double-peak,\\" which was consistent with the intestinal mucosal \\"double-strike\\" injury trend. Intestinal microthrombus and mixed thrombus formation were detectable in chemotherapeutic enteritis. Furthermore, ozone therapy relieved chemotherapeutic enteritis in mice. Ozone inhibited TF expression induced by CPT-11 via activating AMPK/SOCS3, and effectively ameliorated the intestinal mucosal injury in mice. Moreover, ozone autotransfusion therapy effectively attenuated chemotherapeutic enteritis and the blood hypercoagulability in patients. For the first time, we proposed that TF-induced thrombotic intestinal ischemic injury is a core trigger pathological mechanism of chemotherapeutic enteritis, and provided a new treatment strategy, ozone therapy, to suppress TF expression and treat chemotherapeutic enteritis.","output":"AMPK activation by ozone therapy inhibits tissue factor-triggered intestinal ischemia and ameliorates chemotherapeutic enteritis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is a novel strain of human beta-coronavirus that has produced over two million deaths and affected one hundred million individuals worldwide.

This paper investigates the impact of higher NPL ratios on the availability of bank credit among international lenders and emerging market borrowers. The paper finds that a rise in NPL ratios in both lender and borrower countries is positively associated with higher banking outflows from emerging market economies. Two additional features emerge in the patterns of cross-border banking flows when NPL ratios rise that are related to international credit market imperfections. First, lenders are more responsive to a rise in NPL ratios of same-region borrowers. This is consistent with the reversion to the mean effect given their generally high exposures to the same-region borrowers. Second, while a high share of US-dollar-denominated debt is generally positively associated with withdrawals of funds from emerging market borrowers, lenders are less responsive to a rise in NPL ratios in emerging market economies if their liabilities are denominated more in US dollars.

Aim: To understand the dynamics of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibody response and its protective role against re-infection in a cohort of HCWs. Materials and Methods: This observational longitudinal cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Gurugram, North India from June to December 2020. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Serum specimens from 230 HCWs were tested for anti-spike protein Immunogloublin G (IgG) antibodies by chemiluminescence immunoassay. The HCWs with positive antibody status and previous Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) confirmed infection (n=47) were followed-up over 180 days for serial antibody titres at four visits, each at a gap of 30-45 days. Participants were classified into asymptomatic (n=18), mild (n=17) and moderate (n=12) disease categories based on severity of previous COVID-19 illness. SPSS version 22.0 was used for statistical analysis. Intergroup comparison of means was done using Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square test. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Positivity rate for anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 25.7%. Seroconversion rate was 90.74% in HCWs with history of previous Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 infection. Incidence of infection in seronegative group (n=171) was 12.96 per 10,000 person days while in seropositive group, it was 1.29 per 10,000 person days. Risk ratio for infection (baseline seronegative vs baseline seropositive) was determined to be 8.12 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.068-61.755]. Incidence of PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 re-infection was inversely associated with antibody titres (p=0.018). Antibody response trend showed a peak in mean titres in the 46-90 days period followed by steep decline till 135 days and a gradual waning till 180 days. Conclusion: Significant postinfection immunity is offered by even low to moderate amounts of antibodies and this occurs regardless of whether a seropositive HCW had previous asymptomatic or symptomatic infection.

This is anticipated to result in long-term negative mental health effects on the population, with HCWs representing a particularly vulnerable group. The scope of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the development of a scalable mental health platform to provide services to large numbers of at-risk or affected individuals. The Mount Sinai Health System in New York City was at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The Center for Stress, Resilience, and Personal Growth (CSRPG) was created to address the current and anticipated psychological impact of the pandemic on the HCWs in the health system. The mission of the Center is to support the resilience and mental health of employees through educational offerings, outreach, and clinical care. Our aim was to build a mobile app to support the newly founded Center in its mission. METHODS: We built the app as a standalone digital platform that hosts a suite of tools that users can interact with on a daily basis. With consideration for the Centers aims, we determined the overall vision, initiatives, and goals for the Wellness Hub app, followed by specific milestone tasks and deliverables for development. We defined the apps primary features based on the mental health assessment and needs of HCWs. Feature definition was informed by the results of a resilience survey widely distributed to Mount Sinai HCWs and by the resources offered at CSRPG, including workshop content. RESULTS: We launched our app over the course of two phases, the first phase being a soft launch and the second being a broader launch to all of Mount Sinai. Of the 231 HCWs who downloaded the app, 173 (74.9%) completed our baseline assessment of all mental health screeners in the app. Results from the baseline assessment show that more than half of the users demonstrate a need for support in at least one psychological area. As of 3 months after the Phase 2 launch, approximately 55% of users re-entered the app after their first opening to explore additional features, with an average of 4 app openings per person. CONCLUSIONS: To address the mental health needs of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Wellness Hub app was built and deployed throughout the Mount Sinai Health System. To our knowledge, this is the first resilience app of its kind. The Wellness Hub app is a promising proof of concept, with room to grow, for those who wish to build a secure mobile health app to support their employees, communities, or others in managing and improving mental and physical well-being.

COVID-19 has made clear systemic disparities in terms of access to healthcare and economic precarity. Our objective was to examine the mental health repercussions of COVID-19 on adult females living in Fort McMurray, Canada in light of their unique circumstances and challenges. METHOD: To investigate this issue, we analyzed responses gathered from an anonymous cross-section of online survey questionnaire responses gathered from females living in the Fort McMurray area (n = 159) during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 24CJune 2, 2021). This included relevant demographic, mental health history, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as COVID-19 data. Chi-squared analysis was used to determine outcome relevance, and binary logistic regression was employed to generate a model of susceptibility to PTSD. RESULTS: 159 females completed the survey. The prevalence of putative PTSD in our sample was 40.8%. A regression analysis revealed 4 variables with significant, unique contributions to PTSD. These were: a diagnosis of depression; a diagnosis of anxiety; job loss due to COVID-19; and lack of support from family and friends. Specifically, women with a previous diagnosis of either depression or anxiety were ~4C5 times more likely to present with PTSD symptomatology in the wake of COVID-19 (OR = 3.846; 95% CI: 1.13C13.13 for depression; OR = 5.190; 95% CI: 1.42C19.00 for anxiety). Women who reported having lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic were ~5 times more likely to show evidence of probable PTSD (OR = 5.182; 95% CI: 1.08C24.85).

METHODS: IDSA formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise. Process followed a rapid recommendation checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. Then a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. RESULTS: The IDSA guideline panel agreed on 7 treatment recommendations and provided narrative summaries of other treatments undergoing evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: The panel expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials, which would provide much needed evidence on the efficacy and safety of various therapies for COVID-19, given that we could not make a determination whether the benefits outweigh harms for most treatments.","output":"Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the current 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, now named SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a worldwide health threat. Currently, more information is needed so as to further understand the transmission and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection and the infection control procedures required. Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed. Previous investigations of other highly infectious human CoVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide useful information. In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, and mechanisms of human CoV infection, and recommendations for infection control procedures. The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail. Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low. This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract. However, pathogens that the ocular surface is exposed to might be transported to nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa by constant tear rinsing through the lacrimal duct system and then cause respiratory tract infection. Considering that close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice and is apt to transmit human CoVs by droplets and fomites, strict hand hygiene and proper personal protection are highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.","output":"Role of the Eye in Transmitting Human Coronavirus: What We Know and What We Do Not Know"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by systemic infection and multiorgan dysfunction. The association between the kinetics of viral load and clinical outcome in severe COVID-19 patients has not been well established.

A total of 578 paired throat swab (TS) and anal swab (AS) samples were collected. Viral load was measured by using quantitative real-time PCR. Viral RNA was detected in 193 (33.4%) TS and 121 (20.9%) AS samples. A higher viral RNA load was found in TS than in AS, with means of 1.0106 and 2.3105 copies/ml, respectively. The median number of days from symptom onset to positive virus detection in AS samples was significantly lower in non-survivors than in survivors (14 days vs 19 days, P=0.007). The virus positive rate in AS (P=0.006) and the viral load in AS (P=0.006) were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors at week 2 post symptom onset. A high initial viral load in AS was associated with death (OR 1.368, 95% CI 1.076-1.741, P=0.011), admission to the intensive care unit (OR 1.237, 95% CI 1.001-1.528, P=0.049) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 1.340, 95% CI 1.076-1.669, P=0.009) in COVID-19 patients.

In the study, \\"Leisure Boredom Scale\\" and \\"Psychological Resilience Scale\\" were used as the measurement tools. In the study, individuals were asked to write a word expressing their thoughts on the CoViD-19 process for descriptive analyses, and the collected data were visualized with the \\"MAXQDA\\" qualitative data analysis program. In addition, the data are presented in charts in the analysis of other variables. In the statistical analysis of the study, descriptive statistics were used, t-test was used to determine the difference between independent groups, Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationships between variables, and simple linear regression analysis was used to determine the strength of the independent variable in predicting the dependent variable. As a result, predominantly negative emotional states were observed in individuals during the quarantine period. However, as the participation in physical activity increases, the level of psychological resilience will increase and the perception of boredom in leisure time will decrease. Besides, it was found that the perception of boredom in leisure time was an important determinant of the level of psychological resilience, and that it explains about 15% of the variance.","output":"Covid-19 in Turkey: Leisure boredom, psychological resilience, physical activity and emotional state"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: A subset of recovered COVID-19 patients report persistent neurological symptoms. These include non-specific symptoms (e.g., headaches and fatigue) which were found to be affected by psychological processes in other disorders (e.g., post-concussion syndrome, PCS, after mild traumatic brain injury). The current study assessed the impact of diagnosis threat (i.e., information regarding the long-term neurological impact of COVID-19) and suggestibility on endorsed symptoms of both recovered patients and healthy controls. METHOD: Recovered patients (n = 90) and healthy controls (n = 210) described their cognitive functioning after being randomly assigned to: (a) Experimental group: These participants read an article that explored long-term neurological symptoms among COVID-19 survivors. (b) Control group: These participants read an article providing general information regarding the disease. RESULTS: Recovered patients, but not healthy controls, endorsed more symptoms in the experimental condition compared to the control condition. Moreover, suggestibility was correlated with endorsement of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Post COVID-19 neurological symptoms may, at least partially, be affected by non-neurological factors such as diagnosis threat.

Here, we developed a method called 2CIMPL that includes proximity ligation under native conditions to identify genome-wide RNA duplexes. Interactions between all eight segments were observed at multiple sites along a given segment and are concentrated at hotspots. Furthermore, synonymous nucleotide changes in a hotspot decreased the formation of RNA-RNA interactions at this site and resulted in a genome-wide rearrangement without a loss in replicative fitness. These results indicate that the viral RNA interaction network is flexible to account for nucleotide evolution. Moreover, comparative analysis of RNA-RNA interaction sites with viral nucleoprotein (NP) binding to the genome revealed that RNA junctions can also occur adjacent to NP peaks, suggesting that NP association does not exclude RNA duplex formation.

Implementation strategies that potentially impact implementation outcomes and implementation success have been identified. Which strategies are actually used in the implementation of eHealth interventions for patients with chronic illness and which ones are the most effective is unclear. OBJECTIVE This systematic realist review aimed to summarize evidence from empirical studies regarding (1) which implementation strategies are used when implementing eHealth interventions for patients with chronic illnesses living at home, (2) implementation outcomes, and (3) the relationship between implementation strategies, implementation outcomes, and degree of implementation success. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Library. Studies were included if they described implementation strategies used to support the integration of eHealth interventions into practice. Implementation strategies were categorized according to 9 categories defined by the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change project: (1) engage consumers, (2) use evaluative and iterative strategies, (3) change infrastructure, (4) adapt and tailor to the context, (5) develop stakeholder interrelationships, (6) use financial strategies, (7) support clinicians, (8) provide interactive assistance, and (9) train and educate stakeholders. Implementation outcomes were extracted according to the implementation outcome framework by Proctor and colleagues: (1) acceptability, (2) adoption, (3) appropriateness, (4) cost, (5) feasibility, (6) fidelity, (7) penetration, and (8) sustainability. Implementation success was extracted according to the study authors' own evaluation of implementation success in relation to the used implementation strategies. RESULTS The implementation strategies management support and engagement, internal and external facilitation, training, and audit and feedback were directly related to implementation success in several studies. No clear relationship was found between the number of implementation strategies used and implementation success. CONCLUSIONS This is the first review examining implementation strategies, implementation outcomes, and implementation success of studies reporting the implementation of eHealth programs for patients with chronic illnesses living at home. The review indicates that internal and external facilitation, audit and feedback, management support, and training of clinicians are of importance for eHealth implementation. The review also points to the lack of eHealth studies that report implementation strategies in a comprehensive way and highlights the need to design robust studies focusing on implementation strategies in the future.

RESULTS There was a significant main effect of race/ethnicity on opioid and non-opioid orders. Physicians ordered significantly fewer opioid medications, but a greater number of non-opioid medications, for non-Hispanic African American children than non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, and non-Hispanic White pediatric patients. There was also a main effect of health insurance payer type on non-opioid orders. Patients with government-sponsored plans (e.g., Medi-Cal, Medicare) received fewer non-opioid prescriptions compared with patients with both HMO and PPO coverage.

Here we report the midterm results of a microsurgical non-patch technique and compare these findings to those in the literature. METHODS From 1998 to 2009 we treated 586 consecutive patients with CEA. CEA was performed, under general anesthesia, with a surgical microscope using a non-patch technique. Somatosensory evoked potential and transcranial Doppler were continuously monitored. Cross-clamping was performed under EEG burst suppression and adaptive blood pressure increase. Follow-up was performed by an independent neurologist. Mortality at 30 days and morbidity such as major and minor stroke, peripheral nerve palsy, hematoma and cardiac complications were recorded. The restenosis rate was assessed using duplex sonography 1 year after surgery. RESULTS A total of 439 (75%) patients had symptomatic and 147 (25%) asymptomatic stenosis; 49.7% of the stenoses were on the right-side. Major perioperative strokes occurred in five (0.9%) patients [n = 4 (0.9%) symptomatic; n = 1 (0.7%) asymptomatic patients]. Minor stroke was recorded in six (1%) patients [n = 4 (0.9%) symptomatic; n = 2 (1.3%) asymptomatic patients]. Two patients with symptomatic stenoses died within 1 month after surgery. Nine patients (1.5%) had reversible peripheral nerve palsies, and nine patients (1.5%) suffered a perioperative myocardial infarction.

Metabolic adaptations enable microbial growth in nutrient-scarce host niches, and they further control immune responses to pathogens, thereby offering opportunities for therapeutic targeting. Because it is a relatively new pathogen, little is known about the metabolic requirements for C. auris growth and its adaptations to counter host defenses. Here, we establish that triggering metabolic dysfunction is a promising strategy against C. auris. Treatment with pyrvinium pamoate (PP) induced metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial dysfunction evident in disrupted mitochondrial morphology and reduced tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme activity. PP also induced changes consistent with disrupted iron homeostasis. Nutrient supplementation experiments support the proposition that PP-induced metabolic dysfunction is driven by disrupted iron homeostasis, which compromises carbon and lipid metabolism and mitochondria. PP inhibited C. auris replication in macrophages, which is a relevant host niche for this yeast pathogen. We propose that PP causes a multipronged metabolic hit to C. auris: it restricts the micronutrient iron to potentiate nutritional immunity imposed by immune cells, and it further causes metabolic dysfunction that compromises the utilization of macronutrients, thereby curbing the metabolic plasticity needed for growth in host environments. Our study offers a new avenue for therapeutic development against drug-resistant C. auris, shows how complex metabolic dysfunction can be caused by a single compound triggering antifungal inhibition, and provides insights into the metabolic needs of C. auris in immune cell environments. IMPORTANCE Over the last decade, Candida auris has emerged as a human pathogen around the world causing life-threatening infections with wide-spread antifungal drug resistance, including pandrug resistance in some cases. In this study, we addressed the mechanism of action of the antiparasitic drug pyrvinium pamoate against C. auris and show how metabolism could be inhibited to curb C. auris proliferation. We show that pyrvinium pamoate triggers sweeping metabolic and mitochondrial changes and disrupts iron homeostasis. PP-induced metabolic dysfunction compromises the utilization of both micro- and macronutrients by C. auris and reduces its growth in vitro and in immune phagocytes. Our findings provide insights into the metabolic requirements for C. auris growth and define the mechanisms of action of pyrvinium pamoate against C. auris, demonstrating how this compound works by inhibiting the metabolic flexibility of the pathogen. As such, our study characterizes credible avenues for new antifungal approaches against C. auris.","output":"Disruption of Iron Homeostasis and Mitochondrial Metabolism Are Promising Targets to Inhibit Candida auris"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cellular and viral S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases are involved in many regulated processes such as metabolism, detoxification, signal transduction, chromatin remodeling, nucleic acid processing, and mRNA capping.

Our previous microarray analysis showed that H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In present study, we deeply investigated the expression patterns of IFITM1 and IFITM1-mediated antiviral response induced by H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation in HUVECs. Epithelial cells that are considered target cells of the influenza virus were selected as a reference control. METHODS: First, we quantified the expression levels of IFITM1 in HUVECs induced by H9N2 virus infection or viral particle inoculation using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Second, we observed whether hemagglutinin or neuraminidase affected IFITM1 expression in HUVECs. Finally, we investigated the effect of induced-IFITM1 on the antiviral state in HUVECs by siRNA and activation plasmid transfection. RESULTS: Both H9N2 virus infection and viral particle inoculation increased the expression of IFITM1 without elevating the levels of interferon-/ in HUVECs. HA or NA protein binding alone is not sufficient to increase the levels of IFITM1 and interferon-/ in HUVECs. IFITM1 induced by viral particle inoculation significantly decreased the virus titers in culture supernatants of HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of IFITM1 at mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the induction of IFITM1 expression mediated the antiviral state in HUVECs.","output":"Investigation of antiviral state mediated by interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 1 induced by H9N2 virus and inactivated viral particle in human endothelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims The rapid setting up of research during the COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in ways of working within research organisations.

METHODS This single-center, ambispective cohort study compared 122 consecutive patients (mean age 66.7 years) with unilateral versus bilateral PAE from March 2009 to December 2011. Selective PAE was performed with 100- and 200-m nonspherical polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles by a unilateral femoral approach. RESULTS Bilateral PAE was performed in 103 (84.4 %) patients (group A). The remaining 19 (15.6 %) patients underwent unilateral PAE (group B). Mean follow-up time was 6.7 months in group A and 7.3 months in group B. Mean prostate volume, PSA, International prostate symptom score/quality of life (IPSS/QoL) and post-void residual volume (PVR) reduction, and peak flow rate (Qmax) improvement were 19.4 mL, 1.68 ng/mL, 11.8/2.0 points, 32.9 mL, and 3.9 mL/s in group A and 11.5 mL, 1.98 ng/mL, 8.9/1.4 points, 53.8 mL, and 4.58 mL/s in group B. Poor clinical outcome was observed in 24.3 % of patients from group A and 47.4 % from group B (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS PAE is a safe and effective technique that can induce 48 % improvement in the IPSS score and a prostate volume reduction of 19 %, with good clinical outcome in up to 75 % of treated patients.

Little data is available regarding the safety and efficacy of extubation of children in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) by a nurse rather than in the OR. We sought to evaluate the impact of a long-standing practice of PACU extubation upon airway complications and OR efficiency. METHODS The records of 1930 children who underwent inguinal hernia repair, laparoscopic appendectomy or pyloromyotomy at a children's hospital between July, 2018 and June, 2020 were reviewed. Extubations were performed in the OR only when the PACU was inadequately staffed or during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Cases in which there was a deep extubation, a PACU hold was in effect or a patient went directly to an inpatient unit from the OR were excluded. Intra- and post-operative time metrics were recorded and emergency airway interventions were assessed. RESULTS 1747 operations were evaluated. Time from the end of the procedure to leaving the OR ranged from 4.1 to 4.8 min when extubation was done in the PACU and was 6-9 min less than with OR extubation. (see table). There were 23 airway events (1.5% of all cases) after PACU extubation that necessitated only brief bag-mask ventilation. There were no cases of re-intubation. CONCLUSIONS In a large population of children undergoing diverse surgical procedures, post-anesthesia care unit extubation was safe and resulted in rapid transfer of patients from the operating room after completion of their operation. Time saved because of shorter operating room times reduces hospital costs and can allow for increased throughput. Extubation in the post-anesthesia care unit may not only be as safe as operating room extubation, but may result in fewer serious airway events as patients may be less likely to have their endotracheal tube removed prematurely.

Combinations of markers, as opposed to single ones, may improve diagnosis and thereby survival. We therefore compared the diagnostic characteristics of novel and routinely used biomarkers of sepsis alone and in combination. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome who were suspected of having community-acquired infections. It was conducted in a medical emergency department and department of infectious diseases at a university hospital. A multiplex immunoassay measuring soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM)-1 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was used in parallel with standard measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and neutrophils. Two composite markers were constructed C one including a linear combination of the three best performing markers and another including all six C and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare their performance and those of the individual markers. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were eligible for analysis. Of these, 96 had bacterial infections. The AUCs for detection of a bacterial cause of inflammation were 0.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.60) for suPAR, 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.71) for sTREM-1, 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.72) for MIF, 0.72 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.79) for PCT, 0.74 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.81) for neutrophil count, 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.86) for CRP, 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.91) for the composite three-marker test, and 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.92) for the composite six-marker test. The AUC of the six-marker test was significantly greater than that of the single markers. CONCLUSION: Combining information from several markers improves diagnostic accuracy in detecting bacterial versus nonbacterial causes of inflammation. Measurements of suPAR, sTREM-1 and MIF had limited value as single markers, whereas PCT and CRP exhibited acceptable diagnostic characteristics.

In this article, we argue that the concept of 'disease public profile' has become a prominent, if not the sole, determinant in decision-making across various healthcare responses to the pandemic. In the case of COVID-19, the disease's public profile is based on clinical and non-clinical factors that include contagiousness, clinical presentation and media coverage.

It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leading to immune activation. Several studies suggest that the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might interact with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and thereby activate immunity. Here we have investigated the role of TLR4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity. Neither exposure of isolated S protein, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus nor a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced TLR4 activation in a TLR4-expressing cell line. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) express TLR4 but not ACE2, and DCs were not infected by a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Notably, neither S protein nor the primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced DC maturation or cytokines, indicating that both S protein and SARS-CoV-2 virus particles do not trigger extracellular TLRs, including TLR4. Ectopic expression of ACE2 in DCs led to efficient infection by SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced type I IFN and cytokine responses, which was inhibited by antibodies against ACE2. These data strongly suggest that not extracellular TLRs but intracellular viral sensors are key players in sensing SARS-CoV-2. These data imply that SARS-CoV-2 escapes direct sensing by TLRs, which might underlie the lack of efficient immunity to SARS-CoV-2 early during infection. Author summary The immune system needs to recognize pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 to initiate antiviral immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for inducing antiviral immunity and are therefore equipped with both extracellular and intracellular pattern recognition receptors to sense pathogens. However, it is unknown if and how SARS-CoV-2 activates DCs. Recent research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by extracellular Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We have previously shown that DCs do not express ACE2, and are therefore not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that DCs do not become activated by exposure to viral Spike proteins or SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. These findings suggest that TLR4 and other extracellular TLRs do not sense SARS-CoV-2. Next, we expressed ACE2 in DCs and SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected these ACE2-positive DCs. Notably, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced an antiviral immune response. Thus, our study suggests that infection of DCs is required for induction of immunity, and thus that intracellular viral sensors rather than extracellular TLRs are important in sensing SARS-CoV-2. Lack of sensing by extracellular TLRs might be an escape mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and could contribute to the aberrant immune responses observed during COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection activates dendritic cells via cytosolic receptors rather than extracellular TLRs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die Frauen- und Geschlechterforschung hat bereits in den 1970er Jahren herausgearbeitet, dass sich das Verh?ltnis von Arbeit und Geschlecht entlang der Achse Sichtbarkeit/Unsichtbarkeit konstituiert.

Evidence about these significant changes indicated that college students were more prone to feel anxious and depressed. To derive a precise assessment of the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom among college students worldwide, we conducted this meta-analysis. METHODS: Based on the guidance of PRISMA, literature was searched in Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycArticles (last search November 6, 2020). These articles after the screening were analyzed by a random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom. Also, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were performed in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the pooled anxiety symptom prevalence was 31% (95% CI: 23-39%), pooled depressive symptom prevalence was 34% (95% CI: 27-41%). Subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom among different countries' college students were different, and the pooled depressive symptom prevalence of females was higher compared with males. LIMITATIONS: The prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom in worldwide college students could be better assessed by a standard and reliable questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom during the COVID-19 pandemic is relatively high. Except for interventions that should be taken to control the pandemic urgently, mental health services are also needed to decrease the risk of anxiety and depression among college students.","output":"Prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom among college students during COVID-19 pandemic: A meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac surgeons during this pandemic crisis have a responsibility to ensure that essential elective cardiac operations are provided at their centers to the public, at the same time, they have to face administrative demands as well as the infection prevention guidelines and restrictions to protect themselves and their patients.

Many kinds of polysaccharides from natural resources possess therapeutic effects on hyperlipidemia but still lack a comprehensive understanding. In this paper, the research progress of natural polysaccharides on reducing blood lipids in recent years is reviewed. The pharmacological mechanisms and targets of natural polysaccharides are mainly introduced. The relationship between structure and hypolipidemic activity is also discussed in detail.

Typically, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS\\\\CoV) caused SARS pandemic in 2003 and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 caused the ongoing COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Both viruses are most likely originated from bats. Thus, direct or indirect interspecies transmission from bats to humans is required for the viruses to cause pandemics. Receptor utilization is a key factor determining the host range of viruses which is critical to the interspecies transmission. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of both SARS\\\\CoV and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, but only ACE2s of certain animals can be utilized by the viruses. Here, we employed pseudovirus cell\\\\entry assay to evaluate the receptor\\\\utilizing capability of ACE2s of 20 animals by the two viruses and found that SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 utilized less ACE2s than SARS\\\\CoV, indicating a narrower host range of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. Especially, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 tended not to use murine or non\\\\mammal ACE2s. Meanwhile, pangolin CoV, another SARS\\\\related coronavirus highly homologous to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in its genome, yet showed similar ACE2 utilization profile with SARS\\\\CoV rather than SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. Nevertheless, the actually susceptibility of these animals to the coronaviruses should be further verified by in\\\\vivo studies. To clarify the mechanism underlying the receptor utilization, we compared the amino acid sequences of the 20 ACE2s and found 5 amino acid residues potentially critical for ACE2 utilization, including the N\\\\terminal 20(th) and 42(nd) amino acid residues that might determine the different receptor utilization of SARS\\\\CoV, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and pangolin CoV. Our studies enhance the understanding of receptor utilization of pandemic coronaviruses, potentially contributing to the virus tracing, intermediate host screening and epidemic prevention for pathogenic coronaviruses.","output":"Receptor utilization of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) indicates a narrower host range of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 than that of SARS\\\\CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its origin, the emergence of vector-borne infections has taken a toll on incalculable human lives.

The impact on children's rate of weight gain has not been analysed. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used United States (US) Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from Optum? to calculate the age- and sex- adjusted change in BMI (?BMI(adj)) in individual 6-to-17-year-old children between two well child checks (WCCs). The mean of individual ?BMI(adj) during 2017C2020 was calculated by month. For September-December WCCs, the mean of individual ?BMI(adj) (overall and by subgroup) was reported for 2020 and 2017C2019, and the impact of 2020 vs 2017C2019 was tested by multivariable linear regression. FINDINGS: The mean [95% Confidence Interval - CI] ?BMI(adj) in September-December of 2020 was 062 [059,064] kg/m(2), compared to 031 [029, 032] kg/m(2) in previous years. The increase was most prominent in children with pre-existing obesity (116 [107,124] kg/m(2) in 2020 versus 056 [052,061] kg/m(2) in previous years), Hispanic children (093 [084,102] kg/m(2) in 2020 versus 041 [036,046] kg/m(2) in previous years), and children who lack commercial insurance (088 [081,095] kg/m(2) in 2020 compared to 043 [039,047] kg/m(2) in previous years). ?BMI(adj) accelerated most in ages 8C12 and least in ages 15C17.

Newer evidence suggests that increasing BMI may also be a risk factor. Ultrasound is first-line imaging for diagnosis. Magnetic resonance image is preferred for surgical planning for deep or extensive lesions. Laparotomy with wide local excision is considered standard treatment for AWE with great success. Novel techniques in minimally invasive surgery have been described as effective for the treatment of AWE. A multidisciplinary surgical approach is often warranted for successful excision and reapproximation of skin and/or fascial defects. Noninvasive therapies including ultrasonic ablation or cryotherapy are also emerging as promising treatment strategies in select patients.

We study the temporal nature of pandemic-related disorder events as tallied by the \\"COVID-19 Disorder Tracker\\" initiative by focusing on the three countries with the largest number of incidents, India, Israel, and Mexico. By fitting Poisson and Hawkes processes to the stream of data, we find that disorder events are inter-dependent and self-excite in all three countries. Geographic clustering confirms these features at the subnational level, indicating that nationwide disorders emerge as the convergence of meso-scale patterns of self-excitation. Considerable diversity is observed among countries when computing correlations of events between subnational clusters; these are discussed in the context of specific political, societal and geographic characteristics. Israel, the most territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the shortest period of influence following an event, as well as the strongest nationwide synchrony. In Mexico, where complete lockdown orders were never mandated, reactivity and nationwide synchrony are lowest.

Method: A random sample consisted of 426 COVID-19 patients, who have resided in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, they answered an online questionnaire contains four scales (Religiosity, hope, stigma, and well-being). The data collected from the study participants were analyzed quantitatively by using One-way ANOVA, Exploratory Factor Analysis EFA, Confirmatory Factor Analysis CFA, and Structural Equation Model (IBM SPSS statistics 21 and Amos v.25). Results: : The results showed that there are statistical significant differences due to age in hope and well-being, in favor of the sample members belonging to the age group from 30 years old and over old, while there are no differences in religiosity and stigma due to age. As well as, there are no differences due to the education level in religiosity, hope, stigma and well-being.

To date, various machine learning models have been proposed that combine multi-parametric imaging data for this purpose. However, most of these machine learning models were trained using voxel information extracted from the whole brain, without taking differences in susceptibility to ischemia into account that exist between brain regions. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a local tissue outcome prediction approach, which makes predictions using locally trained machine learning models and thus accounts for regional differences. MATERIAL AND METHODS Multi-parametric MRI data from 99 acute ischemic stroke patients were used for the development and evaluation of the local tissue outcome prediction approach. Diffusion (ADC) and perfusion parameter maps (CBF, CBV, MTT, Tmax) and corresponding follow-up lesion masks for each patient were registered to the MNI brain atlas. Logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models were trained employing a local approach, which makes predictions using models individually trained for each specific voxel position using the corresponding local data. A global approach, which uses a single model trained using all voxels of the brain, was used for comparison. Tissue outcome predictions resulting from the global and local RF and LR models, as well as a combined (hybrid) approach were quantitatively evaluated and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC), the Dice coefficient, and the sensitivity and specificity metrics. RESULTS Statistical analysis revealed the highest ROC AUC and Dice values for the hybrid approach. With 0.872 (ROC AUC; LR) and 0.353 (Dice; RF), these values were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than the values of the two other approaches. In addition, the local approach achieved the highest sensitivity of 0.448 (LR). Overall, the hybrid approach was only outperformed in sensitivity (LR) by the local approach and in specificity by both other approaches. However, in these cases the effect sizes were comparatively small. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that using locally trained machine learning models can lead to better lesion outcome prediction results compared to a single global machine learning model trained using all voxel information independent of the location in the brain.","output":"Localized prediction of tissue outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients using diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI datasets."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Management of pre-hospital patients remains a challenge.

We conducted a public health investigation to assess and mitigate nosocomial transmission and contributing infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. METHODS: A case was defined as a patient with CS in respiratory cultures from January 1, 2020 - February 28, 2021. We reviewed clinical characteristics on a subset of cases in 2021 and IPC practices in affected hospital locations. CS respiratory isolates collected on different dates and locations were assessed for relatedness by whole genome sequencing (WGS) on MiSeq. RESULTS: Eighty-three cases were identified, including 75 among COVID-19 patients (Figure 1). Among 62 patients identified in 2021, all were ventilated; 58 also had COVID-19, including 4 cases identified on point prevalence survey (PPS). The median time from admission to CS culture was 19 days (range, 0-60). Patients were critically ill; often it was unclear whether CS cultures represented colonization or infection. During the COVID-19 surge, two hospital wings (7W and 7S) were converted to negative-pressure COVID-19 units. Staff donned and doffed personal protective equipment in anterooms outside the units; extended use of gowns was practiced, and lapses in glove changes and hand hygiene (HH) between patients likely occurred. In response to the CS outbreak, patients were placed in Contact precautions and cohorted. Staff were re-educated on IPC for COVID-19 patients. Gowns were changed between CS patients. Subsequent PPS were negative. Two CS clusters were identified by WGS: cluster 1 (5 cases) in unit 7W, and cluster 2 (2 cases) in unit 7S (Figure 2). Figure 1.

Similarly, when the relative humidity was greater than 46%, it was negatively correlated with the epidemic, where a 1% increase in relative humidity decreased the rate of confirmed cases by 0.19%. Furthermore, prefecture-level administrative regions, such as Chifeng (included as warning cities) have more days of dangerous weather, which is favorable for outbreaks. In addition, we found that the impact of mean temperature is greatest in the east, the influence of relative humidity is most pronounced in the central region, and the significance of weather conditions is more important in the coastal region. Finally, we found that rising diurnal temperatures decreased the negative impact of weather conditions on the spread of COVID-19. We also observed that strict public health measures and high social concern can mitigate the adverse effects of cold and dry weather on the spread of the epidemic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which applies the two-way fixed effect model to investigate the influence of weather conditions on the COVID-19 epidemic, takes into account socio-economic factors and draws new conclusions.","output":"The influence of weather conditions on the COVID-19 epidemic: Evidence from 279 prefecture-level panel data in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We observed two cases of patients with schizophrenia who were treated with clozapine (250mg/day and 275mg/day, respectively) and showed neutropenia after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2).

Methods: We present data form a prospective study implementing an RDT-based screening program at a primary school in southwest Germany. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with participating children, parents, and school stakeholders to elicit implementation experiences and screening perception. Results: The screening intervention was highly accepted and appreciated among participants; no positive RDT was reported over the duration of the study. Self-testing at home before coming to school was feasible, but more positive consequences of screening participation (e.g., easing of mask mandates) besides a personal feeling of safety would be appreciated. Participants preferred home-based RDTs over some other measures, particularly mask mandates. Despite the RDTs being licensed as self-tests in Germany, additional training can help avoid mistakes, and ensuring intervention ownership and improving pre-implementation communication can facilitate buy-in.

We built a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with vaccination to predict herd immunity, following the trends from the early-stage vaccination program. Herd immunity could be achieved earlier with a faster vaccination pace, lower vaccine hesitancy, and higher vaccine effectiveness.

Emerging research documents correlates and trajectories of adolescent distress, but further work is needed to identify additional vulnerability factors that explain increased psychopathology during the pandemic. The current study examined whether COVID-19-related loneliness and health anxiety (assessed in March 2020) predicted increased depressive symptoms, frequency of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and suicide risk from pre-pandemic (late January/early February 2020) to June 2020. METHOD Participants were 362 middle and high school adolescents in rural Maine (M age = 15.01 years; 63.4% female; 76.4% White). Data were collected during a time in which state-level COVID-19 restrictions were high and case counts were relatively low. Self-reports assessed psychopathology symptoms, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) was used to capture COVID-19-related distress during the initial days of school closures. RESULTS Loneliness predicted higher depressive symptoms for all adolescents, higher NSSI frequency for adolescents with low pre-pandemic frequency (but less frequent NSSI for adolescents with high pre-pandemic frequency), and higher suicide risk for adolescents with higher pre-pandemic risk. Health anxiety predicted higher NSSI frequency for adolescents with high pre-pandemic frequency, and secondary analyses suggested that this pattern may depend on adolescents' gender identity.

The acoustic parameters, including fundamental frequency (F0), sound pressure level (SPL), percentage of jitter (%), percentage of shimmer (%), noise to harmonic ratio (NHR) and cepstral peak prominence (CPP), aerodynamic parameter (maximum phonation time, MPT) and formant parameters (formant frequency, F1, F2, F3) without and with wearing medical masks were included. We further investigated the potential differences in the impact on different sexes and ages (45 years old and >45 years old).

METHOD Using Panopto? Video Platform, we pre-recorded real Primary Care consultations, with patient and GP consent, which were then processed securely using the University of Aberdeen server. These were shown to all Year 1 medical students who immediately debriefed these consultations in small groups with a GP tutor.

LEARNING OUTCOMES The consultations were easy to record and play during the teaching session, although there were some issues with sound quality. All students in the focus groups enjoyed the experience. They gained new knowledge about the skills of GPs, and recognised GPs as positive role models. Students were able to identify a variety of communication and consultation skills used by the GP, which reinforced their teaching on these delivered elsewhere in the course.

Determining the impact could prevent repercussions in future crisis. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dermatology residents' professional practice, working conditions, academic training and mental health. METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent to all French dermatology residents. We compared the activity of residents working in areas heavily impacted by COVID-19 to others. Logistic multivariate regressions were done, using as outcome variables the negative impact of the COVID crisis on residents' possibility to practice dermatology during the crisis, supervision, academic training and working more than 50 h/week. The last part of the questionnaire was the burnout questionnaire of Maslach. RESULTS: A total of 246 residents filled the questionnaire. Residents working in highly impacted COVID areas (odds ratio, OR 0.34 confidence interval, CI [0.18, 0.61], P  0.001), first-year postgraduate (PGY-1) residents (OR 0.46 CI [0.23, 0.91], P = 0.023) and those in private practice (OR 0.10 CI [0.01, 0.57], P = 0.032) were significantly less able to maintain dermatology activities. Worse supervision was significantly more frequent with non-PGY-1 residents (OR 3.24 CI [1.65, 6.65], P < 0.001). One hundred and eighty one residents claimed the pandemic to have a negative effect on their dermatology curriculum with no difference according to their regions' affection by COVID-19. This was mostly attributed to the cancelation of courses and congresses. PGY-1 residents (OR 2.09 CI [1.09, 4.04], P = 0.029) and residents in highly affected areas (OR 1.79 CI [1.01, 3.18], P = 0.049) were more at risk of working above the maximal legal working time.

APPROACH Electrode contacts with diameters of 0.3 mm and 4 mm are localized in 1.5 T MRI using reference structures made of silicone and iron oxide nanoparticle doping. The precision of the localization procedure was assessed for several standard MRI sequences and implant orientations in phantom experiments and compared to common clinical localization procedures. MAIN RESULTS A localization precision of 0.410.20 mm could be achieved for both electrode diameters compared to 1.460.69 mm that was achieved for 4 mm standard electrode contacts localized using a common clinical standard method. The new reference structures are intrinsically bio-compatible, and they can be detected with currently available feature detection software so that a clinical implementation of this technology should be feasible. SIGNIFICANCE Neuropathologies are increasingly diagnosed and treated with subdural electrodes, where the exact localization of the electrode contacts with respect to the patient's cortical anatomy is a prerequisite for the procedure. Post-implantation electrode localization using MRI may be advantageous compared to the common alternative of CT-MRI image co-registration, as it avoids systematic localization errors associated with the co-registration itself, as well as brain shift and implant movement. Additionally, MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast for the identification of brain lesions without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. Recent studies show that smaller electrodes and high-density electrode grids are ideal for clinical and research purposes, but the localization of these devices in MRI has not been demonstrated.","output":"Fabrication and validation of reference structures for the localization of subdural standard- and micro-electrodes in MRI."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmission of infectious diseases depends on the social networks among people and the protections that people have taken before being exposed to the disease.

To extend the scope of the method. METHOD: In the collaborative study, the candidate method was compared to the United States Food and Drug Administration/Bacteriological Analytical Manual (FDA/BAM) Chapter 10 Listeria reference method. The candidate method used two PCR thermocyclers, the Applied Biosystems? QuantStudio? 5 Real-Time PCR instrument (QS5) and the Applied Biosystems? 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR instrument (7500 Fast). The candidate method included its own confirmation procedure. Eighteen (18) participants from 10 laboratories located within the United States and Europe were solicited for the collaborative study, with 12 participants submitting valid data. Statistical analysis was conducted according to the Probability of Detection (POD) statistical model. In addition, in order to extend the scope of the method, 7 matrix studies were performed comparing the candidate method to the FDA/BAM reference method. One of these matrices was also compared to the ISO 11290-1:2017 Microbiology of the food chain-Horizontal method for the detection and enumeration of Listeria monocytogenes and of Listeria spp.-Part 1: Detection method reference method. RESULTS: In the collaborative study, the difference in laboratory results indicate equivalence between the candidate method and reference method for the matrix evaluated and the method demonstrated acceptable inter-laboratory reproducibility as determined in the collaborative evaluation.

RECENT FINDINGS Positional components are nearly ubiquitous among diagnoses of dizziness, so it can be challenging to classify patients with episodic positional dizziness simply based on the history of present illness. Overreliance on the presence of a report of positional components has likely resulted in misapplication or misinterpretation of positional testing and negative experiences with maneuvers to treat positional dizziness. The prototypical episodic positional dizziness disorder is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is caused by free-floating particles in a semicircular canal that move in response to gravity. The diagnosis is made by identifying the characteristic patterns of nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike test. Particle repositioning for BPPV is supported by randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and practice guidelines. Other disorders that can present with episodic positional dizziness are migraine dizziness, central lesions, and light cupula syndrome. SUMMARY Episodic positional dizziness is a common presentation of dizziness. Neurologists should prioritize identifying and treating BPPV; doing so provides an important opportunity to deliver effective and efficient care. Providers should also recognize that positional components are common in most causes of dizziness and, therefore, should not over-rely on this part of the history of presentation when considering the diagnosis and management plan.","output":"Episodic Positional Dizziness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the initial emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the subsequent surge of patients requiring critical care, our Joint Commission certified thrombectomycapable stroke center sought to utilize a low-intensity monitoring protocol in stable, post intravenous (IV) thrombolysis patients in our intensive care unit (ICU). The acuity level in our ICU jumped to an all-time high, with many critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our goal was simple, provide safe patient care, free up precious nursing time, and preserve the personal protective equipment supply. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to use a rapid cycle process improvement project to implement a low-intensity monitoring (LIM) protocol in stable, suspected stroke patients, who are deemed at low risk for complications, in the first twenty-four hours following IV thrombolysis. Methods: We utilized the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model to implement this project. Collaboration between physician, nursing, and stroke program leaders occurred during the month of April 2020. Our new process utilized the Optimal Post T-pa Iv Monitoring in Ischemic STroke (OPTIMIST) protocol. We continued to admit our post IV alteplase patients to the ICU, rather than a step-down unit, in order to accommodate the 3:1 patient to nurse ratio, ensure protocol adherence, and maximize patient safety with this high-risk medication. We used change of shift huddles to educate the ICU nursing staff over a two-week period. Stroke program advanced practice nurses were onsite to ensure compliance. Results: Since implementation of the new protocol, two IV alteplase patients have met protocol criteria;both remained stable throughout the twenty-four-hour LIM period. The protocol's nursing ratio changes allowed the other, critically ill patients, to be staffed with traditional ICU ratios. Conclusion: Rapid cycle PI projects can be accomplished during times of extreme challenge, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing staff was able to adapt and even welcomed the change, while maintaining patient safety.

Design/methodology/approach: COVID-19 had a tremendous impact on the law enforcement community, who continued to work and adapt in order to provide public safety. During the first few months of the pandemic, a number of national data collection efforts set out to understand what police agencies, at the organizational-level, were doing to address the crisis. Largely missing from these initial discussions were the perspectives of individual officers, particularly how they felt about their respective departments ensuring safety and balancing risk. Findings: Results from ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions found that the number of departmental changes made in the wake of COVID-19 that reduced policeCpublic contact was associated with (1) increased levels of perceived agency responsivity to officer needs (i.e. balancing officer safety, taking active steps to maintain officers' mental health) and (2) reduced levels of perceived negative outlook (e.g. stress, low morale, danger/risk).

METHODS: A retrospective observational study that was conducted at a tertiary academic hospital from March C June 2020. Patients were included if they were  18 years old, inpatient, had a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for COVID-19, and were treated with; (lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, favipiravir, ribavirin, or interferon-?) either as monotherapy or combination therapy for three days or longer. The data of eligible patients were retrieved from the electronic medical records. A standardized data collection form was designed to collect patient demographics, COVID-19 severity based on the Saudi Ministry of Health management protocols, antiviral therapies, duration of therapy, and length of stay (LOS). The ADRs were identified via conducting a comprehensive review using predefined triggers and were evaluated using Naranjo Score. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients were included of which 123 (79.4%) were males. In our sample, the incidence proportion of ADRs per patient was 72.3%. A total of 287 ADRs were identified most of them were hepatic (n = 101, 35.2%), gastrointestinal (n = 59, 20.6%), hematological (n = 47, 16%), and endocrine (n = 45, 15%).

However, brain RAS is an independent form of RAS expressed locally in the brain, which is known to be involved in brain functions and disorders. There is strong evidence for a major involvement of excessive brain angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/Angiotensin II (Ang II)/Angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT-1R) axis in increased activation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and neuroinflammation causing neurodegeneration in several brain disorders. Numerous studies have demonstrated strong neuroprotective effects by blocking AT1R in these brain disorders. Additionally, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Angiotensin (1C7)/Mas receptor (MASR), is another axis of brain RAS which counteracts the damaging effects of ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis on neurons in the brain. Thus, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and activation of ACE2/Angiotensin (1C7)/MASR axis may serve as an exciting and novel method for neuroprotection in several neurodegenerative diseases.

ICU patients without COVID-19 diagnosis with CT between March 20 and May 10, 2020 were also identified. CT image findings of colitis or terminal ileitis as well as supportive treatment including ventilator, vasopressors, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were recorded.

This in-brief paper is written in response to the numerous questions I have been asked by other doctoral students around how I collected 41 in-depth, semi-structured interviews while working from home during a global pandemic, with my toddler at home with me. I reflect on how I pivoted to recruit participants, scheduled interviews, and conducted interviews from home, and how I believe COVID-19 has created space for a more accessible qualitative data gathering experience.

Our research objective was to study whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected from routine nasopharyngeal swab samples by using attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy coupled with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The advantage of ATR-FTIR is that measurements can be conducted without any sample preparation and no reagents are needed. Our study included 558 positive and 558 negative samples collected from Northern Finland. Overall, we found moderate diagnostic performance for ATR-FTIR when polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used as the gold standard: the average area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) was 0.67-0.68 (min. 0.65, max. 0.69) with 20, 10 and 5 k-fold cross validations. Mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity was 0.62-0.63 (min. 0.60, max. 0.65), 0.61 (min. 0.58, max. 0.65) and 0.64 (min. 0.59, max. 0.67) with 20, 10 and 5 k-fold cross validations. As a conclusion, our study with relatively large sample set clearly indicate that measured ATR-FTIR spectrum contains specific information for SARS-CoV-2 infection (P<0.001 in label permutation test). However, the diagnostic performance of ATR-FTIR remained only moderate, potentially due to low concentration of viral particles in the transport medium. Further studies are needed before ATR-FTIR can be recommended for fast screening of SARS-CoV-2 from routine nasopharyngeal swab samples. ImportanceAttenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy coupled with machine learning-based analysis was applied to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from nasopharyngeal swab samples originally collected and processed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Even though our results showed moderate performance, we think that our carefully designed and conducted work is valuable in the field of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics as there were as many as 1116 nasopharyngeal swab samples (558 negative and 558 positive) collected from individual patients in a real clinical setting. The Real clinical setting refers to the fact that the nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from people with symptoms typical for COVID-19 or asymptomatic individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The presented technique could be relatively easy to use for point-of-care testing, as ATR-FTIR can be performed with a portable machine without sample preparation and machine learning-based model could give a result immediately after ATR-FTIR measurement.","output":"Diagnostic performance of attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy for detecting COVID-19 from routine nasopharyngeal swab samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In past decades, to improve the chemotherapeutic efficiency and reduce the systemic toxicity of small molecule anti-cancer drugs, polymer-based drug delivery systems (DDSs) have attracted great attention for tumor treatment due to their remarkable biocompatibility and responsive degradation in tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, we developed a kind of pH-responsive and degradable hyperbranched polymeric nanocarriers via yne-phenol click-reaction of resveratrol (RSV) with bifunctional n-butyl dipropiolate (BDP) for efficient doxorubicin (DOX) delivery. The natural product RSV with three phenol groups has excellent antioxidant activity and synergetic enhancement for some anticancer drugs such as DOX. RSV tends to attack the alkynyl groups on BDP by nucleophilic addition in the presence of base as catalyst to afford hyperbranched polyprodrug (denoted as RB). PEGylated RB (termed as RBP) were further synthesized to improve the water solubility and prolong blood circulation by the click reaction of propiolate-terminated RB with amino terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-NH2). Interestingly, the RBP have high DOX loading ratio (a58.6 %) at neutral pH, but the vinyl-ether bonds in RB could break down at low pH conditions such as acidic TME (extracellular pHa6.8, endosomes and lysosomes pHa5.0) that leading to the targeting release of DOX and RSV. Therefore, the developed RBP@DOX nanoparticles exhibited high kill efficiency to tumor cells and slight damage to normal cells due to the effective delivery and release of DOX and RSV in tumor sites and the synergistic enhancement effect of two drugs.","output":"Construction of hyperbranched and pH-responsive polymeric nanocarriers by yne-phenol click-reaction for tumor synergistic chemotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Risk management and stock investment decision-making is an essential topic for investors and fund managers, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The problem becomes easier if the market is efficient, where stock prices fully reflect potential risk. Nevertheless, if the market is not efficient, investors may have an opportunity to find an effective investment method. Vietnam is one of the emerging markets; the efficiency is still weak. Thus, there will be an opportunity for astute investors. This study aims to test the weak-form efficient market and provide a modern approach to investors' decision-making. To achieve that aim, this study uses historical data of stocks in the VN-Index and VN30 portfolio to buy and sell within a one-day period under the rolling window approach to test the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange (HoSE) through a runs test and to perform stock trading using the support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression. The buying/selling of stocks is guided by the forecasted outcomes (increase/decrease) of logistic regression and SVM. This study adjusted the return rate in proportion to the risks and compared it with index investments of VN-Index and VN30 to evaluate investment efficiency. The test results dismissed the weak-form efficient-market hypothesis, which opens up many opportunities for short-term traders. This study's primary contribution is to provide a stock trading strategy for short-term investors to maximize trading profits. Because logistic regression and SVM have proven effective trading methods, investors can use them to achieve abnormal returns.","output":"Is It Possible to Earn Abnormal Return in an Inefficient Market?

Human islets were cultured or preserved under four different conditions and three media options. Parameters such as recovery, viability, function, islet damage, and gene expressions for markers of hypoxia, and inflammation were assessed after 48-h culture or preservation. Preservation of islets was performed at 4C in Connaught's Medical Research Lab (CMRL) and University of Wisconsin (UW) media. Islets were cultured at 22C, 37C, and 37C-22C in CMRL and PRODO culture media. Islets preserved in UW solution had visually good morphology and exhibited higher recovery with less islet damage compared with the rest of the groups, whereas islets preserved in CMRL at 4C resulted in poor morphology, recovery, viability, and function compared with the rest of the treatment conditions. Culture at 22C and 37C demonstrated an increase in the expression of inflammatory and hypoxia-related genes. In conclusion, islets preserved at 4C in UW solution showed the best overall outcomes after 48 h compared with islets cultured at 22C, 37C, or 37C-22C in PRODO. Advancement in islet culture media is warranted to reduce inflammatory gene activation and improve recovery of islets for transplantation.","output":"Assessment of Culture/Preservation Conditions of Human Islets for Transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is not usually associated with significant adverse effects.

Improving political campaign security is a vital part of protecting democracy. To identify campaign security issues, we conducted qualitative research with 28 participants across the U.S. political spectrum to understand the digital security practices, challenges, and perceptions of people involved in campaigns. A main, overarching finding is that a unique combination of threats, constraints, and work culture lead people involved with political campaigns to use technologies from across platforms and domains in ways that leave them--and democracy--vulnerable to security attacks. Sensitive data was kept in a plethora of personal and work accounts, with ad hoc adoption of strong passwords, two-factor authentication, encryption, and access controls. No individual company, committee, organization, campaign, or academic institution can solve the identified problems on their own.

As of March 9, 2020, this epidemic has occurred in 102 countries and caused 3584 deaths with global serious concern. To cope with the outbreak, Chinese governments have strictly controlled urban traffic at all levels, especially in Wuhan. This article firstly reviews the urban traffic situation from January 23, 2020 to March 8, 2020, including safety problems of urban public transportation, traffic control methods, and emergency public transportation planning. Based on this, we present some emergency traffic control measures that are very urgent in the early stage of epidemic. Between cities, we strongly recommend blocking and controlling the flow of traffic in the early stage of epidemic. Inside a city, it is imperative to suspend the public transports, block all roads, restrict private cars, and close bridges and tunnels. Material isolation transfer stations are suggested to be established. A number of public transports should be organized to ensure transport of medical workers, patients, and daily necessities. We also give suggestions about the long-term planning and improvement methods. Considering the great success China has achieved in fighting COVID-19, we believe that this article offers a valuable reference of urban traffic control.","output":"Controlling Urban Traffic-One of the Useful Methods to Ensure Safety in Wuhan Based on COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccination is proven useful for primary prevention against COVID-19.

The effectiveness of the third vaccine still unknown, therefore any studies on its effectiveness are interesting. Additionally, there are also many new ideas for using a new type of COVID-19 crossing to the previous completely vaccinated one.

We conducted a survey, in which the questionnaire was distributed through post or email to 607 specialists who work at 164 hospitals performing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The results were as follows: (1) of the 164 hospitals, 132 responded (response rate: 80.5%). While all 47 hospitals with CRP responded (100%), from among the 117 hospitals without CRP, 85 responded (72.7%). (2) Of the 607 specialists, 227 responded (response rate: 36.9%).

Antibiotics are emerging contaminants which can enter rivers from various sources. Several antibiotics and their related antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been detected in these ecosystems by various research programs and could constitute a substantial problem. The presence of antibiotics and other resistance cofactors can boost the development of ARGs in the chromosomes or mobile genetic elements of natural bacteria in rivers. The ARGs in environmental bacteria can also be transferred to clinically important pathogens. However, antibiotics and their resistance genes are both not currently monitored by national or international authorities responsible for controlling the quality of water bodies. For example, they are not included in the contaminant list in the European Water Framework Directive or in the US list of Water-Quality Benchmarks for Contaminants. Although ARGs are naturally present in the environment, very few studies have focused on non-impacted rivers to assess the background ARG levels in rivers, which could provide some useful indications for future environmental regulation and legislation. The present study reviews the antibiotics and associated ARGs most commonly measured and detected in rivers, including the primary analysis tools used for their assessment. In addition, other factors that could enhance antibiotic resistance, such as the effects of chemical mixtures, the effects of climate change, and the potential effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, are discussed.

Here, we report a novel SARS-CoV-2 viral replication mechanism mediated by interactions between ACE2 and the epigenetic eraser enzyme LSD1, and its interplay with the nuclear shuttling importin pathway. Recent studies have shown a critical role for the importin pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and many RNA viruses hijack this axis to re-direct host cell transcription. LSD1 colocalized with ACE2 at the cell surface to maintain demethylated SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain lysine 31 to promote virusCACE2 interactions. Two newly developed peptide inhibitors competitively inhibited virusCACE2 interactions, and demethylase access to significantly inhibit viral replication. Similar to some other predominantly plasma membrane proteins, ACE2 had a novel nuclear function: its cytoplasmic domain harbors a nuclear shuttling domain, which when demethylated by LSD1 promoted importin--dependent nuclear ACE2 entry following infection to regulate active transcription. A novel, cell permeable ACE2 peptide inhibitor prevented ACE2 nuclear entry, significantly inhibiting viral replication in SARS-CoV-2-infected cell lines, outperforming other LSD1 inhibitors. These data raise the prospect of post-exposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2, either through repurposed LSD1 inhibitors or new, nuclear-specific ACE2 inhibitors.","output":"Targeting novel LSD1-dependent ACE2 demethylation domains inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Contact tracing apps are an essential component of an effective COVID-19 testing strategy to counteract the spread of the pandemic and thereby avoid overburdening the health care system. As the adoption rates in several regions are undesirable, governments must increase the acceptance of COVID-19 tracing apps in these times of uncertainty. OBJECTIVE: Building on the Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), this study aims to investigate how uncertainty reduction measures foster the adoption of COVID-19 tracing apps and how their use affects the perception of different risks. METHODS: Representative survey data were gathered at two measurement points (before and after the app's release) and analyzed by performing covariance-based structural equation modeling (n=1003). RESULTS: We found that uncertainty reduction measures in the form of the transparency dimensions disclosure and accuracy, as well as social influence and trust in government, foster the adoption process. The use of the COVID-19 tracing app in turn reduced the perceived privacy and performance risks but did not reduce social risks and health-related COVID-19 concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the mass adoption of health care technology and URT research by integrating interactive communication measures and transparency as a multidimensional concept to reduce different types of uncertainty over time. Furthermore, our results help to derive communication strategies to promote the mass adoption of COVID-19 tracing apps, thus detecting infection chains and allowing intelligent COVID-19 testing.","output":"The Role of Transparency, Trust, and Social Influence on Uncertainty Reduction in Times of Pandemics: Empirical Study on the Adoption of COVID-19 Tracing Apps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is a threat to public health that impacts the life of frontline pharmacists as they are more susceptible to getting infected by the coronavirus. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive practices associated with coronavirus disease 2019 among pharmacy students of Bangladesh to evaluate their preparedness as future frontline workers against the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: An online-based cross-sectional study was conducted among pharmacy undergraduate students of Bangladesh during the early months of the pandemic in April 2020. Respondents voluntarily submitted an online questionnaire regarding sociodemographics, knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive practices related to coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: A total of 418 participants submitted their responses, and we included 395 responses for final analysis. The mean age of the participants was 20.65 years. The study revealed that out of 395 pharmacy students, 68 (17.2%) had high levels of knowledge, 210 (53.2%) possessed high risk perceptions regarding coronavirus disease 2019, and 165 (41.7%) were adopting high levels of preventive practices. Average scores for knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive practices were 5.7, 8.4, and 8.2 out of 10. Chi-square test and logistic regression analyses showed that having high knowledge levels was associated with high risk perceptions regarding coronavirus disease 2019. Similarly, higher risk perceptions were associated with having high knowledge and preventive measures, while higher preventive measures were associated with female gender, low monthly family income, and having high risk perceptions. CONCLUSION: We found moderate knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive practices related to coronavirus disease 2019 among the undergraduate pharmacy students.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, for coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled phase II trial involving patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ruxolitinib plus standard-of-care treatment (22 patients) or placebo based on standard-of-care treatment (21 patients). After exclusion of 2 patients (1 ineligible, 1 consent withdrawn) from the ruxolitinib group, 20 patients in the intervention group and 21 patients in the control group were included in the study. Treatment with ruxolitinib plus standard-of-care was not associated with significantly accelerated clinical improvement in severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019, although ruxolitinib recipients had a numerically faster clinical improvement. Eighteen (90%) patients from the ruxolitinib group showed computed tomography improvement at day 14 compared with 13 (61.9%) patients from the control group (P = .0495). Three patients in the control group died of respiratory failure, with 14.3% overall mortality at day 28; no patients died in the ruxolitinib group. Ruxolitinib was well tolerated with low toxicities and no new safety signals. Levels of 7 cytokines were significantly decreased in the ruxolitinib group in comparison to the control group.

As COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to increase in the USA, aging Black and Hispanic populations have emerged as especially at-risk for increased exposure to COVID-19 and susceptibility to severe health outcomes. The current review discusses the weathering hypothesis and the influence of social inequality on the identified health disparities. Recent Findings: Aging minoritized populations have endured structural and social inequality over the lifecourse. Consequently, these populations experience weathering, a process that results in physiological dysregulation due to stress associated with persistent disadvantage. Through weathering and continued inequity, aging minoritized populations have an increased risk of exposure and poor health outcomes from COVID-19. Summary: Current literature and available data suggests that aging minoritized persons experience high rates of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The current review hypothesizes and supports that observed disparities are the result of inequalities that especially affect Black and Hispanic populations over the lifecourse. Future efforts to address these disparities should emphasize research that supports governments in identifying at-risk groups, providing accessible COVID-19-related information to those groups, and implementing policy that addresses the structural and social inequities that perpetuate current COVID-19 disparities.","output":"Aging and COVID-19 in Minority Populations: a Perfect Storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The European Resuscitation Council has produced these newborn life support guidelines, which are based on the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) 2020 Consensus on Science and Treatment Recommendations (CoSTR) for Neonatal Life Support.

Mobile health (mHealth) apps, such as meditation apps, are a novel method for improving health and behaviors. These apps may be a critical health promotion strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic and could potentially be used to address rural health disparities. However, limited research has assessed whether meditation app health outcomes are associated with rural and urban residence, and it is unclear whether disparities in health and behaviors between rural and urban populations would persist among meditation app users. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore associations between rural or urban status, psychological outcomes, and physical activity among users of a mobile meditation app. We further aimed to explore associations between rural or urban status and perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity, and to explore changes in these outcomes in rural versus urban app users over time. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of a national survey conducted among subscribers to the meditation app Calm. Eligible participants completed online baseline surveys from April to June 2020, and follow-up surveys from June to September 2020, assessing demographics, psychological outcomes, physical activity, and perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity.

Repeated-measures models showed overall decreases in depression, anxiety, and perceived effects of COVID-19 on physical activity from baseline to follow-up, and no significant changes in stress or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress and mental health over time. Models also showed no significant main effects of rural or urban status, COVID-19 statewide prevalence at baseline, or change in COVID-19 statewide prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find associations between rural or urban status and psychological outcomes (ie, stress, depression, and anxiety), physical activity, or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. Rural or urban status does not appear to drive differences in outcomes among meditation app users, and the use of mHealth apps should continue to be explored as a health promotion strategy in both rural and urban populations. Furthermore, our results did not show negative cumulative effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes and physical activity among app users in our sample, the majority of whom were urban, White, female, and of high socioeconomic status. Further research is needed to investigate meditation app use as a health promotion strategy in rural and urban populations.","output":"Associations Between Rural or Urban Status, Health Outcomes and Behaviors, and COVID-19 Perceptions Among Meditation App Users: Longitudinal Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic with rapid rate of transmission and fatalities worldwide. Scientists have been investigating a host of drugs that may be rechanneled to fight this malaise. Thus, in this current computational study we carried out molecular docking experiments to assess the bridging potentials of some commercial drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, nafamostat, camostat, famotidine, umifenovir, nitazoxanide, ivermectin, and fluvoxamine at the interface between human ACE2 and the coronavirus spike glycoprotein complex. This is aimed at ascertaining the ability of these drugs to bridge and prevent the complexing of these two proteins. The crystal structure of human ACE2 and the coronavirus spike glycoprotein complex was retrieved from protein database, while the selected drugs were retrieved from PubChem data base. The proteins and drugs were prepared for docking using Cresset Flare software. The docking was completed via AutoDock Vina module in Python Prescription software. The best hit drugs with each receptor were selected and their molecular interactions were analyzed using BIOVIA's Discovery Studio 2020. The best hit compounds on the human ACE2 were the lopinavir (-10.1 kcal/mol), ritonavir (-8.9 kcal/mol), and nafamostat (-8.7 kcal/mol). Ivermectin, nafamostat, and camostat with binding energy values -9.0 kcal/mol, -7.8 kcal/mol, and -7.4 kcal/mol respectively were the hit drugs on the coronavirus spike glycoprotein.

This study investigated the impact of direct versus nondirect transfers on the mortality rates of patients with sTBI. METHODS Data on patients with TBI admitted between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, to our Level I TC were obtained from the trauma registry. Data included patient age, sex, mechanism, and type of injury, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity scores, prehospital time, time to request and to transfer, time to initiation of multimodality monitoring and goal-directed therapy protocol, dwell time in the emergency department (EDT), and mortality. Data, reported in means  standard deviation, were analyzed with the Student t-test and chi-square. Statistical significance was accepted at a P value < 0.05. RESULTS sTBI direct transfer to TC versus transfer from non-TCs (NTC): Of the 1187 patients with TBI admitted to our TC, 768 (64.7%) were admitted directly from the scene, whereas 419 (35.3%) were admitted after secondary transfer. One hundred seventy-one (22.2%) of the direct transfers had Glasgow Coma Scale < 8 (sTBI) and 92 (21.9%) of the secondary transfers had sTBI. The transfer time: Time from scene to arrival to the EDT was significantly shorter for TC versus NTCs 43  14 versus 77  26 min, respectively (P < 0.05). EDT dwell time before transfer and time from injury to arrival to TC were 4.2  2.1 and 6.2  8.3 h, respectively. Mortality: There was a statistically significant lower mortality for patients with sTBI transferred directly from the scene to TCs as opposed to patients secondarily transferred, 33/171 (19.3%) versus 33/92 (35.8%), respectively (P < 0.05).

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Public hospital employees in Denmark. Participants: 5985 healthcare workers (88.6% women) who daily on a smartphone reported COVID-19 contact. Main outcome measures: SARS-CoV-2 infection rates defined by the first positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test recorded in a register with complete test coverage. Results: 159 positive and 35 996 negative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were recorded during 514 165 person-days of follow-up November 25, 2020 - April 30, 2021. The SARS-CoV-2 infection rate for healthcare workers who during the previous 3-7 days had close contact with COVID-19 patients was 153.7 per 100 000 person-days (0.15% per day) corresponding with an incidence rate ratio of 3.17 (40 cases, 95% CI 2.15 to 4.66) when compared with no close contact with COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate ratios following close contact with co-workers and persons outside work with COVID-19 were 2.54 (10 cases, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.96) and 17.79 (35 cases, 95% CI 12.05 to 26.28). These estimates were mutually adjusted and further adjusted for age, sex, month and number of previous PCR tests. Conclusions: Despite strong focus on preventive actions during the second wave of the pandemic, healthcare workers were still at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection when in close contact with patients with COVID-19. The numbers affected were comparable to the numbers affected following COVID-19 contact outside work. Close contact with co-workers was also a risk factor.

It is practically impossible to implement this task manually due to the high volume of the relevant literature. Text mining has been considered to be a powerful approach to address this challenge, especially the topic modeling, a well-known unsupervised method that aims to reveal latent topics from the literature. However, in spite of its potential utility, the results generated from this approach are often investigated manually. Hence, its application to the COVID-19 literature is not straightforward and expert knowledge is needed to make meaningful interpretations. In order to address these challenges, we propose a novel analytical framework for estimating topic interactions and effective visualization for topic interpretation. Here we assumed that topics constituting a paper can be positioned on an interaction map, which belongs to a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Based on this assumption, after summarizing topics with their topic-word distributions using the biterm topic model, we mapped these latent topics on networks to visualize relationships among the topics. Moreover, in the proposed approach, we developed a score that is helpful to select meaningful words that characterize the topic. We interpret the relationships among topics by tracking the change of relationships among topics using a trajectory plot generated with different levels of word richness. These results together provide deeply mined and intuitive representation of relationships among topics related to a specific research area. The application of this proposed framework to the PubMed literature shows that our approach facilitates understanding of the topics constituting the COVID-19 knowledge.","output":"Network-based Trajectory Analysis of Topic Interaction Map for Text Mining of COVID-19 Biomedical Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intra-operative autologous blood donation is a blood conservation technique with limited evidence.

This fact could be related to an inappropriate use of these measures due to the absence of specific VTE risk scores. To assess the current situation in Spain, we have performed a cross-sectional study, analyzing if the prophylactic measures were appropriate to the patients' VTE risk. METHODS Through an electronic questionnaire, we carried out a single day point prevalence study on the VTE prophylactic measures used in several critical care units in Spain. We performed a risk stratification for VTE in three groups: low, moderate-high, and very high risk. The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines were used to determine if the patients were receiving the recommended prophylaxis. RESULTS A total of 777 patients were included; 62% medical, 30% surgical, and 7% major trauma patients. The median number of the risk factors for VTE was four. According to the proposed VTE risk score, only 2% of the patients were at low risk, whereas 83% were at very high risk. Sixty-three percent of patients received pharmacological prophylaxis, 12% mechanical prophylaxis, 6% combined prophylaxis, and 19% did not receive any prophylactic measure. According to criteria suggested by the guidelines, 23% of medical, 71% of surgical, and 70% of major trauma patients received an inappropriate prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS Most critically ill patients are at high or very high risk of VTE, but there is a low rate of appropriate prophylaxis.

Artificial neural networks were trained to learn time-series temperature variation patterns using radio occultation measurements of atmospheric temperature from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC). Data used for training, validation and testing of the neural networks covered period prior to the lockdown. There was also an investigation into the viability of solar activity indicator (represented by the sunspot number) as an input for the process. The results indicated that including the sunspot number as an input for the training did not improve the network prediction accuracy. The trained network was then used to predict values for the lockdown period. Since the network was trained using pre-lockdown dataset, predictions from the network are regarded as expected temperatures, should there have been no lockdown. By comparing with the actual COSMIC measurements during the lockdown period, effects of the lockdown on atmospheric temperatures were deduced. In overall, the mean altitudinal temperatures rose by about 1.1  above expected values during the lockdown. An altitudinal breakdown, at 1 km resolution, reveals that the values were typically below 0.5  at most of the altitudes, but exceeded 1  at 28 and 29 km altitudes.

Identifying and disentangling the drivers of resulting hospitalisation incidence at the local scale is key to predict, mitigate and manage epidemic surges, but also to develop targeted measures. However, this type of analysis is often not possible because of the lack of spatially-explicit health data and spatial uncertainties associated with infection. METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we propose an analytical framework to investigate potential drivers of the spatio-temporal heterogeneity in COVID-19 hospitalisation incidence when data are only available at the hospital level. Specifically, the approach is based on the delimitation of hospital catchment areas, which allows analysing associations between hospitalisation incidence and spatial or temporal covariates. We illustrate and apply our analytical framework to Belgium, a country heavily impacted by two COVID-19 epidemic waves in 2020, both in terms of mortality and hospitalisation incidence. RESULTS: Our spatial analyses reveal an association between the hospitalisation incidence and the local density of nursing home residents, which confirms the important impact of COVID-19 in elderly communities of Belgium. Our temporal analyses further indicate a pronounced seasonality in hospitalisation incidence associated with the seasonality of weather variables. Taking advantage of these associations, we discuss the feasibility of predictive models based on machine learning to predict future hospitalisation incidence. CONCLUSION: Our reproducible analytical workflow allows performing spatially-explicit analyses of data aggregated at the hospital level and can be used to explore potential drivers and dynamic of COVID-19 hospitalisation incidence at regional or national scales.","output":"Investigating the drivers of the spatio-temporal heterogeneity in COVID-19 hospital incidence-Belgium as a study case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes and behaviors about COVID-19 among Portuguese higher education students.Design/methodology/approachIn May 2020, all students from a Portuguese University were invited to participate in completing an online questionnaire.

Results suggest that concession areas having the largest accumulated and current biomass have the highest risk, which is also transferred to the municipal level. The scenarios modelled with better management practices that reduce diseases were able to reduce risks by 30C40%. The largest risk reduction is achieved when production biomass is divided in a more equitable manner among concession areas, suggesting the need for strategic improvements in spatial planning of the activity in the marine environment according to ecosystem carrying capacity and better practices. Improving adaptation capacity can reduce vulnerability between 20% and 30% for municipalities; for example, providing local employment can be a win-win management measure under the COVID-19 threat because it reduces movement of people and facilitates handling and responses to emergencies. A larger footprint in local economies and employment can also improve social perception and acceptance of the sector, thus contributing to improve adaptation changes and governance to face the threats.

The top three candidate compounds, which were shown to adapt similar binding modes as the reported covalent ligands were selected. The mechanism and stability of binding of these compounds were confirmed by 100 ns molecular dynamic simulation followed by MM/PBSA binding free energy calculation.

Furthermore, three pistons with different bowl-shaped pit depths (pistons A1, A2, and A3) are designed based on piston A. The results show that piston A2 (7.7 mm) has advantages in terms of strengthening the turbulence in the cylinders, promoting fuel evaporation, increasing the in-cylinder turbulent kinetic energy and the velocity of the airflow near the spark plug at the ignition time, and accelerating the rapid diffusion of combustion and the rapid increase in in-cylinder temperature and pressure.

Eligibility criteria and data analysis: Prevalence rates of mental health symptoms in the general population and key sub-populations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Eastern Europe. Data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence rates of anxiety and depression. Results: The meta-analysis identifies and includes 21 studies and 26 independent samples in Eastern Europe. Poland (n=4), Serbia (n=4), Russia (n=3), and Croatia (n=3) had the greatest number of studies. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted in eleven Eastern European countries including Hungary, Slovakia, and Slovenia. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 18 studies with 22 samples was 30% (95% CI: 24%-37%) and pooled prevalence of depression in 18 studies with 23 samples was 27% (95% CI: 21%-34%).

It was soon announced that these cases were of viral origin and the cause was a new coronavirus (CoV). Initially, the virus was called novel CoV  and then defined as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after more detailed investigations. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. The rapid spread of the disease in a few months has resulted in a global pandemic and it continues. However, there are no specific effective anti-viral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 infection, some antiviral drugs are using in the therapy of COVID-19 with limited success. Currently, for the prevention of the pandemic, global vaccination seems to be important. Antiviral protection of vaccines is provided by the development of antibodies that can neutralize the virus. Antibody response develops against spike protein and nucleocapsid protein but neutralizing antibodies are formed against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. It has also been shown that most viral proteins are recognized in T-cell responses. Vaccine discovery trials for COVID-19 have begun all over the world since the outbreak began.

These changes impacted how pregnant individuals received prenatal care and experienced childbirth. The additional stress caused by these changes may negatively affect the well-being of pregnant individuals and the developing child. This study investigated the impact of the pandemic on prenatal care and birth plans of pregnant individuals in Canada and potential associations with maternal mental health. Data from 4604 participants was collected from English- and French-speaking Canadians between April 5-June 1, 2020 as part of the Canada-wide Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic study. Symptoms of maternal depression, general anxiety, and pregnancy-related anxiety were assessed. Participants also answered questions about disruptions and changes to prenatal care and their birth plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between prenatal care disruptions and maternal mental health. Cancellation of prenatal appointments and birth plan changes (specifically changes to childcare during birth and change of support person attending the birth) were significantly associated with greater odds of experiencing clinically-elevated depression, anxiety, and/or pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms.

This has prompted calls for key workers to receive a variety of special benefits over and above their normal pay. Here, we consider whether two such benefits are justified: a no-fault compensation scheme for harm caused by an epidemic and hazard pay for the risks and burdens of working during an epidemic. Both forms of benefit are often made available to members of the armed forces for the harms, risks and burdens that come with military service. We argue from analogy that these benefits also ought to be provided to key workers during an epidemic because, like the military, key workers face unavoidable harms, risks and burdens in providing essential public good. The amount of compensation should be proportional to the harm suffered and the amount of hazard pay should be proportional to the risk and burden endured. Therefore, key workers should receive the same amount of compensation and hazard pay as the military where the harms, risks and burdens are equivalent. In the UK, a form of no-fault compensation has recently been made available to the surviving families of key workers who suffer fatal COVID-19 infections. According to our argument, however, it is insufficient because it offers less to key workers than is made available to the families of armed services personnel killed on duty.","output":"Compensation and hazard pay for key workers during an epidemic: an argument from analogy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With improving PM2.5 air quality, the tropospheric ozone (O3) has become the top issue of Chinas air pollution control. Here, we combine comprehensive observational data analysis with models to unveil the contributions of different processes and precursors to the change of O3 during COVID-19 lockdown in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), one of the most urbanized megacity regions of eastern China. Despite a 44 to 47% reduction in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) ozone concentrations increase from 28 ppbv in pre-lockdown to 43 ppbv in lockdown period. We reproduce this transition with the WRF-Chem model, which shows that ~80% of the increase in MDA8 is due to meteorological factors (seasonal variation and radiation), and ~20% is due to emission reduction. We find that daytime photochemistry does not lead to an increase but rather a decrease of daytime O3 production during the lockdown. However, the reduced O3 production is overwhelmed by the weakened nitric oxide (NO) titration resulting in a net increase of O3 concentration. Although the emission reduction increases O3 concentration, it leads to a decrease in the Ox (O3 + NO2) concentration, suggesting reduced atmospheric oxidation capacity on a regional scale. The dominant effect of NO titration demonstrates the importance of prioritizing VOCs reduction, especially from solvent usage and the petrochemical industry with high emission ratios of VOCs/NOx.","output":"Seasonality and reduced nitric oxide titration dominated ozone increase during COVID-19 lockdown in eastern China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Following the positive results from recent trials on endovascular therapy (EVT), bridging therapy (intravenous alteplase plus EVT) is increasingly being used for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, the optimal dose of intravenous alteplase remains unknown in centers where bridging therapy is actively performed. The optimal dose for eventual recanalization and positive clinical outcomes in patients receiving bridging therapy also remains unknown. METHODS In this prospective Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED) sub-study, we explored the outcomes following treatment with two different doses (low- [0.6 mg/kg] or standard-dose [0.9 mg/kg]) of intravenous alteplase across 12 Korean centers where EVT is actively performed. The primary endpoint was a favorable outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale scores 0 to 1). Secondary endpoints included symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in all patients, and the recanalization rate and favorable outcome in patients who underwent cerebral angiography for EVT (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01422616). RESULTS Of 351 patients, the primary outcome occurred in 46% of patients in both the standard-(80/173) and low-dose (81/178) groups (odds ratio [OR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.81; P=0.582), although ICHs tended to occur more frequently in the standard-dose group (8% vs. 3%, P=0.056). Of the 67 patients who underwent cerebral angiography, there was no significant difference in favorable functional outcome between the standard- and low-dose groups (39% vs. 21%; OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 0.73 to 7.78; P=0.149).

Methods: PCR confirmed, serum antibody confirmed with persistent negative PCR results, and clinically diagnosed patients hospitalized in two medical centers during February and March 2020 were included. Differences in clinical, imaging and laboratory characteristics as well as factors affecting their prognosis were analyzed. Results: There were 114 PCR confirmed, 17 serology confirmed and 21 clinically diagnosed patients included. Time from onset of disease to the first PCR and admission were similar among the groups. Compared with PCR-confirmed patients, serology-confirmed patients were older and likely to have hypertension, vomiting, or symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea. Regarding imaging manifestations, serology-confirmed patients were more prone to pleural effusion. In addition, higher levels of C-reactive protein, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, total bilirubin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, troponin, interleukin-6 and IL-8 were also found. Although with similar mortality, serology confirmed patients were more likely to have disease progression. High levels of D-dimer and IL-6 were possibly the underlying factors leading to their worse prognosis. On the other hand, clinically diagnosed patients were more similar to PCR-confirmed patients.

In the last decades, a wide variety of surface display systems have been developed for the exposure of recombinant proteins on the surface of Escherichia coli, such as autotransporters and outer membrane proteins. RESULTS: In this study, we assess three approaches for the surface display of a panel of heterologous and homologous mature lipoproteins in E. coli: four from Neisseria meningitidis and four from the host strain that are known to be localised in the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. Constructs were made carrying the sequences coding for eight mature lipoproteins, each fused to the delivery portion of three different systems: the autotransporter adhesin involved in diffuse adherence-I (AIDA-I) from enteropathogenic E. coli, the LppOmpA chimaera and a truncated form of the ice nucleation protein (INP), InaK-NC (N-terminal domain fused with C-terminal one) from Pseudomonas syringae. In contrast to what was observed for the INP constructs, when fused to the AIDA-I or LppOmpA, most of the mature lipoproteins were displayed on the bacterial surface both at 37 and 25 C as demonstrated by FACS analysis, confocal and transmission electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first study that compares surface display systems using a number of passenger proteins. We have shown that the experimental conditions, including the choice of the carrier protein and the growth temperature, play an important role in the translocation of mature lipoproteins onto the bacterial surface. Despite all the optimization steps performed with the InaK-NC anchor motif, surface exposure of the passenger proteins used in this study was not achieved. For our experimental conditions, LppOmpA chimaera has proved to be an efficient surface display system for the homologous passenger proteins although cell lysis and phenotype heterogeneity were observed. Finally, AIDA-I was found to be the best surface display system for mature lipoproteins (especially heterologous ones) in the E. coli host strain with no inhibition of growth and only limited phenotype heterogeneity.","output":"Decorating the surface of Escherichia coli with bacterial lipoproteins: a comparative analysis of different display systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is a virus that has created tension and devastation around the globe This study is designed to specifically find out the effect of Covid-19 on the socioeconomic well-being of Nigerians, the health sector preparedness to handle the pandemic, and the role of Nigerian social workers in the fight against Covid-19 in Nigeria The study employed a phenomenological and exploratory research design in its inquiry Sixteen respondents made up the sample size for the study A Focus Group Discussion Guide and an In-Depth Interview Guide were the instruments for data collection The result of the study shows that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the socioeconomic well-being of Nigerians Second, the Nigerian health system is ill equipped and underprepared to handle the Covid-19 pandemic Third, Nigerian social workers, most especially medical social workers, have played a significant role in passing out information on Covid-19 preventive measures to the general public The study recommends that the Nigerian government should wake up and fix the health sector and make it proactive to handle epidemics/pandemics in the future Social work practice in Nigeria should be promoted by the government through institutionalization of the profession","output":"Effect of Covid-19 on Nigerian Socio-economic Well-being, Health Sector Pandemic Preparedness and the Role of Nigerian Social Workers in the War Against Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CD4(+) T cells are essential for regulating effective immune response to pathogens and immune balance.

Understanding smokers' responses to the pandemic will help assess its public health impact and inform future public health and provider messages to smokers. OBJECTIVE: To assess risk perceptions and change in tobacco use among current and former smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted in May-July 2020 (55% response rate) PARTICIPANTS: 694 current and former daily smokers (mean age 53, 40% male, 78% white) who had been hospitalized pre-COVID-19 and enrolled into a smoking cessation clinical trial at hospitals in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. MAIN MEASURES: Perceived risk of COVID-19 due to tobacco use; changes in tobacco consumption and interest in quitting tobacco use; self-reported quitting and relapse since January 2020. KEY RESULTS: 68% (95% CI, 65-72%) of respondents believed that smoking increases the risk of contracting COVID-19 or having a more severe case. In adjusted analyses, perceived risk was higher in Massachusetts where COVID-19 had already surged than in Pennsylvania and Tennessee which were pre-surge during survey administration (AOR 1.56, 95% CI, 1.07-2.28). Higher perceived COVID-19 risk was associated with increased interest in quitting smoking (AOR 1.72, 95% CI 1.01-2.92). During the pandemic, 32% (95% CI, 27-37%) of smokers increased, 37% (95% CI, 33-42%) decreased, and 31% (95% CI, 26-35%) did not change their cigarette consumption. Increased smoking was associated with higher perceived stress (AOR 1.49, 95% CI 1.16-1.91). Overall, 11% (95% CI, 8-14%) of respondents who smoked in January 2020 (pre-COVID-19) had quit smoking at survey (mean, 6 months later) while 28% (95% CI, 22-34%) of former smokers relapsed. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk was associated with higher odds of quitting and lower odds of relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Most smokers believed that smoking increased COVID-19 risk.

Traditionally the discipline focuses on eukaryotes, with the study of bacteria and viruses complementary but distinct. Nonetheless, parasites vary in size and complexity from single celled protozoa, to enormous plants like those in the genus Rafflesia. Lifecycles range from obligate intracellular to extensive exoparasitism. Examples of parasites include high-profile medical and zoonotic pathogens such as Plasmodium, veterinary pathogens of wild and captive animals and many of the agents which cause neglected tropical diseases, stretching to parasites which infect plants and other parasites (e.g. Kikuchi et al. 2011; Hotez et al. 2014; Blake et al. 2015; Hemingway, 2015; Meekums et al. 2015; Sandlund et al. 2015). The breadth of parasitology has been matched by the variety of ways in which parasites are studied, drawing upon biological, chemical, molecular, epidemiological and other expertise. Despite such breadth bridging between disciplines has commonly been problematic, regardless of extensive encouragement from government agencies, peer audiences and funding bodies promoting multidisciplinary research. Now, progress in understanding and collaboration can benefit from establishment of the One Health concept (Zinsstag et al. 2012; Stark et al. 2015). One Health draws upon biological, environmental, medical, veterinary and social science disciplines in order to improve human, animal and environmental health, although it remains tantalizingly difficult to engage many relevant parties. For infectious diseases traditional divides have been exacerbated as the importance of wildlife reservoirs, climate change, food production systems and socio-economic diversity have been recognized but often not addressed in a multidisciplinary manner. In response the 2015 Autumn Symposium organized by the British Society for Parasitology (BSP; https://www.bsp.uk.net/home/) was focused on One Health, running under the title 'One Health: parasites and beyond'. The meeting, held at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in Camden, London from September 14th to 15th, drew upon a blend of specialist parasitology reinforced with additional complementary expertise. Scientists, advocates, policy makers and industry representatives were invited to present at the meeting, promoting and developing One Health understanding with relevance to parasitology. The decision to widen the scope of the meeting to non-parasitological, but informative topics, is reflected in the diversity of the articles included in this special issue.

Obesity is often associated with physiological and mental health burdens. Owing to several barriers to face-to-face psychotherapy, a promising approach is to exploit recent developments and implement innovative eCmental health interventions that offer various benefits to patients with obesity and to the health care system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the acceptance of eCmental health interventions in patients with obesity and explore its influencing predictors. In addition, the well-established Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model is compared with an extended UTAUT model in terms of variance explanation of acceptance. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey study was conducted from July 2020 to January 2021 in Germany. Eligibility requirements were adult age (18 years), internet access, good command of the German language, and BMI >30 kg/m(2) (obesity). A total of 448 patients with obesity (grades I, II, and III) were recruited via specialized social media platforms. The impact of various sociodemographic, medical, and mental health characteristics was assessed. eHealth-related data and acceptance of eCmental health interventions were examined using a modified questionnaire based on the UTAUT. RESULTS: Overall, the acceptance of eCmental health interventions in patients with obesity was moderate (mean 3.18, SD 1.11). Significant differences in the acceptance of eCmental health interventions among patients with obesity exist, depending on the grade of obesity, age, sex, occupational status, and mental health status. In an extended UTAUT regression model, acceptance was significantly predicted by the depression score (Patient Health Questionnaire-8; =.07; P=.03), stress owing to constant availability via mobile phone or email (=.06; P=.02), and confidence in using digital media (=?0.058; P=.04) and by the UTAUT core predictors performance expectancy (=.45; P<.001), effort expectancy (=.22; P<.001), and social influence (=.27; P<.001). The comparison between an extended UTAUT model (16 predictors) and the restrictive UTAUT model (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence) revealed a significant difference in explained variance (F(13,431)=2.366; P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: The UTAUT model has proven to be a valuable instrument to predict the acceptance of eCmental health interventions in patients with obesity. The extended UTAUT model explained a significantly high percentage of variance in acceptance (in total 73.6%). On the basis of the strong association between acceptance and future use, new interventions should focus on these UTAUT predictors to promote the establishment of effective eCmental health interventions for patients with obesity who experience mental health burdens.","output":"Predicting Acceptance of eCMental Health Interventions in Patients With Obesity by Using an Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance Model: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blockchain-based federated learning has gained significant interest over the last few years with the increasing concern for data privacy, advances in machine learning, and blockchain innovation.

As the global COVID-19 pandemic swept through our state, we were abruptly forced to take our burn clinic to a telehealth platform for most patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our experience with telehealth in managing burn wounds and other complex skin defects. METHODS: A 16-item survey was developed using the framework outlined by the National Quality Forum for the development of telehealth measures. The survey was distributed to direct care providers and focused on the domains of experience and effectiveness and the subdomains of efficiency and satisfaction. RESULTS: There were a total of 14 respondents, including physicians, allied healthcare professionals, therapists and nurses. Seventy-seven percent of participants felt that overall, the system was efficient in the 4 categories of time required for scheduling, check-in, visit conduct and care coordination. Telehealth was deemed moderately to very effective by 80% in providing the patient access to care and the providers ability to educate the patient. However, providers, therapists and nurses uniformly found telehealth to be either not at all effective or slightly effective in assessing wounds, musculoskeletal function and developing a plan of care. When rating satisfaction with connectivity and overall quality of the clinic visit 70% of respondents were either dissatisfied/neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with the platform. CONCLUSIONS: The operational aspects of our burn clinic telehealth program implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were found to be largely satisfactory, with the exception of connectivity issues. However, the clinical aspects of the program were found to be largely unsatisfactory and, notably, were judged to be inferior to in-person visits.","output":"582 A Survey of Burn Care Providers Regarding the Utility of Telehealth to Provide Outpatient Burn Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The use of tacks for mesh fixation may induce pain after surgery for ventral hernia. The aim of this study was to compare postoperative pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) with conventional mesh fixation using titanium tacks versus fibrin sealant (FS). METHODS This randomized clinical trial included patients with an umbilical hernia defect ranging from 15 to 5 cm at three Danish hernia centres. Participants were assigned randomly to FS or titanium tack fixation. The primary outcome was acute pain, defined as the mean pain score on days 0-2 after surgery, measured on a 0-100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS Forty patients were included, of whom 38 were available for intention-to-treat analysis after 1 month. Patients in the FS group reported less pain than those in the tack group on days 0-2, both at rest (median 19 versus 47 mm; P = 0025) and during activity (38 versus 60 mm; P = 0014). The absolute difference in pain score between groups was 19 (95 per cent confidence interval 3 to 34) and 20 (4 to 35) mm at rest and during activity respectively. Patients in the FS group resumed normal daily activity earlier (after median 7 versus 18 days; P = 0027) and reported significantly less discomfort. No recurrences were observed. CONCLUSION Mesh fixation with FS in LVHR was associated with less acute postoperative pain, discomfort and a shorter convalescence than tack fixation. Long-term follow-up is needed to show whether the effect of FS fixation persists in terms of chronic pain and recurrence.

This effect of kCer is not due to histamine-activated GPCRs, but rather to Sema3A-Nrp1 receptor binding. The present study focused on the ability of kCer to induce cell differentiation, in addition to its anti-migratory effects. We demonstrated that the effects of kCer on cell migration and cell differentiation are perpetuated by a cascade of crosstalk between pathways downstream of Nrp1 and GPCR in HaCaT cells. ABSTRACT: Histamines suppress epidermal keratinocyte differentiation. Previously, we reported that konjac ceramide (kCer) suppresses histamine-stimulated cell migration of HaCaT keratinocytes. kCer specifically binds to Nrp1 and does not interact with histamine receptors. The signaling mechanism of kCer in HaCaT cells is also controlled by an intracellular signaling cascade activated by the Sema3A-Nrp1 pathway. In the present study, we demonstrated that kCer treatment induced HaCaT keratinocyte differentiation after migration of immature cells. kCer-induced HaCaT cell differentiation was accompanied by some features of keratinocyte differentiation markers. kCer induced activating phosphorylation of p38MAPK and c-Fos, which increased the protein levels of involucrin that was the latter differentiation marker. In addition, we demonstrated that the effects of both kCer and histamines are regulated by an intracellular mechanism of Rac1 activation/RhoA inhibition downstream of the Sema3A/Nrp1 receptor and histamine/GPCR pathways. In summary, the effects of kCer on cell migration and cell differentiation are regulated by cascade crosstalk between downstream Nrp1 and histamine-GPCR pathways in HaCaT cells.","output":"Konjac Ceramide (kCer)-Mediated Signal Transduction of the Sema3A Pathway Promotes HaCaT Keratinocyte Differentiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has emerged as an alarming disease since December 2019, claiming the lives of thousands across the world to date.

However, there are few studies on depression in older adults and the few existing results may be contradictory, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine the factors associated with depression in older adults in two coastal regions of Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study uses an analytical cross-sectional design in a population of older adults, who participated in a non-governmental ambulatory social support program in Callao and Ica, two coastal regions of Peru. We administered an on-site structured questionnaire to record sociodemographic data, the Geriatric Depression Scale by Yesavage to measure depression, and the Barthel Index to assess physical function. In order to determine cognitive impairment as an exclusion criterion, the MEC-30 was used. The association between variables was assessed through contingency tables, using the odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding confidence interval (95% CI) and the X2 test. Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: Out of the 244 older adults surveyed, 39% had depressive symptoms, of which 28.3% (n=69) and 10.7% (n=26) were moderately and severely depressive, respectively. The findings significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms were being 76 years old or older [p=0.005, OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29-4.20], not participating in weekly recreational activities [p=0.004, OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.31-3.99] and the presence of comorbidities [p=0.026, OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.07-3.29].

Nanoparticles on the surface of platinum are investigated with a scanning electron microscope and elemental composition is analysed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Findings Vigorous formation of Pt nanoparticles with a size of 10a?nm is observed when the process is driven by the alternating polarity pulses. The effects of Pt corrosion have different character and cannot explain the phenomenon. Similar nanoparticles are observed when the Pt plate is exposed to a stream of nanobubbles.

To halt the pandemic and alleviate its impact on society, economy, and public health, the development of vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 was a dire need. To date, various platforms have been utilized for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, and over 200 vaccine candidates have been produced, many of which have obtained the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for emergency use. Despite this successful development and licensure, concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of these vaccines have arisen, given the unprecedented speed of vaccine development and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains and variants. In this review, we summarize the different platforms used for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine development, discuss their strengths and limitations, and highlight the major safety concerns and potential risks associated with each vaccine type.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine Platforms: Challenges and Safety Contemplations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging affects all tissues and organs. Aging of the immune system results in the severe disruption of its functions, leading to an increased susceptibility to infections, an increase in autoimmune disorders and cancer incidence, and a decreased response to vaccines. Lymph nodes are precisely organized structures of the peripheral lymphoid organs and are the key sites coordinating innate and long-term adaptive immune responses to external antigens and vaccines. They are also involved in immune tolerance. The aging of lymph nodes results in decreased cell transport to and within the nodes, a disturbance in the structure and organization of nodal zones, incorrect location of individual immune cell types and impaired intercellular interactions, as well as changes in the production of adequate amounts of chemokines and cytokines necessary for immune cell proliferation, survival and function, impaired na?ve T- and B-cell homeostasis, and a diminished long-term humoral response. Understanding the causes of these stromal and lymphoid microenvironment changes in the lymph nodes that cause the aging-related dysfunction of the immune system can help to improve long-term immune responses and the effectiveness of vaccines in the elderly.","output":"Aging-Related Cellular, Structural and Functional Changes in the Lymph Nodes: A Significant Component of Immunosenescence?

Despite its growing evidence, there is a need to unravel the complex learning process in order to ensure high quality of interprofessional education delivery. AIM This study aimed to explore the experiences of healthcare students and facilitators on the use of 3DVW for interprofessional team-based virtual simulation. METHODS Interprofessional teams, each comprising six different healthcare students (Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, and Medical Social Work) and two clinicians who acted as facilitators, logged into the 3DVW from their own remote locations to participate in team-based care delivery that included an interprofessional bedside round and a family conference. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted on a purposive sample of 30 healthcare students and 12 facilitators using focus group discussions and individual interviews. RESULTS Four themes emerged from their experiences: the \\"wow experience\\", authentic experience on collaborative care, ease of learning, and preeminent role of the facilitator. The simulation provided the \\"wow\\" experiences through contextual, collaborative and experiential learning approaches. Despite technical challenges, the participants were wooed by the comforts of learning from home and the psychological safety in virtual environment. The facilitators played a critical role in optimizing learning engagement to win learners over. CONCLUSION Our study explicates how attention to the \\"wow, woo and win\\" trilateral factors can transform the interprofessional learning experiences offered by 3DVW simulation. Future developments in the use of this learning technology should include developing the clinicians' facilitation skills and the provision of technical support to make this 3DVW a success calls in winning students' learning engagement.","output":"\\"Wow, woo, win\\": Healthcare students' and facilitators' experiences of interprofessional simulation in three-dimensional virtual world: A qualitative evaluation study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Access to high-quality palliative care is inadequate for most people living and dying with serious illness. Policies aimed at optimising delivery of palliative and end of life care are an important mechanism to improve quality of care for the dying. The extent to which palliative care is included in national health policies is unknown. We aimed to identify priorities and opportunities for palliative and end of life care in national health policies in the UK. METHODS: Documentary analysis consisting of 1) summative content analysis to describe the extent to which palliative and end of life care is referred to and/or prioritised in national health and social care policies, and 2) thematic analysis to explore health policy priorities that are opportunities to widen access to palliative and end of life care for people with serious illness. Relevant national policy documents were identified through web searches of key government and other organisations, and through expert consultation. Documents included were UK-wide or devolved (i.e. England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales), health and social care government strategies published from 2010 onwards. RESULTS: Fifteen policy documents were included in the final analysis. Twelve referred to palliative or end of life care, but details about what should improve, or mechanisms to achieve this, were sparse. Policy priorities that are opportunities to widen palliative and end of life care access comprised three inter-related themes: (1) integrated care C conceptualised as reorganisation of services as a way to enable improvement; (2) personalised care C conceptualised as allowing people to shape and manage their own care; and (3) support for unpaid carers C conceptualised as enabling unpaid carers to live a more independent lifestyle and balance caring with their own needs. CONCLUSIONS: Although information on palliative and end of life care in UK health and social care policies was sparse, improving palliative care may provide an evidence-based approach to achieve the stated policy priorities of integrated care, personalised care, and support for unpaid carers. Aligning existing evidence of the benefits of palliative care with the three priorities identified may be an effective mechanism to both strengthen policy and improve care for people who are dying.

The aim of the present study was to adapt the questionnaire for its use in Spanish-speaking populations. A total of 171 individuals (131 women and 40 men) with nononcological chronic pain participated in this cross-sectional study. The most frequent pain diagnoses in the sample were fibromyalgia, herniated disc, and rheumatoid arthritis. Systematic sampling was used. All individuals were interviewed at their clinic between March 2018 and February 2020. The dimensionality of the COMM-SV items was evaluated using an optimal implementation of parallel analysis (PA) and an exploratory factor analysis. Internal consistency, testCretest reliability, and criterion and convergent validity were calculated. The COMM-SV comprises five factors: problematic interpersonal behaviour, searching for more medication than prescribed, medication misuse and self-injurious thoughts, emergency use, and memory and attention problems. It has good reliability and adequate testCretest stability. The results support its criterion and convergent validity. Given the increasing use and abuse of opioids, a valid and reliable instrument is needed in Spanish settings to identify patients with chronic pain who present aberrant behaviour related to the use of these medications.

This procedure is laborious and poses LN(2) related hazards. An alternative logistics for transportation of samples was investigated. Use of Flinders Technology Associates (FTA(?)) elute card was evaluated for transportation of extended bovine semen to screen BoHV-1 DNA by real-time PCR targeting gB gene and the method was compared with the OIE approved Chelex resin based method. A protocol for extraction of BoHV-1 DNA from FTA(?) card spotted with extended semen was optimized. The viral DNA was found to be stable on FTA(?) card for at least 28 days when the cards are stored at 4C37 C. The analytical sensitivity for the assay was determined using variable dilutions of BoHV-1 spiked semen and positive plasmid harbouring gB gene (97bp) spotted onto FTA(?) card and it was found to be 10(0.8) TCID(50)/ml or 100 copies respectively in real-time PCR. The test could detect as low as 10(0.008) TCID(50)/ml or 1 copy of positive plasmid when more number of replicates (n = 6) of the same sample were tested. This sensitivity was found to be comparable to Chelex method and both the methods demonstrated a very strong correlation (r = 0.9774; 95% CI: 0.9620C0.9860) in terms of Ct value (p < 0.0001).

associated with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and fever. Its etiology is multifactorial but related to the overproduction of inflammatory and oxidative mediators. There is currently no cure for this disease, and drugs used to manage it often have deleterious side effects. H(2) is recognized as having anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may qualify it as a novel therapeutic for colitis. We induced an acute model of colitis in mice by administering dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days. Mice were divided into five groups (n=6); normal, colitis, H(2)-treated colitis, sulfasalazine-treated colitis, and H(2) plus sulfasalazine-treated colitis. From days three to ten, mice were given H(2), sulfasalazine, or both. H(2) was administered via dissolving a hydrogen-generating tablet in water to make hydrogen-rich water (HRW), which was ingested ad libitum and via oral gavage (200 L). The Disease Activity Index (DAI), histological changes, and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were assessed. HRW and sulfasalazine significantly improved bodyweight, DAI, mucosal damage, crypt loss, and spleen weight compared to control. Both treatments significantly decreased inflammation (high-sensitive C-reactive protein) and restored redox balance (total thiol, superoxide dismutase, catalase activity). There was a trend for the combination treatment to be more effective than either HRW or sulfasalazine alone.

Allicin exerts its strong antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi via S-thioallylation of protein thiols and low molecular weight thiols. Here, we investigated the effect of allicin on SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells. Toxicity tests revealed that Calu-3 cells showed greater allicin tolerance, probably due to >4-fold higher GSH levels compared to the very sensitive Vero E6 cells. Exposure of infected Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells to biocompatible allicin doses led to a 60C70% decrease of viral RNA and infectious viral particles. Label-free quantitative proteomics was used to investigate the changes in the Calu-3 proteome after SARS-CoV-2 infection and the effect of allicin on the host-virus proteome. SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells caused a strong induction of the antiviral interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature, including several antiviral effectors, such as cGAS, Mx1, IFIT, IFIH, IFI16, IFI44, OAS, and ISG15, pathways of vesicular transport, tight junctions (KIF5A/B/C, OSBPL2, CLTCL1, and ARHGAP17) and ubiquitin modification (UBE2L3/5), as well as reprogramming of host metabolism, transcription and translation. Allicin treatment of infected Calu-3 cells reduced the expression of IFN signaling pathways and ISG effectors and reverted several host pathways to levels of uninfected cells. Allicin further reduced the abundance of the structural viral proteins N, M, S and ORF3 in the host-virus proteome. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the antiviral and immunomodulatory activity of biocompatible doses of allicin in SARS-CoV-2-infected cell cultures.

This virus gradually became the main subtype of PEDV worldwide. However, there were no reports of mild pathogenicity of a variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in China. FINDINGS: In 2013, a PEDV-positive sample from a sow with very mild clinical sign was used to inoculate in Vero cells to isolate the virus. This PEDV field strain, designated FL2013 strain, was successfully propagated and genetically characterized. The phylogenetic trees based upon either the complete genome or S gene showed that the FL2013 strain belongs to the genogroup G2b. The S gene of FL2013 has a 7-aa deletion (FEKVHVQ) in the C-terminus comparison with the other G2 PEDV sequences. Further comparative pathology study indicated that the FL2013 strain had reduced virulence to newborn piglets. CONCLUSIONS: A novel variant PEDV strain FL2013 with reduced virulence, as determined by the pathological study, was identified from east China.

OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a single bout of continuous aerobic exercise on circulating glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations in healthy adults. METHODS CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, Global Health, HMIC, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to May 2020. Papers were included if they reported a randomised, crossover study measuring glucose and/or insulin and/or glucagon concentrations before and immediately after a single bout of continuous aerobic exercise ( 30 min) compared to a time-matched, resting control arm in healthy adults. The risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and GRADE approach, respectively. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed for glucose, insulin, and glucagon. Sub-group meta-analyses and meta-regression were performed for categorical (metabolic state [postprandial or fasted], exercise mode [cycle ergometer or treadmill]) and continuous (age, body mass index, % males, maximal aerobic capacity, exercise duration, exercise intensity) covariates, respectively. RESULTS 42 papers (51 studies) were considered eligible: glucose (45 studies, 391 participants), insulin (38 studies, 377 participants) and glucagon (5 studies, 47 participants). Acute aerobic exercise had no significant effect on glucose concentrations (mean difference: - 0.05 mmol/L; 95% CI, - 0.22 to 0.13 mmol/L; P = 0.589; I2: 91.08%, large heterogeneity; moderate-quality evidence). Acute aerobic exercise significantly decreased insulin concentrations (mean difference: - 18.07 pmol/L; 95% CI, - 30.47 to - 5.66 pmol/L; P = 0.004; I2: 95.39%, large heterogeneity; moderate-quality evidence) and significantly increased glucagon concentrations (mean difference: 24.60 ng/L; 95% CI, 16.25 to 32.95 ng/L; P < 0.001; I2: 79.36%, large heterogeneity; moderate-quality evidence). Sub-group meta-analyses identified that metabolic state modified glucose and insulin responses, in which aerobic exercise significantly decreased glucose (mean difference: - 0.27 mmol/L; 95% CI, - 0.55 to - 0.00 mmol/L; P = 0.049; I2: 89.72%, large heterogeneity) and insulin (mean difference: - 42.63 pmol/L; 95% CI, - 66.18 to - 19.09 pmol/L; P < 0.001; I2: 81.29%, large heterogeneity) concentrations in the postprandial but not fasted state. Meta-regression revealed that the glucose concentrations were also moderated by exercise duration and maximal aerobic capacity. CONCLUSIONS Acute aerobic exercise performed in the postprandial state decreases glucose and insulin concentrations in healthy adults. Acute aerobic exercise also increases glucagon concentrations irrespective of metabolic state. Therefore, aerobic exercise undertaken in the postprandial state is an effective strategy to improve acute glycaemic control in healthy adults, supporting the role of aerobic exercise in reducing cardiometabolic disease incidence.

The biophysics of this process has been studied extensively but the additional role of externally applied force or displacement has generally been neglected. In this work we study the adhesive force-displacement response of viral particles against a cell membrane. We have built two models: one in which the viral particle is cylindrical (say, representative of filamentous virus such as Ebola) and another in which it is spherical (such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika). Our interest is in initial adhesion, in which case deformations are small and the mathematical model for the system can be simplified considerably. The parameters that characterize the process combine into two dimensionless groups that represent normalized membrane bending stiffness and tension. In the limit where bending dominates, for sufficiently large values of normalized bending stiffness, there is no adhesion between viral particles and the cell membrane without applied force. (The zero-external-force contact width and pull-off force are both zero.) For large values of normalized membrane tension, the adhesion between virus and cell membrane is weak but stable. (The contact width at zero external force has a small value.) Our results for pull-off force and zero force contact width help to quantify conditions that could aid the development of therapies based on denying the virus entry into the cell by blocking its initial adhesion.","output":"Adhesive Contact Between Cylindrical (Ebola) and Spherical (SARS-CoV-2) Viral Particles and a Cell Membrane"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is a clinical condition in which symptoms worsen upon assuming and maintaining upright posture and are ameliorated by recumbency. OI has a high prevalence in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Limited data are available to guide the treatment of OI in ME/CFS patients. We and others have previously described patient-reported subjective improvement in symptoms using compression stockings. We hypothesized that these subjective reports would be accompanied by objective hemodynamic improvements. Materials and Methods: We performed a randomized crossover trial in 16 ME/CFS patients. Each underwent two 15-min head-up tilt table tests, one with and one without wearing knee-high compression stockings that provided 20C25 mm Hg compression. The order of the tests was randomized. We measured heart rate and blood pressure as well as cardiac output and cerebral blood flow (CBF) using extracranial Doppler of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. Results: There were no differences in supine measurements between the 2 baseline measurements. There were no differences in heart rate and blood pressure at either end-tilt testing period. Compared to the test with the stockings off, the mean percentage reduction in cardiac output during the test with compression stockings on was lower, 15 (4)% versus 27 (6)% (p < 0.0001), as was the mean percentage CBF reduction, 14 (4)% versus 25 (5)% (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: In ME/CFS patients with orthostatic intolerance symptoms, cardiac output and CBF are significantly reduced during a tilt test.

METHODS: Literature review and expert opinion. SHORT CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing COVID-19, is considered to be transmitted via droplets rather than aerosols, but droplets with strong directional airflow support may spread further than 2 m. High rates of COVID-19 infections in healthcare-workers (HCWs) have been reported from several countries. Respirators such as filtering face piece (FFP) 2 masks were designed to protect HCWs, while surgical masks were originally intended to protect patients (e.g., during surgery). Nevertheless, high quality standard surgical masks (type II/IIR according to European Norm EN 14683) appear to be as effective as FFP2 masks in preventing droplet-associated viral infections of HCWs as reported from influenza or SARS. So far, no head-to-head trials with these masks have been published for COVID-19. Neither mask type completely prevents transmission, which may be due to inappropriate handling and alternative transmission pathways. Therefore, compliance with a bundle of infection control measures including thorough hand hygiene is key. During high-risk procedures, both droplets and aerosols may be produced, reason why respirators are indicated for these interventions.","output":"Risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by aerosols, the rational use of masks, and protection of healthcare workers from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report on an approach to rapidly screen thousands of Salmonella Enteritidis proteins with the goal of identifying novel immunodominant proteins. We used a microarray-based system that warrants high throughput and easy handling. Seven immunogenic candidates were selected after screening. Comparative analyses by ELISA and microarrays manifested their immunodominant character. The large repetitive protein (SEN4030) that plays a role as a putative adhesin in initial cell surface interaction and is highly specific to Salmonella is considered to be the most suitable protein for a diagnostic approach. The results further demonstrate that the strategy applied herein is convenient for specifically identifying immunogenic proteins of pathogenic microorganisms. Consequently, it enables a sound assessment of promising candidates for diagnostic applications and vaccine development. Moreover, the elucidation of immunogenic proteins may assist in unveiling unknown virulence-associated factors, thus furthering the understanding of the underlying pathogenicity of Salmonella in general, and of S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The atypical imaging data of ten patients in our hospital who tested positive for COVID-19 were analyzed retrospectively, and the distribution, morphology, and image evolution of the lesions were analyzed. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed in all cases, and the imaging features were analyzed and summarized by two senior radiologists. RESULTS: Of these ten patients, three were male, and seven were female. The age of these patients ranged from 21-53 years, with an average age of 36.3  3.6. The first symptom was fever in nine cases and dry cough in one case. A total of 17 lesions were detected in these ten patients. Five patients had a single lesion, and five patients had multiple lesions, for a total of 12 lesions. Ten lesions (58.82%) were located in the inferior lobe of the right lung, four lesions (23.53%) in the left inferior lobe, two lesions (11.76%) in the left upper lobe, and one lesion (5.88%) in the right middle lobe. Among the five single lesions, two were solid lesions, two were mixed ground-glass lesions, and one was a pure ground-glass lesion. Among the 12 multiple lesions, eight were solid lesions, two were mixed ground-glass lesions, and two were pure ground-glass lesions. Atypical manifestations in image signs: five lesions (29.41%) had single solid and sub-solid nodules, and four lesions (23.53%) had cavitary nodules. Typical manifestation (the presence of \\"white lung\\"): three lesions (17.65%) had an air bronchogram, two lesions (11.76%) had crazy-paving signs, two lesions (11.76%) had vascular thickening, and one lesion (5.88%) had halo signs.

These were primarily Internal Medicine (IM) patients, and of these, 25C30% were admitted. The present governmental policy presents a deterrent to adding IM beds for these patients, and Emergency and IM departments cope with ever-increasing number of IM patients. We describe a quality improvement intervention to increase outflow of IM patients from the ED to the IM departments. METHODS: We conducted a quality improvement intervention at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center from 2014 to 2018. The first stage consisted of an effort to increase morning discharges from the IM departments. The second stage consisted of establishing a process to increase the number of admissions to the IM departments from the ED. RESULTS: Implementation of the first stage led to an increased morning discharge rate from a baseline of 2C4 to 18%. The second stage led to an immediate mean ( SD) morning transfer of 35  7 patients to the medical departments (8C12 per department), providing significant relief for the ED. However, the additional workload for the IM departments medical and nursing staff led to a rapid decrease in morning discharges, returning to pre-intervention rates. Throughout the period of the new throughput intervention, morning admissions increased from 30 to > 70%, and were sustained. The number of patients in each department increased from 36 to 38 to a new steady state of 42C44, included constant hallway housing, and often midday peaks of 48C50 patients. Mean length of stay did not change. IM physician and nurse dissatisfaction led to increased number of patients being admitted during the evening and night hours and fewer during the morning. CONCLUSION: We describe a quality improvement intervention to improve outflow of medical patients from the ED in the morning hours. The new ED practices had mixed effects. They led to less ED crowding in the morning hours but increased dissatisfaction among the IM department medical and nursing staff due to an increased number of admissions in a limited number of hours. The present governmental reimbursement policy needs to address hospital overcrowding as it relates to limited community healthcare beds and an aging population.","output":"Mixed effect of increasing outflow of medical patients from an emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There is limited research on children infected with Covid-19 after initial diagnosis.

Methods Covid-19 patients age under 18 admitted to the Dokuz Eylul University Hospital, Izmir, Turkey during December 2020 (n = 144) and completed three months follow-up (n = 123) were included in this prospective cohort study. Data on age, sex, parents' educational status, perceived economic status, presence of Covid-19 patient at household, chronic diseases history, initial and existing symptoms and perception of recovery were collected via telephone interviews. Persistent symptom was defined as any symptom reported within a week of the interview. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U Test were used for univariate analyses. Results Out of 124 patients, 89.3% reported a symptom at time of diagnosis, 21.0% at 1st month and 11.4% at the 3rd-month follow-up. Median number of symptoms was 2 at diagnosis, 0 at 1st and the 3rd month. The most common initial symptoms were fever (52.4%), weakness (40.3%), flu like symptoms (25.8%) and cough (24.4%). The most common persistent symptoms by the 1st month were fatigue (5.7%), cough (4.1%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (4.1%), and by the 3rd month were fatigue (2.4%), weakness (2.4%), respiratory symptoms and chest pain (2.4%). 10.6% of the patients were not fully recovered by the 3rd month. Persistent symptoms at the end of 1st month were more common in children with chronic diseases (36.6% vs 13.3%, p = 0.003) and who were not recovered fully (63.6% vs 15.5%, p = 0.001). Parents' education level, perceived economic status, and presence of Covid-19 patients at household were not associated with persisting symptoms. Conclusions COVID-19 symptoms may persist by three months of infection, especially in children with chronic conditions.

Early diagnosis remains challenging because fecal occult blood screening tests have performed sub-optimally, especially due to hemorrhoidal, inflammatory, and vascular diseases, while colonoscopy is invasive and requires a medical setting to be performed. The objective of the present study was to determine if serum metabolomic profiles could be used to develop a novel screening approach for colorectal cancer. Furthermore, the study evaluated the metabolic alterations associated with the disease. Untargeted serum metabolomic profiles were collected from 100 CRC subjects, 50 healthy controls, and 50 individuals with benign colorectal disease. Different machine learning models, as well as an ensemble model based on a voting scheme, were built to discern CRC patients from CTRLs. The ensemble model correctly classified all CRC and CTRL subjects (accuracy = 100%) using a random subset of the cohort as a test set. Relevant metabolites were examined in a metabolite-set enrichment analysis, revealing differences in patients and controls primarily associated with cell glucose metabolism. These results support a potential use of the metabolomic signature as a non-invasive screening tool for CRC. Moreover, metabolic pathway analysis can provide valuable information to enhance understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cancer.

Multivariable regression analyses were conducted comparing demographics, clinical characteristics, and presence of symptoms between patients with long COVID and patients with shorter symptom duration. RESULTS: Long COVID was present in 310/3151 (9.8%) patients with self-diagnosed, clinician-diagnosed, or test-confirmed COVID-19. Only 106/310 (34.2%) long COVID patients had test-confirmed COVID-19. Risk predictors of long COVID were age 40 years (adjusted Odds Ratio [AdjOR]=1.49 [1.05C2.17]), female sex (adjOR=1.37 [1.02C1.85]), frailty (adjOR=2.39 [1.29C4.27]), visit to A&E (adjOR=4.28 [2.31C7.78]), and hospital admission for COVID-19 symptoms (adjOR=3.22 [1.77C5.79]). Aches and pain (adjOR=1.70 [1.21C2.39]), appetite loss (adjOR=3.15 [1.78C5.92]), confusion and disorientation (adjOR=2.17 [1.57C2.99]), diarrhea (adjOR=1.4 [1.03C1.89]), and persistent dry cough (adjOR=2.77 [1.94C3.98]) were symptom features statistically more common in long COVID. CONCLUSION: This study reports the factors and symptom features predicting long COVID in a broad primary care population, including both test-confirmed and the previously missed group of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Risk Predictors and Symptom Features of Long COVID Within a Broad Primary Care Patient Population Including Both Tested and Untested Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic gave rise to management approaches using mobile apps for contact tracing The corresponding apps track individuals and their interactions, to facilitate alerting users of potential infections well before they become infectious themselves Na?ve implementation obviously jeopardizes the privacy of health conditions, location, activities, and social interaction of its users A number of protocol designs for colocation tracking have already been developed, most of which claim to function in a privacy preserving manner However, despite claims such as GDPR compliance, anonymity, pseudonymity or other forms of privacy, the authors of these designs usually neglect to precisely define what they (aim to) protect We make a first step towards formally defining the privacy notions of proximity tracing services, especially with regards to the health, (co-)location, and social interaction of their users We also give a high-level intuition of which protection the most prominent proposals likely can and cannot achieve This initial overview indicates that all proposals include some centralized services, and none protects identity and (co-)locations of infected users perfectly from both other users and the service provider","output":"Covid notions: Towards formal definitions C and documented understanding C of privacy goals and claimed protection in proximity-tracing services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the first time in over a hundred years, the world faces a devastating pandemic Millions have been infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus and thousands have died Unprecedented global shortages of protective equipment have resulted in the infection and death of healthcare workers The legal and ethical duty of a doctor to treat during a pandemic has evolved over time, shaped by legislation and ethical guidance following SARS and the September 11 terrorism attacks A positive ethical obligation to treat is arguably outweighed by the inability to meet occupational safety standards and high risk of personal harm, in addition to a physician?s competing duties to future patients, their families and colleagues Nevertheless, individuals who continue working should be acknowledged by society with accessible worker?s compensation, alternative accommodation, hazard pay and student debt forgiveness so that healthcare workers continue to serve patients, answering far beyond the call of duty","output":"Unmasked: A comparative analysis of the physicians ethical and legal duty to treat during a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a Paramyxovirus known to cause acute respiratory tract infections in children and young adults. To date, there is no study from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia determining the proportion and severity of hMPV infection among pediatric hospitalized patients with respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine the presence of hMPV antigens in the nasopharyngeal secretions of pediatric patients hospitalized with respiratory tract infections in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, serological hospital-based study included all pediatric patients who were admitted to Aseer Central Hospital, Abha, Saudi Arabia, from July 2016 to November 2017 with upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Basic demographics of patients and their clinical data on and after admission were recorded. Direct fluorescent antibody assay was used to detect the presence of hMPV antigens in the obtained nasopharyngeal secretion specimens. RESULTS: During the study, 91 pediatric patients were hospitalized due to upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections, of which 9.9% were positive for hMPV. These patients were aged 9 months to 16 years, were from Abha city or its surrounding localities and were mostly (77.8%) hospitalized during autumn or winter. The most common diagnosis on admission was bronchopneumonia (55.5%) and aspiration pneumonia (22.2%), and some patients also had underlying chronic conditions such as chronic heart disease (22.2%) and bronchial asthma (11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained indicated that hMPV is a potential etiologic factor for the commonly occurring acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. hMPV infection was also found to be associated with complicated respiratory conditions such as bronchopneumonia, chronic heart disease and bronchial asthma.","output":"Human metapneumovirus in Pediatric Patients with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in the Aseer Region of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article demonstrates how a public research university library responded to user needs following radical service changes during Fall 2020 and assesses whether the library met challenges resulting from COVID-19.

In particular, we define several notions of randomness associated with interval, rather than precise, forecasting systems, and study their properties. The richer mathematical structure that thus arises lets us, amongst other things, better understand and place existing results for the precise limit. When we focus on constant interval forecasts, we find that every sequence of binary outcomes has an associated filter of intervals it is random for. It may happen that none of these intervals is precise -- a single real number -- which justifies the title of this paper. We illustrate this by showing that randomness associated with non-stationary precise forecasting systems can be captured by a constant interval forecast, which must then be less precise: a gain in model simplicity is thus paid for by a loss in precision. But imprecise randomness can't always be explained away as a result of oversimplification: we show that there are sequences that are random for a constant interval forecast, but never random for any {\\\\comp} (more) precise forecasting system. We also show that the set of sequences that are random for a non-vacuous interval forecasting system is meagre, as it is for precise forecasting systems.","output":"Randomness is inherently imprecise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Allostatic load refers to the cumulative burden of chronic stress and life events. It involves the interaction of different physiological systems at varying degrees of activity. When environmental challenges exceed the individual ability to cope, then allostatic overload ensues. Allostatic load is identified by the use of biomarkers and clinical criteria. OBJECTIVE To summarize the current knowledge on allostatic load and overload and its clinical implications based on a systematic review of the literature. METHODS PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to December 2019. A manual search of the literature was also performed, and reference lists of the retrieved articles were examined.We considered only studies in which allostatic load or overload were adequately described and assessed in either clinical or non-clinical adult populations. RESULTS A total of 267 original investigations were included. They encompassed general population studies, as well as clinical studies on consequences of allostatic load/overload on both physical and mental health across a variety of settings. CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that allostatic load and overload are associated with poorer health outcomes. Assessment of allostatic load provides support to the understanding of psychosocial determinants of health and lifestyle medicine. An integrated approach that includes both biological markers and clinimetric criteria is recommended.","output":"Allostatic Load and Its Impact on Health: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited information is available on the decay rate of endogenous SARS-CoV-2 and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA in wastewater and primary settled solids, potentially limiting an understanding of how transit or holding times within wastewater infrastructure might impact RNA measurements and their relationship to community COVID-19 infections. In this study, primary settled solids samples were collected from two wastewater treatment plants in the San Francisco Bay Area. Samples were thoroughly mixed, aliquoted into subsamples, and stored at 4, 22, and 37 C for 10 days. The concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 targets) and PMMoV RNA were measured using an RT-ddPCR. Limited decay (<1 log10 reduction) was observed in the detection of viral RNA targets at all temperature conditions, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV RNA can be highly persistent in solids. First-order decay rate constants ranged from 0.011 to 0.098 dayC1 for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and from 0.010 to 0.091 dayC1 for PMMoV RNA depending on the temperature conditions. A slower decay was observed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in primary settled solids compared to previously reported decay in wastewater influent. Further research is needed to understand if solid content and wastewater characteristics might influence the persistence of viral RNA targets.

The uncontrolled release of cytokines is seen from the primary stages of symptoms to last acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, it is necessary to find out safe and effective drugs against this deadly coronavirus as soon as possible. Here, we downloaded the three-dimensional model of NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase (PDB-ID: 6w6l) and main protease (PDB-ID: 6lu7) of COVID-19. Using these molecular models, we performed virtual screening with our anti-viral, inti-infectious, and anti-protease compounds, which are attractive therapeutics to prevent infection of the COVID-19. We found that top screened compound binds with protein molecules with good dock score with the help of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. We observed that protease complexed with Cyclocytidine hydrochloride (anti-viral and anti-cancer), Trifluridine (anti-viral), Adonitol, and Meropenem (anti-bacterial), and Penciclovir (anti-viral) bound with a good docking score ranging from ?6.8 to ?5.1 (Kcal/mol). Further, NSP10/NSP16 methyltransferase complexed with Telbivudine, Oxytetracycline dihydrate (anti-viral), Methylgallate (anti-malarial), 2-deoxyglucose and Daphnetin (anti-cancer) from the docking score of ?7.0 to ?5.7 (Kcal/mol). In conclusion, the selected compounds may be used as a novel therapeutic agent to combat this deadly pandemic disease, SARS-CoV-2 infection, but needs further experimental research.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze gender differences in state anxiety, daily functional self-actualization, and functional cognition and relationships among those factors in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: We collected online data from a sample of 204 people (102 men and 102 women) aged 60 years and older. In addition to a demographic questionnaire, we used the State-Trait Personality Inventory to assess state anxiety, Daily Functional Actualization questionnaire to evaluate daily functional self-actualization, and Daily Living Questionnaire (DLQ) to measure functional cognition. RESULTS: Significant gender differences were found for state anxiety, t202=-2.36, P=.02; daily functional self-actualization, t202=2.15, P=.03; and the functional cognition components: complex tasks, Z=-3.07, P=.002; cognitive symptoms that might be interfering, Z=-2.15, P=.028; executive functions, Z=-2.21, P=.024; and executive function monitoring, Z=-2.21, P=.027. Significant medium correlations were found between both state anxiety level and daily functional self-actualization (r=-.62, P<.001) and functional cognition (r=.37-.40, P<.001). Gender predicted 3%, while daily functional self-actualization predicted 41%, and complex activities (DLQ) an additional 3% of the variance in state anxiety level, F3,202=9.57, P=.01. CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, anxiety is associated with cognitive decline, which may harm daily functional abilities and lead to social isolation, loneliness, and decreased well-being.

The airborne carrier for the COVID-19 can be tiny droplets and particulates from infected person, fine suspended mists (humidity) in air, or ambient aerosols in air. To-date, unfortunately there are no test standards for nano-aerosols (100 nm). A goal in our study is to develop air filters (e.g. respirator, facemask, ventilator, medical breathing filter/system) with 90% capture on 100-nm airborne COVID-19 with pressure drop of less than 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). There are two challenges. First, this airborne bio-nanoaerosol (combined virus and carrier) is amorphous unlike cubic NaCl crystals. Second, unlike standard laboratory tests on NaCl and test oil (DOP) droplets, these polydispersed aerosols all challenge the filter simultaneously and they are of different sizes and can interact among themselves complicating the filtration process. For the first time, we have studied these two effects using ambient aerosols (simulating the bio-nanoaerosols of coronavirus plus carrier of different shapes and sizes) to challenge electrostatically charged multilayer/multimodule nanofiber filters. This problem is fundamentally complicated due to mechanical and electrostatic interactions among aerosols of different sizes with induced charges of different magnitudes. The test filters were arranged in 2, 4, and 6 multiple-modules stack-up with each module having 0.765 g/m 2of charged PVDF nanofibers (mean diameter 525  191 nm). This configuration minimized electrical interference among neighboring charged nanofibers and reduced flow resistance in the filter. For ambient aerosol size&gt;80 nm (applicable to the smallest COVID-19), the electrostatic effect contributes 100C180% more efficiency to the existing mechanical efficiency (due to diffusion and interception) depending on the number of modules in the filter. By stacking-up modules to increase fiber basis weight in the filter, a 6-layer charged nanofiber filter achieved 88%, 88% and 96% filtration efficiency for, respectively, 55-nm, 100-nm and 300-nm ambient aerosol. This is very close to attaining our set goal of 90%-efficiency on the 100-nm ambient aerosol. The pressure drop for the 6-layer nanofiber filter was only 26 Pa (2.65 mm water column) which was below our limit of 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). For the test multi-module filters, a high quality factor (efficiency-to-pressure-drop ratio) of about 0.1 to 0.13 Pa ?1can be consistently maintained, which was far better than conventional filters. Using the same PVDF 6-layer charged nanofiber filter, laboratory tests results using monodispersed NaCl aerosols of 50, 100, and 300 nm yielded filtration efficiency, respectively, 92%, 94% and 98% (qualified for 'N98 standard') with same pressure drop of 26 Pa. The 2C6% discrepancy in efficiency for the NaCl aerosols was primarily attributed to the absence of interaction among aerosols of different sizes using monodispersed NaCl aerosols in the laboratory. This discrepancy can be further reduced with increasing number of modules in the filter and for larger 300-nm aerosol. The 6-layer charged nanofiber filter was qualified as a 'N98 respirator' (98% capture efficiency for 300-nm NaCl aerosols) but with pressure drop of only 2.65-mm water which was 1/10 below conventional N95 with 25-mm (exhaling) to 35-mm (inhaling) water column! The 6-layer charged PVDF nanofiber filter provides good personal protection against airborne COVID-19 virus and nano-aerosols from pollution based on the N98 standard, yet it is at least 10X more breathable than a conventional N95 respirator.","output":"Charged PVDF multilayer nanofiber filter in filtering simulated airborne novel coronavirus (COVID-19) using ambient nano-aerosols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have shown previously that transplanted bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC), which are a cell fraction rich in hematopoietic stem cells, can activate cerebral endothelial cells via gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction. In the present study, we investigated such cell-cell interaction between mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and cerebral endothelial cells. In contrast to BM-MNC, for MSC we observed suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor uptake into endothelial cells and transfer of glucose from endothelial cells to MSC in vitro. The transfer of such a small molecule from MSC to vascular endothelium was subsequently confirmed in vivo and was followed by suppressed activation of macrophage/microglia in stroke mice. The suppressive effect was absent by blockade of gap junction at MSC. Furthermore, gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction was observed between circulating white blood cells and MSC. Our findings indicate that gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction is one of the major pathways for MSC-mediated suppression of inflammation in the brain following stroke and provides a novel strategy to maintain the blood-brain barrier in injured brain. Furthermore, our current results have the potential to provide a novel insight for other ongoing clinical trials that make use of MSC transplantation aiming to suppress excess inflammation, as well as other diseases such as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).","output":"Gap junction-mediated cell-cell interaction between transplanted mesenchymal stem cells and vascular endothelium in stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The possibility of contamination of human skin by infectious virions plays an important role in indirect transmission of respiratory viruses but little is known about the fundamental physico-chemical aspects of the virus-skin interactions.

Here, we perform all atomic simulations between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and human skin models. We consider an oily skin covered by sebum and a clean skin exposing the stratum corneum. The simulations show that the spike tries to maximize the contacts with stratum corneum lipids, particularly ceramides, with substantial hydrogen bonding. In the case of oily skin, the spike is able to retain its structure, orientation and hydration over sebum with little interaction with sebum components. Comparison of these results with our previous simulations of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike with hydrophilic and hydrophobic solid surfaces, suggests that thesoft or hard nature of the surface plays an essential role in the interaction of the spike protein with materials.","output":"Interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and human skin models: a molecular dynamics study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To mark the 25th anniversary of the journal, each issue in 2020 will include an interview with a healthcare thought leader.

The team, importantly, involved partners with lived and/or professional experience of the conflict as well as alumni of the course and educators in all stages of design and delivery through to marking and project evaluation. The project experimented with disrupting power dynamics and extending ownership of the curriculum beyond traditional faculty by codesigning and codelivering module contents together with colleagues with direct expertise and experience of the Syrian context. An authentic approach was applied to assessment design using real-time syndromic healthcare data from the Aleppo and Idlib Governorates. We discuss the challenges involved in our collaborative partnership and describe how it may have enhanced the validity of our curriculum with students engaging in a richer representation of key health issues in the conflict. We observed an enhanced self-reflexivity in the students approach to quantitative data and its complex interpretation. The dialogic nature of this collaborative design was also a formative process for partners and an opportunity for GH educators to reflect on their own positionality.

It was collected via face-by-face in a twelve-month period (2019), and 2586 valid data were collected for SPSS statistic accordingly. RESULTS: Besides the significance of the functional medical treatment values (such as the treatment effectiveness, accurate price, standardization, and normalization), the emotional values (reasonable waiting time, convenient accessibility, communication with doctors/nurses) were significant in patients' consciousness. Patient medical treatment seeking preferences were affected by patients' background characteristics and perceived value, which consequently produced differentiated patients' satisfaction. Patients' characteristics, which related to the age, gender, illness conditions, educational, and income level, would have different demanding in medical treatment seeking. These young female patients in outpatient or in mild illness conditions with higher educational and income levels tend to be relatively high in timing and convenience demanding.

Importantly, hamsters and the human Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme-2-transgenic mice immunized with SpiN were highly resistant to challenge with the wild type SARS-CoV-2, as indicated by viral load, clinical outcome, lung inflammation and lethality. This protective immunity was dependent of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, but not by transfer of antibody of vaccinated mice. Thus, our experiment provides an example T cell-mediated immunity and reinforce the concept that T cell target antigens other that the S protein maybe considered to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and eventually circumvent the immune scape by variants.","output":"Neutralizing antibody-independent immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in Syrian hamsters and human ACE-2 transgenic mice immunized with a RBD/Nucleocapsid fusion protein (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the 2018 advisory opinion concerning the realignment of healthcare, it is advocated that in order to relieve pressure on emergency departments (ED) prehospital medical emergency services should be given the option to directly transport suitable patients to doctors offices. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of patients treated by prehospital emergency services that have the potential to be directly allocated to a primary care provider. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preclinical and clinical data of adult patients who in a 2-month period were transported to the ED of a university hospital by an ambulance were evaluated. To determine a safe and meaningful transport directly to a doctors office, a stepwise assessment was carried out: patients were categorized on the basis of the prehospital assessment of urgency as urgent (contact to doctor necessary within a maximum time of 30 min) and less urgent (contact to doctor not necessary within 30 min, maximum 120 min). Less urgent patients were further divided and those treated as outpatients were identified. This group was further restricted to cases whose administrative reception in the ED was documented MondayCFriday between 8 am and 7 pm. In addition, these cases were further differentiated with regard to medical content and compared with the triage results in the ED (Manchester Triage, MTS). RESULTS: In all, 1260 patients were brought to the ED by ambulance within the study period (total number of patients treated in this time period n = 11,506); 894 cases had a documented prehospital level of urgency and could therefore be included. Of these n = 477 (53.4%) were categorized as less urgent; 317 (66.5%) of these less urgent cases were treated as outpatients in the ED, and n = 114 (23.9%) in a time frame potentially suitable for direct transport to doctors offices, which is 1% of all patients treated in the ED in the time period examined. However, 70 of the cases suitable for doctors office (63.6% of n = 110 with documented MTS) were rated more urgent in the ED. With regards to prehospital complaints and documented diagnosis we assume employment of a relevant amount of resources in the treatment of these cases. CONCLUSIONS: EDs could be relieved from every tenth patient brought in by prehospital emergency services (1% of all patients treated) during normal offices hours by direct allocation to doctors offices. Regarding patients safety this process however has to be seen critically as > 60% of these cases were potentially undertriaged. Necessary resources for diagnostics and treatment have to be available in the doctors offices and known to prehospital emergency services. Primary assignment of patients to doctors offices by prehospital emergency can only relieve urban EDs to a negligible extent, is potentially dangerous and linked to a tremendous logistic effort.","output":"Mit dem Rettungsdienst direkt in die Arztpraxis C eine wirkungsvolle Entlastung der Notaufnahmen?: Analyse von notfallmedizinischen Routinedaten aus Pr?klinik und Klinik"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SINgapore GERiatric intervention study to reduce cognitive decline and physical frailty (SINGER) randomised controlled trial (RCT) uses a multidomain lifestyle interventions approach, shown to be effective by the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) trial, to delay cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of the SINGER multidomain lifestyle interventions in older adults at risk for dementia to delay cognitive decline. PARTICIPANTS: 1200 participants between 60C77 years old, with Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) dementia risk score 6, fulfilling at least one of the following LIBRA index for diet, cognitive activity, physical activity and a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score 18, 27 points, will be recruited across Singapore. METHODS: SINGER is a 2-year multi-site RCT consisting of multidomain interventions: dietary advice, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk factors management. Participants will be randomised into either the Self-Guided Intervention (SGI; general lifestyle and health information and resources) or Structured Lifestyle Intervention (SLI) group. The SLI comprises diet training (6 group and 3 individual sessions over 12 months); exercise (supervised: 1-hour twice weekly for 6 months, unsupervised: 2C3/week for the rest of the study duration); cognitive sessions (15C30 minutes/session, 3/week for 6 months, together with 10 workshops in 24 months). Vascular management takes place every 3C6 months or otherwise as specified by study physicians. The primary outcome is global cognition measured using the modified Neuropsychological Battery assessing performance in various domains, such as episodic memory, executive function and processing speed. Secondary outcome measures include: domain-specific cognition and function, imaging evidence of brain and retinal changes, incidence and progression of chronic diseases, blood biomarkers, quality of life, mental health and cost-benefit analysis. CONCLUSIONS: SINGER is part of the Worldwide-FINGERS international network, which is at the forefront of harmonizing approaches to effective non-pharmacological interventions in delaying cognitive decline in older adults at risk of dementia. By establishing the efficacy of multidomain interventions in preventing cognitive decline, SINGER aims to implement the findings into public health and clinical practices by informing policy makers, and guiding the design of community- and individual-level health promotion initiatives.

To date, few SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes have been described. Internal viral proteins are typically more conserved than surface proteins and are often the target of CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we have characterised eight peptides derived from the internal SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01, the most common HLA molecule in the global population. We determined not all peptides could form a complex with HLA-A*02:01, and the six crystal structures determined revealed that some peptides adopted a mobile conformation. We therefore provide a molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell epitopes. Furthermore, we show that there is limited pre-existing CD8+ T cell response towards these epitopes in unexposed individuals. Together, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid might not contain potent epitopes restricted to HLA-A*02:01.","output":"The presentation of SARS-CoV-2 peptides by the common HLA-A*02:01 molecule"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nutraceuticals are defined as foods or their extracts that have a demonstrably positive effect on human health According to the decision of the European Food Safety Authority, this positive effect, the so-called health claim, must be clearly demonstrated best by performed tests Nutraceuticals include dietary supplements and functional foods These special foods thus affect human health and can positively affect the immune system and strengthen it even in these turbulent times, when the human population is exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic Many of these special foods are supplemented with nanoparticles of active substances or processed into nanoformulations The benefits of nanoparticles in this case include enhanced bioavailability, controlled release, and increased stability Lipid-based delivery systems and the encapsulation of nutraceuticals are mainly used for the enrichment of food products with these health-promoting compounds This contribution summarizes the current state of the research and development of effective nanonutraceuticals influencing the body&rsquo;s immune responses, such as vitamins (C, D, E, B12, folic acid), minerals (Zn, Fe, Se), antioxidants (carotenoids, coenzyme Q10, polyphenols, curcumin), omega-3 fatty acids, and probiotics","output":"Potential of Nanonutraceuticals in Increasing Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March of 2020, state governments in the United States began implementing stay-at-home orders in an attempt to curtail the spread of COVID-19. As a result, most people experienced a decrease in face-to-face interactions as they limited their participation in social gatherings, travel, and in-person work. Although these orders aimed to stop the spread of COVID-19, a potential unintended consequence of these guidelines was an increase in loneliness, which has several negative mental and physical health consequences. The goals of the present study were to investigate the extent that ones romantic relationship status and living arrangements affected self-reports of loneliness and to track how self-reports of loneliness changed over the span of 1 month following the first stay-at-home orders in the United States. Participants (&lt;italic&gt;N&lt;/italic&gt; = 311) reported their loneliness at three time points in 2-week intervals. Results showed considerable overlap between living arrangements and romantic relationship status in predicting loneliness;however, it appears that living with another person has a greater protective effect against loneliness compared to relationship status. That is, whereas living with others or being in a romantic relationship both predicted lower loneliness scores, ones living arrangements accounted for variance in loneliness scores beyond what was accounted for by ones relationship status. The researcher also explored whether loneliness increased across three time points throughout data collection. Results showed that loneliness levels remained approximately the same across time. An unhypothesized interaction effect did emerge between time and age. Subsequent probing of this interact effects showed that young adults experienced the greatest level of loneliness but this loneliness decreased over the month, whereas older adults experienced less loneliness but experienced a small increase in loneliness over the during this time. Together, these results suggest that certain groups of people were more likely to experience loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Of them, the placental pathological characteristics of five participants were evaluated following the standard guidelines. Two of them chose induced labour due to being worry about the potential adverse effects of medical treatment for COVID-19 by themselves. For the others, 8 gave birth by cesarean section with certain indications and 2 by vaginal delivery. Their neonates were all live birth with &#8805; 37 gestational weeks and high Apgar scores of 9 a 10. For the neonate related biological samples, they all have negative results of RNA test, including nasopharyngeal swab, umbilical cord blood, amniotic fluid, vaginal fluid, placenta, or umbilical cord. Most of other pathological indicators of placental examination suggested no abnormal syndromes. Overall, we did not find any abnormal pregnancy complications and neonatal outcomes among them. We concluded that excess adverse effect on the fetus development due to COVID-19 in the recovered pregnant women should be less influential, especially, induce abortion due to the anxiety of COVID-19 treatment should be not advisable.","output":"No obviously adverse pregnancy complications and outcomes of the recovered pregnant women from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on major agricultural commodity prices (cattle, cocoa, coffee, corn, cotton, hog, rice, soya oil, soybeans, soybean meal, sugar and wheat) using daily data from February 28, 2020 to November 20, 2020. We measured COVID-19 effect using a news-based sentiment index. A novel nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test was used to test the effect of the COVID-19 sentiment on agricultural commodity prices and price volatility. We found significant causality from the news-based COVID-19 sentiment to mean of the agricultural commodity prices in the lower and upper ranges of the quantiles, but not in the quantiles around the median, implying that the COVID-19 sentiment largely causes extreme changes in the agricultural commodity prices. Moreover, findings show that the COVID-19 sentiment is also causal for variance of agricultural commodity prices, but only above the quantile ranges above the first quarter. Thus, COVID-19 is causal for large volatility changes in agricultural commodity prices. Accordingly, the extremely negative sentiment associated with COVID-19 has not only caused a price crash in agricultural markets, but also significantly increased market risk.","output":"The COVID-19 Effects on Agricultural Commodity Markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Group testing is a widely used protocol which aims to test a small group of people to identify whether at least one of them is infected.

Method: A short course, including an introductory lecture and a three component competency based assessment exercise testing student's knowledge and ability in infection control measures was incorporated into the previously established training programme. The assessment exercises included a written test of students knowledge of the Infection Control Policy, a unit management exercise and a hand hygiene assessment. The infection control competency was initially incorporated into the final term of the second year in 2004 and is now an established part of the 5\\\\year dental undergraduate degree programme. Re\\\\assessments were scheduled (at the start of third year) for students failing to meet the required standard as successful completion of this course was compulsory prior to students being allowed to treat their first patients. Student performance over the last 2 years on this course and during their first year on clinic were analysed to determine potential improvements in student knowledge and application in infection control. Examination results from the year 3, infection control spot test were compared with those of earlier years. In addition, the opinions, as assessed by questionnaire analysis, of dental staff and students on the infection control competency were obtained. Results: All students successfully completed the infection control competency (either at first or second attempt) and were subsequently allowed to enter clinical training in year 3. Significant improvements were seen in students passing the course at their initial attempt, 42% and 78%, in the 2004 and 2005 academic years, respectively. Also subsequent testing of these students during their first year on clinic showed marked increases in awareness and knowledge of the infection control protocols.

However, a few studies have examined mental health conditions in this population. We employed a qualitative approach to understand the factors perceived as causes of burn-out and embitterment among temporary FHWs to provide recommendations for supporting the workforce. METHODS: We recruited 20 FHWs to participate in semistructured focus group interviews through purposive sampling. The sample size was determined on the basis of data saturation. We collected data from October to November 2020, audiorecording and transcribing the interviews. Data analysis was conducted manually, applying the principles of grounded theory. RESULTS: Five levels of perceived sources of occupational burn-out and embitterment emerged. FHWs showed considerable mistrust of patients and faced ethical dilemmas in accessing and disclosing personal information. Poor collaboration with community health centre workers and interested parties as well as inadequate organisational support aggravated their conditions. Lack of social recognition and employment instability also presented challenges for FHWs mental health. CONCLUSIONS: The current pandemic response system imposes great moral and emotional burdens on the workforce, prompting the need for initiatives to safeguard the values and needs of those who represent the backbone of the system. This study suggests that multilevel strategies, including providing organisational support and establishing contingency plans for workforce management and resource distribution, may improve FHWs mental health outcomes as well as the health system for emergency preparedness.","output":"Perceived sources of occupational burn-out and embitterment among front-line health workers for COVID-19 control in Gyeonggi province, South Korea: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 disease has a worse prognosis in patients with diabetes, but comparative data about the course of COVID-19 in patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are lacking. The purpose of this study was to find out the relative clinical severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients with T1DM and T2DM. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A nationwide retrospective cohort of patients with conrmed (PCR positive) COVID-19 infection (n = 149,671) was investigated. After exclusion of individuals with unspecified diabetes status, the adverse outcomes between patients with T1DM (n = 163), T2DM (n = 33,478) and those without diabetes (n = 115,108) were compared by using the propensity score matching method. The outcomes were hospitalization, the composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or mechanical ventilation, and mortality. RESULTS: The patients with T1DM had higher mortality than the age- and gender-matched patients with T2DM (n = 489) and those without diabetes (n = 489) (p < 0.001). After further adjustment for the HbA1c, and microvascular and macrovascular complications, the odds of mortality (OR: 3.35, 95% CI: 1.41-7.96, p = 0.006) and ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.28-6.77, p = 0.011) were significantly higher in patients with T1DM compared to those with T2DM.

Almost all of these vaccines have been designed to induce antibodies targeting spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in expectation of neutralizing activities. However, non-neutralizing antibodies are at risk of causing antibody-dependent enhancement. Further, the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is very short. Therefore, in addition to antibody-induced vaccines, novel vaccines on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be considered in the vaccine development. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-two peptides were firstly predicted as epitope candidates on bioinformatics. Fifty-four in 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were CTL epitopes because of the induction of IFN-?3-producing CD8+ T cells. In the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10 peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides. There were three response patterns, suggesting the existence of an immunodominance hierarchy following peptide vaccination, which may provide us more variations in the epitope selection for designing CTL-based COVID-19 vaccines.IMPORTANCE For the development of vaccines based on SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2.

It was shown to exhibit significant resistance to neutralization by serum not only from convalescent patients, but also from individuals receiving currently used COVID-19 vaccines with multiple booster shots. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop next generation vaccines against VOCs like Omicron. In this study, we develop a panel of mRNA-LNP-based vaccines using the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Omicron and Delta variants, which are dominant in the current wave of COVID-19. In addition to the Omicron- and Delta-specific vaccines, the panel also includes a Hybrid vaccine that uses the RBD containing all 16 point-mutations shown in Omicron and Delta RBD, as well as a bivalent vaccine composed of both Omicron and Delta RBD-LNP in half dose. Interestingly, both Omicron-specific and Hybrid RBD-LNP elicited extremely high titer of neutralizing antibody against Omicron itself, but few to none neutralizing antibody against other SARS-CoV-2 variants.

In the DIF images, the deposition appearances and locations of immunoglobulin on glomeruli involve immunological characteristics of glomerulonephritis and thus can be used to aid in the identification of glomerulonephritis disease. Manual classification to such deposition patterns is time consuming and may lead to significant inter and intra operator variances. We wanted to automate the identification and fusion of deposition location and deposition appearance to assist physicians in achieving immunofluorescence reporting. METHODS In this paper, we propose a framework that consists of a pre-segmentation module and a classification module for automatically segmenting glomerulus object and classifying the deposition pattern of immunoglobulin on glomerulus object. For the pre-segmentation module, the glomerulus object is segmented out from the acquired DIF images using a segmentation network, which excludes other tissues and makes the classification module focus on the glomerulus. For the classification module, two branches of classifying deposition region and appearance, respectively, are formed by using multiple attentions convolutional neural network (MANet) based on the segmented images, and the classification results of the two pre-trained classification networks are fused with labels. RESULTS Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a high classification performance with an accuracy of 98% and 95% in terms of deposition region and appearance, respectively. The label fusion of deposition appearance and deposition classification is achieved with high accuracy based on well-trained classification.

Given the fact that numerous systematic reviews already exist on yoga and mental health, it becomes vital to undertake an overview on the same. The objective of the overview was to summarise the evidence from different systematic reviews of distinct yoga interventions used to improve mental health and recommend yoga practices for the same. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020185221). MEDLINE via Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Google Scholar were searched for relevant literature. Search terms used were \\"Yoga practice, mental health and systematic review\\". Reviews from earliest possible date till May 2020, including those examining the effects of any single or combination of yoga interventions on mental health reported on children, youth and adults were selected. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool was used to evaluate the evidence of the included reviews. Out of the 90 reviews found, eight unique reviews were selected for the overview. Overall, 243 studies were analyzed, with an overlap of only 6 studies across the reviews.

Because sleep is one of the endogenous drives that impacts short and long-term health and well-being, it is important to consider how social isolation during the COVID-19 government-mandated quarantines affected sleep and sleep habits. A number of researchers have addressed this question during the last 2 years by examining several concepts related to possible changes in sleep during the quarantines. To best understand these recent results, the current mini review provides a background on the pre-pandemic literature on the effects of social isolation and loneliness with a focus on sleep and then summarizes the recent literature on sleep and sleep habits. In general, sleep was negatively impacted for many people during the pandemics but not all. One group that seemed to benefit from the pandemic in terms of sleep patterns, were younger people who could more easily adapt their sleep times to match their internal chronobiology. Given the potential broad impact of sleep on health and well-being, better understanding how social isolation impacts sleep is an important consideration for individuals, work organizations, and governments.","output":"Social Isolation and Sleep: Manifestation During COVID-19 Quarantines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The attenuation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, at least in Italy, allows a gradual resumption of diagnostic and therapeutic activities for sleep respiratory disorders. The knowledge on this new disorder is growing fast, but our experience is still limited and when a physician cannot rely on evidence-based medicine, the experience of his peers can support the decision-making and operational process of reopening sleep laboratories. The aim of this paper is to focus on the safety of patients and operators accessing hospitals and the practice of diagnosing and treating sleep-related respiratory disorders. The whole process requires a careful plan, starting with a triage preceding the access to the facility, to minimize the risk of infection. Preparation of the medical record can be performed through standard questionnaires administered over the phone or by e-mail, including an assessment of the COVID-19 risk. The home sleep test should include single-patient sensors or easy-to-sanitize material. The use of nasal cannulas is discouraged in view of the risk of the virus colonizing the internal reading chamber, since no filter has been tested and certified to be used extensively for coronavirus due to its small size. The adaptation to positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment can also be performed mainly using telemedicine procedures. In the adaptation session, the mask should be new or correctly sanitized and the PAP device, without a humidifier, should be protected by an antibacterial/antiviral filter, then sanitized and reassigned after at least 4 days since SARS-CoV-2 was detected on some surfaces up to 72 h after. Identification of pressure should preferably be performed by telemedicine. The patient should be informed of the risk of spreading the disease in the family environment through droplets and how to reduce this risk. The follow-up phase can again be performed mainly by telemedicine both for problem solving and the collection of data. Public access to hospital should be minimized and granted to patients only. Constant monitoring of institutional communications will help in implementing the necessary recommendations.","output":"Sleep Breathing Disorders in the COVID-19 Era: Italian Thoracic Society Organizational Models for a Correct Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, because of the downturn of the global economy, the energy sector asked for the lowest prices for its products. Consequently, investors may not be willing to invest for the renewable energy projects in the short term after the pandemic. Therefore, every possible effort should be done in the post-pandemic era not to lose the clean energy gains of the recent history. Iranian bakeries are among the most energy consuming bakeries in the world and produce 15 million t of bread annually. Three different scenarios are suggested in the present study to make it possible to save 45%, i.e., 105 MJ t(-1) year(-1), of energy and increase the cumulative degree of perfection of the traditional bread-making processes by approximately 37%. These suggestions may increase the renewability indicator of the traditional bread-making sector by about 70%.

Among the three RLRs encoded by the human genome, RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, which contain N-terminal caspase recruitment domains, are activated upon the detection of viral RNAs in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells. Activated RLRs induce downstream signaling via their interactions with mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins and activate the production of type I and III interferons and inflammatory cytokines. Recent studies have shown that RLR-mediated signaling is regulated by interactions with endogenous RNAs and host proteins, such as those involved in stress responses and posttranslational modifications. Since RLR-mediated cytokine production is also involved in the regulation of acquired immunity, the deregulation of RLR-mediated signaling is associated with autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Moreover, RLR-mediated signaling might be involved in the aberrant cytokine production observed in coronavirus disease 2019. Since the discovery of RLRs in 2004, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the activation and regulation of RLR-mediated signaling pathways. Here, we review the recent advances in the understanding of regulated RNA recognition and signal activation by RLRs, focusing on the interactions between various host and viral factors.","output":"Regulation of RIG-I-like receptor-mediated signaling: interaction between host and viral factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Involvement of the large vessels is rarely reported and poorly understood in cases of Corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to present a series of cases with large vessel thrombosis (LVT). METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective case series study. The participants were consecutive in order. All the patients were diagnosed as cases of COVID-19 with documented LVT were included in the study. Large vessels were defined as any vessel equal or larger than popliteal artery. The mean duration of follow up was 4 months. RESULTS: The study included 22 cases, 19 (86.4%) cases were male, 3 (13.6%) patients were females. The age ranged from 23 to 76 with a mean of 48.4 years. Four (18.2%) cases had pulmonary embolism confirmed by IV contrast enhanced chest CT scan. All of the cases showed pulmonary parenchymal ground glass opacities (GGO) and high D-Dimers (ranging from 1267 to 6038 ng/ml with a mean of 3601 ng/ml). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a hidden risk factor of LVT that may endanger the patient's life and lead to major amputation. Despite therapeutic anticoagulants still all COVID-19 patient are at risk for LVT, a high index of suspicion should be created and with minimal symptoms surgical consultation should be obtained.","output":"Large vessel thrombosis in patient with COVID-19, a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(Full story doi:10 1136/bmj m2156) Benzodiazepines may link to ectopic pregnancy The risk of an ectopic pregnancy was 50% higher in women who had filled out a prescription for benzodiazepines in the 90 days before conception, in a large observational study published in Human Reproduction 3 Researchers analysed US health insurance claims of almost 1 7 million women and found that 30 000 pregnancies (2%) were ectopic and 17 990 (1%) were to women who had taken a benzodiazepine before conception Overseas news Trump appointee is accused of competing interests The US presidents new covid-19 vaccine czar is a venture capitalist who holds millions of dollars in drug company stocks, said an ethics complaint filed by two public interest organisations, Public Citizen and Lower Drug Prices Now 4 The groups said that Moncef Slaoui was appointed by Trump as a private contractor, allowing him to maintain an extensive web of conflicting financial interests  The committees president, Peter Maurer, told the United Nations Security Council that the actual number of incidents, which have ranged from verbal threats to burning down facilities housing covid-19 patients, was likely to be much higher 1 Wang Y Tian H Zhang L Reduction of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in households by face mask use, disinfection and social distancing: a cohort study in Beijing, China","output":"Seven days in medicine: 27 May to 2 Jun 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High rates of asymptomatic infection suggest benefits to routine testing in congregate care settings.

COVID-19 has exacerbated this trend. Concurrently, crowd-shipping has been gaining in popularity due to both the increase in e-commerce and the current pressures due to COVID-19. We consider a setting where a crowd-shipping platform can fulfill heterogeneous delivery requests from a central depot with a fleet of professionally driven vehicles and a pool of capacitated occasional drivers. We divide delivery requests into sectors to represent different neighborhoods in a city. Occasional drivers have unknown destinations that can be anywhere inside the sectors. Route duration constraints are modeled to motivate participation and increase the probability of route-acceptance by keeping routes short. We assume that occasional drivers will choose routes that are better compensated and that the probability of route-acceptance is dependent on other routes being offered. We propose a two-stage stochastic model to formulate the problem. We use a branch-and-price algorithm capable of solving 50-customer instances, and develop a heuristic that can solve larger 100-customer instances quickly. An upper bound for the total number of occasional drivers is used to reduce the number of constraints in the master problem and reduce the complexity of the pricing problems. We show that occasional drivers with destinations far from the depot reduce the cost by over 30%, while occasional drivers with destinations that are near the depot reduce the cost by 20%. We show that route duration constraints and capacity constraints can restrict the occasional driver routes and both need to simultaneously increase in order to have cost reductions. This setting of crowd-shipping is a viable option for last-mile deliveries.","output":"Crowdshipping: An open VRP variant with stochastic destinations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Evidence-based and effective treatments for COVID-19 are limited, and a new wave of infections and deaths calls for novel, easily implemented treatment strategies Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a well-known adjunctive treatment for pain manage- ment, wound healing, lymphedema, and cellulitis PBMT uses light to start a cascade of photochemical reactions that lead to local and systemic anti-inflammatory effects at multiple levels and that stimulate healing Numerous empirical studies of PBMT for patients with pulmonary disease such as pneumonia, COPD and asthma suggest that PBMT is a safe and effective adjunctive treatment Recent systematic reviews suggest that PBMT may be applied to target lung tissue in COVID-19 patients In this preliminary study, we evaluated the effect of adjunctive PBMT on COVID-19 pneumonia and patient clinical status Patients and Methods: We present a small-scale clinical trial with 10 patients randomized to standard medical care or standard medical care plus adjunctive PBMT The PBMT group received four daily sessions of near-infrared light treatment targeting the lung tissue via a Multiwave Locked System (MLS) laser Patient outcomes were measured via blood work, chest x-rays, pulse oximetry and validated scoring tools for pneumonia Results: PBMT patients showed improvement on pulmonary indices such as SMART-COP, BCRSS, RALE, and CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia questionnaire) PBMT-treated patients showed rapid recovery, did not require ICU admission or mechanical ventilation, and reported no long-term sequelae at 5 months after treatment In the control group, 60% of patients were admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation The control group had an overall mortality of 40% At a 5-month follow-up, 40% of the control group experienced long-term sequelae Conclusion: PBMT is a safe and effective potential treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia and improves clinical status in COVID-19 pneumonia","output":"Evaluation of adjunctive photobiomodulation (PBMT) for COVID-19 pneumonia via clinical status and pulmonary severity indices in a preliminary trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India is currently fighting against the deadly contagious, Novel coronavirus (nCoV) in all possible means.
