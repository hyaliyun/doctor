Objective: To describe the feasibility, clinical and process outcomes associated with a multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model to triage and manage obstetric patients with known exposures and/or symptoms concerning for COVID-19. Study Design: We implemented a multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model with obstetric physicians and nurses to standardize ambulatory care for obstetric patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 based on symptoms or exposures at an urban academic tertiary care center with multiple hospital and community-based affiliated practices. All pregnant or postpartum patients with COVID-19 symptoms, exposures or hospitalization were eligible for inclusion in the program. Patients were assessed via regular nursing phone calls and were managed according to illness severity. Patient characteristics, clinical and process outcomes were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Results: A total of 135 patients were enrolled in the multidisciplinary telemedicine model from March 17-April 19, 2020, of whom 130 were pregnant and 5 recently postpartum. The majority (N=116, 86%) were managed solely in the outpatient setting and did not require in-person evaluation; 9 were ultimately admitted after ambulatory or urgent evaluation and 10 patients were followed after hospital discharge. Although only 50% of the patients were tested secondary to limitations in ambulatory testing, 1 in 3 of those was PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 (N=22, 16% of entire cohort). Patients were enrolled in the telemedicine model for a median of 7 days (IQR 4-8) and averaged one phone call daily, resulting in 891 nursing calls and 20 physician calls over 1 month. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary telemedicine surveillance model for outpatient management of obstetric patients with COVID-19 symptoms and/or exposures is feasible and resulted in rates of ambulatory management similar to those seen in non-pregnant patients. A centralized model for telemedicine surveillance of obstetric patients with COVID-19 symptoms may preserve inpatient resources and prevent avoidable staff and patient exposures, particularly in centers with multiple ambulatory practice settings.","output":"A multidisciplinary telemedicine model for management of COVID-19 in obstetric patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated mental health and substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic in 196 participants from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) Cohort.

Dysfunction of endothelial cells is believed to mediate a variety of viral infections, including those caused by previous coronaviruses. Experience from previous coronaviruses has triggered hypotheses on the role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical studies.

Current algorithms prioritize the use of benzodiazepines as first line treatment followed by Levetiracetam or Valproic Acid, possibly Fosphenytoin and eventually high dose Propofol and intubation. CASE REPORT: A 9-month old girl was brought to the emergency department with a continuous seizure involving the right upper and lower extremity for 45 min prior to arrival. Patient received a dose of rectal Diazepam, intramuscular Midazolam, 2 doses of Lorazepam, Levetiracetam, Fosphenytoin and 2 additional doses of Lorazepam. The seizure remained refractory and generalized. In anticipation of intubation, and because of its action on the NMDA receptor, Ketamine (1 mg/kg IV) was administered. The clonic movements and eye deviations stopped. Patient was intubated for airway protection, sedated with Propofol, then admitted to the PICU. EEG showed no evidence of a seizure pattern. Labs (CBC, CMP, COVID) were unremarkable except for WBC 24.5, blood glucose of 346 and CO2 of 17 with normal anion gap. Urinalysis showed a urinary tract infection. Patient was at her baseline on 1 week post-discharge re-evaluation. Ketamine theoretically may abort seizures through blockade of NMDA receptors which are unregulated in status epilepticus. To date, no randomized controlled trials have been reported. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Ketamine may have a role in treating status epilepticus.

Mindfulness training, which helps individuals attend to the present moment with a nonjudgmental attitude, improves sleep and reduces stress during regular times. Mindfulness training may also be relevant to the mitigation of harmful health consequences during acute crises. However, certain restrictions may necessitate the web-based delivery of mindfulness training (ie, rather than in-person group training settings). OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine the effects of mindfulness interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of web-based interventions. METHODS: Data from an ongoing study were used for this retrospective equivalence analysis. Recruited participants were enrollees from mindfulness courses at a local charity organization that promoted mental wellness. This study had no exclusion criteria. We created three groups; two groups received their training during the COVID-19 pandemic (in-person training group: n=36; videoconferencing group: n=38), and a second control group included participants who were trained before the pandemic (n=86). Our primary outcomes were self-reported stress and sleep quality. Baseline levels and changes in these variables due to mindfulness training were compared among the groups via an analysis of covariance test and two one-tailed t tests. RESULTS: Baseline perceived stress (P=.50) and sleep quality (P=.22) did not differ significantly among the three groups. Mindfulness training significantly reduced stress in all three groups (P<.001), and this effect was statistically significant when comparing videoconferencing to in-person training (P=.002). Sleep quality improved significantly in the prepandemic training group (P<.001). However, sleep quality did not improve in the groups that received training during the pandemic. Participants reported that they required shorter times to initiate sleep following prepandemic mindfulness training (P<.001), but this was not true for those who received training during the pandemic. Course attendance was high and equivalent across the videoconferencing and comparison groups (P=.02), and participants in the videoconferencing group engaged in marginally more daily practice than the in-person training group. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based mindfulness training via videoconferencing may be a useful intervention for reducing stress during times when traditional, in-person training is not feasible. However, it may not be useful for improving sleep quality.","output":"Effects of Web-Based Group Mindfulness Training on Stress and Sleep Quality in Singapore During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Equivalence Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The (?)-strand viral RNAs that result from after infection of cells with coronaviruses, which possess RNA genomes of message polarity, are genomic-sized and subgenomic-sized.

We tested whether (?)-strand subgenomic RNAs might initially be synthesized from the input single-stranded (+)-strand genomic RNA prior to the production of subgenomic mRNAs. We used a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNA, from which subgenomic RNA was produced in DI RNA-replicating cells, because this DI RNA had a functional MHV intergenic region inserted in its interior. MHV samples containing the DI particles were irradiated with UV-light and then superinfected into cells that had been infected with MHV 4 h prior to superinfection. Northern blot analysis of intracellular RNAs that were extracted 3 h after superinfection showed that genomic DI RNA and subgenomic DI RNA had similar UV-target sizes, indicating that (?)-strand genomic DI RNA synthesis from input genomic DI RNA probably occurred prior to the subgenomic-size DI RNA synthesis.

Abnormal brain imaging was evaluated in detail and various imaging patterns on magnetic resonance imaging MRI were identified. Results Of the 3,403 patients with COVID-19, 167 (4.9%) had neurological signs or symptoms warranting neuroimaging. The most common indications were delirium (44/167, 26%), focal neurology (37/167, 22%), and altered consciousness (34/167, 20%). Neuroimaging showed abnormalities in 23% of patients, with MRI being abnormal in 20 patients and computed tomography (CT) in 18 patients. The most consistent neuroradiological finding was microhaemorrhage with a predilection for the splenium of the corpus callosum (12/20, 60%) followed by acute or subacute infarct (5/20, 25%), watershed white matter hyperintensities (4/20, 20%), and susceptibility changes on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in the superficial veins (3/20, 15%), acute haemorrhagic necrotising encephalopathy (2/20, 10%), large parenchymal haemorrhage (2/20, 10%), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1/20, 5%), hypoxicCischaemic changes (1/20, 5%), and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like changes (1/20, 5%).

We aimed to bring together the results of these experimental studies. Methods and materials: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis searching PubMed and Scopus databases for clinical trials incorporating WLI for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Required data were extracted from each study. Using the random-effects model, overall pooled day-28 survival rate, survival hazard ratio, and intubation-free days within 15 days after WLI was calculated, and forest plots were produced. Results: Ten studies were identified, and eventually, five were included for meta-analysis. The overall survival hazard ratio was calculated to be 0.85 [0.46-1.57]. The pooled mean difference of intubation-free days within 15 days after WLI was 1.87, favoring the WLI group (CI: -0.02-3.76).

An intermediate respiratory care unit (IMCU) may be a valuable element for optimizing patient care and limited health-care resources management. We aim to assess the clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients admitted to an IMCU. Methods: Observational, retrospective study including patients admitted to the IMCU due to COVID-19 pneumonia during the months of March and April 2020. Patients were stratified based on their requirement of transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and on survival status at the end of follow-up. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards method was used to assess risk factors associated with mortality. Results: A total of 253 patients were included. Of them, 68% were male and median age was 65 years (IQR 18 years). Ninety-two patients (36.4%) required ICU transfer. Patients transferred to the ICU had a higher mortality rate (44.6 vs. 24.2%; p < 0.001). Multivariable proportional hazards model showed that age 65 years (HR 4.14; 95%CI 2.31C7.42; p < 0.001); chronic respiratory conditions (HR 2.34; 95%CI 1.38C3.99; p = 0.002) and chronic kidney disease (HR 2.96; 95%CI 1.61C5.43; p < 0.001) were independently associated with mortality. High-dose systemic corticosteroids followed by progressive dose tapering showed a lower risk of death (HR 0.15; 95%CI 0.06C0.40; p < 0.001). Conclusions: IMCU may be a useful tool for the multidisciplinary management of severe COVID-19 patients requiring respiratory support and non-invasive monitoring, therefore reducing ICU burden.

Baseline seroprevalence was 16.3%, compared to estimates in the regional population of 6% to 7%. Seropositivity was retained in over 70% of participants at 3- and 6-mo follow-up and conferred a 75% reduced risk of infection. Nonwhite ethnicity and living in areas of greater deprivation were associated with increased baseline seroprevalence. During follow-up, no polymerase chain reaction-proven infections occurred in individuals with a baseline anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level greater than 147.6 IU/ml with respect to the World Health Organization international standard 20-136. After vaccination, antibody responses were more rapid and of higher magnitude in those individuals who were seropositive at baseline. Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 prior to enhanced PPE was significantly higher in DCPs than the regional population. Natural infection leads to a serological response that remains detectable in over 70% of individuals 6 mo after initial sampling and 9 mo from the peak of the first wave of the pandemic.

Additionally the suspension of OSCE's in 2020 due to the pandemic ,has meant this cohort of final year students have never been examined on psychiatry skills. Our aims were to assess if our student psychiatry society (PsychSoc) run OSCE could help to prepare medical students for novel virtual stations ahead of their final examinations, and how this format of mock examination could be improved in the future.MethodOur PsychSoc (QUB Mind Matters) hosted a virtual mock psychiatry OSCE for 24 final year medical students using the video conference platform Zoom, approximately 1 month before their finals. The OSCE comprised 4 stations each lasting 8 minutes, and covered psychiatric history taking, risk assessment and drug counselling. Stations were marked by psychiatry trainees in individual breakout rooms to closely simulate real examination conditions. A post-event online questionnaire was distributed to all participants. 5-point Likert scales and free text responses were used to gather feedback regarding the content and delivery of the mock. A response rate of 100% was achieved (n = 24).ResultThe feedback from students was overwhelmingly positive, with 100% (n = 24) agreeing/strongly agreeing that the mock OSCE left them feeling more prepared for their final exam. 95.8% (n = 23) agreed that the opportunity to practice virtual OSCE stations improved their confidence, and all 24 students agreed/strongly agreed that they would like more practice of virtual OSCE stations. A common theme that emerged when asked how our mock could have been improved was the need for a group feedback session covering common pitfalls in addition to individual feedback.ConclusionThe lack of clinical experience and shift towards online learning has led to increased stress around clinical exams in the student population. PsychSocs can supplement formal teaching by providing students the opportunity to practice virtual communication and history taking skills that are not always covered in their undergraduate curriculum. However, as a psychiatry society our mock only assessed psychiatry skills, many of which may be relatively well suited to an online format. We would welcome further evaluation of the applicability of student run virtual mock OSCE's to other specialties. We have demonstrated that PsychSocs can offer much needed practice for students through mock OSCE's and have highlighted ways to enhance their delivery.","output":"Preparing students for psychiatry OSCE's in the COVID-19 pandemic.

During a time of heightened negative affect, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on eating behaviours, and further elucidate the ways in which emotional eating is related to emotion dysregulation and impaired abilities to identify emotions (i.e. alexithymia). The aims of this study were to explore perceived changes in eating behaviours in relation to self-reported negative affect during the pandemic and to examine direct and indirect effects of alexithymia on emotional eating. An online questionnaire measured these constructs in the general population of the United Kingdom (n = 136). Findings demonstrated that those who reported changes to their eating behaviours during the pandemic also reported greater levels of depression during the same time frame. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties identifying and describing feelings both predicted emotional eating indirectly via emotion dysregulation. Findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alexithymia and emotional eating and describe changes to eating behaviours during COVID-19. We discuss how these findings should be applied, and recommendations for future research.","output":"Emotional eating during COVID-19 in the United Kingdom: Exploring the roles of alexithymia and emotion dysregulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection vary from asymptomatic to severe ARDS pneumonia. Chest CT is highly sensitive in detecting lung injury due to COVID-19, but is not routinely used for serial monitoring. ReDS? is an FDA-approved, non-invasive measurement tool for monitoring lung fluid content in HF patients (normal values ranging 20-35%). ReDS has proven to have excellent correlation with CT in quantification of lung fluid and may have the potential to assess the severity of lung injury in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Methods Cone Health is a six-hospital system in central NC. In March 2020, the previous Women's Hospital site was converted into a 120-bed (24 ICU/96 Medical) COVID hospital. In this prospective, feasibility, pilot study we used the ReDS Clip to evaluate whether it was possible to measure bilateral lung fluid status on a daily basis in qualifying patients with COVID-19 lung infection. Secondary endpoints included correlations between the daily ReDS measurements and standard markers of clinical status. Patients were excluded if they had an implantable cardiac device, did not meet BMI criteria, were in the ICU prior to enrollment or had physical/cognitive limitations that precluded obtaining accurate readings. Results In May - June 2020, 83 patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. The mean age was 56yr, 60% male. Medication regimen included 100% vitamin C and zinc, 72% steroids, 34% remdesivir, 39% tocilizmab. No patients received hydroxycholoroquine. Over the 2month study period, 78% (65/83 patients) were able to receive daily ReDS measurements. Four patients missed 1 or 2 readings during hospitalization due to oxygen saturations dropping or too weak for minimal movements in bed to place the ReDS Device. Eight patients refused to continue study after 1 reading due to weakness or shortness of breath. ReDS readings were held during ICU stay. Six patients (7.2%) were moved to ICU, of which two patients died (33%). For the studied chohort, six patients (7.2%) died during evaluation. Only 2 patients had a documented history of heart failure. For the entire cohort, the average ReDS reading was 37%. Patients with higher supplemental oxygen demand (O2 > 5 L/min or need for BIPAP) had higher ReDS readings than patients with low oxygen demands, ReDS 43% vs ReDS 35%. Patients who were referred to ICU had higher ReDS readings than patients who were discharged home, ReDS 47% vs ReDS 37%. Conclusion In this single-center feasibility study, ReDS lung fluid was able to be measured on a daily basis in 78% of the hospitalized study cohort. ReDS measurements correlated with then need for higher levels of O2 supplementation and worsening clinical status in patients with COVID-19 lung infection. More research is warranted to determine if daily monitoring with this technology can assist in early prediction of disease trajectory.","output":"Reds Lung Fluid Monitoring For Assessing Lung Disease In Patients With Covid-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of and factors associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional online survey that targeted adults over the age of 18 residing in Saudi Arabia The data collection began June 1, 2020 and continued for four weeks The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Specific, the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire version BIP-Q5, and a 9-item health literacy measure were used Results: There were 1249 participants, of which 62 21% were under the age of 34 The prevalence of PTSD was 19 5% among all participants The results showed that both the perception of threat (OR =1 17, 95% CI = 1 13-1 19) and health literacy (OR =0 97, 95% CI = 0 95-0 99) were associated with PTSD symptoms Conclusion: This study highlights important findings that the level of an individual's perception of threat and health literacy is associated with symptoms of PTSD Thus, an understanding of these constructs in the target population will enable the development of better measures designed to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Health Literacy, Perceived Threat, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The aim of this study is to explore barriers that influence COVID-19 vaccination uptake among the public in Saudi Arabia Methods: This study included an online questionnaire that was prepared using questionnaire of previous study After that, it was converted using Google (R) forms to an online form and was disseminated by social media platforms to be completed by the public Results: Only 13 37% of the respondents believe that COVID-19 is not serious enough to warrant vaccination, about 14 71% agreed that the vaccine does not provide benefit, about 17 64% agreed that the chance of getting COVID-19 disease is low About 31 37% of them said that they don't have the time to get vaccinated About 60 78% of the respondents said that they concerned about the vaccine side effects Conclusion: The main barrier of COVID-19 vaccination uptake was the vaccine side effects concerns Health care provider should provide open and transparent information about vaccine safety and the potential vaccine side effects Health education programs could change people's thoughts and feelings towards vaccination","output":"Barriers Influencing COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake among the Public in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has rapidly and abruptly changed the world as we knew in 2020. It becomes the most unprecedent challenge to analytic epidemiology in general and signal processing theories in specific. Given its high contingency nature and adverse effects across the world, it is important to develop efficient processing/learning models to overcome this pandemic and be prepared for potential future ones. In this regard, medical imaging plays an important role for the management of COVID-19. Human-centered interpretation of medical images is, however, tedious and can be subjective. This has resulted in a surge of interest to develop Radiomics models for analysis and interpretation of medical images. Signal Processing (SP) and Deep Learning (DL) models can assist in development of robust Radiomics solutions for diagnosis/prognosis, severity assessment, treatment response, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients. In this article, we aim to present an overview of the current state, challenges, and opportunities of developing SP/DL-empowered models for diagnosis (screening/monitoring) and prognosis (outcome prediction and severity assessment) of COVID-19 infection. More specifically, the article starts by elaborating the latest development on the theoretical framework of analytic epidemiology and hypersignal processing for COVID-19. Afterwards, imaging modalities and Radiological characteristics of COVID-19 are discussed. SL/DL-based Radiomic models specific to the analysis of COVID-19 infection are then described covering the following four domains: Segmentation of COVID-19 lesions; Predictive models for outcome prediction; Severity assessment, and; Diagnosis/classification models.

The prevention of the first variceal bleed is, therefore, an important clinical goal. Little is known about patients experience of treatments geared towards this, or of their perceptions of treatments prior to being exposed to them. AIMS: To explore the factors impacting patient preference for, and actual experience of carvedilol and variceal band ligation. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 30 patients from across the UK at baseline, prior to random allocation to either carvedilol or variceal band ligation. Twenty patients were interviewed a second time at 6-month follow-up. Five patients who declined the trial were also interviewed. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: There was no clear preference for either treatment pathway at baseline. Key factors reported by patients to influence their treatment preference included: negative experiences with key treatment processes; how long-term or short-term treatment was perceived to be; treatment misconceptions; concerns around polypharmacy and worries around treatment adherence. Patient treatment experience was influenced by their perceptions of treatment effectiveness; clinical surveillance; clinician interaction and communication, or lack thereof. Carvedilol-specific experience was also influenced by the manifestation of side effects and patient dosage routine. Variceal band ligation-specific experience was positively influenced by the use of sedation, and negatively influenced by the procedure recovery period. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not support a view that the patient experience of beta-blockade for prevention of variceal bleeds is likely to be superior to variceal band ligation.","output":"Exploring patients perceptions and experiences of treatments for the prevention of variceal bleeding: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A short-cut review of the literature was carried out to examine the potential utility of prone positioning in awake patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure.

METHODS: Pearson's Correlation and Linear Regression analyses were applied to a subset of the CLOZUK2 dataset (N=208) to assess the association between Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) and plasma clozapine concentration. Norclozapine and the metabolic ratio between clozapine and norclozapine were also investigated, along with SNPs associated with clozapine metabolism. RESULTS: Association between ANC and plasma clozapine concentration was found to be significant in a linear regression model (beta=-1.41, p=0.009), with a decrease in ANC of approximately 141 cells/mm3 for every 0.1 mg/litre increase in clozapine concentration. This association was attenuated by the addition of the metabolic ratio, which was significantly negatively correlated with ANC (beta=-0.69, p=0.021). In a further regression model, three SNPs previously associated with norclozapine plasma concentrations and clozapine/norclozapine ratio were also found to be significantly associated with ANC: rs61750900 (beta=-0.410, p=0.048), rs2011425 (beta=0.450, p=0.026) and rs1126545 (beta=0.330, p=0.039).

To examine shelter characteristics and infection prevention practices in relation to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection point prevalence during universal testing at homeless shelters in the United States.Methods. SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered to clients and staff at homeless shelters, irrespective of symptoms. Site assessments were conducted from March 30 to June 1, 2020, to collect information on shelter characteristics and infection prevention practices. We assessed the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence and shelter characteristics, including 20 infection prevention practices by using crude risk ratios (RRs) and exact unconditional 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results. Site assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing results were reported for 63 homeless shelters in 7 US urban areas. Median infection prevalence was 2.9% (range = 0%-71.4%). Shelters implementing head-to-toe sleeping and excluding symptomatic staff from working were less likely to have high infection prevalence (RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3, 0.8; and RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.6; respectively); shelters with medical services available were less likely to have very high infection prevalence (RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.2, 1.0).Conclusions.

METHOD: We performed a systematic literature search through electronic databases. The variables of interest were serum procalcitonin, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in each group of severity outcomes from COVID-19. RESULTS: There were a total of 4848 patients from 23 studies.

The FebriDx is a point-of-care test that detects an antiviral host response protein in finger prick blood within 10 minutes, but its accuracy for the detection of COVID-19 is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of FebriDx in hospitalised patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated based on FebriDx results compared to the reference standard of PCR, and stratified by duration of symptoms. A multivariable predictive model was developed and underwent internal validation. Results FebriDx was performed on 251 patients and gave a valid result in 248. 118 of 248 (48%) were PCR positive for COVID-19. Sensitivity of FebriDx for the identification of COVID-19 was 93% (110/118; 95% CI 87 to 97%) and specificity was 86% (112/130; 95%CI 79 to 92%).

Information about the prognostic significance of functional status in older patients with COVID-19 is scarce. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, laboratory and short-term mortality data were collected of 186 consecutive patients aged &#8805; 65 years hospitalized with COVID-19. The data were compared between 4 study groups: (1) age 65-79 years without severe functional dependency; (2) age &#8805; 80 years without severe functional dependency; (3) age 65-79 years with severe functional dependency; and (4) age &#8805; 80 years with severe functional dependency. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the variables that were most significantly associated with mortality in the entire sample. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in the proportions of males (p = 0.007); of patients with diabetes mellitus (p = 0.025), cerebrovascular disease (p < 0.001), renal failure (p = 0.003), dementia (p < 0.001), heart failure (p = 0.005), pressure sores (p < 0.001) and malignant disorders (p = 0.007); and of patients residing in nursing homes (p < 0.001). Compared to groups 1 (n = 69) and 2 (n = 28), patients in groups 3 (n = 32) and 4 (n = 57) presented with lower mean serum albumin levels on admission (p < 0.001), and were less often treated with convalescent plasma (p < 0.001), tocilizumab (p < 0.001) and remdesivir (p < 0.001). The overall mortality rate was 23.1 %. The mortality rate was higher in group 4 than in groups 1 - 3: 45.6 % vs. 8.7 %, 17.9% and 18.3 %, respectively (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, both age &#8805; 80 years and severe functional dependency were among the variables most significantly associated with mortality in the entire cohort (odds ratio [OR] 4.83, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.88 - 12.40, p < 0.001 and OR 2.51, 95 % CI 1.02 - 6.15, p = 0.044, respectively).

Estimated background rate of CVST with thrombocytopenia is 0.1 per million per month. We assessed the age-stratified risk of CVST with and without thrombocytopenia after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. METHODS: We estimated the absolute risk of CVST with and without thrombocytopenia within 28 days of a first dose of 4 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations using data from the European Medicines Agency's EudraVigilance database (until June 13, 2021). As a denominator, we used data on vaccine delivery from 31 European countries. For 22.8 million adults from 25 countries, we estimated the absolute risk of CVST after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 per age category. RESULTS: The absolute risk of CVST within 28 days of first-dose vaccination was 7.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.9-8.3), 0.7 (95% CI 0.2-2.4), 0.6 (95% CI 0.5-0.7), and 0.6 (95% CI 0.3-1.1) per million of first doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19, Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, and mRNA-1273, respectively. The absolute risk of CVST with thrombocytopenia within 28 days of first dose vaccination was 4.4 (95% CI 3.9-4.9), 0.7 (95% CI 0.2-2.4), 0.0 (95% CI 0.0-0.1), and 0.0 (95% CI 0.0-0.2) per million of first doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19, Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2, and mRNA-1273, respectively. In recipients of ChAdOx1 nCov-19, the absolute risk of CVST, both with and without thrombocytopenia, was the highest in the 18- to 24-year-old group (7.3 per million, 95% CI 2.8-18.8 and 3.7 per million, 95% CI 1.0-13.3, respectively). The risk of CVST with thrombocytopenia in ChAdOx1 nCov-19 recipients was the lowest in the age group >=70 years (0.2, 95% CI 0.0-1.3). Age <60 years compared to >=60 years was a predictor for CVST with thrombocytopenia (incidence rate ratio 5.79, 95% CI 2.98-11.24, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The risk of CVST with thrombocytopenia within 28 days of first-dose vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 was higher in younger age groups. The risk of CVST with thrombocytopenia was slightly increased in patients receiving Ad26.COV2.S compared with the estimated background risk.

About 39% of these were associated with a religious mass gathering event held in Kuala Lumpur between February 27 and March 1, 2020, which drove community transmission during Malaysias main wave. We analysed genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Malaysia to understand the molecular epidemiology. Methods We obtained whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 58 COVID-19 patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and performed phylogenetic analyses on these and a further 50 Malaysian sequences available in the GISAID database. Malaysian lineage B.6 sequences were further analysed with all available worldwide lineage B.6 sequences. Results Nine different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.36, B.2, B.3 and B.6) were detected in Malaysia. The B.6 lineage was first reported a week after the mass gathering and became predominant (63%) despite being relatively rare (1.4%) among available global sequences. Increases in reported cases and community-acquired B.6 lineage strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 lineages were mainly associated with travel and showed limited onward transmission. There were also temporally-correlated increases in B.6 sequences in other Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia, linked to participants returning from this event. We also report the presence of a nsp3-C6310A substitution found in 40.5% of global B.6 sequences which has associated with reduced sensitivity in a commercial assay. Conclusion Lineage B.6 became the predominant cause of community transmission in Malaysia after likely introduction during a religious mass gathering. This event also contributed to spikes of lineage B.6 in other countries in the region. Author Summary The COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia was driven mainly by transmission following a religious mass gathering held in Kuala Lumpur at the end of February. To study the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Malaysia, we analysed 50 available and 58 newly-generated Malaysian whole genome virus sequences. We found that lineage B.6, rare (1.4%) globally, first appeared after the mass gathering and became the most predominant (62.9%) in Malaysia. Increases in COVID-19 cases and locally-acquired B.6 strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 viruses were mainly associated with travel and showed limited spread. Increases in B.6 viruses in Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia were linked to participants returning from this mass gathering. Altogether, 95.3% of global B.6 sequences originated in Asia or Australia. We also report a mutation in the virus nsP3 gene found in 40.5% of global B.6 sequences and associated with reduced detection by a commercial diagnostic test. In conclusion, the religious mass gathering in Kuala Lumpur was associated with the main wave of COVID-19 cases of predominantly B.6 lineage in Malaysia, and subsequent spread of B.6 viruses regionally. Genome sequence data provides valuable insight into virus spread and is important for monitoring continued accuracy of diagnostic kits.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.6 is the major contributor to transmission in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mammalian cells have the ability to recognize virus infection and mount a powerful antiviral response. Pattern recognition receptor proteins detect molecular signatures of virus infection and activate antiviral signaling cascades. The RIG-I-like receptors are cytoplasmic DExD/H box proteins that can specifically recognize virus-derived RNA species as a molecular feature discriminating the pathogen from the host. The RIG-I-like receptor family is composed of three homologous proteins, RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. All of these proteins can bind double-stranded RNA species with varying affinities via their conserved DExD/H box RNA helicase domains and C-terminal regulatory domains. The recognition of foreign RNA by the RLRs activates enzymatic functions and initiates signal transduction pathways resulting in the production of antiviral cytokines and the establishment of a broadly effective cellular antiviral state that protects neighboring cells from infection and triggers innate and adaptive immune systems. The propagation of this signal via the interferon antiviral system has been studied extensively, while the precise roles for enzymatic activities of the RNA helicase domain in antiviral responses are only beginning to be elucidated.

MATERIALS: Urine drug testing is a strategy to reduce harm to patients in pain management and substance abuse treatment programs. We analyzed trends in the clinical drug testing patterns of urine specimens sent by substance abuse and pain clinics to monitor their patients. These specimens were tested by a national clinical laboratory using LC-MS/MS definitive methods. The time frame of these comparative observations was the past five years, including the time of the pandemic. RESULTS: The only decrease was a 30% reduction in test requests during the second quarter of 2020. Among the patients tested, positivity decreased greatly for the illicit drugs heroin and cocaine but increased for methamphetamine and fentanyl. Use of the antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs remained consistent or declined for some drugs, relative to pre-pandemic patterns. The percent of patients prescribed the opiates morphine and oxycodone decreased, while the use of hydrocodone increased. Positivity for the drug gabapentin increased greatly. The use of alcohol did not increase significantly during the lockdown period. CONCLUSION: In summary, these findings demonstrate relatively consistent drug use, with decreased positivity for high-risk drugs and dangerous drug combinations.

Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and in-hospital length of stay (LOS). A retrospective, observational, multicenter study was conducted in intermediate-high dependency respiratory units of two Italian university hospitals. Consecutive patients with COVID-19 treated with CPAP were enrolled. Thoraco-abdominal asynchrony or hemodynamic instability led to ETI. Patients showing SpO(2)  94%, respiratory rate  30 bpm or accessory muscle activation on CPAP received NIV.

Among patients that failed CPAP (n = 63), 28% were intubated, while the remaining 72% received NIV, of which 65% were intubated. Patients intubated after CPAP showed lower baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2), lower lymphocyte counts and higher D-dimer values compared with patients intubated after CPAP + NIV.

Chronic conditions including diabetes, COPD, mental health, and HTN outcomes worsened due to decrease in routine care during the pandemic. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic blood disorder that causes numerous complications including but not limited to vaso-occlusive crisis, strokes, and chronic kidney disease.

COVID pandemic declaration (Pre COVID: September 2019 to February 2020, Intra COVID 1: March 2020 to Sept 2020, Intra COVID 2: October 2020 to February 2021). Primary endpoints included emergency room visits, inpatient admissions, and length of stay, blood product utilization, and opioid utilization. Secondary endpoints and analyses included pediatric vs. adult health care utilization disparity and outcomes. Descriptive analysis was done by calculating frequency and percentages for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. Results: Shown in Result TABLE attached .Patients seeking inpatient care for scheduled procedure's/ transfusion were excluded from this analysis. Patients with SCD diagnoses of acute SCD crises (pan crisis /chest syndrome / COVID infection / Pneumonia) were included in assessment. Absolute number of patients per ED visit, patient per Inpatient admission frequency has been shown in more detail in the bar chart in Figure and will be presented in the oral presentation along with detailed data analysis box plots and charts. Discussion: Fewer patients' sought timely care for acute SCD event leading to fewer but prolonged hospitalizations, a trend seen in our adult and pediatric patient's across the board during intra COVID 1 and 2 time points, likely due to the fear of contracting COVID infection at an acute health care setting in a declared pandemic . Similarly, we found there were less unique sickle cell patients using the ER for both pediatric and adult patients during the pandemic. There was a decrease in the amount of hospital admission related to sickle cell disease, which was similar to results published in the United Kingdom. More sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis were being managed at home, likely due to avoidance of COVID exposures at health care facilities, likely thus leading to certain individuals having more severe crisis as shown by increased LOS in our adult population. Additionally, only a few individuals with likely more severe crisis needed more RBC transfusions. The general trend for different patients requiring RBCs and IV opiates decreased during the pandemic. Due to more people foregoing medical care especially in the minority populations who had restrictions to access to healthcare, there was an overall decrease in inpatient healthcare utilization in sickle cell population during the pandemic. Additionally care disparities in outcome of pediatric and adult SCD patients were highlighted by our study. Pediatric patients commonly cared at a center of excellence by the dedicated team of sickle cell stakeholders, seemed to do well overall as compared to adult SCD patients who notoriously have has inequitable access to comprehensive Sickle Cell care globally. Infrastructure around better outpatient support, care optimization with sickle cell disease modifying agents and timely access to inpatient care even in a pandemic, that is ongoing could be strategies to reduce stress on the health care systems and better utilization of scarce resources in current times of surge from an International health care crisis such as the SAR CoV2 pandemic.

Both these conferences had a huge influence on the history of the churches in South Africa. Thirty years after the Rustenburg Conference, this article suggests that the current context of South Africa calls for another church conference. To motivate this, the events and the declarations of the Rustenburg Church Conference of 1990 are revisited. Firstly, the article starts with a short overview on the organising of the conference. Secondly, it revisits the important confession of Prof. W.D. Jonker on apartheid and what he said on behalf of the Dutch Reformed Church and the Afrikaner people. It then recalls the lesser known but not less important declaration by the women at the conference before moving on to the main declaration, which was made after the conference. The question that is then asked is what this important historical event means for the current situation in South Africa. It is suggested that the churches in South Africa are called to take the initiative to organise a Lekgotla where churches and other civil organisations can come together to discuss and address the challenges in South Africa. Racism, poverty, education, violence against women and children and corruption are specifically named as issues that should be addressed. The article concludes that given the current situation in South Africa, the churches have arrived at another Kairos moment. Interdisciplinary implications: The research in this article challenges other disciplines in theology, sociology, education and law to join the quest for workable solutions. This should be done with specific reference to research on the current problematic events in South Africa, namely poverty, corruption, racism, violence against women and the needs of children and land issues.","output":"The Rustenburg Church Conference of 1990: A call to the churches in South Africa after 30 years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Streaming video is responsible for the bulk of Internet traffic these days.

NETs have emerged as critical mediators of lung damage, inflammation and thrombosis in COVID-19 and other diseases, but there are no therapeutics to prevent or reduce NETs that are available to patients. Here, we show that neutrophils isolated from hospitalised patients with COVID-19 produce significantly more NETs in response to LPS compared to cells from healthy control subjects. A subset of patients were captured at follow-up clinics (3-4 month post-infection) and while LPS-induced NET formation is significantly lower at this time point, it remains elevated compared to healthy controls. LPS- and PMA-induced NETs were significantly inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor ruboxistaurin. Ruboxistaurin-mediated inhibition of NETs in healthy neutrophils reduces NET-induced epithelial cell death. Our findings suggest ruboxistaurin could reduce proinflammatory and tissue-damaging consequences of neutrophils during disease, and since it has completed phase III trials for other indications without safety concerns, it is a promising and novel therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.","output":"Enhanced neutrophil extracellular trap formation in COVID-19 is inhibited by the PKC inhibitor ruboxistaurin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a pandemic.

We further show that Omicron is attenuated in a lung cell line but replicates more rapidly, albeit to lower peak titres, in human primary nasal cells. This replication phenotype also maps to the spike gene. Omicron spike (including the emerging Omicron lineage BA.4) shows attenuated fusogenicity and a preference for cell entry via the endosomal route. We map the altered Omicron spike entry route and partially map the lower fusogenicity to the S2 domain, particularly the substitution N969K. Finally, we show that pseudovirus with Omicron spike, engineered in the S2 domain to confer a more Delta-like cell entry route retains the antigenic properties of Omicron. This shows a distinct separation between the genetic determinants of these two key Omicron phenotypes, raising the concerning possibility that future variants with large antigenic distance from currently circulating and vaccine strains will not necessarily display the lower intrinsic severity seen during Omicron infection.","output":"The altered entry pathway and antigenic distance of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant map to separate domains of spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious new worldwide public health crisis with significant morbidity and mortality, effective therapeutic treatments are urgently needed Drug repurposing is an efficient and cost-effective strategy with minimum risk for identifying novel potential treatment options by repositioning therapies that were previously approved for other clinical outcomes Here, we used an integrated network-based pharmacologic and transcriptomic approach to screen drug candidates novel for COVID-19 treatment Network-based proximity scores were calculated to identify the drugCdisease pharmacological effect between drugCtarget relationship modules and COVID-19 related genes Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was then performed to determine whether drug candidates influence the expression of COVID-19 related genes and examine the sensitivity of the repurposing drug treatment to peripheral immune cell types Moreover, we used the complementary exposure model to recommend potential synergistic drug combinations We identified 18 individual drug candidates including nicardipine, orantinib, tipifarnib and promethazine which have not previously been proposed as possible treatments for COVID-19 Additionally, 30 synergistic drug pairs were ultimately recommended including fostamatinib plus tretinoin and orantinib plus valproic acid Differential expression genes of most repurposing drugs were enriched significantly in B cells The findings may potentially accelerate the discovery and establishment of an effective therapeutic treatment plan for COVID-19 patients","output":"Drug Repurposing for COVID-19 Treatment by Integrating Network Pharmacology and Transcriptomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide pandemic.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX), an 2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has been proven having lung protection effects. However, since now, there has not been final conclusion about whether DEX can reduce the incidence of PPCs. We hypothesize that, in oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction patients, DEX may decrease the incidence of PPCs. METHODS This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centered trial with two parallel arms. A total of 160 patients at intermediate-to-high risk of PPCs undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction and tracheotomy were enrolled and randomized to receive continuous infusion of either DEX or placebo (normal saline). 0.4 g/kg of DEX was given over 10mins as an initial dose followed by a maintaining dose of 0.4 g/kg/h till the second day morning after surgery. At the same time, the normal saline was administered a similar quantity. The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs according to Clavien-Dindo score within 7 days after surgery. RESULTS The two groups had similar characteristics at baseline. 18(22.5%) of 80 patients administered DEX, and 32(40.0%) of 80 patient administered placebo experienced PPCs within the first 7 days after surgery (relative risk [RR] 0.563,95% confidence interval [CI] 0.346-0.916; P = 0.017). In the first 7 days after surgery, the DEX group had a lower incidence of PPCs and a better postoperative survival probability (Log-rank test, P = 0.019), and was less prone to occur PPCs (Cox regression, P = 0.025, HR = 0.516). When the total dose of DEX was more than 328 g, the patients were unlikely to have PPCs (ROC curve, AUC = 0.614, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS For patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction and tracheotomy who were at intermediate or high risk of developing PPCs, continuous infusion of DEX could decrease the occurrence of PPCs during the first 7 days after surgery and shorten the length of hospital stay after surgery, but did not increase the prevalence of bradycardia or hypotension.

Evidence has been obtained from mice and human cancer patients with bony metastases and non-metastatic disease, as well as pediatric burn patients, that inflammation leads to bone resorption and release of TGF- from the bone matrix with paracrine effects on muscle protein balance, possibly mediated by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Whether immobilization, which confounds the etiology of bone resorption in burn injury, also leads to the release of TGF- from bone contributing to muscle wasting in other conditions is unclear. The use of anti-resorptive therapy in both metastatic cancer patients and pediatric burn patients has been successful in the prevention of muscle wasting, thereby creating an additional therapeutic niche for this class of drugs. The liberation of TGF- may be one way in which bone helps to control muscle mass, but further investigation will be necessary to assess whether the rate of bone resorption is the determining factor for the release of TGF-.

In this study, we developed a peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the N gene to efficiently discriminate SARS-CoV-2 from other SARSr-CoVs in human clinical samples. Without compromising the sensitivity, this method significantly enhanced the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by 100-fold as compared to conventional RT-qPCR. In addition, we designed an RT-qPCR method for the sensitive and universal detection of ORF3ab-E genes of SARSr-CoV with a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.3 RNA copies per microliter. Thus, the developed assay serves as a confirmative dual-target detection method.

However, due to the limitations in sensitivity and the long turn-around time (TAT) of conventional diagnostic methods, pathogen detection and identification methods for pulmonary infection with greater diagnostic efficiency are urgently needed. In recent years, unbiased metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) has been widely used to detect different types of infectious pathogens, and is especially useful for the detection of rare and newly emergent pathogens, showing better diagnostic performance than traditional methods. There has been limited research exploring the application of mNGS for the diagnosis of pulmonary infections. In this study we evaluated the diagnostic efficiency and clinical impact of mNGS on pulmonary infections. A total of 100 respiratory samples were collected from patients diagnosed with pulmonary infection in Shanghai, China. Conventional methods, including culture and standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel analysis for respiratory tract viruses, and mNGS were used for the pathogen detection in respiratory samples. The difference in the diagnostic yield between conventional methods and mNGS demonstrated that mNGS had higher sensitivity than traditional culture for the detection of pathogenic bacteria and fungi (95% vs 54%; p<0.001). Although mNGS had lower sensitivity than PCR for diagnosing viral infections, it identified 14 viral species that were not detected using conventional methods, including multiple subtypes of human herpesvirus. mNGS detected viruses with a genome coverage >95% and a sequencing depth >100 and provided reliable phylogenetic and epidemiological information. mNGS offered extra benefits, including a shorter TAT. As a complementary approach to conventional methods, mNGS could help improving the identification of respiratory infection agents.

This study investigates the independent effects of race and environmental temperature on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in United States counties. METHODS: Data on COVID-19 and risk factors in all United States counties was collected. 661 counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases and 217 with at least 10 deaths were included in analyses. Upper and lower quartiles for cases/100,000 people and halves for deaths/100,000 people were compared with t-tests. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of race and environmental temperature. RESULTS: Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for increased COVID-19 cases (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.09-1.40, P=0.001) and deaths independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other risk factors. Higher environmental temperature independently reduced caseload (OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.91, P=0.0009), but not deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Higher environmental temperatures correlated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but this benefit does not yet appear in mortality models.

We recently implemented an evidence-based protocol for outpatient rapid evaluation of transient and minor, non-disabling stroke symptoms for patients seeking care 24 hours after symptom onset. We present our early experience through the pandemic. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients evaluated in the RESCUE-TIA (Rapid Evaluation of minor Stroke and CerebrovascUlar Events including TIA) clinic from December 2019- August 2020. The clinic sees patients with TIA symptoms or with fixed, non-disabling deficits seeking care &gt; 24 hours after symptom onset. We introduced telemedicine in March 2020. Magnetic resonance brain and vascular imaging is available within 24 hours of visit. We summarized patient characteristics and quality data with standard descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 21 patients were seen in the RESCUE-TIA clinic, including 15 patients during the height of the pandemic in NY;67% were seen by telemedicine. The median age was 75 years (interquartile range [IQR], 61-82), and 71% were women. The median NIH Stroke Score for patients with minor stroke was 0 (IQR, 0-1), and the median ABCD score for TIA patients was 3 (IQR, 2-3). Median time from symptom onset to evaluation was 3 days (IQR, 2.5-17.5). Median time from evaluation to laboratory diagnostics was 8 hours (IQR, 2-21), and to completion of imaging was 1 day (IQR, 0-5). Outpatient telemetry commenced in a median of 5 days (IQR, 1-9), and echocardiography was completed in a median of 8 days (IQR, 0-10). One patient was referred to the emergency room for a carotid occlusion. Final diagnoses were TIA (n=12), ischemic stroke (n=5), transient global amnesia (n=2), migraine (n=1), and non-aneurysmal, distal subarachnoid hemorrhage (n=1). Secondary prevention was initiated or optimized in 94% of TIA and stroke patients. Recurrent TIA occurred in 1 patient after 67 days, and ischemic stroke occurred in 1 patient 55 days after TIA. Conclusion: Timely outpatient evaluation of patients with recent TIA and minor, non-disabling stroke is feasible and may be useful during the pandemic, especially during emergency room crowding.","output":"Outpatient evaluation of transient ischemic attack and minor, non-disabling stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory symptoms are one of COVID-19 manifestations, and the metalloproteinases (MMPs) have essential roles in the lung physiology. We sought to characterize the plasmatic levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in patients with severe COVID-19 and to investigate an association between plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels and clinical outcomes and mortality. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels in plasma from patients with COVID-19 treated in the ICU (COVID-19 group) and Control patients were measured with the zymography. The study groups were matched for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, BMI, and obesity profile. MMP-2 levels were lower and MMP-9 levels were higher in a COVID-19 group (p<0.0001) compared to Controls. MMP-9 levels in COVID-19 patients were not affected by comorbidity such as hypertension or obesity. MMP-2 levels were affected by hypertension (p<0.05), but unaffected by obesity status. Notably, hypertensive COVID-19 patients had higher MMP-2 levels compared to the non-hypertensive COVID-19 group, albeit still lower than Controls (p<0.05). No association between MMP-2 and MMP-9 plasmatic levels and corticosteroid treatment or acute kidney injury was found in COVID-19 patients. The survival analysis showed that COVID-19 mortality was associated with increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels, age, hypertension, BMI, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 were better predictors of mortality during hospitalization than SAPS3 and SOFA scores at hospital admission. In conclusion, a significant association between MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels and COVID-19 was found.

This retrospective observational study (January 2020-June 2021) analysed the impact of monthly virtual HF multi-specialty multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings to address the management of associated comorbidities and thereby upon provision, cost of care and HF outcomes. Methods Patients acted as their own controls, with outcomes compared for equal periods (for each patient) pre versus post-MDT meeting. The MDT comprised of HF cardiologists (primary, secondary, tertiary care), HF specialist nurses (hospital, community), nephrologist, endocrinologist, palliative care specialist, chest physician, pharmacist, clinical pharmacologist and geriatrician. Outcome measures were 1) all-cause hospitalisations, 2) outpatient clinic attendances, and 3) cost. Results 334 patients (mean age 72.5 +/- 11 years) were discussed virtually through MDT meetings and follow-up duration was 13.9 +/- 4 months. The mean age-adjusted Charlson Co-morbidity Index was 7.6 +/- 2.1 and Rockwood Frailty Score was 5.5 +/- 1.6. The mean number of clinic attendances prevented was 1.6 +/- 0.4. The total cost of funding monthly meetings for the duration of the study was 32400 pounds and the 64 clinic appointments generated cost 9600 pounds. The MDT meetings prevented 534 clinic appointments (cost saving 80,100 pounds) and reduced all-cause hospitalisations (pre-MDT meeting 1.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.1 post-MDT meeting; p<0.001), reduction of 1586 hospital bed-days and cost-savings of 634,400 pounds. The total cost-saving to the healthcare system was 672,500 pounds. Conclusion The HF multispecialty virtual MDT model provides integration of care across all tiers of healthcare for HF management and a holistic approach addressing associated co-morbidities.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use a database of 1218 overviews (2000C2020) created from a bibliometric study as the basis of our search for studies assessing discordance (called discordant reviews). This bibliometric study searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Epistemonikos and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for overviews. We will include any study using Jadad (1997) or another method to assess discordance. The first 30 studies screened at the full-text stage by two independent reviewers will be included. We will replicate the authors Jadad assessments. We will compare our outcomes qualitatively and evaluate the differences between our Jadad assessment of discordance and the authors assessment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethics approval was required as no human subjects were involved. In addition to publishing in an open-access journal, we will disseminate evidence summaries through formal and informal conferences, academic websites, and across social media platforms.

Objective: To determine whether discontinuation compared with continuation of ACEIs or ARBs changed the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial of 659 patients hospitalized in Brazil with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were taking ACEIs or ARBs prior to hospitalization (enrolled: April 9-June 26, 2020; final follow-up: July 26, 2020). Interventions: Discontinuation (n = 334) or continuation (n = 325) of ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Secondary outcomes included death, cardiovascular death, and COVID-19 progression. Results: Among 659 patients, the median age was 55.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46.1-65.0 years), 14.7% were aged 70 years or older, 40.4% were women, and 100% completed the trial. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6 days (IQR, 4-9 days) and 27.2% of patients had an oxygen saturation of less than 94% of room air at baseline. In terms of clinical severity, 57.1% of patients were considered mild at hospital admission and 42.9% were considered moderate. There was no significant difference in the number of days alive and out of the hospital in patients in the discontinuation group (mean, 21.9 days [SD, 8 days]) vs patients in the continuation group (mean, 22.9 days [SD, 7.1 days]) and the mean ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.01). There also was no statistically significant difference in death (2.7% for the discontinuation group vs 2.8% for the continuation group; odds ratio [OR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.38-2.52]), cardiovascular death (0.6% vs 0.3%, respectively; OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.19-42.12]), or COVID-19 progression (38.3% vs 32.3%; OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.95-1.80]). The most common adverse events were respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (9.6% in the discontinuation group vs 7.7% in the continuation group), shock requiring vasopressors (8.4% vs 7.1%, respectively), acute myocardial infarction (7.5% vs 4.6%), new or worsening heart failure (4.2% vs 4.9%), and acute kidney failure requiring hemodialysis (3.3% vs 2.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 and who were taking ACEIs or ARBs before hospital admission, there was no significant difference in the mean number of days alive and out of the hospital for those assigned to discontinue vs continue these medications. These findings do not support routinely discontinuing ACEIs or ARBs among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 if there is an indication for treatment.

The olfactory epithelium (OE) is the peripheral organ for olfaction and is subject to acquired damage, suggesting a likely site of pathology in aging. Adult stem cells reconstitute the neuroepithelium in response to cell loss under normal conditions. In aged OE, patches of respiratory-like metaplasia have been observed histologically, consistent with a failure in normal neuroepithelial homeostasis. METHODS: Accordingly, we have focused on identifying cellular and molecular changes in presbyosmic OE. The study combined psychophysical testing with olfactory mucosa biopsy analysis, single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq), and culture studies. RESULTS: We identified evidence for inflammation-associated changes in the OE stem cells of presbyosmic patients. The presbyosmic basal stem cells exhibited increased expression of genes involved in response to cytokines or stress or the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. Using a culture model, we found that cytokine exposure drove increased TP63, a transcription factor acting to prevent OE stem cell differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest aging-related inflammatory changes in OE stem cells may contribute to presbyosmia via the disruption of normal epithelial homeostasis. OE stem cells may represent a therapeutic target for restoration of olfaction.

METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing ACT vs. any comparator condition in a sample of adults with psychosis. The outcome of interest was overall psychotic symptomatology. RESULTS The search identified seven published and eight unpublished trials (of which we were able to obtain data from one).

We aimed to compare the anxiety level between infertile female patients in quarantined and non-quarantined areas during the second wave of COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 759 infertile women were included in this cross-sectional study conducted through an online survey. Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) tool. Participants were divided into the quarantined group (QG) and non-quarantined group (Non-QG). Independent sample T-test and chi-square test were performed to examine the difference between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the average STAI score of the two groups of infertile women, but responses to the emotional state showed that women in the QG had a higher tendency to be anxious. Participants in QG spent more time paying attention to the dynamics of the epidemic every day, and their sleep (p < 0.01) and mood conditions were worse (p < 0.01) than in the Non-QG. The family relationship of QG is more tense than non-QG. Through the research on the infertility treatment information of the overall research population, it is found the average STAI-State (STAI-S) (p = 0.031) score and STAI-Trait (STAI-T) (p = 0.005) score of women who were infertile for more than 3 years were significantly higher than those of women with <2 years. The STAI-T score of infertile women who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) was higher than that of non-IVF women (p = 0.007), but no significant difference was observed with the STAI-S score.

The aim of this study was to evaluate sleep quality and psychological effects of pediatric healthcare workers during COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and to evaluate potential differences between Primary and Secondary Care operators. Methods: : Pediatric healthcare workers were involved in an online survey aimed to characterize responders and to define their clinical expertise in the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during pandemic. Using validated scores, the online questionnaire assessed sleep quality, stress and anxiety level, self-efficacy and social support in pediatric healthcare workers. Results: : During COVID-19 outbreak, 67.43% of our population were suffering sleep disturbance, and we found a positive correlation between sleep disturbances with stress and anxiety. Furthermore, 19.42% of subjects were suffering anxiety and 53% were at risk of developing an acute stress disorder. Stress resulted inversely correlated with self-efficacy and social support.Secondary care operators were more affected than family pediatricians by sleep disturbances, stress but especially by anxiety. Social support was considerably higher in secondary care operators compared to family pediatricians. Conclusions: Despite the less exposure and the less infection probability, much of pediatric healthcare workers were suffered sleep disturbance, anxiety and potential stress disorder.

Despite the potential public health risks, no assay for detecting them all at once has been developed. Hence, in this study, a multiplex RT-PCR (mRT-PCR) assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of SaV, EMCV, RVA and AstV from swine fecal samples.

Nevertheless, robust estimation of the SIR model presents a significant challenge, particularly with limited and possibly noisy data in the initial phase of the pandemic. METHODS: The K-means algorithm is used to perform a cluster analysis of the top 10 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, to observe if there are any significant differences among countries in terms of robustness. RESULTS: As a result of model variation tests, the robustness of parameter estimates is found to be particularly problematic in developing countries. The incompatibility of parameter estimates with the observed characteristics of COVID-19 is another potential problem. Hence, a series of research questions are visited.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the number and characteristics of emergency psychiatric consultations during the phase 1 of lockdown with respect to the same period in 2019 in a Department of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA) located in Lombardy region. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study including subjects consecutively admitted to two psychiatric emergency rooms of DMHA in Monza, Lombardy, Italy. Sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, referred symptoms, diagnosis and information on patients illness course following the emergency consultations were collected. No subjects were excluded for the purposes of the study. RESULTS: Between February 21st and May 3rd 2020, there was a marked reduction in the number of psychiatric emergency consultations, if compared to the same period of 2019. Subjects who were living in psychiatric residential treatment facilities, had cannabis addiction and a diagnosis of OCD were significantly more likely to present to emergency psychiatric consultations during lockdown.

In this paper we provide a framework to analyse how income inequality, besides other structural and policy-related features, shapes the trade-off between economic lockdown and contagion. We then supply empirical evidence, by means of simulation analysis, on the distributive effects of the lockdown for 31 European countries. Our results confirm that the lockdown is likely to significantly increase inequality and poverty and that the magnitude of the change is larger in more unequal countries.Such a cumulative process shapes a serious challenge for social and economic stability in the most vulnerable countries, which needs adequate policy response. However, the magnitude of the compensating measures is likely to be financially unsustainable, forcing them to lift necessary public health measures prematurely in order to avoid social collapse. This is likely to increase the risk of a new spread of the pandemic that might easily spill over to other countries.

Neighborhood deprivation has been observed to be associated with poorer health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 in Louisiana. Methods: The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was calculated and used to classify neighborhood deprivation at the census tract level. A total of 17 US census variables were used to calculate the ADI for each of the 1148 census tracts in Louisiana. The data were extracted from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018. The neighborhoods were categorized into quintiles as well as low and high deprivation. The publicly available COVID-19 cumulative case counts by census tract was obtained from the Louisiana Department of Health website on July 31, 2020. Descriptive and Poisson regression analyses were performed. Results: Neighborhoods in Louisiana were substantially different with respect to deprivation. The ADI ranged from 136.00 for the most deprived neighborhood and -33.87 in the least deprived neighborhood. We observed that individuals residing in the most deprived neighborhoods had a 45% higher risk of COVID-19 disease compared to those residing in the least deprived neighborhoods. Conclusion: While the majority of previous studies were focused on very limited socio-environmental factors such as crowding and income, this study used a composite area-based deprivation index to examine the role of neighborhood environment on COVID-19. We observed a positive relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 risk in Louisiana.

Therefore, applying effective screening strategies and infection control measures is essential to control the spread of the epidemic within hemodialysis centers. OBJECTIVE: Description and evaluation of the efficacy of systematic screening by rt-PCR and viral cultures, in addition to triage to limit the spread of the epidemic. Evaluation of the performance of these tests using post-hoc SARS-CoV-2 serology as a surrogate marker of infection. METHODS: One hundred and forty-four patients undergoing hemodialysis in the Nephrology-Hemodialysis center of CHU Brugmann, Brussels, benefited from systematic virological screening using viral cultures in asymptomatic patients, or molecular tests (rt-PCR) for symptomatic ones, in addition to general prevention measures. Post-hoc serology was performed in all patients. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (26.3%) individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Seventeen infected patients (44.7%) were asymptomatic and thus detected by viral culture. Our strategy allowed us to detect and isolate 97.4% of the infected patients, as proven by post-hoc serology. Only one patient, missed by clinical screening and sequential viral cultures, had a positive serology. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a control and prevention strategy based on a systematic clinical and virological screening showed its effectiveness in limiting (and shortening) the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic within our hemodialysis unit.

In the present study, a novel intelligent optimization algorithm, known as WCC (World Competitive Contests), has been proposed and applied to find the transcriptional factor binding sites (TFBS) and eight benchmark functions discovery processes. We recognize the need to introduce an intelligent optimization algorithm because the TFBS discovery is a biological and an NP-Hard problem. Although there are some intelligent algorithms for the purpose of solving the above-mentioned problems, an optimization algorithm with good and acceptable performance, which is based on the real parameters, is essential. Like the other optimization algorithms, the proposed algorithm starts with the first population of teams. After teams are put into different groups, they will begin competing against their rival teams. The highly qualified teams will ascend to the elimination stage and will play each other in the next rounds. The other teams will wait for a new season to start. In this paper, were going to implement our proposed algorithm and compare it with five famous optimization algorithms from the perspective of the following: the obtained results, stability, convergence, standard deviation and elapsed time, which are applied to the real and randomly created datasets with different motif sizes.

We sought to develop and implement a weighted lottery to more equitably allocate scarce COVID-19 medications in a large U.S. health system. METHODS: We convened a multi-institution consortium of experts in bioethics, economics, health disparities, medicine, pharmacy, and health law to develop the weighted lottery. The UPMC Patient and Family Advisory Council and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Ethical Allocation Committee reviewed and endorsed the framework. We implemented the weighted lottery during periods when there was inadequate remdesivir to treat all patients in need. We used administrative data to ascertain the number and characteristics of patients who, on days of drug shortage: 1) were eligible for remdesivir;2) were offered remdesivir;and 3) accepted remdesivir. RESULTS: We implemented the weighted lottery across 23 hospitals in the UPMC health system during periods of drug shortage in May-July 2020. We proactively identified eligible patients using an EHR-and telephone-based screening system. To determine the general population chances in the lottery, each week we divided the number of available treatment courses by the predicted number of patients who would be eligible that week, based on the number of eligible patients in the prior week. The table contains the weighting factors in the remdesivir lottery. An allocation team met daily to apply the weighting system that determined each eligible patient's chance, then used a random number generator to run the lottery. Overall, 93 patients met the clinical eligibility criteria outlined in the FDA's emergency use authorization;44% were from disadvantaged neighborhoods, 20% were essential workers, and 9% had an underlying end-stage medical condition. During the periods of drug shortage, the general population chances to receive treatment ranged from 28%-88%. 59% of eligible patients (55 of 93) were allocated remdesivir, 13% of whom (7 of 55) refused the treatment. Overall 61% of drug was allocated to patients who were from disadvantaged neighborhoods and/or were essential workers, who made up 56% of the population. &gt;CONCLUSIONS: We developed and implemented a weighted lottery to promote equity in the allocation of scarce COVID-19 therapeutics. The lottery resulted in heightened access to treatment among groups that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, though larger weightings may be needed to substantially mitigate disparities.

Evidence from previous emerging infectious disease outbreaks points to the role of perceived risk, worry, media coverage, and knowledge in shaping engagement with health-protective behaviours as well as vaccination intentions. The current study examined these factors in 2,174 Australian residents. An online survey was completed between 2-9 March 2020, at an early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. Results revealed that two thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread COVID-19 outbreak in Australia (which subsequently occurred). Worry about the outbreak and closely following media coverage were consistent predictors of health-protective behaviours (both over the previous month, and intended behaviours in the case of a widespread outbreak) as well as vaccination intentions. Health-behaviour engagement over the previous month was lower in some demographic groups, including males and younger individuals (18-29 age group). These was a substantial mismatch between respondents' expected symptoms of infection and emerging evidence that a meaningful proportion of people who contract the novel coronavirus will experience asymptomatic infection (i.e., they will not experience symptoms associated with COVID-19). Only 0.3% of those in the current study believed that they personally would not experience any symptoms if they were infected. Uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 were common, including one third of respondents who reported being unsure whether people are likely have natural or existing immunity. There was also uncertainty around whether specific home remedies (e.g., vitamins, saline rinses) would offer protection, whether the virus could spread via the airborne route, and whether the virus was human made and deliberately released. Such misconceptions are likely to cause concern for members of the public. These results point to areas of uncertainty that could be usefully targeted by public education campaigns, as well as psychological and demographic factors associated with engagement with health-protective behaviours. These findings offer potential pathways for interventions to encourage health-protective behaviours to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Public perceptions of COVID-19 in Australia: perceived risk, knowledge, health-protective behaviours, and vaccine intentions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A low frequency peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulation, referred to as natural interferon-producing (NIP) cells, is described as producing interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) following contact with non-infectious viral structures, namely viral glycoproteins.

In this review, we aim to narrate the current state of the literature on telehealth applied to migraine care. First, telemedicine in the context of non-acute headache management has been shown to produce non-inferior patient outcomes when compared to traditional face-to-face appointments. The assignment of patients to telehealth appointments should be made after referring more urgent cases to dedicated in-person clinics. During the virtual appointment, physicians can ask their patients about the \\"3 F's\\" in order to perform a thorough assessment of their headaches: frequency of headache days, frequency of acute medication usage and functional impairment. Clinical assessment scores that have been studied and deemed feasible for telemedicine, safe and efficient include the HIT-6, VAS and MIDAS scores. Although MIDAS was found to be redundant and inadequate to use on a daily basis, we suggest that it can be useful in periodic remote follow-up appointments. Additionally, several mobile health apps have been studied including Migraine Buddy, Migraine Coach and Migraine Monitor. All of these are appropriate for use in telemedicine when combined with an adequate trial period with Migraine Buddy being rated the highest, as it captures the most detailed clinical picture. High satisfaction rates have been reported for virtual headache management which were shown to be equal to in-person consults. These are based on patients' perceived increase in convenience due to avoided travel time, less disruption of their daily routine and feeling more comfortable in the environment of their choice.

ObjectivesTo estimate mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) as measured by risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis matched test-negative case-control study was conducted using SARS-CoV-2 test results at Veterans Health Administration sites from December 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021. VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and death were estimated using electronic health records from veterans who routinely sought care at a VHA facility and had a test result positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases) or negative for SARS-CoV-2 (controls). Data were analyzed from December 1, 2021 to January 14, 2022. ExposuresVaccination status, defined as number of mRNA vaccine doses (1, 2, 3 or more) as the primary explanatory variable, at time of test. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe main outcome of interest was a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on a polymerase chain reaction or antigen test. Secondary outcomes included COVID-19-related hospitalization and death, defined by discharge data and proximity of event to positive test result. VE was estimated from odds ratios for SARS-CoV-2 infection with 95% CIs. ResultsVE for those who have received a mRNA vaccine booster is 77% (95%, 75 to 79) against Delta while 62% (95%, 59 to 65) against Omicron infection, 91% (95%, 85 to 94) against COVID-related hospitalization with better VE against Omicron, and 96% (95%, 91 to 98) against COVID-related death with no discernable difference between Omicron and Delta. However, without a booster, VE against COVID-related death decreases to 76% (95%, 62 to 85). ConclusionsAlthough Omicron is highly contagious and more likely to result in breakthrough infections against the current mRNA vaccines, a mRNA vaccine booster is still effective against severe COVID-related outcomes.","output":"Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines against Omicron among Veterans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The immune response within the tumor microenvironment plays a key role in tumorigenesis and determines the clinical outcomes of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, to date, a paucity of robust, reliable immune-related biomarkers has been identified that are capable of estimating prognosis in HNSCC patients. METHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed in tumors and matched adjacent tissues from five HNSCC patients, and the immune signatures expression of 730 immune-related transcripts selected from the nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel were assessed. Survival analyzes were performed in a training cohort, consisting of 416 HNSCC cases, retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A prognostic signature was built, using elastic net-penalized Cox regression and backward, stepwise Cox regression analyzes. The outcomes were validated by an independent cohort of 115 HNSCC patients, using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry staining. Cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) was also used to estimate the relative fractions of 22 immune-cell types and their correlations coefficients with prognostic biomarkers. RESULTS: Collectively, 248 immune-related genes were differentially expressed in paired tumors and normal tissues using RNA sequencing. After process screening in the training TCGA cohort, four immune-related genes (PVR, TNFRSF12A, IL21R, and SOCS1) were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). Integrating these genes with Path_N stage, a multiplex model was built and suggested better performance in determining 5 years OS (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC)=0.709) than others. Further protein-based validation was conducted in 115 HNSCC patients. Similarly, high expression of PVR and TNFRSF12A were associated with poor OS (Kaplan-Meier p=0.017 and 0.0032), while high expression of IL21R and SOCS1 indicated favorable OS (Kaplan-Meier p<0.0001 and =0.0018). The integrated model with Path_N stage still demonstrated efficacy in OS evaluation (Kaplan-Meier p<0.0001, ROC AUC=0.893). Besides, the four prognostic genes were significantly correlated with activated CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, follicular helper T cells and regulatory T cells, implying the possible involvement of these genes in the immunoregulation and development of HNSCC. CONCLUSIONS: The well-established model encompassing both immune-related biomarkers and clinicopathological factor might serve as a promising tool for the prognostic prediction of HNSCC.","output":"Prognostic value of novel immune-related genomic biomarkers identified in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is experiencing one of the major viral outbreaks of this millennium, caused by a plus sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, COVID-19, declared as pandemic by WHO.

The present study revealed that the phosphorylation of Ser725 was an essential step for the priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. We also showed that Ser725 was directly phosphorylated by misshapen (Msn)/NIK-related kinase 1 (MINK1), depending on the direct interaction between MINK1 and the NLRP3 LRR domain. MINK1 deficiency reduced NLRP3 activation and suppressed inflammatory responses in mouse models of acute sepsis and peritonitis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) upregulated the kinase activity of MINK1 and subsequently promoted inflammasome priming via NLRP3 Ser725 phosphorylation. Eliminating ROS suppressed NLRP3 activation and reduced sepsis and peritonitis symptoms in a MINK1-dependent manner. Altogether, our study reveals a direct regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by Msn family kinase MINK1 and suggests that modulation of MINK1 activity is a potential intervention strategy for inflammasome-related diseases.","output":"Priming of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by Msn kinase MINK1 in macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Problematic Internet use (PIU) is a risk factor for psychological distress during COVID-19, as teachers are a psychologically vulnerable population.

We empirically evaluated the relationships among these research variables in explaining teachers psychological distress during COVID-19. Online survey data were collected from 9030 teachers. A high proportion of participants demonstrated psychological distress: depression (20.4%), anxiety (26.4%), and stress (10.2%). Structural equation modeling was used to test our proposed conceptual model, wherein PIU behaviors served as predictors, mediated by fear of COVID-19 and PNT of online teaching, for teachers psychological distress. With ideal model fit, the results of the path coefficients indicated that PIU behaviors were associated with fear of COVID-19 (p < 0.001); fear of COVID-19 and PNT of online teaching were associated with psychological distress (p < 0.001); and fear of COVID-19 was also positively associated with PNT of online teaching (p < 0.001). PSU and PSMU had an indirect positive effect on psychological distress through the mediator of fear of COVID-19 and PNT of online teaching.

Research points to motherhood being linked to womens victimization, with pregnancy being a particular point of risk.

Less clear is the relationship between mothers victimization of different types of abuse and other factors such as age, socioeconomic status, and level of education. The article makes an original contribution to knowledge by addressing these limitations of the existing literature. Using nationally representative data from a Scottish longitudinal survey (N = 3,633) into childrens development this article investigates the social stratification of mothers exposure to different types of abuse, including coercive control, physical abuse, and threats. Overall, 14% of mothers report experiencing any type of domestic abuse since the birth of the study child (age 6), of which 7% experienced physical abuse. Compared to mothers in the highest income households, mothers in the lowest income quintile were far more likely to experience any form of abuse (Logistic Regression, OR = 3.55), more likely to have experienced more types of abuse and to have experienced these more often (OR = 5.54). Age had a protective effect, with mothers aged 20 or younger at most risk of abuse (OR = 2.60 compared to mothers aged 40+). Interaction effects between age and income suggested that an intersectional lens may help explain the cumulative layers of difficulty which young mothers on low incomes may find themselves in when it comes to abusive partners. The pattern of social stratification remained the same when comparing different types of abuse. Mothers of boys were more likely to experience abuse, and to experience more types of abuse, more often.

We aimed to identify the attitudes and perceptions of Gastroenterology Fellowship Program Directors (PDs) and applicants regarding the virtual interview experience and the role of virtual interviews (VI) in the future. METHODS: We designed separate surveys targeting PDs and applicants using the Qualtrics software. At the end of the interview season, we e-mailed both survey links to all PDs and requested that they forward the applicant survey to their interviewed candidates. Surveys were voluntary and anonymous. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data with results presented as percentages. RESULTS: A total of 29.7% of PDs completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 46.5% of PDs to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. Yet, 69.1% envisioned a role for VI in the future. A total of 14.2% of applicants completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 42.3% of applicants to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. However, 61.8% saw a future role for VI. While both applicants and PDs reported that establishing an interpersonal connection was a disadvantage with VI, applicants placed more emphasis on this need for connection (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, PDs and applicants report mixed views with regard to VI but anticipate that it may continue to have a future role. VI may augment future recruitment cycles with care taken to not disadvantage applicants, who rely heavily on the interview process to create personal connections with programs.

Some medications such as >2 weeks of corticosteroid therapy can influence HBV reactivation; therefore, screening tests that measure hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody, and hepatitis B surface antibody prior to therapy are required. Additionally, because HBV reactivation has been reported in patients positive for HBsAg treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the prophylactic administration of nucleos(t)ide analogues prior to administering ICIs is recommended for HBsAg-positive patients. Under these circumstances, highly sensitive novel biomarkers are expected to be used for the early diagnosis of HBV reactivation. Recently, a fully automated high-sensitive HBsAg assay (detection limit: 5 mIU/mL) by Lumipulse HBsAg-HQ, with 10-fold higher sensitivity than that of conventional assays, is currently used.

It is only the third option that can make affordable, comprehensive health care accessible for our entire population. As the debate goes forward over these alternatives during this election season, the likelihood of major change through a new system of national health insurance is becoming increasingly realistic. Rebuilding primary care and public health is a high priority as we face a new normal in US health care that places the public interest above that of corporate stakeholders and Wall Street investors.

The increasing prevalence of malignancy has become a leading cause of human mortality. However, conflicting findings have been published on the association between malignancy and COVID-19 severity. This study aims to assess the pooled proportion of malignancy amongst 2019-nCov patients and to investigate the association between malignancy and COVID-19 severity. METHODS Correlative studies were identi?ed by systematically searching electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Sciences and Embase) up to September 2, 2020. All data analyses were carried out using Stata 15.0. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies consisting of 9475 confirmed COVID-19 patients (median age 54.4 years [IQR 49-62], 54.0% men) were included. The overall proportion of malignancy was 2.5% (95% CI 1.6%-3.4%). The proportion of malignancy was higher in patients with severe/critical 2019-nCoV than those in non-severe/non-critical group (3.9% [95% CI 2.0-6.3] vs 1.4% [95% CI 0.8-2.2]). Furthermore, pre-existing malignancy was associated with more than twofold higher risk of severe/critical patients with COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.65-3.06 I2 = 0.0%).

Estimates of postpartum depressive symptoms range from 6.5% to 12.9% and from 8.6% to 9.9% for postpartum anxiety. We sought to identify the role social support could play in mitigating PMADs. METHODS The data are drawn from the Listening to Mothers in California survey; results are representative of women who gave birth in 2016 in a California hospital. The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 was used to assess total symptoms of PMADs and anxiety and depressive symptoms individually. Two questions adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey were used to assess emotional, practical, and functional (combined) social support. After exclusions for missing data related to PMADs or social support, we analyzed data from 2,372 women. RESULTS At the time of survey administration (mean 5.7 months after birth), 7.0% of respondents reported elevated PMAD symptoms and 45.9% reported that they always received functional social support. In multivariable analysis, controlling for demographic and pregnancy-related factors and prenatal anxiety and depressive symptoms, women who reported consistent support had a prevalence of elevated PMAD symptoms one-half that of those who did not (adjusted odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.74). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that consistent social support serves as a robust protective factor against postpartum symptoms of PMADs. Because many predictors of PMADs are not modifiable, social support stands out as an important target for programmatic intervention, particularly in light of increased isolation related to the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic.","output":"The Relationship between Social Support and Postnatal Anxiety and Depression: Results from the Listening to Mothers in California Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. OBJECTIVE: We explored the clinical management of inpatients with COVID-19 in Italy. METHODS: A self-administered survey was sent by email to Italian physicians caring for adult patients with COVID-19. A panel of experts was selected according to their clinical curricula and their responses were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1,215 physicians completed the survey questionnaire (17.4% response rate). Of these, 188 (15.5%) were COVID-19 experts. Chest computed tomography was the most used method to detect and monitor COVID-19 pneumonia. Most of the experts managed acute respiratory failure with CPAP (56.4%), high flow nasal cannula (18.6%), and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (8%), while an intensivist referral for early intubation was requested in 17% of the cases. Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed as an antiviral in 90% of cases, both as monotherapy (11.7%), and combined with protease inhibitors (43.6%) or azithromycin (36.2%). The experts unanimously prescribed low-molecular-weight heparin to patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and half of them (51.6%) used a dose higher than standard. The respiratory burden in patients who survived the acute phase was estimated as relevant in 28.2% of the cases, modest in 39.4%, and negligible in 9%. CONCLUSIONS: In our survey some major topics, such as the role of non-invasive respiratory support and drug treatments, show disagreement between experts, likely reflecting the absence of high-quality evidence studies.

Government requirements to stay at home and avoid social and school settings may impact psychological well-being by modifying various behaviors such as problematic phone and Internet use, yet there is a paucity of research on this issue. This study examined whether the COVID-19 outbreak may have impacted problematic smartphone use (PSU), problematic gaming (PG), and psychological distress, specifically the pattern of relationships between PSU, PG, and psychological distress in schoolchildren. METHODS: Longitudinal data on psychological distress, PSU, and PG were collected from 575 children in primary schools in 3 waves: Waves 1 and 2 were conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak and Wave 3 during the outbreak. Cross-lagged panel models were used to examine relationships between factors across the 3 waves. RESULTS: Cross-lagged models found that higher levels of PSU were not significantly related prospectively to greater psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak, but this prospective relationship became significant during the COVID-19 outbreak. Whereas PG was associated prospectively with psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak (ie, between Waves 1 and 2), this association became nonsignificant during the COVID-19 lockdown (ie, between Waves 2 and 3). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak has seemed to change prospective relationships between PSU and psychological distress and PG and psychological distress in schoolchildren.

Therefore, this study is aimed to assess barriers and determinants of postpartum family-planning uptake among women visiting Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Health (MNCH) services in public health facilities of western Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study design with a quantitative method was conducted on 989 postpartum women in Western Ethiopia from September 1 to October 30, 2020. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using pretested structured questionnaires, entered using EPI-INFO version 7.0, and analyzed by SPSS version 25. Descriptive analysis and logistic regressions were performed. The adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used and statistical significance was declared at P-value < 0.05. RESULT: In this study, 56.1% of participants had used PPFP in the last year. The most commonly used method was injectable (51.7%). Family planning use before the index pregnancy (AOR = 2.09;95%CI:1.29,3,41),counselling on PPFP during antenatal care and delivery (AOR = 4.89;95%CI:2.31,10.37),health facility delivery (AOR = 7.61;95%CI:4.36,13.28), skilled birth attendance (AOR = 4.99;95%CI:2.88,8.64),COVID-19 restrictions (AOR = 0.59;95%CI:0.39,0.90) were factors associated with PPFP utilization.

Although multiple studies have sought to address possible effects of these variables on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, results of these studies have been varied. It is possible that at least some of the differing results are due to insufficient understanding of atmospheric science, including certain physical and chemical principles underlying selected meteorological variables, and how global seasons differ between tropical and temperate zones.

The IRB-approved questionnaire focused on adults with moderate-severe ARDS (PaO2:FiO2 < 150) with critical hypoxemia where dyssynchrony causes were addressed and PEEP optimized. Weekly reminders were sent twice. RESULTS: Respondents [173/342(50.5%)] primarily worked as an attending 117(75%) in a medical ICU 94(60%) for 128 weeks/year. COVID+ ARDS patients were twice as likely to receive a NMBI (5637 vs. 2819%;p< 0.01). Respondents somewhat/strongly agreed a NMBI: should be reserved until after a trial of deep sedation 142 (82%) or proning 59 (34%), be dose-titrated based on trainof- four monitoring 107(62%);and effectively reduced dyssynchrony 149(86%), plateau pressure 106(62%) and barotrauma 102(60%).

Although most viral infections can receive appropriate treatment thereby limiting damage to life and livelihood with modern medicine and early diagnosis, new types of viral infections are continuously emerging that need to be properly and timely treated. As time is the most important factor in the progress of many deadly viral diseases, early detection becomes of paramount importance for effective treatment. Aptamers are small oligonucleotide molecules made by the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Aptamers are characterized by being able to specifically bind to a target, much like antibodies. However, unlike antibodies, aptamers are easily synthesized, modified, and are able to target a wider range of substances, including proteins and carbohydrates. With these advantages in mind, many studies on aptamer-based viral diagnosis and treatments are currently in progress. The use of aptamers for viral diagnosis requires a system that recognizes the binding of viral molecules to aptamers in samples of blood, serum, plasma, or in virus-infected cells. From a therapeutic perspective, aptamers target viral particles or host cell receptors to prevent the interaction between the virus and host cells or target intracellular viral proteins to interrupt the life cycle of the virus within infected cells.

OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were (1) to develop a Japanese version of MARS and (2) to assess the translated versions reliability and validity in evaluating mHealth apps. METHODS: To develop the Japanese version of MARS, cross-cultural adaptation was used using a universalist approach. A total of 50 mental health apps were evaluated by 2 independent raters. Internal consistency and interrater reliability were then calculated. Convergent and divergent validity were assessed using multitrait scaling analysis and concurrent validity. RESULTS: After cross-cultural adaptation, all 23 items from the original MARS were included in the Japanese version. Following translation, back-translation, and review by the author of the original MARS, a Japanese version of MARS was finalized. Internal consistency was acceptable by all subscales of objective and subjective quality (Cronbach =.78-.89). Interrater reliability was deemed acceptable, with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) ranging from 0.61 to 0.79 for all subscales, except for functionality, which had an ICC of 0.40.

New York City is a racially and ethnically segregated city, and a longstanding destination of immigrants, making some neighborhoods more susceptible to greater levels of COVID-19 mortality than others. Using ZCTA-level data on COVID-19 deaths and demographic data from the American Community Survey, our descriptive and bivariate choropleth mapping analyses reveal that a racial, ethnic, and nativity-status hierarchy exists in the geographic distribution of COVID-19 mortality. Implications of these findings are discussed as they relate to residential segregation and persistent spatial inequalities faced by neighborhoods of color.","output":"COVID-19 Mortality in New York City across Neighborhoods by Race, Ethnicity, and Nativity Status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concomitant mechanical deformation and solidification of melts are relevant to a broad range of phenomena. Examples include the preparation of cotton candy, the atomization of metals, the manufacture of glass fibers, and the formation of elongated structures in volcanic eruptions known as Pele's hair. Usually, solid-like deformations during solidification are neglected as the melt is much more malleable in its initial liquid-like form. Here we demonstrate how elastic deformations in the midst of solidification, i.e., while the melt responds as a very soft solid ([Formula: see text] Pa), can lead to the formation of previously unknown periodic structures. Namely, we generate an array of droplets on a thin layer of liquid elastomer melt coated on the outside of a rotating cylinder through the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Then, as the melt cures and goes through its gelation point, the rotation speed is increased and the drops stretch into hairs. The ongoing solidification eventually hardens the material, permanently \\"freezing\\" these elastic deformations into a patterned solid. Using experiments, simulation, and theory, we demonstrate that the formation of our two-step patterns can be rationalized when combining the tools from fluid mechanics, elasticity, and statistics. Our study therefore provides a framework to analyze multistep pattern formation processes and harness them to assemble complex materials.","output":"Elastic amplification of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in solidifying melts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay reconsiders epidemic narratives through the lens of polio to examine temporal shifts and overlapping and conflicting temporalities and assess some of the stakes in how we conceptualize the epidemic dramaturgy.

Participants were 192 psychotherapists recruited through a convenience sample, from three different regions in the country. Therapists were asked to assess three measures: the Effectiveness of Online Therapy (EOT), Online Therapy Preparedness (OTP), and Attitude Toward Telemedicine in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (ATiPP) Questionnaires. Associations between EOT, OTP, and ATiPP, as well as demographic and professional variables, were analyzed using bivariate analyses. A multiple regression analysis was performed to assess the contribution of the independent variables to EOT. Therapists reported high levels of EOT, OTP, and ATiPP. In addition, years of experience in therapy were found to contribute to EOT. Increasing exposure to online therapy through education as well as investing in the training and preparation of therapists in online therapy may be a pathway to enhance more effective OT, especially among those who have little experience.

It is unknown which triage criteria for allocation of resources perform best to inform health system decision-making. We sought to summarize and describe existing triage tools and ethical frameworks to aid healthcare decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of triage criteria and ethical frameworks for the allocation of critical care resources during epidemics and pandemics. We searched Medline, EMBASE, and SCOPUS from inception to November 3, 2020. Full-text screening and data abstraction were conducted independently and in duplicate by three reviewers. Articles were included if they were primary research, an adult critical care setting, and the framework described was related to an infectious disease outbreak. We summarized each triage tool and ethical guidelines or framework including their elements and operating characteristics using descriptive statistics. We assessed the quality of each article with applicable checklists tailored to each study design. RESULTS: From 11,539 unique citations, 697 full-text articles were reviewed and 83 articles were included. Fifty-nine described critical care triage protocols and 25 described ethical frameworks. Of these, four articles described both a protocol and ethical framework. Sixty articles described 52 unique triage criteria (29 algorithm-based, 23 point-based). Few algorithmic- or point-based triage protocols were good predictors of mortality with AUCs ranging from 0.51 (PMEWS) to 0.85 (admitting SOFA > 11). Most published triage protocols included the substantive values of duty to provide care, equity, stewardship and trust, and the procedural value of reason. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes available triage protocols and ethical guidelines to provide decision-makers with data to help select and tailor triage tools. Given the uncertainty about how the COVID-19 pandemic will progress and any future pandemics, jurisdictions should prepare by selecting and adapting a triage tool that works best for their circumstances.","output":"Allocation of intensive care resources during an infectious disease outbreak: a rapid review to inform practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Much current global debate C as well as a great deal of political rhetoric C about global health and healthcare is characterised by a renewed emphasis on the goal of universal access throughout the world. While this goal has been achieved to varying extents in the United Kingdom, Canada and many countries in Europe, even within those countries where national health systems have long been in place, the pervasive shift in emphasis from health as a social value to health as a commodity within a capitalist market civilization is eroding the commitment to equitable access to healthcare. Against this background the challenge is much greater in low- and middle-income countries that lag behind C especially if aspirations to universal access go beyond primary care. The challenges of achieving greater equity in access to health and in health outcomes, in a middle-income country like South Africa, illustrate the magnitude of the tensions and gaps that need to be traversed, given the vast differences between healthcare provided in the private and public sectors. Understandably the concept of National Health Insurance (NHI) in South Africa has widespread support. The strategies for how a successful and effective NHI could be implemented, over what time-frame and what it covers are, however, very controversial issues. What tends to be ignored is that sustainable improvement in health in South Africa, and elsewhere, is not determined merely by medical care but more especially by social structures intimately linked to deeply entrenched local and global social, economic and political forces and inequalities.

The purpose of this study is compare presenting characteristics and outcomes of U.S. patients with COVID-19 in a nonurban setting to similar patients in an urban setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Hershey Medical Center (HMC), a 548-bed tertiary academic medical center in central Pennsylvania serving semi-urban and rural populations, from March 23, 2020, to April 20, 2020 (the first month of COVID-19 admissions at HMC). Patients and outcomes of this cohort were compared to published data on a cohort of similar patients from the New York City (NYC) area. RESULTS: The cohorts had similar age, gender, comorbidities, need for intensive care or mechanical ventilation, and most vital sign and laboratory studies. The NYCs cohort had shorter hospital stays (4.1 versus 7.2 days, P < .001) but more African American patients (23% versus 12%, P = .02) and higher prevalence of abnormal alanine (>60U/L; 39.0% versus 5.9%, P < .001) and aspartate (>40U/L; 58.4% versus 42.4%, P = .012) aminotransferase, oxygen saturation <90% (20.4% versus 7.2%, P = .004), and mortality (21% versus 1.4%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalists in nonurban environments would be prudent to use caution when considering the generalizability of results from dissimilar regions.

Given this regions lower rates of literacy and internet access, interactive voice response (IVR) systemCautomated telephone-based interventions have the potential to help overcome physical activity intervention barriers (literacy, internet access, costs, and transportation) but have yet to be extended to rural, underserved populations, such as in the Deep South. Thus, extensive formative research is being conducted to develop and beta test the Deep South IVR SystemCSupported Active Lifestyle intervention in preparation for dissemination in rural Alabama counties. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe the design and rationale of an ongoing efficacy trial of the Deep South IVR SystemCSupported Active Lifestyle intervention. METHODS: A two-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare a 12-month physical activity intervention versus a wait-list control condition in 240 underactive adults from 6 rural Alabama counties. The Deep South IVR SystemCSupported Active Lifestyle intervention is based on the Social Cognitive Theory and includes IVR-automated physical activityCrelated phone counseling (daily in months 0-3, twice weekly in months 4-6, and weekly in months 7-12) and support from local rural county coordinators with the University of Alabama ONeal Comprehensive Cancer Center Community Outreach and Engagement Office. The primary outcome is weekly minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (7-day physical activity recall; accelerometry) at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. Rural Active Living Assessments will be conducted in each rural county to assess walkability, assess recreational amenities, and inform future environment and policy efforts. RESULTS: This study was funded in March 2019 and approved by the institutional review board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham in April 2019. As of February 2020, start-up activities (hiring and training staff and purchasing supplies) were completed. Study recruitment and assessments began in September 2020 and are ongoing.

Results The initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS, odds ratio (OR), 1.35; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28-1.44; p < 0.001], delta NIHSS (changes in the NIHSS score from baseline to 24 h, OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70-0.79; p < 0.001), hypertension (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.32-3.31; p = 0.002), hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy, OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.20-4.11; p = 0.013), and the ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (HDL-C/LDL-C, OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.00-10.89; p = 0.049) (N2H3) were found to be independent predictors of a 3-month unfavorable outcome from multivariate logistic regression analysis and were incorporated in the N2H3 nomogram model. The AUC-ROC of the training cohort was 0.872 (95% CI, 0.841-0.902), and the AUC-ROC of the test cohort was 0.900 (95% CI, 0.848-0.953). Conclusion The study presented the N2H3 nomogram model, with initial NIHSS score, delta NIHSS, hypertension, Hhcy, and HDL-C/LDL-C as predictors. It therefore provides an individualized early prediction of the 3-month unfavorable outcome in AIS patients treated with intravenous rt-PA thrombolysis.","output":"Early prediction of the 3-month outcome for individual acute ischemic stroke patients who received intravenous thrombolysis using the N2H3 nomogram model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the worldwide burden of neglected tropical diseases, there is ongoing need to develop novel anthelmintic agents to strengthen the pipeline of drugs to combat these burdensome infections. Many diseases caused by parasitic flatworms are treated using the anthelmintic drug praziquantel (PZQ), employed for decades as the key clinical agent to treat schistosomiasis. PZQ activates a flatworm transient receptor potential (TRP) channel within the melastatin family (TRPM(PZQ)) to mediate sustained Ca(2+) influx and worm paralysis. As a druggable target present in many parasitic flatworms, TRPM(PZQ) is a promising target for a target-based screening campaign with the goal of discovering novel regulators of this channel complex. Here, we have optimized methods to miniaturize a Ca(2+)-based reporter assay for Schistosoma mansoni TRPM(PZQ) (Sm.TRPM(PZQ)) activity enabling a high throughput screening (HTS) approach. This methodology will enable further HTS efforts against Sm.TRPM(PZQ) as well as other flatworm ion channels. A pilot screen of ~16,000 compounds yielded a novel activator of Sm.TRPM(PZQ), and numerous potential blockers. The new activator of Sm.TRPM(PZQ) represented a distinct chemotype to PZQ, but is a known chemical entity previously identified by phenotypic screening. The fact that a compound prioritized from a phenotypic screening campaign is revealed to act, like PZQ, as an Sm.TRPM(PZQ) agonist underscores the validity of TRPM(PZQ) as a druggable target for antischistosomal ligands.","output":"Identification of novel modulators of a schistosome transient receptor potential channel targeted by praziquantel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA viruses are ubiquitous in nature, infecting every known organism on the planet. These viruses can also be notorious human pathogens with significant medical and economic burdens. Central to the lifecycle of an RNA virus is the synthesis of new RNA molecules, a process that is mediated by specialized virally encoded enzymes called RNA\\\\dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). RdRps directly catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates in an RNA\\\\templated manner. These enzymes are strikingly conserved in their structural and functional features, even among diverse RNA viruses belonging to different families. During host cell infection, the activities of viral RdRps are often regulated by viral cofactor proteins. Cofactors can modulate the type and timing of RNA synthesis by directly engaging the RdRp and/or by indirectly affecting its capacity to recognize template RNA. High\\\\resolution structures of RdRps as apoenzymes, bound to RNA templates, in the midst of catalysis, and/or interacting with regulatory cofactor proteins, have dramatically increased our understanding of viral RNA synthetic mechanisms. Combined with elegant biochemical studies, such structures are providing a scientific platform for the rational design of antiviral agents aimed at preventing and treating RNA virus\\\\induced diseases.

Few medical schools provide web-based medicine or telemedicine training to their learners, though this is likely to be important for future medical practice. OBJECTIVE: This tutorial communicates a framework for incorporating medical students into primary care telemedicine clinics. METHODS: A third-year medical student and internal medicine attending physician from the Johns Hopkins University completed telemedicine clinic visits in April 2020 by using a variety of video platforms and via telephone calls. RESULTS: Nine telemedicine visits were completed over 4 clinic days. Our patients were, on average, aged 68 years. The majority of patients were female (6/9, 67%), and most appointments were completed via a video platform (6/9, 67%). Additionally, our experience is summarized and describe (1) practical tips for how to prepare for a telehealth visit; (2) technology considerations; (3) recommendations for participation during a telehealth visit; (4) debriefing and feedback; (5) challenges to care; and (6) student, care provider, and patient reactions to telemedicine visits. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine clinics have been successfully used for managing patients with chronic conditions, those who have attended low-risk urgent care visits, and those with mental health concerns. Patients have reported high patient satisfaction scores for telemedicine visits, and the majority of patients are comfortable with having medical students as part of their care team. Moving forward, telemedicine will remain a popular method for receiving health care.

An assessment of mortality relative to mortality in the general population is presented. DESIGN: Retrospective population-based study. SETTING: Individual information on symptomatic confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients and subsequent deaths from any cause were compared with the all-cause mortality in the Swiss population of 2018. Starting 23 February 2020, mortality in COVID-19 patients was monitored for 80 days and compared with the population mortality observed in the same time of year starting 23 February 2018. PARTICIPANTS: 5 102 300 inhabitants of Switzerland aged 35-95 without COVID-19 (general population in spring 2018) and 20 769 persons tested positively for COVID-19 during the first wave in spring 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Sex-specific and age-specific mortality rates were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Absolute probabilities of death were predicted and risk was assessed in terms of relative mortality by taking the ratio between the sex-specific and age-specific absolute mortality in COVID-19 patients and the corresponding mortality in the 2018 general population. RESULTS: Absolute mortalities increased with age and were higher for males compared with females, both in the general population and in positively tested persons. A confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased the probability of death across all patient groups at least eightfold. The highest relative mortality risks were observed among males and younger patients. Male COVID-19 patients exceeded the population hazard for males (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.44). An additional year of age increased the population hazard in COVID-19 patients only marginally (HR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.01). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals, decision-makers and societies are provided with an additional population-adjusted assessment of COVID-19 mortality risk.

The occurrence and severity of bronchiolitis are dependent on patient-related factors (preterm birth, comorbidities, individual susceptibility), virus-related factors (RSV A), and environmental factors (pollution, environmental tobacco smoke, and others). Mortality rates in infants with bronchiolitis range from 0.005% to 0.2% according to patient-related factors. The pathophysiology of RSV bronchiolitis is unknown but clearly involves direct effects of the virus on the airway epithelium, airway immaturity, and recently identified effects of the inflammatory response. Immunopathologic mechanisms (e.g., IgE antibodies and CD4+ Th2 cells) play a role in some infants or in severe forms. Complete immunity to the virus is never achieved, and repeat infections are common in the young and the elderly, in whom the RSV causes about 5% of all lower respiratory tract infections. VPI3 infections usually cause bronchiolitis, whereas VPI1 and VPI2 infections manifest chiefly as laryngotracheitis. Little is known about the clinical expression of VPI4 infection.

Methods: Digital surveys were administered to 1118 Israeli parents. After VHPs were identified, three surveys were conducted to evaluate considerations that discourage or encourage vaccination. A logistic regression was carried out on sixteen models;of these, six were found to be statistically significant. Results: 456 parents data were analyzed. Parents intentions to vaccinate prior to the vaccination campaign were a good predictor of their actual behavior, (rp=.497, p<.001). We divided the parents into four groups: consistently pro-vaccine (39.4%), consistently anti-vaccine (15.2%), pro-vaccine parents who did not vaccinate (17.6%), and anti-vaccine parents who did vaccinate (27.9%). We identified eight considerations that were significant in VHPs vaccination behavior: trust in scientists, doctors and drug companies, childrens preferences, spread of COVID, social responsibility, childrens characteristics, the vaccines speed of development and its side effects.

Yet other systemic problems have been unearthed during this pandemic: the failure to coordinate the US public health system at the federal level and the effects of long-term disinvestment and neglect of state- and local-level public health programs. Together these failures have contributed to an inability to coordinate with the LTSS system and to act early to protect residents and staff in the LTSS care settings that are hotspots for infection, spread, and serious negative health outcomes. METHODS: We analyze several impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the US LTSS system and policy arrangements. The economic toll on state budgets has been multifaceted, and the pandemic has had a direct impact on Medicaid, the primary funder of LTSS, which in turn has further exacerbated the states' fiscal problems. Both the inequalities across race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status as well as the increased burden on unpaid caregivers are clear. So too is the need to better integrate LTSS with the health, social care, and public health systems. FINDINGS: We propose seven near-term actions that US policymakers could take: implementing a uniform public reporting of COVID-19 cases in LTSS settings; identifying and supporting unpaid caregivers; bolstering support for the direct care workforce; increasing coordination between public health departments and LTSS agencies and providers; enhancing collaboration and communication across health, LTSS, and public health systems; further reducing the barriers to telehealth in LTSS; and providing incentives to care for our most vulnerable populations. Our analysis also demonstrates that our nation requires comprehensive reform to build the LTSS system we need through comprehensive workforce development, universal coverage through comprehensive financing reform, and the creation of an age-friendly public health system. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has exposed the many deficits of the US LTSS system and made clear the interdependence of LTSS with public health. Policymakers have an opportunity to address these failings through a substantive reform of the LTSS system and increased collaboration with public health agencies and leaders. The opportunity for reform is now.","output":"COVID-19: The Time for Collaboration Between Long-Term Services and Supports, Health Care Systems, and Public Health Is Now"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Co-infections have a key role in virus transmission in wild reservoir hosts.

We performed a cross-sectional cohort study of hospitalized Jordanian children to evaluate antibiotic use for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS Admitting diagnoses from a prior viral surveillance cohort of hospitalized Jordanian children were dichotomized into suspected viral-like, non-pulmonary bacterial-like, and pulmonary bacterial-like infection. Stratifying by sex, we performed a polytomous logistic regression adjusting for age, underlying medical condition, maternal education, and region of residence to estimate prevalence odds ratios (PORs) for antibiotic use during hospitalization. Sensitivity and specificity of admission diagnoses and research laboratory results were compared. RESULTS Children with a suspected viral-like admission diagnosis, compared to those with suspected non-pulmonary bacterial-like, were 88% and 86% less likely to be administered an empiric/first-line antibiotic (male, aPOR: 0.12; female, aPOR: 0.14; p-value = <0.001). There were slight differences by sex with males having a lower prevalence than females in being administered an expanded coverage antibiotic; but they had a higher prevalence of macrolide administration than males with non-pulmonary bacterial-like infection. Overall, children with RSV had a 34% probability (sensitivity) of being assigned to a suspected viral-like diagnosis; whereas RSV-negative children had a 76% probability (specificity) of being assigned to a suspected pulmonary bacterial-like diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Hospitalized children with a suspected viral-like admission diagnosis were less likely to receive an empiric/first-line and expanded coverage antibiotic compared to suspected non-pulmonary and pulmonary infections; however, when evaluating the accuracy of admission diagnosis to RSV-laboratory results there were considerable misclassifications.

We sought to identify predictors of SHR and unplanned return to care (RTC). STUDY DESIGN: Mastectomy cases with and without reconstruction from October 2017 to August 2019 were analyzed. Patient characteristics, operative variables, and multimodal pain management were compared between admitted patients and SHR patients using logistic regression. We identified predictors of RTC in SHR patients, defined as 7-day readmission, reoperation, or emergency department visit. RESULTS: Of 2,648 mastectomies, 1,689 (64%) were outpatient and the average age of patients was 58.5 years. Predictors of SHR included perioperative IV acetaminophen (odds ratio (OR) 1.59, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.28-1.97), perioperative opiates (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.06-2.02), and operation performed by a high-volume breast surgeon (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.42-3.18). Bilateral mastectomies (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.91), immediate reconstruction (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39-0.70), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 3-4 (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54-0.87) decreased the odds of SHR. Of SHR patients, 111/1,689 (7%) patients experienced RTC. Patients with ASA Class 3-4 (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.29-3.14) and African-American ethnicity (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.38-4.91) were more likely to RTC; receiving IV Acetaminophen (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.88) and filling an opiate prescription (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.77) decreased the odds of RTC. CONCLUSION: Surgeon volume and multimodal pain medication increased the odds of SHR. Within the SHR group, ASA Class 3-4 and African American patients increased the likelihood of RTC.

In adults, the classification of septic patients by clinical AKI phenotypes (severity and timing) demonstrates unique associations with patient outcome vs. broadly defined AKI. METHODS: In a multinational prospective observational study, AKI diagnosis in critically ill septic children was stratified by duration (transient vs. persistent) and severity (mild vs. severe by creatinine change and urine output). The outcomes of interest were mortality and intensive care unit resource complexity at 28 days. RESULTS: Seven hundred and fifty-seven septic children were studied (male 52.7%, age 4.6 years (1.5C11.9)). Mortality (overall 12.1%) was different between severe AKI and mild AKI (18.3 vs. 4.4%, p < 0.001) as well as intensive care unit (ICU) complexity (overall 34.5%, 45 vs. 21.7%, p < 0.001). Patients with Persistent AKI had fewer ICU-free days (17 (7, 21) vs. 24 (17, 26), p < 0.001) and higher ICU complexity (52.8 vs. 22.9%, p = 0.002) than transient AKI, even after exclusion of patients with early mortality. AKI phenotypes incorporating temporal and severity data correlate with unique survival (range 4.4C21.6%) and ICU-free days (range of 15C25 days) CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of septic children with AKI changes by clinical phenotype. Our findings underscore the importance of prognostic enrichment in sepsis and AKI for the purpose of trial design and patient management. IMPACT: Although AKI occurs commonly in patients with sepsis (S-AKI), outcomes for children with S-AKI varies based on the severity and timing of the AKI. Existing S-AKI pediatric data utilize a broad singular definition of kidney injury. Increasing the precision of AKI classification results in a new understanding of how S-AKI associates with patient outcome.

Results A total of 29 articles met inclusion criteria, most of which originated from the United States (n=18, 62.1%). Rates of burnout ranged from 6.0% to 86.0%. Personal factors responsible for burnout were fear of contracting/transmitting COVID-19 (8 studies, 27.6%), female gender (8, 27.6%), and younger age (5, 17.2%). Professional factors contributing to burnout included increased COVID-19 patient clinical load (6, 20.7%), limited work experience (6, 20.7%), reduction in operative cases (5, 17.2%) and redeployment to COVID-19 wards (4, 13.8%). The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted surgical education due to reduced number of operative cases (11, 37.9%), decreased hands-on experience (4, 13.8%), and not being able to complete case requirements (3, 10.34%). The shift of didactics to virtual formats (3, 10.3%), increased use of telemedicine (2, 6.9%), and improved camaraderie among residents (1, 3.4%) were viewed as positive consequences.

Incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity suggest a contribution of additional genetic lesions to clinical manifestations and outcome. Some monogenic disorders may therefore actually be digenic. However, only a few digenic disorders have been reported, all discovered by candidate gene approaches applied to at least one locus. We propose here a novel two-locus genome-wide test for detecting digenic inheritance in WES data. This approach uses the gene as the unit of analysis and tests all pairs of genes to detect pairwise gene x gene interactions underlying disease. It is a case-only method, which has several advantages over classic case-control tests, in particular by avoiding recruitment and bias of controls. Our simulation studies based on real WES data identified two major sources of type I error inflation in this case-only test: linkage disequilibrium and population stratification. Both were corrected by specific procedures. Moreover, our case-only approach is more powerful than the corresponding case-control test for detecting digenic interactions in various population stratification scenarios. Finally, we validated our unbiased, genome-wide approach by successfully identifying a previously reported digenic lesion in patients with craniosynostosis. Our case-only test is a powerful and timely tool for detecting digenic inheritance in WES data from patients. Significance statement Despite a growing number of reports of rare disorders not fully explained by monogenic lesions, digenic inheritance has been reported for only 54 diseases to date. The very few existing methods for detecting gene x gene interactions from next-generation sequencing data were generally studied in rare-variant association studies with limited simulation analyses for short genomic regions, under a case-control design. We describe the first case-only approach designed specifically to search for digenic inheritance, which avoids recruitment and bias related to controls. We show, through both extensive simulation studies on real WES datasets and application to a real example of craniosynostosis, that our method is robust and powerful for the genome-wide identification of digenic lesions.","output":"A genome-wide case-only test for the detection of digenic inheritance in human exomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV is a newly emerging respiratory virus with a high case fatality rate among identified cases.

The source of the bloodmeal is identified by analyzing the remnants of blood remaining in the arthropod at the time of capture, though this is often fraught with challenges. This review provides a roadmap and guide for those considering modern techniques for arthropod bloodmeal identification with a focus on progress made in the field over the past decade. We highlight genome regions that can be used to identify the vertebrate source of arthropod bloodmeals as well as technological advances made in other fields that have introduced innovative new ways to identify vertebrate meal source based on unique properties of the DNA sequence, protein signatures, or residual molecules present in the blood. Additionally, engineering progress in miniaturization has led to a number of field-deployable technologies that bring the laboratory directly to the arthropods at the site of collection. Although many of these advancements have helped to address the technical challenges of the past, the challenge of successfully analyzing degraded DNA in bloodmeals remains to be solved. ABSTRACT: Understanding vertebrateCvector interactions is vitally important for understanding the transmission dynamics of arthropod-vectored pathogens and depends on the ability to accurately identify the vertebrate source of blood-engorged arthropods in field collections using molecular methods. A decade ago, molecular techniques being applied to arthropod blood meal identification were thoroughly reviewed, but there have been significant advancements in the techniques and technologies available since that time. This review highlights the available diagnostic markers in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and discusses their benefits and shortcomings for use in molecular identification assays. Advances in real-time PCR, high resolution melting analysis, digital PCR, next generation sequencing, microsphere assays, mass spectrometry, and stable isotope analysis each offer novel approaches and advantages to bloodmeal analysis that have gained traction in the field. New, field-forward technologies and platforms have also come into use that offer promising solutions for point-of-care and remote field deployment for rapid bloodmeal source identification. Some of the lessons learned over the last decade, particularly in the fields of DNA barcoding and sequence analysis, are discussed. Though many advancements have been made, technical challenges remain concerning the prevention of sample degradation both by the arthropod before the sample has been obtained and during storage. This review provides a roadmap and guide for those considering modern techniques for arthropod bloodmeal identification and reviews how advances in molecular technology over the past decade have been applied in this unique biomedical context.","output":"Modernizing the Toolkit for Arthropod Bloodmeal Identification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We systematically investigated the transcriptomes of the peripheral immune cells from 6 inactivated vaccine, BBIBP-CorV recipients at 4 pivotal time points using single-cell RNA-seq technique.

In this observational population-based study, we examined how psychological distress changed following the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis in the United States and tested whether certain population subgroups were vulnerable to persistent distress during the crisis. MethodsWe analyzed longitudinal nationally representative data from eight waves of the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between March 10th and July 20th, 2020 (N = 7319 Observations = 46145). Differences in distress trends were examined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and household income and by the presence of a pre-existing mental health diagnosis. Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). ResultsOn average psychological distress increased significantly by 0.27 standard deviations (95% CI [0.23,0.31], p<.001) from March 10-18 to April 1-14, 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis emerged and lockdown restrictions began in the US.

Although reports of gastric remnant necrosis after gastrectomy have been rare, mortality rates remain substantially high when present. A double elementary diet (W-ED) tube, which can be used for both enteral feeding and gastrointestinal tract decompression, has been developed for anastomotic leakage and postoperative nutritional management after upper gastrointestinal surgery. The current report presents a case of gastric remnant necrosis after proximal gastrectomy that was successfully managed through conservative treatment with a W-ED tube. CASE PRESENTATION A 73-year-old male was referred to our hospital for an additional resection after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric cancer. Endoscopic findings showed an ESD scar on the posterior wall of the upper portion of the stomach, while computed tomography (CT) showed no obvious regional lymph node enlargement and distant metastases. The patient subsequently underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy and esophagogastrostomy but developed candidemia on postoperative day 7. On postoperative day 14, endoscopy revealed gastric ischemic changes around the anastomotic site, suggesting that the patient's candidemia developed due to gastric necrosis. His vital signs remained normal, while the gastric remnant ischemia was localized. Given that surgery in the presence of candidemia was considered extremely risky, conservative treatment was elected. A W-ED tube was placed nasally, after which enteral feeding was initiated along with gastrointestinal tract decompression. Although the patient subsequently developed anastomotic leakage due to gastric remnant necrosis, local control was achieved and conservative treatment was continued. On postoperative day 52, healing of the gastric remnant necrosis and anastomotic leakage was confirmed, after which the patient started drinking water. Although balloon dilation was required due to anastomotic stenosis, the patient was able to resume oral intake and was discharged on postoperative day 88. CONCLUSIONS Herein, we present our experience with a case of gastric remnant necrosis after proximal gastrectomy, wherein conservative management was achieved using a W-ED tube. In cases involving high operative risk, the management should be mindful of gastric remnant necrosis as a post-gastrectomy complication.","output":"Successful management of gastric remnant necrosis after proximal gastrectomy using a double elementary diet tube: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE We performed laparoscopic gastrectomy using an umbilical port in addition with one other port (dual-ports laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy, DP-LADG) since December 2009.

Improving the nutrition of broilers is important for producing high-quality broiler meat. The inclusion of natural effective ingredients, such as ginger, in the diet of broilers did not adversely affect the palatability of the diet, nor did it cause anemia in the broilers. Rather, ginger enhanced the oxidative status and growth rate of broiler chickens. ABSTRACT: The effect of dietary ginger powder on the production performance, digestibility, hematological parameters, antioxidant status, dietary oxidation stability, and plasma cholesterol content of broiler chickens was investigated. Ginger powder was included in the diet at 0, 5, 10, or 15 g/kg. Total antioxidant capacity and malondialdehyde in sera samples, superoxide dismutase activity, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and malondialdehyde in liver samples, and the peroxide value and acid value of the stored diets were evaluated. The results showed that ginger inclusion significantly improved antioxidation indices in broiler sera and liver. Total body weight gain in ginger-supplemented birds was higher than that of control birds (p < 0.048). Supplementing the broiler chickens with ginger powder reduced total feed consumption (p < 0.031). White blood cell counts and the percentage of heterophils in the blood were increased in birds that received ginger supplementation (p < 0.001).

PTMs consist in target modifications by small chemical moieties or conjugation of lipids, sugars or polypeptides. Among them, ubiquitin and a large family of ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) share several features such as the structure of the small protein modifiers, the enzymatic cascades mediating the conjugation process and the targeted aminoacidic residue. In the brain, ubiquitination and two UBLs, namely sumoylation and the recently discovered neddylation orchestrate fundamental processes including synapse formation, maturation and plasticity, and their alteration is thought to contribute to the development of neurological disorders. Remarkably, emerging evidence suggests that these pathways tightly interplay to modulate the function of several proteins that possess pivotal roles for brain homeostasis as well as failure of this crosstalk seems to be implicated in the development of brain pathologies. In this review, we outline the role of ubiquitination, sumoylation, neddylation and their functional interplay in synapse physiology and discuss their implication in the molecular pathogenesis of Intellectual Disability (ID), a neurodevelopmental disorder that is frequently co-morbid with a wide spectrum of brain pathologies. Finally, we propose a few outlooks that might contribute to better understand the complexity of these regulatory systems in regard to neuronal circuit pathophysiology.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Ubiquitination, sumoylation and neddylation are related PTMs modulating cellular and molecular pathways that are essential to generate fully functional neuronal circuits. Their impairment is indeed implicated in the pathogenesis of several disorders, including ID.

Inactivated influenza vaccines are ineffective in infants under six months and to provide protection in older children generally require two doses given a month apart. This leaves few options for rapid protection of infants, e.g. during an influenza pandemic. We investigated whether Advax?, a novel polysaccharide adjuvant based on delta inulin microparticles could help overcome neonatal immune hypo-responsiveness and also whether it was possible to obtain single-dose influenza vaccine protection of babies against lethal infection. Inactivated influenza A/H1N1 vaccine (iH1N1) combined with Advax? adjuvant administered as a single immunization to 7-day-old mouse pups significantly enhanced serum influenza-specific IgM, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b levels in association with a 3C4 fold increase in the frequency of splenic influenza-specific IgM and IgG antibody secreting cells versus pups immunized with iH1N1 alone. Pups immunized with Advax-adjuvanted iH1N1 had significantly higher influenza-stimulated splenocyte production of IFN-, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 and a 3C10 fold higher frequency of T cells IFN- secreting IL-2, IL-4 or IL-17 by ELISPOT. Immunisation with iH1N1+Advax adjuvant induced robust protection against influenza virus challenge 3 weeks post-immunization, whereas pups immunized with iH1N1 alone had no protection. Protection by Advax-adjuvanted iH1N1 was mediated by serum antibody and memory B cells rather than memory T cells as protection was lost in neonatal MT mice that are B-cell deficient. Hence, Advax adjuvant overcame neonatal immune hypo-responsiveness and enabled single-dose protection of pups against otherwise lethal influenza infection, thereby supporting development of Advax? as a neonatal vaccine adjuvant.","output":"Advax Delta Inulin Adjuvant Overcomes Immune Immaturity In Neonatal Mice Thereby Allowing SingleCDose Influenza Vaccine Protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: This study aims to explore the patients experience with telemedicine (TM) as a method of care as well as its long-term implications for the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Telephonic interview was conducted for 78 patients who had availed TM services from April 23, 2020, to June 30, 2020. A predetermined indigenous questionnaire was used to evaluate patients experiences with TM. Primary outcome was the measurement of level of patient satisfaction and secondary outcome was evaluating the demographic profile of patients. Results: Most respondents were of 21C30 years (42.3%) and 64.1% of respondents were from urban areas. 87.1% respondents were satisfied with the medical care they received;94.8% respondents did not feel that their doctors hurried through their consultation. 19.2% respondents had encountered difficulty in using smartphones. 70.5% respondents perceived a positive role of TM in reducing their risk of contracting COVID-19. 62.8% respondents showed willingness to continue using TM services after the resumption of routine OPD services. 76.9% respondents felt that currently provided TM services did not need any improvements. 25.6% respondents needed physical visits to doctors even after availing TM services, for routine or emergency complaints. Conclusion: Patient satisfaction is high with TM services, and it can be adopted and incorporated into routine patient care especially in low-resource countries. Clinical significance: TM is expected to increase access to healthcare, while limiting patients geographic mobility. The implications and full potential of this service will be clear with long-term studies. ?

Immediate triage of suspected patients with chest infections caused by COVID-19 using chest CT may be of assistance when results from definitive viral testing are delayed. Purpose To develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) system to score the likelihood and extent of pulmonary COVID-19 on chest CT scans using the CO-RADS and CT severity scoring systems. Materials and Methods CORADS-AI consists of three deep learning algorithms that automatically segment the five pulmonary lobes, assign a CO-RADS score for the suspicion of COVID-19 and assign a CT severity score for the degree of parenchymal involvement per lobe. This study retrospectively included patients who received an unenhanced chest CT scan due to clinical suspicion of COVID-19 at two medical centers. The system was trained, validated, and tested with data from one of the centers. Data from the second center served as an external test set. Diagnostic performance and agreement with scores assigned by eight independent observers were measured using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, linearly-weighted kappa and classification accuracy. Results 105 patients (62  16 years, 61 men) and 262 patients (64  16 years, 154 men) were evaluated in the internal and the external test set, respectively. The system discriminated between COVID-19 positive and negative patients with areas under the ROC curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91-0.98) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84-0.93). Agreement with the eight human observers was moderate to substantial with a mean linearly-weighted kappa of 0.60  0.01 for CO-RADS scores and 0.54  0.01 for CT severity scores. Conclusion CORADS-AI correctly identified COVID-19 positive patients with high diagnostic performance from chest CT exams, assigned standardized CO-RADS and CT severity scores in good agreement with eight independent observers and generalized well to external data.","output":"Automated Assessment of CO-RADS and Chest CT Severity Scores in Patients with Suspected COVID-19 Using Artificial Intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Computational Metaphor, comparing the brain to the computer and vice versa, is the most prominent metaphor in neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI).

This study examined the characteristics (demographic, substance use and recovery, and mutual-help group use) of attendees of online recovery support meetings, and associations of online meeting attendance with substance use outcomes, using national data (without ensured representativeness) collected before the pandemic. METHODS: Data were from the Peer Alternatives in Addiction (PAL) Study of attendees of 12-step groups (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous), Women for Sobriety (WFS), LifeRing Secular Recovery (LifeRing), and SMART Recovery (SMART). The baseline sample, collected in 2015 (pre-pandemic), was 647 adults with lifetime alcohol use disorder who were surveyed online at baseline and 6-month (81%) and 12-month follow-up (83%). RESULTS: At baseline, 62% (n = 402) had attended an online mutual-help group meeting in their lifetime, and 36% (n = 236) had done so in the past 30 days. Bivariate analyses found that online meeting attendance was more likely among women than men, younger than older participants, and participants with more recent alcohol and drug use, and less abstinence self-efficacy. In addition, online meeting attendance was more likely among respondents who attended two or more different types of mutual-help groups (rather than just one type), and whose primary group was 12-step or WFS rather than LifeRing or SMART. Longitudinal analyses found an interaction between online meeting attendance (yes or no) and time on the outcomes of alcohol and total abstinence such that, compared to those who did not attend online meetings, online meeting attendees were less likely to be abstinent at baseline but were about the same on abstinence at 12 months. However, the interaction effect was attenuated when the model adjusted for mutual-help use characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The findings inform mutual-help groups, providers, and researchers' efforts to sustain and expand this resource by suggesting that online meeting attendance may have appeal and be helpful to mutual-help group members who are earlier in their recovery.","output":"Predictors and outcomes of online mutual-help group attendance in a national survey study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To investigate the relationshibetween coronavirus (COVID-19) and the risk of obesity for critically illness and ICU admitted brbrMethods:","output":"Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the Risk of Obesity for Critically Illness and ICU Admitted: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Epidemiological Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious illness that has rapidly spread throughout the globe.

A hard lockdown imposed on the country in March 2020, as an initial measure of containment of the novel virus, became unfeasible due to detrimental, mostly economic effects on the economy. From 1 May, the government eased the lockdown restrictions and shifted the emphasis from containment to behaviour change measures using communication strategies that promoted adherence. Yet, even within disadvantaged communities, there have been differences in health-related access with differing levels of disadvantage. Secondary data were analysed from a cross-sectional quantitative survey conducted in ten disadvantaged communities in the Northern Cape and Gauteng Provinces involving 1742 participants. Results show that the lack of digital access to information created an obstacle to adherence to some recommended COVID-19-related behaviour change measures. Disparities existed between the two provinces' disadvantaged communities based on an urban versus a rural province. The study emphasized the need to assess the extent of underlying obstacles to health equity and achievement of healthcare goals propagated by an interface between healthcare and socio-economic factors.

However, previous knowledge pertaining to the related SARS virus and other human coronaviruses may prove useful. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may provide a pattern for estimating infection degrees and observing the development of the epidemic. In this study, we aimed to investigate the persistence of antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 in recovered patients in Al Madinah region of Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods: A total of 150 recovered COVID-19 patients participated in this study. All the patients tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, using qualitative RT-PCR. An ELISA was used to measure anti-Spike (S) IgG antibodies in serum samples and screen for their persistence at various time points post-infection. Results: The patients were categorized as asymptomatic (27.3%), mild (28%) and moderate (44.7%) according to the disease severity. Amongst them, 35.3% were females (n = 53) and 64.7% were males (n = 97). Significant anti-S IgG antibody levels were observed among the different groups, with the patients in moderate group exhibiting the highest levels followed by the mild group;while the lowest levels were detected among the asymptomatic. There was a significant positive correlation between the patients' age and anti-S IgG antibody concentrations (Pearson r = 0.45;p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings provide a solid evidence to support the use of an anti-S IgG ELISA as a diagnostic tool to indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

At the same time, the dependence of the number of the infected people per day on time has a very uneven character and can be described very roughly by the logistic curve. To describe it, it is necessary to take into account the dependence of the model coefficients on time or on the total number of cases. Variations, for example, of the growth rate can reach 60%.

Evidence suggests sufficient nicotine delivery and satisfying effects are necessary to facilitate switching away from smoking; nicotine delivery varies across electronic nicotine delivery systems within limited nicotine concentrations. OBJECTIVES: To assess the nicotine delivery and subjective effects of prototype JUUL2 System in two nicotine concentrations, currently-marketed US JUUL System (JUUL), IQOS-brand heated tobacco product, and combustible cigarettes. METHODS: Adult smokers (N = 40) completed a 5-arm cross-over product-use laboratory confinement study. Nicotine pharmacokinetics and subjective effects were assessed following use of: (1) JUUL2 prototype 18 mg/mL nicotine; (2) JUUL2 prototype 40 mg/mL; (3) JUUL 59 mg/mL; (4) IQOS 18 mg/g; and (5) usual brand combustible cigarette, each evaluated during ad libitum (10 min) and controlled (5 min, 10 standardized puffs) use. RESULTS: Nicotine delivery was greatest for combustible cigarettes, followed by JUUL2 prototype 40 mg/mL, IQOS, JUUL2 prototype 18 mg/mL, and JUUL 59 mg/mL. Nicotine delivery from JUUL2 prototype 18 mg/mL was significantly greater than JUUL 59 mg/mL after ad libitum use. JUUL products were significantly more satisfying and effective at reducing craving than IQOS. JUUL2 prototype 40 mg/mL was significantly more aversive than other JUUL products.

In a given scenario, the study focused on the following key variables: communicable diseases, healthcare expenditures, population density, poverty, economic growth, and COVID-19 dummy variable in a panel of 76 selected countries from 2010 through 2019. The results show that the impact of communicable diseases on economic growth is positive because the infected countries get a reap of economic benefits from other countries in the form of healthcare technologies, knowledge transfers, cash transfers, international loans, aid, etc., to get rid of the diseases. However, the case is different with COVID-19 as it has seized the whole world together in a much shorter period of time and no other countries are able to help others in terms of funding loans, healthcare facilities, or technology transfers. Thus, the impact of COVID-19 in the given study is negatively impacting countries' economic growth that converts into a global depression.

However, immunoglobulins targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported to wane below the detectable level of serological assays. We estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from serology studies, accounting for expected levels of antibody acquisition (seroconversion) and waning (seroreversion), and apply this framework using data from New York City (NYC) and Connecticut. METHODS: We estimated time from seroconversion to seroreversion and infection fatality ratio (IFR) using mortality data from March-October 2020 and population-level cross-sectional seroprevalence data from April-August 2020 in NYC and Connecticut. We then estimated the daily seroprevalence and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: The estimated average time from seroconversion to seroreversion was 3C4 months. The estimated IFR was 1.1% (95% credible interval: 1.0C1.2%) in NYC and 1.4% (1.1C1.7%) in Connecticut. The estimated daily seroprevalence declined after a peak in the spring. The estimated cumulative incidence reached 26.8% (24.2C29.7%) and 8.8% (7.1C11.3%) at the end of September in NYC and Connecticut, higher than maximum seroprevalence measures (22.1% and 6.1%), respectively. INTERPRETATION: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is underestimated using cross-sectional serology data without adjustment for waning antibodies.

Average length of inpatient stay of the surviving population was longer compared to the cohort who died, (35.3 days vs 20.6 days, p=0.028). Stroke as a co-morbidity was associated with increased mortality in this patient cohort (p=0.006, <0.05). Obstructive lung disease is noted to be associated with an increased length of stay (33.4 days vs 20 days, p=0.011).ConclusionsThis study demonstrates quantifiable physical functional decline demonstrated by loss of independent function, increase in care requirements, increased frailty, and reduced mobility in this geriatric cohort post COVID-19 infection.","output":"Study of Outcomes and Characteristics of COVID-19 Positive Geriatric Patients in a Scottish Rehabilitation Community Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are RNA-infective viruses that could be considered principal players in universal high-profile outbreaks, namely the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, 2002-2003), the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012) and the continuing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19, 2019) pandemic.

Excessive neutrophil activity associates with hyperinflammation and tissue damage during pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, and coronavirus disease 2019. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) can modulate immune cells, including neutrophils, functions, therefore, nAChR ligands are considered as the potent agents for therapy of inflammation. Earlier it was shown, that about 30% of PMNs from the acute inflammatory site responded to nicotine by calcium spikes. In this study, we studied the generation of calcium spikes in murine granulocytes with different maturity level (evaluated by Gr-1 expression) isolated from bone marrow in response to ligands of nAChRs in control and under chronic nicotine consumption. It was found that nearly 20%-25% cells in the granulocyte population responded to nicotine or selective antagonists of different type of nAChRs (&#945;-cobratoxin, GIC, and Vc1.1). We demonstrated that in the control group Ca2+ -mobilizing activity was regulated through &#945;7 and &#945;9&#945;10 nAChRs in immature granulocytes (Gr-1int ), whereas in mature granulocytes (Gr-1hi ) it was regulated through &#945;7, &#945;3?2, and &#945;9-contained nAChRs. Sensitivity of PMNs to nicotine depended on their maturity level after chronic nicotine consumption. Gr-1int cells responded to nicotine through &#945;7 and &#945;9-contained nAChRs, while Gr-1hi did not respond to nicotine. Thus, calcium response to nAChR ligands in bone marrow PMNs depends on their maturity level.","output":"Calcium activity in response to nAChR ligands in murine bone marrow granulocytes with different Gr-1 expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pancreatitis in cats, although commonly diagnosed, still presents many diagnostic and management challenges. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current literature as it relates to etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of pancreatitis in cats and to arrive at clinically relevant suggestions for veterinary clinicians that are based on evidence, and where such evidence is lacking, based on consensus of experts in the field. ANIMALS: None. METHODS: A panel of 8 experts in the field (5 internists, 1 radiologist, 1 clinical pathologist, and 1 anatomic pathologist), with support from a librarian, was formed to assess and summarize evidence in the peer reviewed literature and complement it with consensus clinical recommendations. RESULTS: There was little literature on the etiology and pathogenesis of spontaneous pancreatitis in cats, but there was much in the literature about the disease in humans, along with some experimental evidence in cats and nonfeline species. Most evidence was in the area of diagnosis of pancreatitis in cats, which was summarized carefully. In contrast, there was little evidence on the management of pancreatitis in cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Pancreatitis is amenable to antemortem diagnosis by integrating all clinical and diagnostic information available, and recognizing that acute pancreatitis is far easier to diagnose than chronic pancreatitis. Although both forms of pancreatitis can be managed successfully in many cats, management measures are far less clearly defined for chronic pancreatitis.","output":"ACVIM consensus statement on pancreatitis in cats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This study aims to assess the impacts of the continuous pandemic state, gender and employment status on changes in substance use during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Here, we show that hospital admissions coupled with mobility data can reliably predict severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission rates and healthcare demand. Using a forecasting model that has guided mitigation policies in Austin, TX, we estimate that the local reproduction number had an initial 7-d average of 5.8 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.6 to 7.9) and reached a low of 0.65 (95% CrI: 0.52 to 0.77) after the summer 2020 surge. Estimated case detection rates ranged from 17.2% (95% CrI: 11.8 to 22.1%) at the outset to a high of 70% (95% CrI: 64 to 80%) in January 2021, and infection prevalence remained above 0.1% between April 2020 and March 1, 2021, peaking at 0.8% (0.7-0.9%) in early January 2021. As precautionary behaviors increased safety in public spaces, the relationship between mobility and transmission weakened. We estimate that mobility-associated transmission was 62% (95% CrI: 52 to 68%) lower in February 2021 compared to March 2020.

This study adopted a quantitative research method and collected the survey data from 160 undergraduate students enrolled in two courses at King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia, reflecting their individual experience with the system usage. Regression analysis and model assessment were tested using SmartPLS with the partial least square-structural equation modeling. The findings confirm the positive effects of the three dimensions on the e-learning usage in both models (direct effects and interaction effects). The quality dimension stands as the most significant driving force among the three dimensions. Furthermore, the findings show that instructor support positively moderates the relationship between the quality dimension and students' usage of e-learning, while it has insignificant negative interaction effects on both usability and interaction dimension.

Particles of oral/nasal fluid released by patients undergoing NHF therapy may pose a cross-infection risk, which is a potential concern for treating COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Liquid particles within the exhaled breath of healthy participants were measured with two protocols: (1) high speed camera imaging and counting exhaled particles under high magnification (6 participants) and (2) measuring the deposition of a chemical marker (riboflavin-5-monophosphate) at a distance of 100 and 500 mm on filter papers through which air was drawn (10 participants). The filter papers were assayed with HPLC. Breathing conditions tested included quiet (resting) breathing and vigorous breathing (which here means nasal snorting, voluntary coughing and voluntary sneezing). Unsupported (natural) breathing and NHF at 30 and 60 LPM were compared. RESULTS: 1. Imaging: During quiet breathing, no particles were recorded with unsupported breathing or 30 LPM NHF (detection limit for single particles 33 m). Particles were detected from 2 of 6 participants at 60 LPM quiet breathing at approximately 10% of the rate caused by unsupported vigorous breathing. Unsupported vigorous breathing released the greatest numbers of particles. Vigorous breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, released half the number of particles compared to vigorous breathing without NHF. 2. Chemical marker tests: No oral/nasal fluid was detected in quiet breathing without NHF (detection limit 0.28 L/m(3)). In quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, small quantities were detected in 4 out of 29 quiet breathing tests, not exceeding 17 L/m(3). Vigorous breathing released 200C1000 times more fluid than the quiet breathing with NHF. The quantities detected in vigorous breathing were similar whether using NHF or not. CONCLUSION: During quiet breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy may cause oral/nasal fluid to be released as particles, at levels of tens of L per cubic metre of air. Vigorous breathing (snort, cough or sneeze) releases 200 to 1000 times more oral/nasal fluid than quiet breathing (p < 0.001 with both imaging and chemical marker methods). During vigorous breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy caused no statistically significant difference in the quantity of oral/nasal fluid released compared to unsupported breathing. NHF use does not increase the risk of dispersing infectious aerosols above the risk of unsupported vigorous breathing. Standard infection prevention and control measures should apply when dealing with a patient who has an acute respiratory infection, independent of which, if any, respiratory support is being used.

Psychological well-being, an essential factor in preventing academic failure, has been threatened in this serious situation of unprecedented and stressful isolation. The aim of this study is to analyze the students cognitive-emotional regulation as well as their beliefs and perceptions about the pandemic and this lockdown situation. With this extensive study we are carrying out, want to describe the extent to which the lockdown situation is a risk factor, and, in the future, make proposals for preventive and palliative actions, if necessary, to minimize this potential risk. METHOD: We applied the CERQ Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire by means of an online application together with a questionnaire, CC/covid-19, of objective description and subjective perception of the lockdown situation of the students, their conditions to study, general opinions about the pandemic and specific opinions about the real possibilities of implementing online education in the middle of the academic year at the university. 1910 valid responses from more than 80 universities in 13 different Spanish-speaking countries were obtained and submitted to descriptive analysis and modeling using structural equations. RESULTS: Most of them consider that the lockdown decision is correct, that health systems are not prepared to deal with the pandemic, and that although the universities have adequate means, the teaching staff is not competent to implement online teaching methodologies. They have a good perception of the conditions of isolation, however, the time devoted to studying has not increased. One of the results of our study is the students self-evaluation about their digital competence and their capacity to perform in online interactive communication. This is key to rejecting a feeling of loneliness or social isolation, even if there is momentary physical separation with friends and classmates which is consistent with the results of emotional well-being the surveyed students present. The cognitive strategies used by the students surveyed have allowed them coping with events arising from the pandemic, mandatory isolation and university closure, certainly adaptive and functional, while maintaining a positive perception of their new living and learning situation.","output":"Evaluation of the Emotional and Cognitive Regulation of Young People in a Lockdown Situation Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Patients infected with SARS-Cov-2, the causative virus behind the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, have been increasing rapidly in New York City.

These strategies can be equally well applied to advance non-human health care research. To date, the glycomes of only a handful of non-human, non-domesticated vertebrates have been analyzed in depth due to the logistic complications associated with obtaining or handling wild-caught or farm-raised specimens. In contrast, the last 2 decades have seen advances in proteomics, glycoproteomics, and glycomics that have significantly advanced efforts to identify human serum/plasma biomarkers for various diseases. In this study, we investigated N-glycan structural diversity in serum harvested from five cultured fish species. This biofluid is a useful starting point for glycomic analysis because it is rich in glycoproteins, can be acquired in a sustainable fashion, and its contents reflect dynamic physiologic changes in the organism. Sera acquired from two chondrostrean fish species, the Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon, and three teleost fish species, the Atlantic salmon, Arctic char, and channel catfish, were delipidated by organic extraction and the resulting protein-rich preparations sequentially treated with trypsin and PNGaseF to generate released N-glycans for structural analysis.

Included studies used multivariate analysis within cohort, cross-sectional or case-control designs, of risk factors among young calves, assessing C. parvum specifically. We tabulated data on characteristics and study quality and present narrative synthesis. Fourteen eligible studies were found; three of which were higher quality. The most consistent evidence suggested that risk of C. parvum infection increased when calves had more contact with other calves, were in larger herds or in organic production. Hard flooring reduced risk of infection and calves tended to have more cryptosporidiosis during warm and wet weather.

The objective of this review was to summarize current evidence regarding the use of cloth masks to prevent respiratory viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), among health care clinicians. METHODS We searched 5 databases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, and the reference lists of identified articles on April 3, 2020. All identified publications were independently screened by 2 reviewers. Two authors independently extracted data and graded the studies. Randomized control trials (RCTs) were graded using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist, and observational and nonhuman subject studies were graded using 11 domains common across frequently used critical appraisal tools. All discrepancies were resolved by consensus. RESULTS Our search identified 136 original publications. Nine studies met inclusion criteria. We performed a qualitative synthesis of the data from these studies. Four nonrandomized trials, 3 laboratory studies, 1 single-case experiment, and 1 RCT were identified. The laboratory studies found that cloth materials provided measurable levels of particle filtration but were less efficacious at blocking biologic material than medical masks. The RCT found that cloth masks were associated with significantly more viral infections than medical masks. CONCLUSIONS The current literature suggests that cloth materials are somewhat efficacious in filtering particulate matter and aerosols but provide a worse fit and inferior protection compared to medical masks in clinical environments. The quality and quantity of literature addressing this question are lacking.

Through an interactive approach, we co-designed a bespoke in-person and virtual GC model, where patients are reviewed in a group setting. Improvements were made following each session following patient input and team reflections. Outcomes measured included patient satisfaction, self-perceived health literacy, and successful implementation of the GCs. During the pilot, eight in-person GCs were delivered: once-monthly (Oct-Dec 2019), then twice-monthly (Jan-Feb 2020). Feedback was received from 49/53 patients. 100% felt more satisfied and heard, 100% felt more involved in decision-making, 98% had a better understanding of their condition, 96% felt more able to cope with their condition and keep themselves healthy, 94% rated this as a positive experience, and 90% reported improved access and more time with their clinician compared with existing 1:1 appointments.

The worldwide dissemination of NDM-1 poses a serious threat to public health, imposing a huge economic burden in the development of new antibiotics. Thus, there is an urgent need for the identification of novel NDM-1 inhibitors from a pool of already-known drug molecules. Here, we screened a library of FDA-approved drugs to identify novel non--lactam ring-containing inhibitors of NDM-1 by applying computational as well as in vitro experimental approaches. Different steps of high-throughput virtual screening, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and enzyme kinetics were performed to identify risedronate and methotrexate as the inhibitors with the most potential. The molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that both of the compounds (risedronate and methotrexate) formed a stable complex with NDM-1. Furthermore, analyses of the binding pose revealed that risedronate formed two hydrogen bonds and three electrostatic interactions with the catalytic residues of NDM-1. Similarly, methotrexate formed four hydrogen bonds and one electrostatic interaction with NDM-1s active site residues. The docking scores of risedronate and methotrexate for NDM-1 were C10.543 kcal mol(?1) and ?10.189 kcal mol(?1), respectively. Steady-state enzyme kinetics in the presence of risedronate and methotrexate showed a decreased catalytic efficiency (i.e., kcat/Km) of NDM-1 on various antibiotics, owing to poor catalytic proficiency and affinity. The results were further validated by determining the MICs of imipenem and meropenem in the presence of risedronate and methotrexate. The IC(50) values of the identified inhibitors were in the micromolar range. The findings of this study should be helpful in further characterizing the potential of risedronate and methotrexate to treat bacterial infections.","output":"Risedronate and Methotrexate Are High-Affinity Inhibitors of New Delhi Metallo--Lactamase-1 (NDM-1): A Drug Repurposing Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December 2019 in China and was declared a pandemic on 11.03.2020 by WHO.

COVID-19 has limited the manpower responsible for the frequent updating of the ESL system. The current ESL uses QR (quick response) codes, NFC (near-field communication), and RFID (radio-frequency identification). These technologies have a short range or need more manpower. LoRa is one of the prominent contenders in this category as it provides long-range connectivity with less energy harvesting and location tracking. It uses many gateways (GWs) to transmit the same data packet to a node, which causes collision at the receiver side. The restriction of the duty cycle (DC) and dependency of acknowledgment makes it unsuitable for use by the common person. The maximum efficiency of pure ALOHA is 18.4%, while that of slotted ALOHA is 36.8%, which makes LoRa unsuitable for industrial use. It can be used for applications that need a low data rate, i.e., up to approximately 27 Kbps. The ALOHA mechanism can cause inefficiency by not eliminating fast saturation even with the increasing number of gateways. The increasing number of gateways can only improve the global performance for generating packets with Poisson law having a uniform distribution of payload of 1~51 bytes. The maximum expected channel capacity usage is similar to the pure ALOHA throughput. (2) Methods: In this paper, the improved ALOHA mechanism is used, which is based on the orthogonal combination of spreading factor (SF) and bandwidth (BW), to maximize the throughput of LoRa for ESL. The varying distances (D) of the end nodes (ENs) are arranged based on the K-means machine learning algorithm (MLA) using the parameter selection principle of ISM (industrial, scientific and medical) regulation with a 1% DC for transmission to minimize the saturation. (3) Results: The performance of the improved ALOHA degraded with the increasing number of SFs and as well ENs. However, after using K-mapping, the network changes and the different number of gateways had a greater impact on the probability of successful transmission. The saturation decreased from 57% to 1~2% by using MLA. The RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) plays a key role in determining the exact position of the ENs, which helps to improve the possibility of successful transmission and synchronization at higher BW (250 kHz). In addition, a high BW has lower energy consumption than a low BW at the same DC with a double-bit rate and almost half the ToA (time on-air).","output":"Optimizing the Performance of Pure ALOHA for LoRa-Based ESL"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The Clinical Simulation Centre (CSC) at GOSH, now provide one of the largest in-situ simulation programmes in the region Prioritising advancement of the patient safety agenda, we work closely with our Quality and Safety teams to embed key safety themes within out trust wide in- situ curriculum A key objective of delivering simulation in-situ in the clinical setting;is to identify and mitigate against hidden risks or 'latent safety threats' in the clinical environment;which could cause unintended harm to patients or staff Method Over the past year, the CSC team have begun to expand the applications of the pan-trust in-situ programme to deliver a number of Systems Safety exercises These simulations focus purely on rehearsal and refinement of process and systems, towards uncovering and mitigating against latent safety threats or gaps in practice A reporting tool has been developed by the team;to capture risks ;identify mitigating actions Results In recent months, the Covid-19 pandemic presented our teams with many new or unfamiliar working practices This context further shifted our focus towards Systems Safety Simulations;with the aim of enabling our clinical teams to focus on rehearsing and preparing for new ways of working These exercises delivered in partnership with clinical teams across the trust;successfully supported the development of 5 new clinical guidelines during the pandemic In one exercise alone;11 latent safety threats (LSTs) were captured and managed with the appropriate teams LST themes included;availability of resources ;Communication and co-ordination in PPE;Infection Prevention&Control risks ;Environmental preparedness Conclusion These recent exercises have demonstrated the potential applications of simulation to support process improvement Beyond the Pandemic, we aim to continue to deliver Systems Safety Simulation exercises to help make our clinical systems and spaces safer for patients and the teams who care for them","output":"Simulation to support system safety in a tertiary paediatric hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous, and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

In response to the COVID-19 emergency, LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) was adapted to expand the range of evidence and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place on a daily search basis. The search covered a period of time up to July 31, 2020. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel living systematic reviews to this question's specificities. We included randomized trials evaluating the effect of either suspension or indication of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers as monotherapy, or in combination versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We pooled the results using meta-analysis and applied the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We will resubmit results every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results We screened 772 records, but none was considered for eligibility. We identified 55 ongoing studies, including 41 randomized trials evaluating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers for patients with COVID-19. Conclusions We did not find a randomized clinical trial meeting our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence for supporting the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Frequencies of adverse events were similar before and after the switch. No serious adverse events occurred. Transient severe local injection reactions were experienced by 1.2% of patients. Median vedolizumab trough levels were 2.3 times higher on subcutaneous compared to intravenous treatment. Patient satisfaction was generally high. Annualised treatment costs were reduced by 15% following the switch. CONCLUSIONS The switch from intravenous to subcutaneous vedolizumab could be done with preserved therapeutic effectiveness, safety, high patient satisfaction and low discontinuation rate, at a reduced cost.","output":"Real-world data on switching from intravenous to subcutaneous vedolizumab treatment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically altered health care delivery and utilization.

It is important to develop innovative virtual care models to deliver multidisciplinary care while minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV2 exposure. Objective We aim to provide a description of how HF patients with CRT devices were assessed and managed in our virtual multidisciplinary clinic during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Clinical outcomes between this group of patients seen in virtual clinic and a historical cohort followed by in-person multi-disciplinary clinic prior to the pandemic were compared. Method This is a retrospective cohort study of HF patients with CRT implants who were seen in the virtual multidisciplinary clinic from March 18th, 2020 to May 27th, 2020 (Virtual Visit Group, N=43). A historical cohort of HF patients with CRT devices seen in the ReACT clinic in person during the same calendar time period in 2019 was used as a control group (In-Person Visit Group, N=39). Both groups were followed until July 1st of the same calendar year (2020 or 2019) for clinical events. The primary outcome measure was a combined outcome of all-cause mortality and HF- or device-related hospitalizations during follow-up. The secondary outcome measures included patient satisfaction, COVID-19 infection, and other cardiovascular events. Results In the Virtual-Visit Group, 21 patients (48.8%) had their initial ReACT clinic visit (first visit after CRT implant) as a virtual visit;22 patients (51.2%) had prior in-person ReACT clinic visits before the first virtual visit. During the virtual visits, 12 patients had either potential cardiac symptoms or significant device interrogation findings that required clinical intervention. In post-virtual clinic patient satisfaction survey, all 22 patients surveyed (100%) reported being very satisfied or satisfied with the overall experience of the virtual clinic, and every patient (100%) said they would like to use telemedicine again. During a median follow-up period of 82 days (interquartile range [IQR] 61-96 days), one patient died from pneumonia of unclear etiology at an outside hospital, without documentation of COVID-19 positivity. No patient was hospitalized for HF- or arrhythmia-related complications. No patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Compared with the In-Person Visit Group, there was no significant increase in mortality or major cardiovascular events in the Virtual-Visit Group (2.3% versus 5.1%, P= 0.60). Conclusions and Relevance Virtual multidisciplinary care was feasible for HF patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy devices and achieved good patient satisfaction. Virtual care was not associated with short-term increase in adverse events for HF patients with CRT device during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This virtual care model could help promote the adoption of digital health methodology for high-risk patients with multiple cardiac comorbidities.","output":"Virtual Multidisciplinary Care For Heart Failure Patients With Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Devices During The Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) is an important public health problem. Studies indicated that TAP plays a key role in the presentation and transport of antigenic peptides during anti-M.tb infection. Given the important biological role of the TAP gene involved in anti-M.tb infection, a family-based caseCcontrol study including 133 tuberculosis patients, 107 healthy household contacts, and 173 healthy controls was conducted to assess the association between TAP gene polymorphisms and TB susceptibility. The basic information of subjects and their blood samples were collected. Four SNPs including rs1135216, rs1057141, rs241447, and rs3819721 were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRCRFLP). Our results suggested that BMI, residence, bedroom crowding, indoor humidity, fitness activities, history of smoking, and TB exposure history were associated with the occurrence of tuberculosis (P < 0.05). A significant association was observed between the TAP1 rs1135216 CT/CC genotype and increased TB risk, and the ORs were 2.56 (95% CI 1.31C4.99) and 6.73 (95% CI 1.33C34.02), respectively. TAP2 rs3819721 GG genotype carriers also showed an increased risk of TB when compared TB patients to healthy household contacts. Haplotype analysis revealed that the haplotype CT at rs1057141 and rs1135216 (OR = 11.34, 95% CI 1.49C86.56; OR = 7.45, 95% CI 1.43C38.76), as well as TA at rs241447 and rs3819721 (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.07C4.56) had a significantly increased risk of TB. The genetic risk scores (GRS) analysis of the four loci indicated that the risk of tuberculosis increased with increasing GRS scores in TB vs HHC (P(trend) = 0.010) and in TB vs HC (P(trend) = 0.001). In conclusion, our findings suggested that the SNPs of rs1135216 and rs3819721 were associated with TB susceptibility among the tuberculosis-prone families in the Chinese Han population and the risk of developing tuberculosis increases with the number of risk alleles, which could help identify high-risk groups in time and take scientific preventive measures. Further cohort studies with large samples are needed to validate the role of TAP gene variants on TB susceptibility.

We aimed to examine the incidence of ACS after national lock-down. METHODS: The Danish government announced national lock-down on March 11, 2020 and first phase of reopening was announced on April 6. Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified first-time ACS admissions in (1) January 1 to May 7, 2017-2019, and (2) January 1, 2020 to May 6, 2020. Incidence rates of ACS admissions per week for the 2017 to 2019 period and the 2020 period were computed and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were computed using Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: The number of ACS admissions were 8,204 (34.6% female, median age 68.3 years) and 2,577 (34.0% female, median age 68.5 years) for the 2017 to 2019- and 2020 period, respectively. No significant differences in IRRs were identified for weeks 1 to 9 (January 1 to March 4) for 2020 compared with week 1 to 9 for 2017 to 2019. In 2020, significant lower IRRs were identified for week 10 (March 5 to 11) IRRa?=a?0.71 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.58 to 0.87), week 11 (12 to 18 March) IRRa?=a?0.68 (0.56 to 0.84), and week 14 (April 2 to April 8) IRRa?=a?0.79 (0.65 to 0.97).

METHODS: An 11-item survey was emailed to American College of Radiology accredited breast imaging facilities in California and Texas in August 2020. A question subset addressed March-April government restrictions on elective services (during the shutdown and after reopening). Comparisons were made between states with chi-square and Fishers tests, and time frames with McNemars and paired t-tests. RESULTS: There were 54 respondents (54/240, 23%, 26 California, 28 Texas). Imaging volumes fell during the shutdown and remained below pre-pandemic levels after reopening, with reduction in screening greatest (ultrasound 12% of baseline, mammography 13%, MRI 23%), followed by diagnostic MRI (43%), procedures (44%), and diagnostics (45%). California reported higher volumes during the shutdown (procedures, MRI) and after reopening (diagnostics, procedures, MRI) versus Texas (P = 0.001 - 0.02).

In the province of Alberta, hospital readmission rates for patients with cirrhosis are estimated at 44% at 90 days. For hospitalized patients, multiple care gaps exist, the most notable stemming from i) the lack of a structured approach to best practice care for cirrhosis complications, ii) the lack of a structured approach to broader health needs and iii) suboptimal preparation for transition of care into the community. Cirrhosis Care Alberta (CCAB) is a 4-year multi-component pragmatic trial which aims to address these gaps. The proposed intervention is initiated at the time of hospitalization through implementation of a clinical information system embedded electronic order set for delivering evidence-based best practices under real-world conditions. The overarching objective of the CCAB trial is to demonstrate effectiveness and implementation feasibility for use of the order set in routine patient care within eight hospital sites in Alberta. METHODS: A mixed methods hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation design will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the order set intervention. The primary outcome is a reduction in 90-day cumulative length of stay. Implementation outcomes such as reach, adoption, fidelity and maintenance will also be evaluated alongside other patient and service outcomes such as readmission rates, quality of care and cost-effectiveness. This theory-based trial will be guided by Normalization Process Theory, Consolidated Framework on Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework. DISCUSSION: The CCAB project is unique in its breadth, both in the comprehensiveness of the multi-component order set and also for the breadth of its roll-out.

By modulating the physical form of mannans, we developed a formulation that targets both the periphery and the dLN.

Previous studies generally modeled the SDP problem as a binary classification task, providing a single prediction outcome. Accordingly, some attempts introduce survival analysis methods to achieve continuous and consistent predictions over time. However, the volatility and sparsity of data always weaken the models performance. Prevailing solutions rely heavily on data pre-processing independent of predictive models, which are labor-intensive and may contaminate authentic data. This paper proposes a Survival Analysis based Volatility and Sparsity Modeling Network (SAVSNet) to address these issues in an end-to-end deep learning framework. Specifically, SAVSNet smooths the volatile time series by convolution network while preserving the original data information using Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM). Furthermore, we propose a Time-Missing-Aware LSTM unit to mitigate the impact of data sparsity by integrating informative missingness patterns into the model. A survival analysis loss function is adopted for parameter estimation, and the model outputs monotonically decreasing survival probabilities.

Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are accurate but costly, which makes the regular testing of every individual expensive. These costs are a challenge for all countries around the world, but particularly for low-to-middle-income countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups1-7. A balance must be struck between increasing the group size and retaining test sensitivity, as sample dilution increases the likelihood of false-negative test results for individuals with a low viral load in the sampled region at the time of the test8. Similarly, minimizing the number of tests to reduce costs must be balanced against minimizing the time that testing takes, to reduce the spread of the infection. Here we propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, accurately identifies individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a small number of tests and few rounds of testing. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred. We report proof-of-concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted 100-fold with negative subsamples (compared with 30-48-fold dilutions described in previous studies9-11). We quantify the loss of sensitivity due to dilution and discuss how it may be mitigated by the frequent re-testing of groups, for example. With the use of these methods, the cost of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor. At low prevalence, the costs decrease in rough proportion to the prevalence. Field trials of our approach are under way in Rwanda and South Africa. The use of group testing on a massive scale to monitor infection rates closely and continually in a population, along with the rapid and effective isolation of people with SARS-CoV-2 infections, provides a promising pathway towards the long-term control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","output":"A pooled testing strategy for identifying SARS-CoV-2 at low prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This prospective study was to describe the incidence and characteristics of physical activity-related injuries (PARI) among college students in southern China.

Manual methods executed by experts are considered the gold standard, but it is time consuming and the accuracy is dependent on radiologists experience. Automated methods are relatively fast and reproducible with potential to facilitate physician interpretation of images. However, these benefits are possible only after overcoming several challenges. The traditional methods that are formulated as a three-stage segmentation demonstrate promising results on normal CT data but perform poorly in the presence of pathological features and variations in image quality attributes. The implementation of deep learning methods that can demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods is dependent on the quantity, quality, cost and the time it takes to generate training data. Thus, efficient and clinically relevant automated segmentation method is desired for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. METHODS: We implement each of the three stages of traditional methods using deep learning methods trained on five different configurations of training data with ground truths obtained from the 3D Image Reconstruction for Comparison of Algorithm Database (3DIRCAD) and the Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD) database. The data was augmented with the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC-IDRI) image collection and a realistic phantom. A convolutional neural network (CNN) at the preprocessing stage classifies the input into lung and none lung regions. The processing stage was implemented using a CNN-based U-net while the postprocessing stage utilize another U-net and CNN for contour refinement and filtering out false positives, respectively. RESULTS: The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on 1230 and 1100 CT slices from the 3DIRCAD and ILD databases.

RESULTS: We first offer pragmatic suggestions to address the difficulties in delivering a coordinated response given the fragmented nature of health care in the US. In view of the broad suite of responses required to address opioid use disorder and its associated comorbidities, we highlight the need for economic evaluations which consider interventions throughout the continuum of care (i.e. primary, secondary and tertiary levels of prevention). We examine how the use of predictive modelling alongside economic evaluation might be adopted to address the rapidly evolving situation affecting distinct populations and geographic areas and encourage investments in epidemic preparedness. Finally, we propose methods to capture the interdependence of various sectors of government affected by the opioid crisis in economic evaluations to ensure optimal levels of investment towards a comprehensive response.

METHOD: From 68 publications (N = 87,586 participants), 808 estimates were included in a series of multilevel meta-analyses/regressions including random effects to account for estimates nested within studies. RESULTS: Median summary point prevalence estimates varied by disorder and population. Psychiatric morbidity (20-56%), PTSD (10-26%) and depression (9-27%) were most prevalent in most populations. The highest prevalence of each disorder was found among infected/recovered adults (18-56%), followed by healthcare providers (11-28%) and community adults (11-20%). Prevalence estimates were often notably higher than reported for unselected samples. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that overall prevalence estimates moderately varied by pandemic, study location, and mental disorder measure type.

In mid-February 2021, a non-vaccinated staff member of the nursing home was diagnosed with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following the outbreak investigation, a total of 70% (14/20) of residents aged 77C100 years were found positive. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the outbreak was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/01 (the so-called UK variant). However, all but one positive subjects (13/14) were fully asymptomatic. The only symptomatic patient was a vaccinated 86-year-old female with a highly compromised health background and deceased approximately two weeks later. The subsequent serological investigation showed that the deceased patient was the only vaccinated subject that did not develop the anti-spike protein antibody response, therefore being likely a vaccine non-responder.

We conducted a study to: 1) estimate levels of PTM program implementation in VA Audiology and Mental Health clinics across the country; and 2) identify barriers and facilitators to PTM implementation based on the experiences of VA audiologists and mental health providers. METHOD: We conducted an anonymous, web-based survey targeting Audiology and Mental Health leaders at 144 major VA facilities. Quantitative analyses summarized respondents facility characteristics and levels of program implementation (full PTM, partial PTM, or no PTM). Qualitative analyses identified themes in factors influencing the implementation of PTM across VA sites. RESULTS: Surveys from 87 audiologists and 66 mental health clinicians revealed that few facilities offered full PTM; the majority offered partial or no PTM. Inductive analysis of the open-ended survey responses identified seven factors influencing implementation of PTM: 1) available resources, 2) service collaboration, 3) prioritization, 4) Veterans preferences and needs, 5) clinician training, 6) awareness of (evidence-based) options, and 7) perceptions of scope of practice. CONCLUSION: Results suggest wide variation in services provided, a need for greater engagement of mental health providers in tinnitus care, and an interest among both audiologists and mental health providers in receiving tinnitus-related training.

With many different healthcare professionals contributing to the prehabilitation literature, there is significant variation in reported primary endpoints that restricts comparison. In addition, there has been limited work on patient-related outcome measures suggesting that patients with colorectal cancer needs and issues are being overlooked. The Defining Standards in Colorectal Optimisation Study aims to achieve international consensus from all stakeholders on key standards to provide a framework for reporting future prehabilitation research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review will identify key standards reported in trials of prehabilitation in colorectal surgery. Standards that are important to patients will be identified by a patient and public involvement (PPI) event. The longlist of standards generated from the systematic review and PPI event will be used to develop a three-round online Delphi process. This will engage all stakeholders (healthcare professionals and patients) both nationally and internationally. The results of the Delphi will be followed by a face-to-face interactive consensus meeting that will define the final standards for prehabilitation for elective colorectal surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of Glasgow College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences Ethics Committee has approved this protocol, which is registered as a study (200190120) with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative.

METHODS: We studied 4510 UK Biobank participants tested for COVID-19 (positive, n = 1326). Multivariate logistic regression models including age, sex and ethnicity were used to test whether addition of (1) cardiometabolic factors [diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, prior myocardial infarction, smoking and body mass index (BMI)]; (2) 25(OH)-vitamin D; (3) poor diet; (4) Townsend deprivation score; (5) housing (home type, overcrowding) or (6) behavioural factors (sociability, risk taking) attenuated sex/ethnicity associations with COVID-19 status. RESULTS: There was over-representation of men and BAME ethnicities in the COVID-19 positive group. BAME individuals had, on average, poorer cardiometabolic profile, lower 25(OH)-vitamin D, greater material deprivation, and were more likely to live in larger households and in flats/apartments. Male sex, BAME ethnicity, higher BMI, higher Townsend deprivation score and household overcrowding were independently associated with significantly greater odds of COVID-19. The pattern of association was consistent for men and women; cardiometabolic, socio-demographic and behavioural factors did not attenuate sex/ethnicity associations. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, sex and ethnicity differential pattern of COVID-19 was not adequately explained by variations in cardiometabolic factors, 25(OH)-vitamin D levels or socio-economic factors. Factors which underlie ethnic differences in COVID-19 may not be easily captured, and so investigation of alternative biological and genetic susceptibilities as well as more comprehensive assessment of the complex economic, social and behavioural differences should be prioritised.","output":"Greater risk of severe COVID-19 in Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic populations is not explained by cardiometabolic, socioeconomic or behavioural factors, or by 25(OH)-vitamin D status: study of 1326 cases from the UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Higher COVID-19 incidence and morbidity have been documented for US Black and Hispanic populations but not as clearly for other racial and ethnic groups.

OBJECTIVE: Examine race/ethnicity and social vulnerability effects on COVID-19 outcomes in the San Francisco Bay Area, an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse region, using geocoded patient records from 2020 in the University of California, San Francisco Health system. KEY RESULTS: Higher social vulnerability, but not race/ethnicity, was associated with less frequent testing yet a higher likelihood of testing positive. Asian hospitalization rates (11.5%) were double that of White patients (5.4%) and exceeded the rates for Black (9.3%) and Hispanic patients (6.9%). A modest relationship between higher hospitalization rates and increasing social vulnerability was evident only for White patients. Hispanic patients had the highest years of expected life lost due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 outcomes were not consistently explained by greater social vulnerability. Asian individuals showed disproportionately high rates of hospitalization regardless of social vulnerability status.

Silencing of KDELR2 in A3G-expressing Vero cells abrogated the antiviral activity induced by A3G, confirming its role as an A3G-regulated antiviral host factor. Recognition of the KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) motif by KDEL receptors initiates the retrograde transport of soluble proteins that have escaped the ER and play an important role in ER quality control. Although KDELR2 over-expression reduced MV titers in cell cultures, we observed no interaction between KDELR2 and the MV hemagglutinin (H) protein. Instead, KDELR2 retained chaperones in the ER, which are required for the correct folding and transport of the MV envelope glycoproteins H and fusion protein (F) to the cell surface. Our data indicate that KDELR2 competes with MV envelope proteins for binding to calnexin and GRP78/Bip, and that this interaction limits the availability of the chaperones for MV proteins, causing the reduction of virus spread and titers.","output":"KDELR2 Competes with Measles Virus Envelope Proteins for Cellular Chaperones Reducing Their Chaperone-Mediated Cell Surface Transport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The real psychological impact of COVID-19 remains difficult to quantify and may differ between hospital sizes and levels.

To provide an overview of the COVID-19 outbreak preparedness and responses of Australian residential aged care facilities (RACFs), 12 months after the pandemic began in early 2020. Methods. A cross-sectional survey of RACF managers was conducted as part of an overview of COVID-19 experience during 2020. Survey questions were based on findings of previous outbreak reviews. Results. Comparison with available data from the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare suggested that survey respondents (n=331) were a representative sample. Almost all RACFs had outbreak management plans, including provision for a surge workforce. However, anticipated staff replacements fell short of those often required during outbreaks. Staff of most (83%) RACFs had completed online infection control training, and a smaller proportion (73%) face-to-face training, by the time of the survey. Exploratory analyses to identify RACF characteristics associated with increased outbreak risk found a strong association with location in Victoria (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 12.8) where most community transmission occurred during 2020. The only other association was an increased risk in facilities where all staff had not completed face-to-face infection control training (aRR 2.1). Respondents ranked leadership and management; planning and preparation; and infection control as the top three of seven critical lines of defence against COVID-19. Conclusion. Survey results suggest that, in early 2021, most Australian RACFs were better prepared for the ongoing risk of COVID-19 than in 2020.

However, clinical observations frequently identified neurological symptoms and neuropsychiatric disorders related to COVID-19 (Neuro-SARS2). Accumulated robust evidence indicates that Neuro-SARS2 may play an important role in aggravating the disease severity and mortality. Understanding the neuropathogenesis and cellular mechanisms underlying Neuro-SARS2 is crucial for both basic research and clinical practice to establish effective strategies for early detection/diagnosis, prevention, and treatment paradigms. In this review, we will comprehensively examine current evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various neural cells including neurons, microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, pericytes/endothelial cells, ependymocytes/choroid epithelial cells, and neural stem/progenitor cells. Although significant progress has been made in studying Neuro-SARS2, much remains to be learned about the neuroinvasive routes (transneuronal and hematogenous) of the virus and the cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying the development/progression of this disease.

This randomized trial compares SILC against four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with post-operative pain as the primary endpoint. METHODS Hundred patients were randomized to either SILC (n = 50) or LC (n = 50). Exclusion criteria were (1) Acute cholecystitis; (2) ASA 3 or above; (3) Bleeding disorders; and (4) Previous open upper abdominal surgery. Patients and post-operative assessors were blinded to the procedure performed. The site and severity of pain were compared at 4 h, 24 h, 14 days and 6 months post-procedure using the visual analog scale; non-inferiority was assumed when the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the difference was above -1 and superiority when p  0.05. RESULTS The study arms were demographically similar. At 24 h post-procedure, SILC was associated with less pain at extra-umbilical sites (rest: p = 0.004; movement: p = 0.008). Pain data were inconclusive at 24 h at the umbilical site on movement; SILC was otherwise non-inferior for pain at all other points. Operating duration was longer in SILC (79.46 vs 58.88 min, p = 0.003). 8% of patients in each arm suffered complications (p = 1.000). Re-intervention rates, analgesic use, return to function, and patient satisfaction did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS SILC has improved short-term pain outcomes compared to LC and is not inferior in both short-term and long-term pain outcomes. The operating time is longer, but remains feasible in routine surgical practice.","output":"A randomized controlled trial comparing post-operative pain in single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Malnutrition remains a challenging problem in hospitals, especially among geriatric patients. The background and causes are actually well known but still underestimated in clinical practice. AIM AND METHODS: This study evaluated possible differences in rates of malnutrition risk and malnutrition in geriatric patients living at home and geriatric patients living in residential nursing homes. For this purpose, data from a total of 4 surveys (3 times nutritionDay plus 1 additional survey) were combined and evaluated. In this secondary analysis, 258 patients 65 years and older are included. Malnutrition risk is determined by the malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST) and malnutrition by the ESPEN criteria. RESULTS: Of the patients 86.0% (n = 222) live at home and 14.0% (n = 36) in residential nursing homes. The patients living in nursing homes have a higher morbidity and need of care. Indicators for the increased morbidity are a larger number of nights spent in the clinic in the last 12 months (mdn 10.0 vs. 5; p 0.007), higher number of daily drug intake (mdn 9.0 vs. 7.0; p 0.002) and greater limitations in walking abilities (mdn 3.0 vs. 1.0; p < 0.001). They are significant older (median 86.0 vs. 78.0; p < 0.001) and show a higher percentage of manifest malnutrition (35.7%; n = 10 vs. 20.1%; n = 40; p 0.062). CONCLUSION: Geriatric patients living at home and in residential nursing homes show high rates of malnutrition. A malnutrition screening at the beginning and during hospital stay is urgently required in every case as this is the only way to identify those affected. In addition, regular screening in outpatient departments as well as in nursing homes is also necessary.","output":"Mangelern?hrung bei geriatrischen Patient*innen: Risikofaktor station?re Langzeitpflege?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the time associated with routine cholangiography in a residency teaching program. DESIGN We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography by a single surgeon from April 2010 to September 2011. Cholangiogram time, demographic, and operative information was recorded, and factors associated with increased cholangiogram times were compared using Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and linear regression; a p value <0.05 was considered significant. SETTING Academic-affiliated community-based surgical residency program. PARTICIPANTS 10 surgical residents, PGY 1-5. RESULTS Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography was performed in 54 patients. The average patient age was 43 years; 69% were Caucasian and 74% were female. Cholangiography was successful in 96% of patients. The average time for cholangiograms performed by residents was 11 minutes (range, 6-22 minutes) and average operating room time was 68 minutes (range, 32-103 minutes). The average percentage of case time for cholangiography was 17% (range, 9%-63%). Minor technical complications related to cholangiograms occurred in 33% of cases, with the most common being difficulty with clipping the catheter (20%).

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2008 and December 2010, 65 patients underwent conventional or LESS ureterolithotomy. CL-RU was performed in 42 patients. These patients were compared with the remaining 23 patients who underwent LESS-RU. Indications for the operations were obstructive or impacted ureteral stones larger than 15 mm in the middle or upper part of the ureter. The following parameters of CL-RU were compared with the LESS-RU: operative time, blood loss, transfusion rates, duration of analgesia, postoperative pain, hospitalization time, and time to return to normal activities. RESULTS No difference was observed between the below-mentioned, respective parameters of CL-RU and LESS-RU groups: mean operative time (74.1 vs 69.9 min, P = .54), blood loss (54.9 vs 56.1 mL, P = .49), transfusion rates (0% for both), and hospitalization time (3.1 vs 2.9 days, P = .61). Duration of analgesia in patients who underwent CL-RU was longer than those who underwent LESS-RU (5.2 vs 2.4 days, P = .001). Time to return to normal activities in CL-RU patients was also longer than LESS-RU patients (9.7 vs 6.4 days, P = .001). Compared to CL-RU, mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were lower during postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 in LESS-RU patients. Urine leakage was observed in 2 cases in each group. CONCLUSION LESS ureterolithotomy performed by adopting the retroperitoneal approach seems to be a safe, reliable, and minimally invasive procedure after failed shock wave lithotripsy or ureteroscopy (URS).

The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that old age (HR: 7.294; 95% CI: 1.442-36.888; P = 0.016), the combination of hypertension (HR: 2.230; 95% CI: 1.090-4.562; P = 0.028) and heart disease (HR: 2.650; 95% CI: 1.079-6.510; P = 0.034) were independent risk factors for progression of COVID-19. Conclusions: The age of the patient, the combination of hypertension and heart disease were independent risk factors for the progression of COVID-19. Cautions should be raised for patients with these risk factors.","output":"Clinical characteristics and analysis of risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19: A retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to their controlled size, sensitivity to external stimuli, and ease-of-use, microgel colloids are unique building blocks for soft materials made by crosslinking polymers on the micrometer scale.

Development of a wider range of vaccines, with different mechanisms of action, could help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19 using a dimeric form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine, ZF2001, and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study. METHODS: We did two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Phase 1 was done at two university hospitals in Chongqing and Beijing, China, and phase 2 was done at the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Xiangtan, China. Healthy adults aged 18-59 years, without a history of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection, an RT-PCR-positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, a history of contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, and severe allergies to any component of the vaccine were eligible for enrolment. In phase 1, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive three doses of the vaccine (25 g or 50 g) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive the vaccine (25 g or 50 g) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart, in either a two-dose schedule or a three-dose schedule. Investigators, participants, and the laboratory team were masked to group allocation. For phase 1, the primary outcome was safety, measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. For phase 2, the primary outcome was safety and immunogenicity (the seroconversion rate and the magnitude, in geometric mean titres [GMTs], of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies). Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat and per-protocol basis. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04445194 and NCT04466085) and participant follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between June 22 and July 3, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled into the phase 1 trial and randomly assigned to receive three doses of placebo (n=10), the 25 g vaccine (n=20), or the 50 g vaccine (n=20). The mean age of participants was 326 (SD 94) years. Between July 12 and July 17, 2020, 900 participants were enrolled into the phase 2 trial and randomly assigned to receive two doses of placebo (n=150), 25 g vaccine (n=150), or 50 g vaccine (n=150), or three doses of placebo (n=150), 25 g vaccine (n=150), or 50 g vaccine (n=150). The mean age of participants was 435 (SD 92) years. In both phase 1 and phase 2, adverse events reported within 30 days after vaccination were mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) in most cases (phase 1: six [60%] of ten participants in the placebo group, 14 [70%] of 20 in the 25 g group, and 18 [90%] of 20 in the 50 g group; phase 2: 37 [25%] of 150 in the two-dose placebo group, 43 [29%] of 150 in the two-dose 25 g group, 50 [33%] of 150 in the two-dose 50 g group, 47 [31%] of 150 in the three-dose placebo group, 72 [48%] of 150 in the three-dose 25 g group, and 65 [43%] of 150 in the three-dose 50 g group). In phase 1, two (10%) grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in the 50 g group. In phase 2, grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported by 18 participants (four [3%] in the two-dose 25 g vaccine group, two [1%] in the two-dose 50 g vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, four [3%] in the three-dose 25 g vaccine group, and six [4%] in the three-dose 50 g vaccine group), and 11 were considered vaccine related (two [1%] in the two-dose 25 g vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 g vaccine group, one [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, two [1%] in the three-dose 25 g vaccine group, and five [3%] in the three-dose 50 g vaccine group); seven participants reported serious adverse events (one [1%] in the two-dose 25 g vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 g vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, one [1%] in the three-dose 25 g vaccine group, and two [1%] in the three-dose 50 g vaccine group), but none was considered vaccine related. In phase 2, on the two-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the second dose were 76% (114 of 150 participants) in the 25 g group and 72% (108 of 150) in the 50 g group; on the three-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the third dose were 97% (143 of 148 participants) in the 25 g group and 93% (138 of 148) in the 50 g group. In the two-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the second dose were 177 (95% CI 136-231) in the 25 g group and 141 (108-183) in the 50 g group. In the three-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the third dose were 1025 (95% CI 818-1285) in the 25 g group and 691 (530-900) in the 50 g group. INTERPRETATION: The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 appears to be well tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from the phase 1 and 2 trials support the use of the 25 g dose in a three-dose schedule in an ongoing phase 3 trial for large-scale evaluation of ZF2001's safety and efficacy.

This paper aims to examine the CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19. METHODS: We evaluated CT images obtained between 10 January 2019 and 16 February 2020 at Taihe Hospital. Scans were conducted 2-6 times per patient and the re-testing interval was 2-7 days. Ninety-five patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results were included in this study and we retrospectively analysed their CT imaging characteristics. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients underwent 2-3 SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and received a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19. Fifty-three were male and 42 were female, and their mean age was 42  12 years (range: 10 months to 81 years). Sixty-nine patients (72.6%) experienced fever, fatigue, and dry cough, while 15 (15.8%) had poor appetite and fatigue, and 11 (11.6%) had a dry cough and no fever. On CT imaging, early stage patients (n = 53, 55.8%) showed peripheral subpleural ground-glass opacities; these were mainly local patches (22/53, 41.5%), while some lesions were accompanied by interlobular septal thickening. Thirty-four (35.8%) patients were classified in the 'progression stage' based on CT imaging; these patients typically showed lesions in multiple lung segments and lobes (21/3461.8%), and an uneven increase in ground-glass opacity density accompanied by consolidation and grid-like or cord-like shadows(30.5%). Two patients (2.1%) showed a severe presentation on CT. These showed diffuse bilateral lung lesions, mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation with cord-like interstitial thickening and air bronchograms, entire lung involvement with a \\"white lung\\" presentation, and mild pleural effusion. Six patients in remission (6.3%), visible lesion absorption, fibrotic lesions. Based on clinical signs, 71 (74.7%), 22 (23.2%), and 2 (2.1%) patients had mild or moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Within the follow-up period, 93 patients recovered and were discharged, including the 53 early stage patients and 34 progression stage patients. The length of hospitalisation was 7-28 days (mean: 10  3.5 days). On discharge, lesions were significantly reduced in area and had in many cases completely disappeared, while slight pulmonary fibrosis was present in some patients. One severe stage patient was still hospitalised at the end of the follow-up period and the other severe stage patient died. The overall mortality rate was 1.05%.

In-DTPA-octreotide is the only registered radiopharmaceutical for the imaging of neuroendocrine tumors. We studied the uptake in this region of the pancreatic head on somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) using In-DTPA-octreotide in a large group of patients. Furthermore, known physiological and clinical characteristics are discussed in an attempt to elucidate this phenomenon. METHODS Four hundred seven patients underwent SRS using In-DTPA-octreotide in our department in 2014. After excluding patients with a known malignancy in or close to the pancreas, as well as all scans without SPECT/CT of the upper abdomen, we reviewed 178 scans in total. The uptake was graded on a 4-point scale that correlates the uptake in the pancreatic head to physiological uptake in the liver. RESULTS Uptake in the region of the pancreatic head, including the uncinate process, was seen in 46 (26%) of 178 patients on SPECT/CT and in 12 patients (7%) on planar imaging. On SPECT/CT, uptake was lower than the liver in 26 patients (15%), equal to the liver in 17 patients (10%), and higher than the liver in 3 patients (2%). In patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the incidence of uptake in the pancreatic head was 50% on SPECT/CT. CONCLUSIONS Physiological uptake in the pancreatic head is seen on SPECT/CT with In-DTPA-octreotide in 26% of patients, and the incidence is doubled in patients with DM. Previous case reports showed uptake in the pancreatic head due to histologically proven pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cell hyperplasia. Also, patients with DM have elevated serum PP concentrations, which is likely due to PP cell hyperplasia. Because 90% of PP cells are present in the pancreatic head, PP cell hyperplasia is the most likely explanation for visualization of the pancreatic head on SRS in a substantial number of patients.","output":"Physiological Uptake in the Pancreatic Head on Somatostatin Receptor Scintigraphy Using [111In-DTPA]Octreotide: Incidence and Mechanism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has substantially changed life worldwide in 2020.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 867 COVID-19 cases. Then, a prospective study was conducted, including 23 healthy individuals and 210 cases. A total of 163 cases had vitamin D supplementation, and 95 were followed for 14 days. Clinical outcomes, routine blood biomarkers, serum levels of vitamin D metabolism, and action mechanism-related parameters were evaluated. Results: Our treatment protocol increased the serum 25OHD levels significantly to above 30 ng/mL within two weeks. COVID-19 cases (no comorbidities, no vitamin D treatment, 25OHD <30 ng/mL) had 1.9-fold increased risk of having hospitalization longer than 8 days compared with the cases with comorbidities and vitamin D treatment.

We performed a retrospective study to characterize pial arterial supply to dural arteriovenous fistulas and the implications for treatment. METHODS: Consecutive patients evaluated over a 12-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Angiograms were reviewed to characterize dAVF angioarchitecture and the presence of pial artery supply. Pial artery supply was categorized as dilated pre-existing dural branches and pure pial supply. We then studied the association between pial artery supply and clinical, angiographic, and treatment features. RESULTS: A total of 201 patients were included of which 27 (13.4%) had pial artery supply. Of these, 11 had supply from dilated pre-existing dural branches, nine had pure pial supply,and seven had both. There was a higher rate of dAVF rupture in the pial supply group (30.8% vs 9.8%, P=0.003) and these fistulas had a higher rate of Borden 2 and 3 (88.9% vs 38.4%, P<0.0001).

Methods This was a retrospective, observational, multicenter cohort study using prospectively collected data from adult patients hospitalized during influenza virus circulation, for at least 24h, for community-acquired ILI (with symptom onset <7 days). Data were collected from five French teaching hospitals over six consecutive winters (2012-2018). Respiratory viruses were identified by multiplex RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal specimens. hMPV+ patients were compared to hMPVC patients, influenza+ and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)+ patients using multivariate logistic regressions. Primary outcome was the prevalence of hMPV in patients hospitalized for ILI. Results Among the 3148 patients included (1449 (46%) women, 1988 (63%) aged 65 and over; 2508 (80%) with chronic disease), at least one respiratory virus was detected in 1604 (51%, 95%CI [49-53]), including 100 cases of hMPV (100/3148, 3% 95%CI [3-4]), of which 10 (10%) were viral co-infection. In the hMPV+ patients, mean length of stay was 7 days, 62% (56/90) developed a complication, 21% (14/68) were admitted to intensive care unit and 4% (4/90) died during hospitalization. In comparison with influenza+ patients, hMPV+ patients were more frequently > 65 years old (aOR=3.3, 95%CI[1.9-6.3]) and presented more acute heart failure during hospitalization (aOR=1.8, 95%CI[1.0-2.9]).

The caspase 1-induced cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a canonical pathway to cause membrane pores and eventually cell pyroptosis. Poly-l-lysine (PLL) is widely used to enhance cell adhesion during experiments. Human THP-1 cells are a typical cell line used to study pyroptosis due to their monocytic and macrophage-like characteristics. However, it was found that THP-1 cells seeded on the PLL-coated slides died. To figure out the reason, we observed the morphology of THP-1 cells on PLL-coated slides, which showed obvious pore forming on the cell membranes and cell swelling. The indicated pyroptosis-related protein expression was evaluated and it showed that the conventional caspase-1 pathway of pyroptosis was activated through the NLRP3 inflammasome in THP-1 monocytes on the PLL-coated slides. Hence, PLL-guided cell adhesion induces cell pyroptosis in THP-1 monocytes, which calls for THP-1 dominant studies of pyroptosis to avoid the use of PLL-coated slides or PLL-related drugs.","output":"Poly-l-lysine-caused cell adhesion induces pyroptosis in THP-1 monocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory disease induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It remains poorly understood how the host immune system responds to the infection during disease progression. We applied microarray analysis of the whole genome transcriptome to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from severe and mild COVID-19 patients as well as healthy controls. Functional enrichment analysis of genes associated with COVID-19 severity indicated that disease progression is featured by overactivation of myeloid cells and deficient T cell function. The upregulation of TLR6 and MMP9, which promote the neutrophils-mediated inflammatory response, and the downregulation of SKAP1 and LAG3, which regulate T cells function, were associated with disease severity. Importantly, the regulation of these four genes was absent in patients with influenza A (H1N1). And compared with stimulation with hemagglutinin (HA) of H1N1 virus, the regulation pattern of these genes was unique in PBMCs response to Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo. Our data also suggested that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection largely silenced the response of type I interferons (IFNs) and altered the proportion of immune cells, providing a potential mechanism for the hypercytokinemia. This study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs inflammatory and immune signatures in patients, especially those at severe stage. The potential mechanisms underpinning severe COVID-19 progression include overactive myeloid cells, impaired function of T cells, and inadequate induction of type I IFNs signaling.","output":"Inflammation and Antiviral Immune Response Associated With Severe Progression of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented human and health crisis.

Here, we review the roles of carbohydrates in the infection strategies of various enteric pathogens including viruses, bacteria and protozoa, which infect the epithelial lining of the human and animal intestine. At host cell entry, enteric viruses, including norovirus, recognize mainly histo-blood group antigens. At the initial step of bacterial infections, carbohydrates also function as receptors for attachment. Here, we describe the function of carbohydrates in infection by Salmonella enterica and several bacterial species that produce a variety of fimbrial adhesions. During invasion by enteropathogenic protozoa, apicomplexan parasites utilize sialic acids or sulfated glycans. Carbohydrates serve as receptors for infection by these microbes; however, their usage of carbohydrates varies depending on the microbe. On the surface of the mucosal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, various carbohydrate moieties are present and play a crucial role in infection, representing the site of infection or route of access for most microbes. During the infection and/or invasion process of the microbes, carbohydrates function as receptors for various microbes, but they can also function as a barrier to infection. One approach to develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial agents is to modify the drug structure. Another approach is to modify the mode of inhibition of infection depending on the individual pathogen by using and mimicking the interactions with carbohydrates. In addition, similarities in mode of infection may also be utilized. Our findings will be useful in the development of new drugs for the treatment of enteric pathogens.","output":"The Role of Carbohydrates in Infection Strategies of Enteric Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in a middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) referral hospital during the peak months of the pandemic.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID-19 patients diagnosed with UGB in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, case group) during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. We formed 2 control groups: COVID-19 patients without UGB (control group A) and non-COVID-19 patients with UGB (control group B). Fifty-three independent variables and 4 outcomes were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS: We identified 83 UGB in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 who were attending EDs (1.11%, 95% CI=0.88-1.38). This incidence was lower compared with non-COVID-19 patients [2474/1,388,879, 1.78%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.71-1.85; odds ratio (OR)=0.62; 95% CI=0.50-0.77]. Clinical characteristics associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 patients presenting with UGB were abdominal pain, vomiting, hematemesis, dyspnea, expectoration, melena, fever, cough, chest pain, and dysgeusia. Compared with non-COVID-19 patients with UGB, COVID-19 patients with UGB more frequently had fever, cough, expectoration, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, interstitial lung infiltrates, and ground-glass lung opacities. They underwent fewer endoscopies in the ED (although diagnoses did not differ between cases and control group B) and less endoscopic treatment.

It all started from the Wuhan city of china in December 2019, when a cluster of pneumonia cases with severe acute respiratory symptoms were reported with unknown etiology, majority of cases linked to the exposure to wholesale seafood market in Hunan. On January 7th, after the nomenclature of this causative agent was done as Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID19, the struggles to combat and try to control this illness have only so far been less helpful as more and more countries have exponential proportion of cases. On the other side of the illness are the efforts being done constantly to study the characteristics of the virus, newer treatment agents, expanding testing facilities and finally to find a vaccine as soon as possible. Although most human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the two beta corona viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)20-24 have caused more than 10 000 cumulative cases in the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. The 2019-nCoV has features typical of the coronavirus family and was classified in the beta coronavirus. Four viruses  (HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are endemic globally and account for 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults and typically cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. Currently, the patients infected by the novel coronavirus are the main source of infection. Although asymptomatic infected can also be a source. Transmission of the virus happens mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact (defined as that within 1m distance and lasting for several minutes). A possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment for a long-time exposure to high concentrations has also not been denied as of yet. Since the information regarding the illness, the treatment principles have been in constant scrutiny and have been changed dynamically as we get to know more about the virus, studies of covid19 cases would be a major stepping stone in acquiring maximum if not hundred percent knowledge about covid19. Materials and Methods: An observational retrospective case study was done for a fixed duration of a month i.e from 23/05/2020 to 23/06/2020. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included under the study. Inclusion criteria: 1. Age >40yrs with symptoms of severe acute respiratory Illness (screened as per the symptom suggestive of acute respiratory illness, mohfw.gov.in) 2. Asymptomatic aged >40yrs with comorbidities and in direct contact with confirmed cases of covid19. Exclusion criteria: 1. Immunocompromised patients. 2. Pregnant patients. 3. Autoimmune disease patients 4. History of psychiatric illness. The patients were isolated in different wards based on the presence or absence and severity of symptoms. Detailed history, general and systemic examination and investigations were done. Samples of throat and nasal swab were sent for RT-PCR assay of covid19 testing done by Real time reverse transcriptase based PCR. Regular monitoring of patients was done. Treatment given based on the most recent guidelines update by the ICMR and made available by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Statistical Analysis: Data was analysed by using SPSS 22.0 (trial version) software and T test, Chi-square Piersons correlation and other appropriate statistical test will be used to analyse the data. Aims & Objectives: To understand the symptomatology, disease course and complications of covid19. To study the changes in laboratory parameters in association with severity of illness.

Purpose of the study. The purpose of the article is to identify the challenges that SMEs are facing due to the pandemic and to consider trade credit as a possible tool to resolve them. Data and Methods. The data were collected through the questionnaire survey among the representatives of SMEs in the textile industry in Pakistan. In total, representatives of 150 textile industries were surveyed, but due to incomplete data only 115 were used for the analysis. The survey was conducted from March 2020 to March 2021.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the textile industry in Pakistan and the buying process as well as the satisfaction level. The study highlights the industrial safety issues during the pandemic which exacerbated the economic difficulties. The study also explains the mechanism how perceived control over buying, perceived satisfaction, and perceived trust in science relate to trade credit and COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions. The Pakistani government has taken many proactive measures, but there is still no consistent policy to attract more agents to the small textile business. Thus, a trade loan is the best solution for SMEs as it does not require immediate cash payments. The lack of government support has exacerbated the general pandemic-related economic crisis. In this light, trade loans may be considered as one of the most effective tools to keep SMEs afloat. ? 2022, Ural University Press.

The causative organism was initially named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) but has subsequently been renamed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic has so far infected several million and killed about a million people worldwide. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the leading causes of morbidity worldwide. OBJECTIVES To examine the critical role diabetes plays in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19 and to assess the emerging therapies available to fight the pandemic. METHODS Authors conducted a systematic review of literature to examine the role of diabetes as a comorbidity in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19. RESULTS Both experimental and observational data from early 2020 suggested that most people with COVID-19 have comorbidities, the most dominant of which are diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Empirical evidence indicates that diabetic patients infected with the COVID-19 disease had the worst outcomes concerning morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION A combination of underlying chronic conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases together with altered ACE receptor expression, immune dysregulation via cytokine storm, alveolar and endothelial dysfunction, increased systemic coagulation may put individuals with diabetes at risk for COVID-19 severity.

Thus, the aim of this exploratory pilot study was to examine the platelet transcriptome and platelet RNA splicing signatures in trauma patients compared with healthy donors. METHODS: Preresuscitation platelets purified from trauma patients (n = 9) and healthy donors (n = 5) were assayed using deep RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis, weighted gene coexpression network analysis, and differential alternative splicing analyses were performed. In parallel samples, platelet function was measured with platelet aggregometry, and clot formation was measured with thromboelastography. RESULTS: Differential gene expression analysis identified 49 platelet RNAs to have differing abundance between trauma patients and healthy donors. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis identified coexpressed platelet RNAs that correlated with platelet aggregation. Differential alternative splicing analyses revealed 1,188 splicing events across 462 platelet RNAs that were highly statistically significant (false discovery rate <0.001) in trauma patients compared with healthy donors. Unsupervised principal component analysis of these platelet RNA splicing signatures segregated trauma patients in two main clusters separate from healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence of finetuning of the platelet transcriptome through differential alternative splicing of platelet RNA in trauma patients and that this finetuning may have relevance to downstream platelet signaling.

COVID-19 cases among residents and staff were recorded on a daily basis from the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test from a resident on 8 March 2020, until 4 May 2020 when the last staff member was classified COVID-19 negative. Eighty of 160 residents (50%) and 37 of 135 staff members (27%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-seven of the 80 residents were asymptomatic but tested positive during the first general screening. Cohort isolation of SARS-CoV-2 positive residents by reorganising the facility proved to be a major effort. After the intervention, four further asymptomatic residents tested positive in follow-up screenings within a period of 6 days, and were possibly infected prior to the intervention. Thereafter, no further infections were recorded among residents. The described outbreak was controlled by implementing general screening and rigorous cohort isolation, providing a blueprint for similar facilities.","output":"Control of a COVID-19 outbreak in a nursing home by general screening and cohort isolation in Germany, March to May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides for an overview on the practical consequences of the EC guideline (III/8115/89): Validation of Virus Removal and Inactivation. This guideline can only be used as a blueprint in combination with other specific guidelines, especially those concerned with EC recommendations during production and quality control for various biotech products. A potential risk associated with the production and use of biological products is viral contamination. This contamination may be present in the source material, eg. human blood, human or animal tissues, cell banks, or introduced in the manufacturing process through the use of animal sera (eg. foetal calf serum or trypsin) in cell culture supernatant. The objectives of validation are to establish  ideally both qualitatively as well as quantitatively  the overall level of virus clearance. Evidence of viral clearance must be obtained in all stages of purification and adequate viral removal and/or inactivation must be proven. The method used when validating viral removal and /or inactivation is by challenging the system through the deliberate addition (spiking) of significant amounts of virus into the crude material to be purified and to different fractions obtained during the various purification stages. Removal or inactivation of the virus during the subsequent stages of purification and /or inactivation is thereafter determined. Such a quality system is by no means a simple one: it is estimated that in some production lines around 600 Standard Operating Procedures are necessary to guarantee the quality and the safety of the desired biotechnological product. Small companies will probably not be able to perform all procedures needed for obtaining the desired quality of the product. Then, external laboratories may take over a part of the Part II development requirements, which may not be representative for the total of internal Quality Assurance. New developments in the production and quality control of biotechnological products may require that companies should introduce novel, sophisticated methods such as: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as yet not recommended by the CPMP in detail.","output":"Regulatory affairs and biotechnology in Europe: III.

RT-LAMP targeting the M gene of hMPV was developed for detecting and identifying hMPV genotypes A and B. The detection limit of the genotype-specific hMPV RT-LAMP assay was 10 times greater than that of conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). No cross-reactivity was found with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus 1C3, adenovirus, human bocavirus, human rhinovirus, influenza virus A and B, human coronaviruses and enteroviruses. One hundred and fifteen clinical specimens were detected for hMPV genotypes A and B with RT-LAMP, RT-PCR and real-time SYBR PCR. Kappa coefficients showed that there was a good agreement among these three methods. Compared with RT-PCR and real-time SYBR PCR, the genotype-specific RT-LAMP showed better specificity, sensitivity and is more convenient to perform with reduced turn-around time.","output":"Identification of human metapneumovirus genotypes A and B from clinical specimens by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST), the mortality ranges 5-30%. Deep venous system involvement and septic dural sinus thrombosis have a higher mortality rate. In acute occlusion, collateral flow may not be established, which may result in significant edema and mass effect. Endovascular interventions may be considered as a treatment option in appropriate high-risk patients with DVST. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-confirmed dural sinus thrombosis, who did not respond to the conventional standard medical treatment, were subsequently treated with mechanical thrombectomy using the Penumbra System?. In all cases, medical treatment including anticoagulants were continued following the procedure for a minimum period of 1 year. RESULTS Recanalization of the dural sinus thrombosis was achieved in all 8 cases. There were no immediate or late endovascular-related complications. One death occurred due to an unrelated medical event. At 6 months, there was notable improvement in the modified Rankin Score (mRS), with 5/8 (62%) patients achieving mRS of 2 or less. The follow-up ranged between 3 months and 26 months (mean: 14.5 months), and there were no new neurological events during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare but life-threatening condition that demands timely diagnosis and therapy. In cases of rapidly declining neurological status despite standard therapy with systemic anticoagulation and anti-edema measures, mechanical thrombectomy could be a lifesaving and effective option.

One of the consequences of exposure to disasters/pandemics is an increase in alcohol use. The current study aimed to examine what predisposing (distal) and pandemic-related (proximal) factors were associated with increased drinking in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: On 1 April 2020, 5158 Australians completed a survey from the COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy (COLLATE) project, a nationwide study aimed at tracking key mental health concerns. Using logistic regression, distal (demographics and previous drinking behaviors) and proximal (employment, lifestyle factors, and mood) factors were assessed for their association with increased drinking since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Distal factors, including heavier drinking pre-pandemic, middle age, and average or higher income, and proximal factors, including job loss, eating more, changes to sleep as well as stress and depression, were all associated with increased drinking in the COVID-19 pandemic environment. Female sex and self-reported history of mental illness became nonsignificant after proximal measures were added to the model. Living alone, exercise, anxiety, and status as an essential or health-care worker were not associated with increased drinking. CONCLUSION: These results provide guidance as to who might be targeted to receive support based on predisposing demographic factors and pre-pandemic drinking behavior.

However, serum and lung biomarkers that can predict RPILD development remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine potential serum and lung biomarkers that can predict RPILD development in patients with PM/DM-ILD. METHODS: In total, 49 patients with PM/DM-ILD were enrolled. We measured the serum levels of 41 cytokines/chemokines, ferritin and anti-MDA5 antibody, compared them between the RPILD (n = 23) and non-RPILD (n = 26) groups, and ranked them by their importance through random forest analysis. To distinguish the two groups, we determined biomarker combinations by logistic regression analysis. We also measured the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of 41 cytokines/chemokines. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined IL-15 expression in lung tissues. The IL-15 production was also investigated using A549 and BEAS-2B cells. RESULTS: The RPILD group had significantly higher IL-15, IL-1RA, IL-6, CXCL10, VCAM-1, anti-MDA5 antibody and ferritin serum levels than the non-RPILD group, but it had a significantly low CCL22 level. Meanwhile, anti-MDA5 antibody, IL-15, CXCL8, CCL22, IL-1RA and ferritin were the best combination to distinguish the two groups. IL-15 and CCL22 were also predictive marker for RPILD development in anti-MDA5 antibody-positive patients. Additionally, the RPILD group had significantly high IL-15 levels in BALF.

To inhibit mutation-based development of new escape variants, elements that are indispensable for the virus may be targeted. The 5-polyU tract of the antigenome offers one such target. Host cells do not harbor 5-polyU tracts on any of their transcripts, making the tract an attractive virus-specific target. We hypothesize that inhibiting the 5-polyU by complementary oligonucleotide can limit the use of the tract as template for virus to generate 3 polyA tails of RNA viruses. Here, we used a frameshift-inducing DNA oligonucleotide with 3 polyAs to target the 5-polyU tract of mouse coronavirus (MHV-A59). Results from assays for double stranded RNA (dsRNA) synthesis, infectivity of released virions, and syncytium formation indicate that the oligonucleotide treatment prevented generation of infectious virions. Our results show a unique mode of action of the designed 3-polyA oligonucleotide against mouse coronavirus which leaves host cells unaffected. This strategy can be adopted for the development of novel classes of oligonucleotide-based drugs that inhibit the production of infectious RNA viruses, including the coronaviruses. Since the 5-polyU tract is conserved and is essential for variants of coronaviruses, this strategy can potentially address coronavirus variant emergence as well.","output":"Crippled Coronavirus: 5-PolyU targeted Oligo prevents development of infectious Virions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In research articles, cities usually occur as topics (e.g., subjects or actors) or places of studies (e.g., sites, destinations, locations, or spaces).

BACKGROUND Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) dramatically demonstrates the global havoc that can be wreaked by a newly emerging infectious disease. The current literature either has a predominantly biomedical focus or deals with the psychological impact on healthcare workers. Published studies on the lived experience of nurses caring for SARS patients are currently lacking. DESIGN A phenomenological design. METHODS Using methods consistent with Husserl's philosophy, eight Registered Nurses working in three regional hospitals in Hong Kong were invited to participate in sharing their lived experience of caring for SARS patients and data were analysed using Colaizzi's approach. RESULTS The three major themes explicated were: the various emotions experienced in caring for SARS patients, the concept of uncertainty and revisiting the 'taken for granted' features of nursing. CONCLUSION These themes, when taken together, describe the essence of the voyage undertaken by nurses who cared for SARS patients during the outbreak. The findings of this study indicate that extensive and ongoing support is needed to prepare and enable nurses to care for SARS patients during a crisis and make it easier for nurses to deal with the various uncertainties. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The essence of caring for SARS patients is highlighted in this study. The experience of caring for SARS patients prompts nurses to find meaning in their experience(s), and to develop knowledge and attitudes on how best to care for patients and prepare for a new crisis in the future.

The aim of this study is to describe the clinical features and risk factors of post COVID-19 sequelae in the North Indian population. This prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary healthcare centre in Northern India between October 2020 and February 2021. Patients aged >18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited after at least two weeks of diagnosis, and details were captured. A total of 1234 patients were recruited and followed up for a median duration of 91 days (IQR: 45-181 days). Among them, 495 (40.1%) had persistent symptoms post-discharge or recovery. In 223 (18.1%) patients, the symptoms resolved within four weeks; 150 (12.1%) patients had symptoms till 12 weeks, and 122 (9.9%) patients had symptoms beyond 12 weeks of diagnosis/symptom-onset of COVID-19. Most common symptoms included myalgia (10.9%), fatigue (5.5%), shortness of breath (6.1%), cough (2.1%), insomnia (1.4%), mood disturbances (0.48%) and anxiety (0.6%). Patients who were hospitalized were more likely to report fatigue as a feature of long COVID.

This paper utilizes a hybrid machine learning and continuum deformation-based approach for analyzing the stability and growth rate of the pandemic. To this end, principal stress values of the pandemic continuum body are obtained using Mohrs Circle method and overlapping, moving windows of data are analysed successively. This helps in finding the correlations between the growth rate and Governments action/Publics reaction. Government actions include state of emergency, shelter at place, and phase declarations. We also consider the vaccination rate milestones, which shows us the coordinated Governments action/Publics reaction.

The S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein (S1 protein) contains the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding domain. The SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern contain mutations in the S1 subunit. The spike protein is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies generated following infection, and constitutes the viral component of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: Therefore, in this work we assessed the effect of exposure (24 h) to 10 nM SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S1 protein on physiologically relevant human bronchial (bro) and alveolar (alv) lung mucosa models cultured at airCliquid interface (ALI) (n = 6 per exposure condition). Corresponding sham exposed samples served as a control. The bro-ALI model was developed using primary bronchial epithelial cells and the alv-ALI model using representative type II pneumocytes (NCI-H441). Results: Exposure to S1 protein induced the surface expression of ACE2, toll like receptor (TLR) 2, and TLR4 in both bro-ALI and alv-ALI models. Transcript expression analysis identified 117 (bro-ALI) and 97 (alv-ALI) differentially regulated genes (p  0.01). Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of canonical pathways such as interferon (IFN) signaling, influenza, coronavirus, and anti-viral response in the bro-ALI. Secreted levels of interleukin (IL) 4 and IL12 were significantly (p < 0.05) increased, whereas IL6 decreased in the bro-ALI. In the case of alv-ALI, enriched terms involving p53, APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) tight junction, integrin kinase, and IL1 signaling were identified. These terms are associated with lung fibrosis. Further, significantly (p < 0.05) increased levels of secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN, IL1?, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL13, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were detected in alv-ALI, whereas IL12 was decreased. Altered levels of these cytokines are also associated with lung fibrotic response. Conclusions: In conclusion, we observed a typical anti-viral response in the bronchial model and a pro-fibrotic response in the alveolar model. The bro-ALI and alv-ALI models may serve as an easy and robust platform for assessing the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern at different lung regions.","output":"Differential Effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein 1 on Human Bronchial and Alveolar Lung Mucosa Models: Implications for Pathogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The United States COVID-19 epidemic has grown extensively since February 2020, with substantial associated hospitalizations and mortality; New York State (NYS) has emerged as the national epicenter.

METHODS: Specimen collection for COVID-19 testing was conducted in healthcare settings, community-based collection sites, and by home testing teams. Information on demographics, risk factors, and hospital outcomes of cases was obtained through epidemiological investigations and an electronic medical records match, and summarized descriptively. Active testing of initial cases households enabled estimation of household prevalence. RESULTS: During March In NYS, outside of New York City, a total of 47,326 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, out of 141,495 tests (33% test-positive), with the highest number of cases located in the metropolitan region counties.

Currently, the therapy benefits of antiviral experimental drugs are still uncertain. The main aim of this study is to describe the experience of a level III hospital regarding therapeutic management of hospitalized children with COVID-19 and to characterize clinical features and evolution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a descriptive study of patients with COVID-19 in a level III pediatric hospital in Portugal between March and June 2020. Experimental drugs were administered according to the best scientific evidence at the time as 'off-label use'. RESULTS: Among 200 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 37 were admitted due to COVID-19. Median age was one year (23 days - 18 years), 43% had comorbidities and 20/37 (54%) received antiviral therapy. Hydroxychloroquine was administered in 13 patients, in monotherapy or combined with lopinavir/ritonavir or azithromycin. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered in eight patients and three children were treated with remdesivir. The patients who were treated had pneumonia (14), multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (2), sepsis (2), myocarditis (1), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1), and mild illness with comorbidities (3). Other therapies included methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin (3), enoxaparin (2), antibiotics (16), oxygen (7), corticosteroids, and other inhaled therapy (16). DISCUSSION: Several treatment approaches have been proposed for severe COVID-19, even though none of them had been proven effective or approved for small children. Currently, remdesivir is approved for children aged above 12 years-old. Although 54% of our patients were treated with antivirals, it is important to understand that the favorable clinical evolution could be related with the natural course of the disease. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of our population presented severe and critical disease, was hospitalized and received treatment according to the most recent data, although most patients had mild disease.

Eighty-nine patients who developed AKI, but didnt have prior kidney diseases were involved in the final analysis. Patients were classified into three groups, those who had AKI on admission, those who developed AKI in the first week and those who developed AKI starting from the 7 th day. Electrolytes, acid-base status and changes in the inflammatory markers were compared. Results: AKIs that were seen on hospital admission day were generally transient. Patients who developed AKI after the 7 th day had higher peak CRP and D-dimer levels and lower nadir lymphocyte counts (p=0.000, 0.004 and 0.003 respectively). AKI that developed later was more related to immunologic response and had significantly higher mortality, reaching as high as 44% after 7 th day.

METHODS: Prospective cohort study of patients who developed ARDS during hospitalization due to COVID-19 compared with a control group of patients who had COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms. All patients were evaluated between the 12th and 24th week after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evaluation includes persistent symptoms, lung diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), chest CT scan and home sleep apnea test.

We used holographic microscopy to image swimming cells of different Leishmania mexicana life cycle stages in three dimensions. We find that the human-infective (metacyclic promastigote) forms display 'run and tumble' behaviour in the absence of stimulus, reminiscent of bacterial motion, and that they specifically modify swimming direction and speed to target host immune cells in response to a macrophage-derived stimulus. Non-infective (procyclic promastigote) cells swim more slowly, along meandering helical paths.

How much do they respect me?). The grounded model and practice-based evidence presented here summarize the strategies and approaches educators used to respond to these unspoken queries and communicate to students various aspects of their selves and their stance, including their motivation, empathy and respect for students, self-awareness and credibility, their professional ability, and finally, their commitment to helping students and investing emotional labor in them.

Alternatives such as serological diagnosis and maintenance of HPVs in culture are neither clinically useful nor consistently feasible. Novel HPV isolates have traditionally been described as \\"types\\". The analysis of specific HPV types is of medical importance, because HPV types typically induce type-specific lesions, i.e. they may be specific for cutaneous or mucosal epithelia, or give rise to benign warts or malignant carcinomas. Recently, it was formally decided that papillomaviruses are a virus family separate from the polyomaviruses. Within the papillomavirus family, closely or remotely related types form species or genera. These formal agreements were important as they brought the taxonomy of papillomaviruses in line with that of other viruses, bacteria and higher organisms, although their impact on medical practice and terminology used in clinical studies is limited. Notably, however, HPV types that are closely related (i.e. form \\"species\\") are associated with similar lesions. Confusion of the terms \\"type\\" and \\"subtype\\" should be avoided, as the latter term refers to some specific but rare taxonomic assemblages. In contrast to many RNA viruses, HPV types evolve very slowly, and diverged since the origin of humans only by about 2%. These divergent isolates are called \\"variants\\".

METHODS: The management of all patients presenting to the emergency department over three successive time periods was evaluated; the baseline, academic detailing and CDSS periods. The rate of empiric antibiotic prescribing that was concordant with recommendations was studied over time comparing pre and post periods and using an interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: The odds ratio for concordant therapy in the academic detailing period, after adjustment for age, illness severity and suspicion of aspiration, compared with the baseline period was OR = 2.79 [1.88, 4.14], p < 0.01, and for the computerised decision support period compared to the academic detailing period was OR = 1.99 [1.07, 3.69], p = 0.02.

Both of these are also recognized as risk factors for severity and poor outcome of COVID-19 disease. It is assumed that COVID-19 outbreak as well as an effective lockdown might have affected the incidence and outcome of some of these. METHODS: To substantiate above hypothesis, an online survey was mailed to 547 pulmonologists across the country; 314 (54.7%) responses were recorded in the given period. The survey included observations on incidence and outcome of common chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD and interstitial lung diseases (ILD) in predefined pre-COVID and during COVID period in a total of 24 questions. RESULTS: It was observed that the reduction in incidence of outpatient department cases, acute exacerbations and hospitalization for asthma, COPD and ILD was statistically significant. The outcome of acute exacerbations of these chronic respiratory diseases was analyzed in terms of discharges from hospitals after satisfactory recovery and/ or mortalities. For COPD and ILD, it was not significantly affected during the COVID period. At the same time, a relatively higher proportion of acute asthma mortality was reported. A wide variation in nebulization practices was reported during this period. The doses of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma management were not affected. A wide variety of factors including effective lockdown, better quality of air and regular use of masks were probably responsible for reduced incidence of exacerbations of these chronic respiratory diseases. CONCLUSION: We conclude that while outpatient department visits, acute exacerbations and hospitalizations were significantly reduced during COVID-19 period, outcome of asthmatics was relatively unfavorable as compared to that of COPD and ILDs.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on (Non-COVID) chronic respiratory disease outcome survey in India (CCROS study)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sebagai negara dengan penduduk paling besar nomor 4 di dunia Indonesia merupakan negara dengan dampak wabah COVID-19 paling parah di Asia Tenggara.

Secondly, we compared the incidence of interstitial pneumonia on [(18)F]-FDG PET/CT and epidemiological data from the regional registry of COVID-19 cases. Additionally, imaging findings and the intensity of [(18)F]-FDG PET/CT uptake in terms of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were compared. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed [(18)F]-FDG PET/CT scans performed in cancer patients referred to nuclear medicine of Humanitas Gavazzeni in Bergamo from December 2019 to May 2020 and from December 2018 to May 2019. The per month incidence of interstitial pneumonia at imaging and the epidemiological data were assessed. To evaluate the differences between the two symmetric groups (period of COVID-19 pandemic and control), the stratified CochranCMantelCHaenszel test was used. Chi-square test or Fishers exact test and t test or Wilcoxon test were performed to compare the distributions of categorical and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, 1298 patients were included in the study. The two cohortsCOVID-19 pandemic (n = 575) and control (n = 723)did not statistically differ in terms of age, disease, or scan indication (p > 0.05). Signs of interstitial pneumonia were observed in 24 (4.2%) and 14 patients (1.9%) in the COVID-19 period and the control period, respectively, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.013). The level of statistical significance improved further when the period from January to May was considered, with a peak in March (7/83 patients, 8.4% vs 3/134 patients, 2.2%, p = 0.001). The curve of interstitial pneumonia diagnosis overlapped with the COVID-19 incidence in the area of Lombardy (Spearman correlation index was equal to 1). Imaging data did not differ among the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Significant increase of interstitial lung alterations at [(18)F]-FDG PET/CT has been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the incidence curve of imaging abnormalities resulted in resembling the epidemiological data of the general population. These data support the rationale to adopt [(18)F]-FDG PET/CT as sentinel modality to identify suspicious COVID-19 cases to be referred for additional confirmatory testing.

This approach ignores how systems interact and how their systemic properties shape socioeconomic outcomes, leading to an over-emphasis on a limited set of characteristics, notably efficiency. We argue that this emphasis on efficiency in the operation, management and outcomes of various economic and social systems is not a conscious collective choice, but rather the response of the whole system to the incentives that individual components face. This has brought much of the world to rely upon complex, nested, and interconnected systems to deliver goods and services around the globe. While this approach has many benefits, the Covid-19 crisis shows how it has also reduced the resilience of key systems to shocks, and allowed failures to cascade from one system to others.

In Ghana, previous studies on health and safety in the construction industry that touched on PPE use did not explicitly demonstrate the reasons why many workers choose to use or not to use it, though they may be at risk of occupational hazards. The purpose of this study was to determine building construction artisans' level of access to PPE and the perceived barriers and motivating factors of adherence to its use. The contribution of this study lies in its examination of the perceived barriers and motivating factors underlying adherence and nonadherence to PPE use in the construction industry, particularly building construction, which is yet to be determined in Ghana. METHOD: Data was collected from 173 frontline building construction workers using a structured questionnaire. The data was analyzed using a two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine the effects of demographic variables on the perceived barrier and motivating factors of adherence to PPE use. RESULTS: The most common PPE that participants had access to was safety boots/shoes, with their main source being borrowing from colleagues. The majority of participants disagreed with the perceived barriers while agreeing with the motivating factors of adherence to PPE use. The results suggest statistically significant differences for years of working experience (Wilks = 0.77, F = 2.47; p  0.01) and form of employment (Wilks = 0.72, F = 3.25, p  0.01) for perceived barriers to adherence.

Several studies have suggested abundant ACE2 expression in the human lung, inferring strong permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection with resultant alveolar damage and lung injury. Against this expectation, we provide evidence that ACE2 expression must be considered scarce, thereby limiting SARS-CoV-2 propagation in the human alveolus. Instead, spectral imaging of ex vivo infected human lungs and COVID-19 autopsy samples depicted that alveolar macrophages were frequently positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicating viral phagocytosis. Single-cell transcriptomics of SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung tissue further revealed strong inflammatory and anti-viral activation responses in macrophages and monocytes, comparable to those induced by MERS-CoV, but with virus-specific gene expression profiles. Collectively, our findings indicate that severe lung injury in COVID-19 likely results from an overwhelming immune activation rather than direct viral damage of the alveolar compartment.Funding: ACH, LES, SH were supported by Berlin University Alliance GC2 Global Health (Corona Virus Pre-Exploration Project).

The risk of severe COVID-19 is increased by certain underlying comorbidities, including asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Notably, exposure to hormonally active chemicals called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can promote such cardio-metabolic diseases, endocrine-related cancers, and immune system dysregulation and thus, may also be linked to higher risk of severe COVID-19. Bisphenol A (BPA) is among the most common EDCs and exerts its effects via receptors which are widely distributed in human tissues, including nuclear oestrogen receptors (ER&#945; and ER?), membrane-bound oestrogen receptor (G protein-coupled receptor 30; GPR30), and human nuclear receptor oestrogen-related receptor gamma. As such, this paper focuses on the potential role of BPA in promoting comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19, as well as on potential BPA-induced effects on key SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Interestingly, GPR30 appears to exhibit greater co-localisation with TMPRSS2 in key tissues like lung and prostate, suggesting that BPA exposure may impact on the local expression of these SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators. Overall, the potential role of BPA on the risk and severity of COVID-19 merits further investigation.","output":"Is There a Link between Bisphenol A (BPA), a Key Endocrine Disruptor, and the Risk for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Severe COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Around the globe, moderate cases account for the largest proportion of all COVID-19 patients, and deteriorated moderate patients contribute the most","output":"Pattern of Deterioration in Moderate Patients with COVID-19: A Multi-Center, Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through a recent upsurge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the clinical assessment of most of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients clearly presents a health condition with the loss of oro-naso-sensory (ONS) perception, responsible for the detection of flavor and savor.

There is no direct report available on the loss of these chemical senses in obese COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, obesity has been shown to be associated with low ONS cues. These alterations in obese subjects are due to obesity-induced altered expression of olfacto-taste receptors. Besides, obesity may further aggravate the SARS-CoV-2 infection, as this pathology is associated with a high degree of inflammation/immunosuppression and reduced protection against viral infections. Hence, obesity represents a great risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it may hide the viral-associated altered ONS symptoms, thus leading to a high mortality rate in these subjects.","output":"Obesity and COVID-19: Oro-Naso-Sensory Perception"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is disrupting and transforming the world.

In our study, we describe the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics; clinical progression; and outcome of 1,263 asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients isolated in one such CCC between May 4, 2020 and June 4, 2020. Around 10.5% of the patients progressed to moderate/severe illness, requiring referral for tertiary care, and three died. Nearly half (49.5%) of the patients were symptomatic at the time of admission, 2.2% of the patients developed symptoms post-testing, and 48.5% patients remained asymptomatic during the entire course of illness. Most common presenting symptoms were fever (69.9%) and cough (29.6%), followed by generalized body pain, breathlessness, and loss of smell and taste. On multivariate analysis, we identified that symptomatic patients with comorbidities and higher neutrophilClymphocyte ratio (NLR) were more likely to progress to severe illness warranting referral for tertiary care. COVID Care Center ensured case isolation and monitoring of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients, thereby providing hospital beds for sick patients. COVID Care Center isolation facilities are safe alternatives for medical institutions to isolate and monitor COVID-19 patients. Older symptomatic patients with comorbidities and a high NLR admitted in an isolation facility must be frequently monitored for prompt identification of clinical progression and referral to higher center for advanced medical care.","output":"Clinical Outcomes among Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic COVID-19 Patients in an Isolation Facility in Chennai, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If conservationists of the Global North are serious about saving the Earth, and I would like to believe they are, then they need to listen carefully to people such as Nemonte Nenquimo of the Waorani Indigenous people in the Amazon (This is my message to the western worldyour civilization is killing life on Earth;Nenquimo, 2020), and to those communities who have told the advocates of nature-based solutions that our nature is not your solution (Global Forest Coalition, 2020b) Global networks comprising Indigenous peoples and local community organizations and civil society groups, such as the Indigenous Peoples & Community Conserved Territories & Areas Consortium (ICCA, 2021), and the Global Forest Coalition, have shown how community-led conservation approaches, especially if there is a supportive policy context such as recognition of tenure and the right of self-determination, can work Most Half-Earth protagonists live in conditions radically altered by industrialization: they cannot possibly imagine living one's whole life as an artisanal hunter, gatherer, fisher, farmer or forest-dweller whose livelihood, culture, entertainment, language, food, relationships and emotions are conditioned by everyday interactions with the natural world","output":"Half-Earth or Whole-Earth?

This provided a wealth of data to examine the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in this multi-ethnic city, while assessing the contributions of cardio-metabolic burden and pulmonary conditions as potential at-risk conditions for COVID-19. We assessed the relative contribution of common upper and lower airway pulmonary diseases in determining the likelihood of COVID-19-related mortality independent of other medical conditions, health risks, and sociodemographic factors. METHODS: We analyzed data from one of the largest US-based case series of patients with COVID-19, captured from an academic health network in NYC. A total of 11,512 hospitalized patients (March 2-May 24, 2020) were tested with 4,446 (38.62%) receiving a positive diagnosis for COVID-19. EHR queries yielded age at time of testing, sex, race/ethnicity aggregated as non-Hispanic black, Asian and Hispanic referenced to non-Hispanic white; cardio-metabolic conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, peripheral artery disease, and coronary artery disease); pulmonary disease (e.g., COPD, sleep apnea, or asthma); autoimmune disease; and cancer. Mortality was based on the patient state (alive or deceased) at the moment of discharge. We included only patients who had been discharged alive or had expired. Anaconda Python 3.7 was used to perform all analyses. RESULTS: Among patients testing positive, 959 (21.57%) died of COVID-19-related complications at the hospital. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling showed mortality risks were strongly associated with greater age (HR=1.05; 95%CI:1.04C1.05), ethnic minority (HR=1.26; 95%CI:1.10C1.44), low household income (HR=1.29; 95%CI:1.11, 1.49), and male sex (HR=0.85; 95%CI:0.74, 0.97). Higher mortality risks were also associated with a history of COPD (HR=1.27; 95%CI:1.02C1.58), obesity (HR=1.19; 95%CI:1.04C1.37) and peripheral artery disease (HR=1.33; 95%CI:1.05C1.69). We observed a significantly higher rate of COVID-19 cases (43.8% vs 39.6%, p<0.05) among patients with sleep apnea (7.72%). However, they did not have a significantly higher mortality rate (13.0% vs 11.8%, NS), although they experienced a longer hospital stay (7.17.7 vs 6.17.5, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with COPD had the highest odds of COVID-19 mortality. Sociodemographic factors including increased age, male sex, low household income, ethnic minority status were also independently associated with greater mortality risks.

A consultant led VSC is held weekly to review the database and follow-up patients virtually. METHOD: Analysis of patients added over a 15-month period was performed. Outcomes included spontaneous stone passage rates, intervention rates and time from initial imaging to VSC outcomes. RESULTS: 615 patients with a median age of 48 years were analysed. Emergency referrals to urology accounted for 85.9% of data. VSC review occurred a median of 5 days after initial imaging. Majority of stones were lower ureteric (64.6%), 28.1% upper ureteric and 7.2% renal stones. Follow up data was available for 557 patients (90.6%). 73.6% of patients passed stones spontaneously. Median time from investigation to imaging was 21 days. 372 patients were discharged following VSC review. 111 patients were listed for surgical intervention. Median time to intervention was 21 days for ESWL, 62 days for ureteroscopy and 202 days for PCNL.

Mechanical ventilation may amplify ventilator-associated complications and extendresourceutilization.A better understanding of prognostic indicators could help in the planning and distribution of resources, particularly in resource-limited areas. We analyzed laboratory studies of intubated COVID-19 patients with the goal of identifying biomarkers that may predictextubationsuccess and survival to discharge. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on all COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation between January 3, 2020, and January 7, 2020, in a single academic tertiary care center in Northeastern New York State. The electronic medical record was used to collect 14 laboratory variables at three time points: admission, intubation, andextubation (including terminal extubation) for all intubated intensive care unit (ICU) patients treated for COVID-19. Mean laboratory values were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed with the two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results Seventy-two patients met the inclusion criteria. Forty-three patients were male. The mean age was 61 years. The overall mortality was 50%. On admission, intubated patients who survived had significantly higher platelet counts (p=0.024),and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC;p=0.047).Notably, ferritin(p=0.018)and aspartate transaminase (AST;p=0.0045) levels were lower in survivors. At the time of intubation, survivors again had a higher platelet count (p=0.024) and ALC(p=0.037) levels. They had a lower D-dimer (p=0.0014), ferritin (p=0.0015), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH;p=0.0145), and AST (p=0.018) compared to intubated patients who died. Atextubation, survivors had higher platelet count (p=0.0002), ALC (p=0.0013), andneutrophil/lymphocyteratio (NLR;p=0.0024). Survivors had lower d-dimer (p=0.035), ferritin (p=0.0012), CRP (p=0.045), LDH (p=0.002), AST (p&lt;0.001), and ALK (p=0.0048). Conclusions Biomarkers associated with increased risk of mortality include platelet count, ALC, lymphocyte percentage, NLR, D-dimer, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), AST, alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALK). This study provides additional evidence that these biomarkers have prognostic value in patients with severe COVID-19.

This study aimed to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of PTX-loaded polymeric nanoparticles based on &#945;-TOS (PTX-NPs) administered by direct intratumoral injection into a Hypopharynx carcinoma squamous cells (FaDu) tumor xenograft mouse model. The nanocarrier system based on block copolymers of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a methacrylic derivative of &#945;-TOS was synthesized and PTX was loaded into the delivery system. Tumor volume was measured to evaluate the antitumor effect of the PTX-NPs.

SAFF consisted of a column with an up-flow biofilter. The biological oxygen demand (BOD)5, chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate and phosphate were the chosen pollutants for evaluation. The pollutants removal efficiency was determined at varying organic loading rates and hydraulic retention time. The organic loading rate was varied between 0.25 and 1.25 kg COD m-3 d-1. The removal efficiency of SAFF and tubesettler combined was 75 % COD, 67 % BOD and 67 % phosphate, respectively. However, nitrate saw an increase in concentration by 25 %. SAFF contribution in the removal of COD, BOD5 and Phosphate was 48 %, 46 % and 29 %, respectively. While for accumulation of nitrate, it was responsible for 56%, respectively. Tubesettler performed better than SAFF with 52 %, 54 % and 69 % reduction of COD, BOD5 and phosphate, respectively. But in terms of nitrate, tubesettler was responsible for 44 % accumulation. The nutrient reduction decreased with an increase in the organic loading rate. Nitrification was observed in the SAFF and tubesettler, which indicated a well-aerated system. An anaerobic unit is required for completing the denitrification process and removing nitrogen from the effluent.

In response, brain antioxidant levels may also increase with age, although this has not been well investigated.

Accounting for age-related atrophy, we identified higher frontal and sensorimotor GSH levels for the older compared to the younger adults. For the older adults only, higher sensorimotor (but not frontal) GSH was correlated with poorer balance, gait, and manual dexterity. This suggests a regionally-specific relationship between higher brain oxidative stress levels and motor performance declines with age.

Here we investigate the impact of colloidal aggregation, a common artifact in early drug discovery, in these repurposing screens. We selected 56 drugs reported to be active in biochemical assays and tested them for aggregation by both dynamic light scattering and by enzyme counter screening with and without detergent; seventeen of these drugs formed colloids at concentrations similar to their literature reported IC50s. To investigate the occurrence of colloidal aggregators more generally in repurposing libraries, we further selected 15 drugs that had physical properties resembling known aggregators from a common repurposing library, and found that 6 of these aggregated at micromolar concentrations. An attraction of repurposing is that drugs active on one target are considered de-risked on another. This study suggests not only that many of the drugs repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 in biochemical assays are artifacts, but that, more generally, when screened at relevant concentrations, drugs can act artifactually via colloidal aggregation. Understanding the role of aggregation, and detecting its effects rapidly, will allow the community to focus on those drugs and leads that genuinely have potential for treating COVID-19.

Here, we report the assessment of the temporal evolution of the air quality in a tropical urban city (Butuan) in the southern Philippines by evaluating the trends of meteorological conditions (i.e., temperature, R.H., boundary layer height), air pollutants (i.e., PM2.5, NO2, O3) and their precursors (Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene) from 2014 to 2020. During the seven-year measurement, the mean PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations were 8.7  3.9 and 24.3  12.0 g mC3, with no single day exceeded the daily PM limit. The max concentrations of aerosol occurred during the dry season when the loss of particles through wet deposition was limited. Speciation of PM2.5 indicated that fine aerosol was dominated by sea salt and organic matter (OM). Analysis of the ratio of OM and sulfate indicated that the main source of pollution in the city was wildfire/biomass burning. The average O3 and NO2 mixing ratios during the same period were 22.3  9.5 ppb and 8.1  5.4 ppb while increasing at the rate of 0.409 ppb yearC1 and 0.683 ppb yearC1. The highest O3 concentration occurred during the summer months when photochemistry enhanced the formation of tropospheric O3. The increasing O3 trend was attributed to the contribution of anthropogenic VOCs (AVOCs), based on their ozone-forming potentials (OFPs). The seven-year measurement also showcased the variability of the atmospheric pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, when O3 substantially increased due to reduced vehicle transport activities. Overall, our results provide insights to better comprehend the sources of the variability of O3 and PM on a long-term temporal scale, as well as implications on relevant environmental policies in controlling air pollutants in a tropical developing region. ?

This study was undertaken to explore and analyse newspaper readers reactions to the unfolding news of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh and how this affected and shaped their compliance with the mitigation measures advised by the Government. METHODS: We collected readers comments on relevant news and features on the COVID-19 outbreak (n = 1,055) which were posted in the online versions of the four top circulating Bangla newspapers and one online news portal published during Jan.CApr. 2020. A search protocol was developed and a team of three researchers searched and extracted data for content analysis according to some pre-determined study themes. RESULTS: Data analysis revealed several characteristics with implications for risk-communication: a faith-based and fatalistic attitude to the unfolding pandemic, a denial syndrome in the initial stage, a returning expatriate-bashing for specific countries, and a concern about the safety of the frontline health workers. The readers were resentful of the all-pervasive corruption in the health sector even in times of a pandemic and the Government's poorly coordinated, fragmented, and delayed COVID-19 response. The pandemic severely shook their trust in the already weak health system and perceived it to be incompetent, corrupt, and non-responsive.

METHODS: Data were obtained using an online-only survey containing 46 questions, completed by a convenience sample of 209 psychiatrists in 19 countries. Descriptive statistics, and analyses of linear associations and to remove country heterogeneity were calculated. RESULTS: Virtually all psychiatrists seek information online with many benefits, but some experience information overload. 75.2% of psychiatrists use an EMR/EHR at work, and 64.6% communicate with patients using a new technology, primarily email (48.8%). 66.0% do not ask patients if they use the Internet in relation to bipolar disorder. 67.3% of psychiatrists feel it is too early to tell if patient online information seeking about bipolar disorder is improving the quality of care. 66.3% of psychiatrists think technology-based treatments will improve the quality of care for some or many patients. However, 60.0% of psychiatrists do not recommend technology-based treatments to patients, and those who recommend select a variety of treatments. Psychiatrists use technology more frequently when the patients live in urban rather than rural or suburban areas. Only 23.9% of psychiatrists have any formal training in technology.

METHODS A total of 100 patients and their partners or carers were invited to complete questionnaires regarding the impact of SSc on quality of life and psychological wellbeing using valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measures (OHIP-14, MHISS, OIDP, MDAS and HADS. A total of 50 patients with SSc and 18 partners or carers who acted as controls returned the completed questionnaires. Statistical analyses were performed for comparisons of different variables. RESULTS All the mean scores of OHIP-14 [SSc (16.512.4) Vs controls (6.067.6, P .001)], MHISS components were significantly higher in patients than those of control group [SSc (21.2612) Vs controls (4.87.3, P<.0001)]. Majority of OIDP mean scores were significantly worse in patients compared with controls [SSc (108.7) Vs controls (1.723.4, P<.0001)]. The mean of total MDAS [SSc (11.75.3) Vs controls (9.54.4)] and HADS scores were higher in patients compared to controls [SSc depression (4.83.3) and anxiety (64.6) Vs controls (3.73.1) (4.73.9)]. CONCLUSIONS Although the present study are limited by the low response rate and its cross-sectional design, present results highlighted that systemic sclerosis has a negative impact on OHRQoL of the affected individuals hence the evaluation of associated psychological impact including anxiety and depression symptoms is needed to better understand, monitor and evaluate the disease comorbidity in patients with SSc.","output":"Measuring the impact of systemic sclerosis on oral health-related quality of life in a UK population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multi-state models provide an extension of the usual survival/event-history analysis setting. In the medical domain, multi-state models give the possibility of further investigating intermediate events such as relapse and remission. In this work, a further extension is proposed using relative survival, where mortality due to population causes (i.e. non-disease-related mortality) is evaluated. The objective is to split all mortality in disease and non-disease-related mortality, with and without intermediate events, in datasets where cause of death is not recorded or is uncertain. To this end, population mortality tables are integrated into the estimation process, while using the basic relative survival idea that the overall mortality hazard can be written as a sum of a population and an excess part. Hence, we propose an upgraded non-parametric approach to estimation, where population mortality is taken into account. Precise definitions and suitable estimators are given for both the transition hazards and probabilities. Variance estimating techniques and confidence intervals are introduced and the behaviour of the new method is investigated through simulations. The newly developed methodology is illustrated by the analysis of a cohort of patients followed after an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

ACE2 metabolizes Ang II to Ang-(1C7) and is essential for the intestinal uptake of tryptophan (Trp), the 5-HT precursor. In ACE2-deficient mice, we observed a decrease in brain 5-HT levels and no increase in the number of BrdU-positive cells following exercise. Targeting the Ang II/AT1 axis by blocking the receptor, or experimentally increasing Trp/5-HT levels in the brain of ACE2-deficient mice, did not rescue the running-induced effect. Furthermore, mice lacking the Ang-(1C7) receptor, Mas, presented a normal neurogenic response to exercise.

Several mechanisms, including lung recruitment and better lung ventilation/perfusion matching, make a relevant rational for using PP. However, not all patients maintain the oxygenation improvement after returning to supine position. Nevertheless, no evidence exists that a sustained oxygenation response after PP is associated to outcome in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. We analyzed data from 191 patients affected by COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing PP for clinical reasons. Clinical history, severity scores and respiratory mechanics were analyzed. Patients were classified as responders (&#8805; median PaO2/FiO2 variation) or non-responders (< median PaO2/FiO2 variation) based on the PaO2/FiO2 percentage change between pre-proning and 1 to 3 h after re-supination in the first prone positioning session. Differences among the groups in physiological variables, complication rates and outcome were evaluated. A competing risk regression analysis was conducted to evaluate if PaO2/FiO2 response after the first pronation cycle was associated to liberation from mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: The median PaO2/FiO2 variation after the first PP cycle was 49 [19-100%] and no differences were found in demographics, comorbidities, ventilatory treatment and PaO2/FiO2 before PP between responders (96/191) and non-responders (95/191). Despite no differences in ICU length of stay, non-responders had a higher rate of tracheostomy (70.5% vs 47.9, P = 0.008) and mortality (53.7% vs 33.3%, P = 0.006), as compared to responders. Moreover, oxygenation response after the first PP was independently associated to liberation from mechanical ventilation at 28 days and was increasingly higher being higher the oxygenation response to PP. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained oxygenation improvement after first PP session is independently associated to improved survival and reduced duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"Sustained oxygenation improvement after first prone positioning is associated with liberation from mechanical ventilation and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The current Covid-19 pandemic has underlined the need for a more coordinated and forward-looking investment in the search for new medicines targeting emerging health care threats.

This information is necessary for government and philanthropic agencies to tailor mental health supports, services, and resources for veterans in the peri- and post-pandemic periods. The objective of this study was to compare mental health symptoms between Canadian Armed Forces (CAFs) veterans and the general Canadian older adult population in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study of older adults in the national Canadian COVID-19 Coping Study. Individuals aged 55 years and older were eligible. A convenience sample of older adults was recruited through a web-based survey administered between May 01, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Canadian Armed Force military service history status (yes/no) was ascertained. The eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the five-item Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the three-item Loneliness Scale were used to measure mental health symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression compared the odds of screening positive for depression, anxiety, and loneliness between veterans and non-veterans. RESULTS: Of 1,541 respondents who answered the final question (87% survey completeness rate), 210 were veterans. Forty percent of veterans met criteria for at least one of the mental health diagnoses compared to 46% of non-veterans (P = .12). The odds of reporting elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were similar for veteran and non-veteran respondents after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSION: Veterans' report of mental health symptoms was similar to the general population Spring 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a palliative care population at one New York hospital system during the initial pandemic surge. METHODS: This repeated cross-sectional, observational study collected data on palliative care patients in a large health system seen during the COVID-19 outbreak and compared it with pre-COVID data. RESULTS: Palliative service volume surged from 678 (4% of total admissions) before COVID-19 to 1071 (10% of total admissions) during the COVID-19 outbreak. During the outbreak, 695 (64.9%) of the total palliative patients tested positive for the virus. Compared with a preoutbreak group, this COVID-19-positive group had higher rates of male (60.7% vs. 48.6%, P < 0.01) and Latino (21.3% vs. 13.3%; P < 0.01) patients and less white patients (21.3% vs. 13.3%; P < 0.01). Our patients with COVID-19 also had greater prevalence of obesity and diabetes and lower rates of end-stage organ disease and cancers. The COVID-19-positive group had a higher rate of intensive care unit admissions (58.9% vs. 33.9%; P < 0.01) and in-hospital mortality rate (57.4% vs. 13.1%; P < 0.01) than the preoutbreak group. There was increased odds of mortality in palliative care patients who were COVID-19 positive (odds ratio = 3.21; 95% confidence interval = 2.43-4.24) and those admitted to the intensive care unit (odds ratio = 1.45; 95% confidence interval = 1.11-1.9).

METHODS: Twenty patients diagnosed with InfB from a hospital outbreak over a four-week-period were included. Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) positive for InfB by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction were sent for lineage typing and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Medical records were reviewed retrospectively for data regarding patient characteristics, localization, exposure and outcome, and assembled into a timeline. In order to find possible connections to the hospital outbreak, all patients with a positive NPS for influenza from the region over an extended time period were also reviewed. FINDINGS: All 20 cases of InfB were of subtype B/Yamagata, and 17 of 20 patients could be linked to each other by either shared room or shared ward.

METHODS A retrospective review of the initial 33 adult patients positive for COVID19 admitted to EHC, with respiratory failure and extubated from 3/8/2020 to 5/8/2020 was performed. Clinical characteristics were evaluated descriptively. RESULTS Successfully extubated patients averaged 56 years of age, males made up 91% of the population. Average BMI was 28.2 and hemoglobin A1C was 6.26. The mean maximum creatinine was 4.39 and max procalcitonin was 26. Mean admission and maximum D-dimer levels were 5,349 and 12,450 respectively, while mean admission CRP was 204. The mean days on nasal cannula, non-rebreather and CPAP prior to intubation were 5, 4, and 3, respectively, with overall mean time to intubation of 11.9 days and average length of stay of 20.6 days. The mean minimum PaO2 was 57.7 (most often on 100% FiO2) and max mean PEEP was 12.7. Total sedation days and total pressors days were calculated giving each pressor or sedative used the equivalence of 1 to provide an estimate of sedative and pressor requirements. The mean number of pressor days was 9.8;with a mean number of sedative days as 28. Survival after extubation at time of analyses was (21/33) 63%. CONCLUSION These results signal that these initial extubated patients were quite hypoxic and ventilated with a low PEEP strategy deviating from those suggested by surviving sepsis guidelines. They were in a hyperinflammatory state with moderate renal failure and propensity for infection, however, perhaps the BMI, low A1C scores, relatively fast decline in D dimers and ventilation with low PEEP strategy allowed them to be mechanically liberated. Classifying patient demographics and disease severity early can help identify patients likely to achieve successful extubation. The duration of preintubation oxygen support, duration of intubation, ideal vent settings, and realistic sedative requirements should be explored to optimize successful MV and extubation strategies.","output":"Clinical characteristics of initial patients successfully extubated after respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 at Elmhurst Hospital Center (EHC)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Breast Cancer (BC) is associated with inherited gene mutations.

We analyzed data from population-based infectious disease surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) among children <5 years of age in Kibera, a densely populated urban slum in Nairobi, Kenya. METHODS: Surveillance was conducted among a monthly mean of 5,874 (range = 5,778-6,411) children <5 years old in two contiguous villages in Kibera. Participants had free access to the study clinic and their health events and utilization were noted during biweekly home visits. Patients meeting criteria for SARI (WHO-defined severe or very severe pneumonia, or oxygen saturation <90%) from March 1, 2007-February 28, 2011 had blood cultures processed for bacteria, and naso- and oro- pharyngeal swabs collected for quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Swabs collected during January 1, 2009 C February 28, 2010 were also tested for rhinoviruses, enterovirus, parechovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella species. Swabs were collected for simultaneous testing from a selected group of control-children visiting the clinic without recent respiratory or diarrheal illnesses. RESULTS: SARI overall incidence was 12.4 cases/100 person-years of observation (PYO) and 30.4 cases/100 PYO in infants. When comparing detection frequency in swabs from 815 SARI cases and 115 healthy controls, only RSV and influenza A virus were significantly more frequently detected in cases, although similar trends neared statistical significance for PIV, adenovirus and hMPV. The incidence for RSV was 2.8 cases/100 PYO and for influenza A was 1.0 cases/100 PYO. When considering all PIV, the rate was 1.1 case/100 PYO and the rate per 100 PYO for SARI-associated disease was 1.5 for adenovirus and 0.9 for hMPV. RSV and influenza A and B viruses were estimated to account for 16.2% and 6.7% of SARI cases, respectively; when taken together, PIV, adenovirus, and hMPV may account for >20% additional cases. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza viruses and RSV (and possibly PIV, hMPV and adenoviruses) are important pathogens to consider when developing technologies and formulating strategies to treat and prevent SARI in children.","output":"Severe acute respiratory infection in children in a densely populated urban slum in Kenya, 2007C2011"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of pediatric teledermatology, with centers showing increased uptake of teledermatology.

In Texas, Latinx populations are overly represented among construction workers, and thus have elevated rates of exposure that are compounded by prevalent high-risk comorbidities and lack of access to health care. Objective: To assess the association between construction work during the COVID-19 pandemic and hospitalization rates for construction workers and the surrounding community. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical model used a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission, stratified by age and risk group, with construction workers modeled explicitly. The model was based on residents of the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan statistical area, with a population of 2.17 million. Based on 500 stochastic simulations for each of 15 scenarios that varied the size of the construction workforce and level of worksite transmission risk, the association between continued construction work and hospitalizations was estimated and then compared with anonymized line-list hospitalization data from central Texas through August 20, 2020. Exposures: Social distancing interventions, size of construction workforce, and level of disease transmission at construction worksites. Main Outcomes and Measures: For each scenario, the total number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and the relative risk of hospitalization among construction workers was projected and then compared with relative risks estimated from reported hospitalization data. Results: Allowing unrestricted construction work was associated with an increase of COVID-19 hospitalization rates through mid-August 2020 from 0.38 per 1000 residents to 1.5 per 1000 residents and from 0.22 per 1000 construction workers to 9.3 per 1000 construction workers. This increased risk was estimated to be offset by safety measures (such as thorough cleaning of equipment between uses, wearing of protective equipment, limits on the number of workers at a worksite, and increased health surveillance) that were associated with a 50% decrease in transmission. The observed relative risk of hospitalization among construction workers compared with other occupational categories among adults aged 18 to 64 years was 4.9 (95% CI, 3.8-6.2). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that unrestricted work in high-contact industries, such as construction, is associated with a higher level of community transmission, increased risks to at-risk workers, and larger health disparities among members of racial and ethnic minority groups.","output":"Estimated Association of Construction Work With Risks of COVID-19 Infection and Hospitalization in Texas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A comparative analysis of the COVID-19 diffusion in North African countries, Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia has been carried out with the aim to study the effects of the containment efforts in different nations and the reliability of the predictions based on the data fits by macroscopicgrowth laws with a small number of free parameters The comparison with data shows that the Coronavirus spreading has often different phases: an initial exponential behavior, followed by a Gompertz one and/or by a logistic phase, due to containment effort The study of the growth phases permits to verify the restarting of the disease spreading after a stationarity period due to new outbreaks or to the weakness of the social control measures The response of the National Health Systems to the emergency is discussed and some short-term predictions on the cumulative number of confirmed infected, on the hospitalizations and on the total number of deaths is done The possible correlation with immigration in other Mediterranean Countries has been analyzed Stable (or unstable) conditionof the spreading can quickly change due to a stronger or weaker application of the lockdown measuresand short-term predictions turn out to be reliable ? 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company","output":"COVID-19 in North Africa: Comparative analysis by macroscopic growth laws"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the factors affecting mortality of patients aged ?65 years who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).

Demographic, clinical, treatment and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors for in hospital death. RESULTS: 218 patients (112 men, 106 women) were included, of whom 166 were discharged and 52 died in hospital. With univariate analysis, various clinical features and laboratory variables were found to be significantly different (ie P <0.05). In multivariate logistic regression analysis; present malignancy (odds ratio [OR]= 4.817, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.107-20.958, p:0.036), dyspnea (OR=4.652, 95% CI=1.473-14.688, p:0.009), Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NRL) (OR=1.097, 95% CI=1.012-1.188, p: 0.025), the highest values of CRP (OR=1.006, 95% CI=1.000-1.012, p: 0.049), LDH (OR=1.002, 95% CI=1.001-1.004, p: 0.003) and creatinine levels (OR=1.497, 95% CI=1.126-1.990, p: 0.006), SpO2 values on admission (OR=0.897, 95% CI=0.811-0.993, p: 0.036) and azithromycin use (OR=0.239, 95% CI=0.065-0.874, p: 0.031) were independently associated with mortality.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine if a self-triage tool could reduce the burden on emergency call centers and help predict increasing burden on hospitals. METHODS: Users were asked questions about their underlying conditions, sociodemographic status, postal code, and main COVID-19 symptoms. Participants were advised to call an emergency call center if they reported dyspnea or complete loss of appetite for over 24 hours. Data on COVID-19Crelated calls were collected from 6 emergency call centers and data on COVID-19 hospitalizations were collected from Sant Publique France and the French Ministry of Health. We examined the change in the number of emergency calls before and after the launch of the web application. RESULTS: From March 17 to April 2, 2020, 735,419 questionnaires were registered in the study area. Of these, 121,370 (16.5%) led to a recommendation to call an emergency center. The peak number of overall questionnaires and of questionnaires leading to a recommendation to call an emergency center were observed on March 22, 2020. In the 17 days preceding the launch of the web application, emergency call centers in the study area registered 66,925 COVID-19Crelated calls and local hospitals admitted 639 patients for COVID-19; the ratio of emergency calls to hospitalizations for COVID-19 was 104.7 to 1. In the 17 days following the launch of the web application, there were 82,347 emergency calls and 6009 new hospitalizations for COVID-19, a ratio of 13.7 calls to 1 hospitalization (chi-square test: P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The self-triage web application launch was followed by a nearly 10-fold increase in COVID-19Crelated hospitalizations with only a 23% increase in emergency calls. The peak of questionnaire completions preceded the peak of COVID-19Crelated hospitalizations by 5 days. Although the design of this study does not allow us to conclude that the self-triage tool alone contributed to the alleviation of calls to the emergency call centers, it does suggest that it played a role, and may be used for predicting increasing burden on hospitals.

This paper suggests that scapegoating a few individuals for faulty science is a myopic approach to the more profound problem with peer-review. Peer-review in its current limited form cannot be expected to adequately address the scope and complexity of large interdisciplinary science research collaboration, which is central in translational research. In addition, empirical studies on the effectiveness of traditional peer-review reveal its very real potential for bias and groupthink; as such, expectations regarding the capacity and effectiveness of the current peer review process are unrealistic.

However, growth of live-virus vaccines must be attenuated to minimize their potential pathogenic effects, and mechanisms of attenuation by conventional serial-transfer viral adaptation are not well-understood. New methods of attenuation based on rational engineering of viral genomes may offer a potentially greater control if one can link defined genetic modifications to changes in virus growth. To begin to establish such links between genotype and growth phenotype, we developed a computer model for the intracellular growth of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a well-studied, nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA virus. Our model incorporated established regulatory mechanisms of VSV while integrating key wild-type infection steps: hijacking of host resources, transcription, translation, and replication, followed by assembly and release of progeny VSV particles. Generalization of the wild-type model to allow for genome rearrangements matched the experimentally observed attenuation ranking for recombinant VSV strains that altered the genome position of their nucleocapsid gene. Finally, our simulations captured previously reported experimental results showing how altering the positions of other VSV genes has the potential to attenuate the VSV growth while overexpressing the immunogenic VSV surface glycoprotein. Such models will facilitate the engineering of new live-virus vaccines by linking genomic manipulations to controlled changes in virus gene-expression and growth.","output":"Model-Based Design of Growth-Attenuated Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Disability innovation strengthens STEM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) have significant delays in cognition and language, as well as anxiety, symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, and challenging behaviors such as hyperactivity and aggression. Biological mothers of children with FXS, who are themselves FMR1 premutation or full mutation carriers, are at elevated risk for mental health challenges in addition to experiencing stress associated with parenting a child with significant disabilities. However, little is known about fathers in these families, including the ways in which parental well-being influences the mother-father relationship and the impact of child characteristics on paternal and couple functioning. METHOD: The current study examined features of, and relationships between, parental well-being, couple well-being, and child functioning in 23 families of young boys with FXS. Mothers and fathers independently completed multiple questionnaires about their individual well-being, couple functioning, and child behavior. One parent per family also completed an interview about the childs adaptive skills. RESULTS: Results suggest that both mothers and fathers in these families experience clinically significant levels of mental health challenges and elevated rates of parenting stress relative to the general population. Findings also indicate that the couples relationship may be a source of strength that potentially buffers against some of the daily stressors faced by these families. Additionally, parents who reported less parenting stress had higher couples satisfaction and dyadic coping. Finally, parents of children with less severe challenging behaviors exhibited fewer mental health challenges, less parenting stress, and higher levels of both couples satisfaction and dyadic coping. Parents of children with higher levels of adaptive behavior also reported less parenting stress and higher couples satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study provides evidence that families of children with FXS need access to services that not only target improvements in the childs functioning, but also ameliorate parental stress.

A class of such models considers the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased populations, the SEIRD model. However, these models do not always account for the movement of individuals from one region to another. In this work, we extend the formulation of SEIRD compartmental models to diffusion-reaction systems of partial differential equations to capture the continuous spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19. Since the virus spread is not only through diffusion, we introduce a source term to the equation system, representing exposed people who return from travel. We also add the possibility of anisotropic non-homogeneous diffusion. We implement the whole model in libMesh, an open finite element library that provides a framework for multiphysics, considering adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. Therefore, the model can represent several spatial scales, adapting the resolution to the disease dynamics. We verify our model with standard SEIRD models and show several examples highlighting the present model's new capabilities.","output":"Adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening for diffusion-reaction epidemiological models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Appropriate surveillance and early warning of infectious diseases have very useful roles in disease control and prevention.

District hospitals provide primary trauma care for a large proportion of this trauma burden, although most studies are in specialised or tertiary settings. The aim was to evaluate the profile of physical trauma patients attending the emergency centre at Helderberg District Hospital, Cape Town. METHODS: An observational descriptive study was conducted between 1 January and 30 April 2019. Patients with trauma were identified from a register and systematically sampled to achieve a sample size of 377. Retrospective data from medical records was collected and analysed in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. RESULTS: Of the 14,873 patients attending the emergency centre 24.6% were trauma related and 381 folders were analysed. Of these patients 30.4% were female and 69.6% male with an average age of 27.8 years. Over 60% of patients used an ambulance to get to the hospital. Sundays were the busiest days with 23.9% of all cases. Intentional trauma accounted for 45.4% of cases and accidental injuries 49.1%. The commonest mechanisms were sharp injuries (27.6%), falls (22.0%) and blunt trauma (19.4%). Intentional trauma made up more than half of all trauma in males, was more prevalent than accidental trauma between 20 and 60 years and resulted in a higher proportion of admissions. CONCLUSION: There were high levels of intentional trauma, especially involving young males over the weekend, mostly with sharp objects. This trauma burden resulted in high numbers of admissions and transfer to tertiary hospitals. Family physicians and other generalists need to be well trained in trauma resuscitation and stabilisation. District hospital need to be appropriately equipped and supplied to manage trauma.

Aside from angiographic findings, there is still no method that predicts the degree of safe partial embolization. Intraluminal measurement of flow velocity and pressure in the vicinity of the AVM nidus might allow detecting the changes in local hemodynamics.

Methods: 3,165 ( 25%) of US urology providers, representing 48 states and territories, participate in the American Urological Association Quality (AQUA) Registry, which collects data via automated extraction from electronic health record systems. We analyzed trends in PCa care delivery from 156 practices contributing data in 2019 and 2020. Risk stratification was based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis, biopsy Gleason, and clinical T-stage, and we used a natural language processing algorithm to determine Gleason and T-stage from unstructured clinical notes. The primary outcome was mean weekly visit volume by PCa patients per practice (visits defined as all MD and mid-level visits, telehealth and face-toface), and we compared each week in 2020 through week 44 (November 1) to the corresponding week in 2019. Results: There were 267,691 PCa patients in AQUA who received care between 2019 and 2020. From mid-March to early November, 2020 (week 10 - week 44) the magnitude of the decline and recovery varied by risk stratum, with the steepest drops for low-risk PCa (Table). For 2020, overall mean visits per day (averaged weekly) were similar to 2019 for the first 9 weeks (25). Visits declined to week 14 (18.19;a 31% drop from 2019), recovered to 2019 levels by week 23, and declined steadily to 11.89 (a 58% drop from 2019) as of week 44, the cut off of this analysis. Conclusions: Access to care for men with PCa was sharply curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and while the impact was less for men with high-risk disease compared to those with low-risk disease, visits even for highrisk individuals were down nearly one-third and continued to fall through November. This study provides real-world evidence on the magnitude of decline in PCa care across risk groups.

This study evaluated the feasibility of remote HbA1c monitoring via dried blood spot (DBS) testing to support assessment of glycemic control for telemedicine visits and examined clinical and demographic characteristics associated with patient completion of DBS testing. METHODS: Providers could place orders for DBS HbA1c 3 weeks prior to telemedicine visits. Feasibility was assessed by examining DBS completion rates, time to completion, and availability of DBS results prior to telemedicine visits. Chi-square tests and Mann Whitney tests were used to assess whether completion rates were associated with participant characteristics. RESULTS: Of 303 DBS orders placed for telemedicine visits in June 2020, 162 patients completed the DBS test for a completion rate of (53.4%). Average time from collection at home to result being reported was 6.9 (3.8) days. The DBS result was available in 67.6% of patients who completed successful DBS, before the telemedicine clinic visit. HbA1c was lower in the DBS completion group as compared to the non-completion group (8.2% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.01). No other clinical or demographic characteristics were significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Remote HbA1c monitoring via DBS is feasible and offers an avenue to support assessment of glycemic control for patients seen via telemedicine.

METHODS: A retrospective survey was performed comparing procedure volumes within March 2019 (pre-COVID-19) with April 2020 (during first wave of COVID-19 pandemic). Sixty-three (63) health care facilities within Oceania that perform cardiac diagnostic procedures were surveyed, including a mixture of metropolitan and regional, hospital and outpatient, public and private sites, and 846 facilities outside of Oceania. The percentage change in procedure volume was measured between March 2019 and April 2020, compared by test type and by facility. RESULTS: In Oceania, the total cardiac diagnostic procedure volume was reduced by 52.2% from March 2019 to April 2020, compared to a reduction of 75.9% seen in the rest of the world (p<0.001). Within Oceania sites, this reduction varied significantly between procedure types, but not between types of health care facility. All procedure types (other than stress cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR] and positron emission tomography [PET]) saw significant reductions in volume over this time period (p<0.001). In Oceania, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) decreased by 51.6%, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) by 74.0%, and stress tests by 65% overall, which was more pronounced for stress electrocardiograph (ECG) (81.8%) and stress echocardiography (76.7%) compared to stress single-photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) (44.3%). Invasive coronary angiography decreased by 36.7% in Oceania. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in cardiac diagnostic procedure volume was seen across all facility types in Oceania and was likely a function of recommendations from cardiac societies and directives from government to minimise spread of COVID-19 amongst patients and staff.

We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released.

We present final data from OCTAVE Open, an open-label, long-term extension study. AIMS The primary objective of OCTAVE Open was to assess the safety and tolerability of long-term tofacitinib in patients with ulcerative colitis; evaluating efficacy was a secondary objective. METHODS Eligible patients included OCTAVE Induction 1&2 non-responders and OCTAVE Sustain completers/treatment failures. Patients in remission at OCTAVE Open baseline received tofacitinib 5 mg b.d.; all others received 10 mg b.d. Incidence rates (unique patients with events/100 patient-years) for adverse events of special interest were calculated; 7.0 years of observation. Efficacy endpoints derived from Mayo score were reported 36 months (last scheduled endoscopy visit). RESULTS In OCTAVE Open, 769 of 944 patients (81.5%) initially received tofacitinib 10 mg b.d. Among all patients (2440.8 patient-years of exposure), incidence rates (IRs; 95% confidence intervals) for deaths and adverse events of special interest were: deaths, 0.25 (0.09-0.54); serious infections, 1.61 (1.14-2.20); herpes zoster (non-serious and serious), 3.16 (2.47-3.97); opportunistic infections, 0.87 (0.54-1.33); major adverse cardiovascular events, 0.16 (0.04-0.42); malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), 1.03 (0.67-1.52); non-melanoma skin cancer, 0.75 (0.45-1.19); deep vein thrombosis, 0.04 (0.00-0.23); pulmonary embolism, 0.21 (0.07-0.48). At Month 36, 66.9% and 40.3% showed clinical response, 64.6% and 37.1% had endoscopic improvement, and 58.9% and 33.7% maintained or achieved remission, with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg b.d. respectively.

METHODS: Original reports of SAT developed after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (mRNA, viral vector, or inactivated virus vaccines) were retrieved from a search of electronic databases. Individual patient data on demographics, medical history, type of vaccine, workup and therapies were collected. Wilcoxon rank-sum, KruskalCWallis and chi-squared tests were employed for comparisons. RESULTS: 30 articles including 48 reports were retrieved, 3 additional cases evaluated by the Authors were described and included for analysis. Of the 51 patients, 38 (74.5%) were women, median age was 39.5 years (IQR 34C47). Patients developed SAT after a median of 10 days (IQR 4C14) after the vaccine shot. Baseline thyroid exams revealed thyrotoxicosis in 88.2% of patients, decreasing at 31.6% at follow-up. Corticosteroids were used in 56.4% of treated patients. Patients undergoing non-mRNA vaccines were most frequently Asian (p = 0.019) and reported more frequently weight loss (p = 0.021). All patients with a previous diagnosis of thyroid disease belonged to the mRNA vaccine group. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated SAT is a novel entity that should be acknowledged by physicians. Previous history of thyroid disease may predispose to develop SAT after mRNA vaccines, but further studies and larger cohorts are needed to verify this suggestion. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated SAT is usually of mild/moderate severity and could be easily treated in most cases, thus it should not raise any concern regarding the need to be vaccinated.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated subacute thyroiditis: insights from a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the concept of cell signal regulation has two basic steps: activation and deactivation.

This indicates that, there is a mechanism that blocks the signal from being reactivated for a certain period of time after an activation is terminated. Here, we propose that cell's signal regulation consists of three basic steps: activation, deactivation, and blocking the signal from being reactivated for a certain period of time until cells are ready for a new activation. We explain the third step of regulation using GH/STAT5 and insulin/AKT signal pathways as examples, and discuss why the third step in regulation is important for cell homeostasis and the development of diseases.","output":"A New Cell Signal Regulation Theory: Blocking the Signal from being Reactivated Before a New Activation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the Lactate Dehydrogenase, C-Reactive Protein and Ferritin in suspected patients of COVID-19. Study Design: Cross-sectional validation study. Place and Duration of Study: Pathology department of Combined Military Hospital Lahore in the month of May 2020. Methodology: We included 101 adult (>18 years) symptomatic suspected COVID-19 patients of both genders. Children, pregnant women and asymptomatic patients were excluded from study. Age, gender and results of Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Lactate Dehydrogenase, C-Reactive Protein, ferritin were recorded. Results: Lactate Dehydrodenase had highest sensitivity (75%) with positive predictive value of 71.6% and diagnostic accuracy of 65.3% among three biochemical parameters studied. Receiver Operator Characteristic curve was studied. Area under curve of Lactate Dehydrogenase (AUC=0.65) and Ferritin (AUC=0.59) reflected their ability to prognosticate the presence of COVID-19 disease. However, C-Reactive Protein (AUC=0.42) appeared to be a poor predictor of the disease. Conclusion: Raised serum Lactate Dehydrogenase (>490 U/L) and Ferritin (>152 ng/L) levels can be used to predict the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction positivity for COVID-19 in the population of suspected patients of COVID-19.

Recently, the fast accumulation of gene transcriptional profiling data provides us an unprecedented opportunity to explore the protein targets of chemical compounds from the perspective of cell transcriptomics and RNA biology. Here, we propose a novel Siamese spectral-based graph convolutional network (SSGCN) model for inferring the protein targets of chemical compounds from gene transcriptional profiles. Although the gene signature of a compound perturbation only provides indirect clues of the interacting targets, and the biological networks under different experiment conditions further complicate the situation, the SSGCN model was successfully trained to learn from known compound-target pairs by uncovering the hidden correlations between compound perturbation profiles and gene knockdown profiles. On a benchmark set and a large time-split validation dataset, the model achieved higher target inference accuracy as compared to previous methods such as Connectivity Map. Further experimental validations of prediction results highlight the practical usefulness of SSGCN in either inferring the interacting targets of compound, or reversely, in finding novel inhibitors of a given target of interest.

Whilst mentoring is traditionally delivered face-to-face, telehealth e-mentoring is a novel alternative, affording a unique andragogy to facilitate mentee critical reflection, deep learning and enhanced knowledge translation C all developed to optimise patient care. With COVID-19 resulting in widespread adoption of telehealth and access to specialist mentors often limited by clinic space, geography and cost, the potential value of telehealth e-mentoring is considerable. The purpose of this study was to understand the experiences and outcomes of/for multiple stakeholders (patients, student-mentees and mentors) engaged in musculoskeletal physiotherapy telehealth e-mentoring. Methods: Using case study design, sequential mixed methods explored stakeholder experiences of a 20-week telehealth e-mentoring service in a UK University as part of an advanced practice Masters programme. Quantitatively, validated outcome measures, patient participant experiences for care and empathy, patient empowerment and change in musculoskeletal health were collected at baseline and discharge. Qualitatively, semi-structured interviews exploring experiences of telehealth e-mentoring, including influence on critical thinking, clinical reasoning, communication skills, confidence, motivation, career enhancement etc. with mentee participants, and a focus group with mentor participants (topic guide informed by earlier analysis) were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics (median, IQR) and qualitative data were analysed following the Framework Method. Trustworthiness was assured through reflexivity and code/recode audits with experts. Results: Data from patients (n = 90), mentees (n = 10) and mentors (n = 6) contributed to the developed analytic framework. Patients were aged median 42 years (18-73 years) presenting with a range of musculoskeletal complaints;n = 52 receiving follow up appointments. Of those followed up, improvements > MCID were clear, with MSK-HQ increasing by 11 points (MCID 6), Patient Specific Functional Scores improving by 4 points (MCID 2.7), and high scores for the Consultation and Relational Empathy and Patient Enablement Instrument. Mentors and mentees provided rich descriptions of their experiences. Main themes (sub-themes) for mentee participants included a) social learning (group mentorship, feedback, individualisation), b) advanced professional practice (communication, clinical reasoning, reflective practice), c) learner experience (expectation/acceptance, enjoyment/motivation) and c) limitations of telehealth (hands-on skill development, caseloads, therapeutic relationship). Mentor participants included a) preparedness (telehealth skills, relationship building, managing perceptions/expectations), b) journey of development (formative feedback, peer discussions, mimicking behaviours) and c) challenges (non-verbal communication, home environment, exercise prescription/goal-setting). Conclusion(s): Telehealth e-mentoring is an appropriate alternative to face-to-face mentored clinical practice, with improved patient outcomes and developed advanced musculoskeletal physiotherapy skills, knowledge and attributes. Planning for telehealth e-mentoring requires multi-stakeholder preparation, including setting expectations, embracing creativity in practice, and acquisition of technical skills. Impact: Adoption of telehealth e-mentoring may enhance opportunities for practice-based professional development and provide needed additional capacity to support profession specific skill development and service capability, to meet planned growth in advanced musculoskeletal physiotherapists. This study provides evidence from patients, mentees and mentors to support e-mentorship within teleheal h clinical practice. Preparation, planning and articulation of clear expectations are important to optimise the experience.

Across many sectors, low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) lag behind more economically developed countries in their application of this safety science, due to resource and, in some cases, awareness and expertise. Most previous applications of HFE related to occupational ergonomics rather than healthcare safety. METHODS: The paper details how the reputation of HFE is being developed within healthcare communities of Latin America (LatAm), through increasing awareness and understanding of its role as safety science in the healthcare sector. It starts by articulating the need for HFE and then provides examples from Mexico, Colombia and Peru. RESULTS: The practical examples for research and education illustrate a developing awareness of the relevance of HFE to the healthcare sectors in LatAm and an appreciation of its worth to improve health service quality and patient safety through healthcare community engagement. A new LatAm Network of HFE in Healthcare Systems (RELAESA) was formed in 2019, which has provided a platform for HFE advice during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: There is a real opportunity in LatAm and other LMIC health services to make more rapid and sustainable progress in healthcare-embedded HFE than has been experienced within healthcare services of more developed nations.","output":"Frontiers in human factors: integrating human factors and ergonomics to improve safety and quality in Latin American healthcare systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the past four decades, most OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries have adopted or expanded paid family leave, which offers leave to workers following the birth or adoption of a child as well as care for ill family members While the effects of paid maternity leave on child health have been the subject of a large body of research, little is known about fathers leave-taking and the effects of paid paternity leave This is a limitation, since most of the recent expansion in paid family leave in OECD countries has been to expand leave benefits to fathers Mothers and fathers leave-taking may improve child health by decreasing postpartum depression among mothers, improving maternal mental health, increasing the time spent with a child, and increasing the likelihood of child medical checkup The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of paid family leave on the wellbeing of children, extending what we know about the effects of maternity leave and establishing new evidence on paternity leave The paper examines the effects of paid family leave expansions on country-level neonatal mortality rates, infant mortality rates, under-five mortality rates, and the measles immunization rates in 35 OECD countries, during the time period of 1990 to 2016 Using an event study design, an approximately 1 9 to 5 2 percent decrease in the infant, neonatal, and under-five mortality rates has been found following the adoption of paid maternity leave However, the beneficial impact is not as visible for extension of paid leave to fathers The implications and potential reasons behind the larger protective effects of maternity leave over paternity leave on child health outcomes are discussed","output":"Paid Family Leave and Children Health Outcomes in OECD Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since COVID-19 pandemic, attention has been drawn to the possible interactions between the deadly disease and a few other infections.

Multilevel logistic regression models were adjusted for age, parents' education level, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, being sexually experienced, and health literacy of medical forms and controlled for clustering by state. Age-stratified models by state-level age of consent for HIV testing and a subanalysis (including only sexually experienced participants) were also conducted. RESULTS Residing in a state with restrictive HIV testing policies was associated with the lack of awareness of home-based HIV testing (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.06; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.49, 6.28).

During the pandemic, children may develop emotional and psychological symptoms, including increased worries about health and illness, known as health anxiety symptoms (HASs). We aimed to explore HAS in 7-9-year-old children from the Danish Odense Child Cohort (OCC) during the first COVID-19 lockdown period in Denmark, and to examine associations with potential risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS OCC is a cohort of children born between 2010 and 2012, which originally recruited 2874 of 6707 pregnancies (43%). Among the current OCC population of 2430 singleton children, 994 participated in this study (response rate 40%). Children and their parents filled out questionnaires about child HAS, family exposure to COVID-19 infection and parental HAS. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated between high score child HAS (90th percentile) and covariates by use of logistic regression. RESULTS Most children (n = 686, 69%) reported few worries about their health. Children reporting high score HAS also had higher levels of internalizing symptoms at age 5; aOR 2.15 (1.20;3.85), p = .010, and higher levels of maternal and paternal HAS; aOR 2.40 (1.44;3.97), p = .001, and 2.00 (1.10;3.65), p = .023, whereas no association with child sex or familial exposure to COVID-19 was detected (n = 65, 6.5%).

METHODS Clinical data of 48 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older, who underwent surgical resection for GBM with intraoperative ultrasonography (IoUS) alone or combination with intraoperative MRI (IoMRI) at Yale New Haven Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Variables were analyzed, and comparative analyses were performed. RESULTS The addition of IoMRI was not superior to IoUS alone in terms of overall survival (OS) (P = 0.306), Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) at postoperative 6 weeks (P = 0.704) or extent of resection (P = 0.263). Length of surgery (LOSx), however, was significantly longer (P = 0.0002) in the IoMRI group. LOSx (P = 0.015) and hospital stay (P = 0.025) were predictors of postoperative complications. Increased EOR (GTR or NTR) (P = 0.030), postoperative adjuvant treatment (P < 0.0001) and postoperative complications (P = 0.006) were predictive for OS. Patients with relatively lower preoperative KPS scores (<70) showed significant improvement at postoperative 6 weeks (P<0.0001). Patients with complications (P = 0.038) were more likely to have lower KPS at postoperative 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Aggressive management with surgical resection should be considered in older patients with GBM, even those with relatively poor KPS. The use of ioMRI in this population does not appear to confer any measurable benefit over ioUS in experienced hands, but prolongs the length of surgery significantly, which is a preventable prognostic factor for impeding care.","output":"Surgical strategies for older patients with glioblastoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, biobanks have adapted, among other processes, the obtaining of informed consents (IC).

Though nursing homes increasingly receive attention, the majority of people with cognitive decline and dementia live at home. We aimed to explore the psychosocial effects of corona measures in memory clinic (pre-)dementia patients and their caregivers. Methods: Between April 28th and July 13th 2020, n = 389 patients of Alzheimer center Amsterdam [n = 121 symptomatic (age = 69  6, 33%F, MMSE = 23  5), n = 268 cognitively normal (age = 66  8, 40% F, MMSE = 29  1)] completed a survey on psychosocial effects of the corona measures. Questions related to social isolation, worries for faster cognitive decline, behavioral problems and discontinuation of care. In addition, n = 147 caregivers of symptomatic patients completed a similar survey with additional questions on caregiver burden. Results: Social isolation was experienced by n = 42 (35%) symptomatic and n = 67 (25%) cognitively normal patients and two third of patients [n = 129 (66%); n = 58 (75%) symptomatic, n = 71 (61%) cognitively normal] reported that care was discontinued. Worries for faster cognitive decline were existed in symptomatic patients [n = 44 (44%)] and caregivers [n = 73 (53%)], but were also reported by a subgroup of cognitively normal patients [n = 27 (14%)]. Both patients [n = 56 (46%) symptomatic, n = 102 (38%) cognitively normal] and caregivers [n = 72 (48%)] reported an increase in psychological symptoms. More than three quarter of caregivers [n = 111(76%)] reported an increase in patients' behavioral problems. A higher caregiver burden was experienced by n = 69 (56%) of caregivers and n = 43 (29%) of them reported that a need for more support. Discontinuation of care (OR = 3.3 [1.3C7.9]), psychological (OR = 4.0 [1.6C9.9]) and behavioral problems (OR = 3.0 [1.0C9.0]) strongly related to experiencing a higher caregiver burden. Lastly, social isolation (OR = 3.2 [1.2C8.1]) and psychological symptoms (OR = 8.1 [2.8C23.7]) were red flags for worries for faster cognitive decline. Conclusion: Not only symptomatic patients, but also cognitively normal patients express worries for faster cognitive decline and psychological symptoms. Moreover, we identified patients who are at risk of adverse outcomes of the corona measures, i.e., discontinued care, social isolation, psychological and behavioral problems. This underlines the need for health care professionals to provide ways to warrant the continuation of care and support (informal) networks surrounding patients and caregivers to mitigate the higher risk of negative psychosocial effects.","output":"Psychosocial Effects of Corona Measures on Patients With Dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment and Subjective Cognitive Decline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Few data are available regarding the combination of biologics or small molecules in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. We report safety and efficacy of such combinations through a retrospective multicentre series. METHODS Combination therapy was defined as the concomitant use of two biologics or one biologic with a small molecule. Patient demographics, disease characteristics and types of combinations were recorded. Safety was evaluated according to the occurrence of serious infection, opportunistic infection, hospitalisation, life-threatening event, worsening of IBD or immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), cancer and death. Efficacy was evaluated as the physician global assessment of the combination and comparison of clinical/endoscopic scores of IBD/IMID activity prior and during combination. RESULTS A total of 104 combinations were collected in 98 patients. Concomitant IMID were present in 41 patients. Reasons for starting combination therapy were active IBD (67%), active IMID or extra-intestinal manifestations (EIM) (22%), both (10%) and unclassified in 1. Median duration of combination was 8 months (interquartile range 5-16). During 122 patient-years of follow-up, 42 significant adverse events were observed, mostly related to uncontrolled IBD. There were 10 significant infections, 1 skin cancer and no death. IBD disease activity was clinically improved in 70% and IMID/EIM activity in 81% of the patients.

Objective: To evaluate the interferon (IFN)-&#945; levels in a cohort of COVID-19 patients in relation to severity, evolution of the clinical manifestations and immune/inflammatory profile. Methods: This is prospective study recruiting consecutive hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with SARS-COV-2 infection and matched controls. After enrollment, patients were assessed every 7  2 days for additional 2 consecutive visits, for a total of 21 days. The severity of the clinical condition was ranked based on the level of respiratory support required. At each time-point blood samples were obtained to assess immune cells and mediators by multiplex immunoassay. Results: Fifty-four COVD-19 and 11 control patients matched for severity were enrolled. At recruitment, lower levels of blood IFN-&#945; were found in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (3.8-fold difference, p < 0.01). Improvements in COVID-19 severity were paralleled by a significant increase of blood IFN-&#945; levels. A significant increase in blood IFN-&#945; was found over the study period in survivors (70% of the study population). A similar trend was found for blood IFN-? with IFN-? levels below the threshold of detectability in a substantial proportion of subjects. Significantly higher values of blood lymphocytes and lower levels of IL-10 were found at each time point in patients who survived compared to patients who died. In patients who clinically improved and survived during the study, we found an inverse association between IL-10 and IFN-&#945; levels. Conclusion: The study identifies a blood immune profile defined by deficient IFN-&#945; levels associated with increased IL-10 expression in patients progressing to severe/life threatening COVID-19 conditions, suggesting the involvement of immunological pathways that could be target of pharmacological intervention.

Methods: A two-wave panel survey of before and after the pandemic was performed to investigate the effects of remote work on these aspects among office workers. A total of 3,123 office workers from 23 tertiary industries responded to a questionnaire. Participants were surveyed about their job stress conditions and sleep practices in both 2019 and 2020, who had not done remote work as of 2019 were included in the study. The effects of remote work on psychological and physical stress responses and presenteeism were analyzed by multivariate analysis, with the adjustment of age, gender, overtime, job stressors, social support, and sleep status. Results: The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that remote work was associated with the reduction of psychological and physical stress responses independently of changes of job stressors, social support, sleep disturbance, and total sleep time on workdays. On the other hand, remote work of 5 days a week (full-remote) was associated with the reduction of work productivity.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic is an RNA virus prone to mutations. Formation of a stable binding interface between the Spike (S) protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) of host actuates viral entry. Yet, how this binding interface evolves as virus acquires mutations during pandemic remains elusive. Here, using a high fidelity bioinformatics pipeline, we analysed 31,403 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, and identified 444 non-synonymous mutations that cause 49 distinct amino acid substitutions in the RBD. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested independent emergence of these RBD mutants during pandemic. In silico structure modelling of interfaces induced by mutations on residues which directly engage ACE2 or lie in the near vicinity revealed molecular rearrangements and binding energies unique to each RBD mutant. Comparative structure analysis using binding interface from mouse that prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry uncovered minimal molecular determinants in RBD necessary for the formation of stable interface. We identified that interfacial interaction involving amino acid residues N487 and G496 on either ends of the binding scaffold are indispensable to anchor RBD and are well conserved in all SARS-like corona viruses. All other interactions appear to be required to locally remodel binding interface with varying affinities and thus may decide extent of viral transmission and disease outcome. Together, our findings propose the modalities and variations in RBD-ACE2 interface formation exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for endurance. Importance COVID-19, so far the worst hit pandemic to mankind, started in January 2020 and is still prevailing globally. Our study identified key molecular arrangements in RBD-ACE2 interface that help virus to tolerate mutations and prevail. In addition, RBD mutations identified in this study can serve as a molecular directory for experimental biologists to perform functional validation experiments. The minimal molecular requirements for the formation of RBD-ACE2 interface predicted using in silico structure models may help precisely design neutralizing antibodies, vaccines and therapeutics. Our study also proposes the significance of understanding evolution of protein interfaces during pandemic.","output":"Mutational landscape and in silico structure models of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain reveal key molecular determinants for virus-host interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Innovative patient engagement models are required to identify people with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease who are hidden in their communities and not normally found in a memory clinic setting.

When OPC is co-administered with levodopa (L-dopa) and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCis), peripheral catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is inhibited which increases L-dopa bioavailability. This study aims to explore the potential of OPC to enhance the clinical benefit of L-dopa/DDCi in patients with early-stage PD on stable treatment. Methods: Patients (aged 30C80 years) with idiopathic PD, treated with 3C4 daily oral doses of up to 500 mg L-dopa, with signs of treatable motor disability but no motor complications will be randomized (1:1) to receive OPC 50 mg once-daily or placebo during a 6-month double-blind evaluation period.

Forty-three percent (76) of respondents were in private practice, 36% (64) academics, 13% (24) privademics, and 6% (12) hospital employed. The most common telemedicine platform was Zoom. During the pandemic, 42% of patient visits were conducted via telemedicine;however, 37% required a subsequent in-person office visit. The most common complaint by surgeons was the inability to provide routine in-office procedures. The most beneficial feature was ease of use, and the most frustrating feature was connectivity difficulty. Time spent was similar to in-person visits, and surgeons were likely to recommend their platforms. Surgeons were neutral about using telehealth in the future and were most likely to use it for follow-up visits. New patient visits for traumatic injuries or fractures were of limited value.

Methods After obtaining IRB approval, we conducted telephone surveys of HTR (n=30) who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate their experience with acute COVID-19 illness and assess symptoms of Long COVID-19. Symptoms at onset and also beyond 6, 12, and 24 weeks of the initial diagnosis were recorded. Additionally, medical charts were reviewed for detailed information regarding transplant history, immunosuppression, COVID-19 management and hospitalization, and COVID-19 vaccination status. Results As noted in Table 1, among the 30 participants, 10 (33%) had symptoms consistent with Long COVID-19. Those with Long COVID-19 were more symptomatic during acute illness, with 40% of patients reporting cough, fevers or chills, and headaches, compared with 15%, 25%, and 20% respectively in those without Long COVID-19. Emergency department visits at initial illness (80% vs. 20%) and admission to the intensive care unit were more frequent (60% vs. 5%) in the Long COVID-19. Symptoms of Long COVID-19 lasted for a median of 9 weeks with 30% reporting ongoing symptoms at week 24. The most common persistent symptoms were depression, confusion, and difficulty concentrating. Conclusion This study is an early investigation of a complex syndrome of Long COVID-19 in transplant patients. Long COVID-19 is not well described in the transplant setting. HTR at our center with Long COVID-19 were sicker at their initial COVID-19 diagnosis and had more emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and longer hospital stays than those without subsequent Long COVID-19. Although, recall bias could affect participants ability to remember details and symptoms, this would have impacted both groups similarly as the time since COVID-19 diagnosis to study enrollment was similar between the two groups.

Modern clinical research features high complexity and requires a high workload for the management of trials-related activities, often hampering physicians participation to clinical trials. Dealing with children in clinical research adds complexity: rare diseases, parents or legal guardian reluctance to engage and recruitment difficulties are major reasons of pediatric trials failure. However, because in pediatrics many treatments are prescribed off-label or are lacking, well-designed clinical trials are particularly needed.

The rapid spread and highly contagiousness motivate the necessity of monitoring cases in real-time, aiming to keep control of the epidemic. As pointed out by [3], some pitfalls like limited infrastructure, laboratory confirmation and logistical problems may cause reporting delay, leading to distortions of the real dynamics of the confirmed cases and deaths. The aim of this study is to propose a suitable statistical methodology for modeling and forecasting daily deaths and reported cases of COVID-19, considering key features as overdispersion of data and correction of notification delay. Both, reporting delays and forecasting consider a Bayesian approach in which the daily deaths and the confirmed cases are modelled using the negative binomial (NB) distribution in order to accommodate the population heterogeneity. For the correction of notification delay, the mean number of occurrences regarding time t notified at time t + j (mean delayed notifications) is associated to the temporal and the delay lag evolution of the notification process through a log link. With regard to daily forecasting, the functional form adopted for the number of deaths and reported cases of COVID-19 is related to the sigmoid growth equation. A variable regarding week days or days off was considered in order to account for possible reduction of the records due to the lower offer of tests on days off. To illustrate the methodology, we analyze data of deaths and infected cases of COVID-19 in Esprito Santo, Brazil.

Case summary We report a case of a 70-year-old woman admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia who developed severe coagulopathy with multiple both, venous and arterial, embolisms in major vessels such as bilateral pulmonary embolism, acute thrombus in abdominal aorta, and acute thrombotic occlusion of the right iliac common artery.

Subsequently, the patient received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), antibiotics and antiviral therapy improving her renal function and her pneumonia, so she could be discharged safely. Discussion Prothrombotic coagulopathy due to enhanced acute inflammatory response and diffuse intravascular coagulation has been described in severe critical COVID-19 patients. This state of hypercoagulability is associated with organ dysfunction and mortality and may predispose to both, venous and arterial, thromboembolism.

The aim of this study was to compare C(rs) taking into account the applied PEEP. METHODS: Two cohorts of patients were created: those with COVID-ARDS and those with non-COVID ARDS. In the whole sample the association between C(rs) and type of ARDS at different PEEP levels was adjusted for anthropometric and clinical variables. As secondary analyses, patients were matched for predicted functional residual capacity and the same association was assessed. Moreover, the association between C(rs) and type of ARDS was reassessed at predefined PEEP level of 0, 5, 10, and 15 cmH(2)O with a propensity score-weighted linear model. RESULTS: 367 patients were included in the study, 276 patients with COVID-ARDS and 91 with non-COVID ARDS. The association between C(rs) and type of ARDS was not significant in both the complete cohorts (p = 0.17) and in the matched cohorts (p = 0.92).

In this article, we present the application of CNNs for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 using X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images of COVID-19 patients. The CNN models discussed in this review were mainly developed for the detection, classification, and segmentation of COVID-19 images. The base models used for detection and classification were AlexNet, Visual Geometry Group Network with 16 layers, residual network, DensNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, Inception, and extreme Inception. U-Net and voxel-based broad learning network were used for segmentation. Even with limited datasets, these methods proved to be beneficial for efficiently identifying the occurrence of COVID-19. To further validate these observations, we conducted an experimental study using a simple CNN framework for the binary classification of COVID-19 CT images. We achieved an accuracy of 93% with an F1-score of 0.93. Thus, with the availability of improved medical image datasets, it is evident that CNNs are very useful for the efficient diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19.","output":"Convolutional neural networks for the diagnosis and prognosis of the coronavirus disease pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is currently the most common bariatric procedure in France. It achieves both adequate excess weight loss and significant reduction of comorbidities. However, leak is still the most common complication after SG. Nevertheless, its risk of occurrence is <3% in specialized centers. Its management is difficult, long, and challenging. Although the procedure is commonly endoscopic and nonoperative, the management of post-SG fistulas could sometimes be surgical, including peritoneal lavage, abscess drainage, disrupted staple line suturing, resleeve, gastric bypass, or total gastrectomy. Roux-en-Y fistulojejunostomy (RYFJ) has been described as a salvage option. In this study, we report the early results of RYFJ for post-SG fistula, emphasizing indications, operative technique, and short-term outcome. METHODS Between January 2007 and December 2012, we treated 62 patients with post-SG fistula. Before surgery, intra-abdominal or thoracic abscesses or collections were either excluded or treated by computed tomographic scan-guided drainage or even surgery. Endoscopic stenting was then attempted. After optimization of the nutritional status in case of failure of endoscopic measures, some of the patients underwent RYFJ. RESULTS Between January 2007 and December 2012, a total of 21 patients (16 women and 5 men) had RYFJ for post-SG fistula. Mean age was 47 years (range, 22-59 years). Procedures were performed laparoscopically in all but 3 cases. The rate of secondary conversion to laparotomy was 11.1%. The was no mortality. The postoperative morbidity rate was less than 5%. The rate of fistula control was eventually 100%. CONCLUSIONS RYFJ is a safe and feasible salvage procedure for the treatment of patients with post-SG fistula. Longer outcome analysis is, however, needed especially regarding the physiological and metabolic behavior of the procedure.","output":"Roux-En-Y Fistulo-Jejunostomy as a salvage procedure in patients with post-sleeve gastrectomy fistula."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Remdesivir (RDV) is the only antiviral treatment conditionally approved to treat COVID-19 hospitalized patients (1). In Mexico, RDV received an Emergency Use Authorization on March 2021 for hospitalized adults with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (2). This study assessed to conduct a CEA of the use of RDV in hospitalized patients compared to the standard of care (SoC) in the Mexican context. Methods: A combined decision tree with a Markov model was used to perform a CEA of treated hospitalized adults for COVID-19 with RDV. In the first stage, patients were followed for 28 days during the hospital stay with a decision tree that consisted of three nodes: 1) the decision between SoC or RDV;2) whether patients received supplementary oxygen or not during the hospital stay, and 3) whether they remain alive or died. After the 28-days follow-up, in a second stage, patients who remain alive entered on a Markov model with two mutually exclusive health states (alive or dead) with one-year cycles. Probabilities, resource utilization, and costs (e.g., cost of hospitalization, monitoring tests, complementary medicines) were extracted from public governmental sources (3C6). Health outcomes (measured as Life-Years Gained -LYG) and costs were discounted following national guidelines (7). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: A thousand adults were modeled. In the base case, RDV provided 0.7 more LYG and generated savings for 1,722 USD compared to SoC (0.91 LYG and -2,038 USD in probabilistic analysis). Thus, RDV is a dominant intervention to treat COVID-19. Results were consistent for all sensitivity scenarios but only for all patients with severe COVID-19 (ICER 2,386 USD), remaining as a cost-effective option. Conclusions: Given the potential clinical benefits of RDV, the model estimated that RDV represents a cost-saving option to the Mexican health system for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","output":"POSC41 Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Remdesivir for the Treatment of COVID-19 Hospitalized Adults in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To estimate the weekly excess all-cause mortality in Norway and Sweden, and to estimate the years of life lost (YLL) attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden and the significance of mortality displacement. Methods: We found expected mortality by taking the declining trend and the seasonality in mortality into account. From the excess mortality in Sweden in 2019/20, we estimated the YLL attributed to COVID-19 using the life expectancy in different age groups. We adjusted this estimate for possible displacement using an auto-regressive model for the year-to-year variations in excess mortality. Results: We found that excess all-cause mortality over the epidemic year (July to July) 2019/20 was 517 (95%CI -12, 1074) in Norway and 4329 (3331, 5325) in Sweden.

To investigate metabolic effects of SARS-COV-2 infection, we evaluated serum metabolites of COVID-19 patients (n = 33; diagnosed by nucleic acid testing), as compared to COVID-19-negative controls (n = 16). Targeted and untargeted metabolomics analyses identified altered tryptophan metabolism into the kynurenine pathway, which regulates inflammation and immunity. Indeed, these changes in tryptophan metabolism correlated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism was also seen in infected patients, with altered levels of most amino acids, along with increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and renal dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis. Interestingly, metabolite levels in these pathways correlated with clinical laboratory markers of inflammation (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and renal function (i.e., blood urea nitrogen). In conclusion, this initial observational study identified amino acid and fatty acid metabolism as correlates of COVID-19, providing mechanistic insights, potential markers of clinical severity, and potential therapeutic targets.","output":"COVID-19 infection alters kynurenine and fatty acid metabolism, correlating with IL-6 levels and renal status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, an increasing number of patients are afflicted by olfactory loss, a now well-recognized symptom of the disease. Though many patients seem to recover their sense of smell after a few weeks, a certain proportion of them seem to develop long-lasting olfactory disorder. Yet, as of October 2020, there is no recommended standardized treatment to reduce the risk of developing long-term olfactory disorder. In this pilot study, we investigated the efficacy and the safety of oral corticosteroids and olfactory training as a treatment for patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction as a result of COVID-19. METHODS: Non-hospitalized patients with a sudden loss of smell and a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were recruited by hospital call from February to April 2020. These participants were submitted to an extensive psychophysical testing in order to identify those with persistent dysosmia. Dysosmic patients were then treated either by a 10-day course of oral corticosteroids combined with olfactory training, or by olfactory training alone. All participants were subject to a second olfactory test after a mean of 10 weeks. RESULTS: 72 subjects with documented COVID-19 infection performed the initial olfactory test, on average 5 weeks after losing their sense of smell. Amongst them, 27 (37.5%) patients showed persistent dysosmia and were all included in this study. Nine participants received oral corticosteroids and performed olfactory training (OCS + OT), while 18 performed olfactory training (OT) only. Only participants in the OCS + OT group had significantly improved their olfactory score and did so above the minimal clinically important difference for subjective improvement of smell (p = 0.007). Three of the participants who received oral corticosteroids reported minimal and transient side effects. CONCLUSION: This pilot study may suggest the combination of a short course of oral corticosteroids and olfactory training is safe and may be beneficial in helping patients with enduring dysosmia recover from olfactory loss due to COVID-19. There is a crucial need for further investigation with larger cohorts to corroborate these findings.","output":"Efficacy and safety of oral corticosteroids and olfactory training in the management of COVID-19-related loss of smell"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study in a sample of 1095 university students from southern Spain.

Participants were further categorized as: inactive (does not engage in physical activity or sport), engaging in physical activity that is not beneficial to health (300 min of moderate physical activity per week) and engaging in physical activity that is beneficial to health (300 min of moderate physical activity per week). Possible relationships with psychosocial factors and perceived psychological distress were explored. An ad hoc questionnaire was used to record the time in minutes of physical activity engagement per week. The ConnorCDavidson Resilience Scale, the Trait Meta-mood Scale, and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale were also administered. Statically significant differences are shown between the three examined groups: physical inactivity and non-beneficial physical activity; physical inactivity and beneficial physical activity, and; non-beneficial physical activity and beneficial physical activity. Positive and direct correlations were seen with respect to resilience and understanding, and emotional regulation, in addition to negative associations with respect to psychological distress.

Our analysis revealed the presence of neutrophils and macrophage cluster-1 as a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Among the identified gene signatures, IFITM2, IFITM1, H3F3B, SAT1, and S100A8 gene signatures were highly associated with neutrophils, while CCL8, CCL3, CCL2, KLF6, and SPP1 were associated with macrophage cluster-1 in severe-COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, although macrophages were also present in healthy subjects and patients with mild COVID-19, they had different gene signatures, indicative of interstitial and cluster-0 macrophage (i.e., FABP4, APOC1, APOE, C1QB, and NURP1). Additionally, MALAT1, NEAT1, and SNGH25 were downregulated in patients with mild and severe COVID-19. Interferon signaling, FC receptor-mediated phagocytosis, IL17, and Tec kinase canonical pathways were enriched in patients with severe COVID-19, while PD-1 and PDL-1 pathways were suppressed. A number of upstream regulators (IFNG, PRL, TLR7, PRL, TGM2, TLR9, IL1B, TNF, NFkB, IL1A, STAT3, CCL5, and others) were also enriched in BAL cells from severe COVID-19-affected patients compared to those from patients with mild COVID-19. Further analyses revealed genes associated with the inflammatory response and chemotaxis of myeloid cells, phagocytes, and granulocytes, among the top activated functional categories in BAL from severe COVID-19-affected patients. Transcriptome data from another cohort of COVID-19-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) revealed the presence of several genes common to those found in BAL from patients with severe and mild COVID-19 (IFI27, IFITM3, IFI6, IFIT3, MX1, IFIT1, OASL, IFI30, OAS1) or to those seen only in BAL from severe-COVID-19 patients (S100A8, IFI44, IFI44L, CXCL8, CCR1, PLSCR1, EPSTI1, FPR1, OAS2, OAS3, IL1RN, TYMP, BCL2A1).

Few data exist identifying decontamination strategies to inactivate viral pathogens and retain 3D-printing material integrity. OBJECTIVE: To test viral disinfection methods on 3D-printing materials. METHODS: The viricidal activity of common disinfectants (10% bleach, quaternary ammonium sanitizer, 3% hydrogen peroxide, or 70% isopropanol and exposure to heat (50C, and 70C) were tested on four 3D-printed materials used in the healthcare setting, including a surgical mask design developed by the Veterans' Health Administration. Inactivation was assessed for several clinically relevant RNA and DNA pathogenic viruses, including severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 and all viruses tested were completely inactivated by a single application of bleach, ammonium quaternary compounds, or hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, exposure to dry heat (70C) for 30 minutes completely inactivated all viruses tested. In contrast, 70% isopropanol reduced viral titers significantly less well following a single application. Inactivation did not interfere with material integrity of the 3D-printed materials.

However, smart windows usually produced from expensive and breakable glass materials. Herein, transparent smart window with long-persistent phosphorescence, high optical transmittance, ultraviolet protection, rigid, high photostability and durability, and superhydrophobicity was developed from recycled polyester (PET). Recycled polyester waste (RBW) was simply immobilized with different ratios of lanthanide-doped aluminate nanoparticles (LdAN) to provide a long-persistent phosphorescent polyester smart window (LdAN@PET) with an ability to persist emitting light for extended time periods. The solid-state high temperature technique was used to prepare LdA micro-scale powder. Then, the top-down technique was applied to afford the corresponding LdA nanoparticles. Recycled shredded recycled polyester bottles were charged into a hot bath to provide a clear plastic shred bulk, which was then well-mixed with LdAN and drop-casted to provide long-persistent luminescent smart window. In order to improve the phosphor dispersion in the PET bulk, LdAN was synthesized in the nanoparticle form which was characterized utilizing transmission electron microscope (TEM). For better preparation of translucent smart window of long-persistent phosphorescent polyester, LdAN must be homogeneously dispersed in the PET matrix without agglomeration. The morphology and chemical composition were studied by infrared spectra (FT-IR), X-ray fluorescent (XRF) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersion X-ray analyzer (EDS). In addition, spectral profiles of excitation and emission, and decay and lifetime were used to better understand the photoluminescence properties. The hardness properties were also investigated. The developed phosphorescent transparent polyester smart window demonstrated a color switch to intense green underneath UV irradiation and greenish-yellow under darkness as verified by CIE Lab color parameters. The afterglow polyester smart window showed an absorption wavelength at 365 nm and two phosphorescence intensities at 442 and 512 nm. An enhanced UV protection, photostability and hydrophobic activity were detected. The luminescent polyester substrates with lower LdAN ratios demonstrated rapid and reversible fluorescent photochromic activity beneath the UV light. The luminescent polyester substrates with higher LdAN contents displayed long-persistent phosphorescence afterglow. The current strategy can be simply applied for the production of smart windows, low thickness anticounterfeiting films and warning signs.","output":"Immobilization of lanthanide doped aluminate phosphor onto recycled polyester toward the development of long-persistent photoluminescence smart window"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND&AIMS Infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a highly morbid complication of acute pancreatitis(AP). Since there is evidence of immunosuppression in the early phase of AP, immune enhancement using Thymosin alpha 1 (T1), which stimulates both innate and adaptive immunity, may be a therapeutic strategy to prevent IPN. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of early T1 treatment on the development of IPN. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with predicted severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP). ANP patients with an APACHE II score[]8 admitted within seven days of the advent of symptoms were considered eligible. Enrolled patients were assigned to receive a subcutaneous injection of T1 1.6 mg, every 12 hours for the first 7 days and 1.6 mg once a day for the subsequent 7 days or matching placebo (normal saline). The primary outcome was the development of IPN during the index admission. RESULTS From Mar 2017 through Dec 2020, 508 patients were randomized at 16 hospitals, of whom 254 were assigned to receive T1 and 254 placebo. During the index admission, 40/254 (15.7%) patients in the T1 group developed IPN compared with 46/254 patients (18.1%) in the placebo group (difference -2.4% [95%CI -7.4% to 5.0%]; p=0.47). The results were similar in four predefined subgroups. There was no difference in other major complications, including new-onset organ failure (10.6% vs. 15.0%; p=0.15), bleeding (6.3% vs. 3.5%; p=0.15), and gastrointestinal fistula (2.0% vs. 2.4%; p=0.75) during the index admission.

Although the etiology varies, most traumatic nerve injuries occur in the upper limb and include damage to the radial nerve. In conjunction with the well-described effects of peripheral damage, nerve injuries are accompanied by changes in the central nervous system. A comprehensive understanding of the functional consequences of nerve injury is necessary to develop new therapeutic interventions. Objectives: We sought to characterize changes in sensory and motor function and central neurophysiology after radial nerve injury in rats. Methods: To evaluate somatosensory function in the forelimb, we assessed mechanical withdrawal threshold, spontaneous forelimb use, and cold sensitivity in rats 10 and 16 weeks after radial nerve injury. To evaluate motor function, we assessed performance on a forelimb supination task for up to 16 weeks after nerve injury. Physiological changes in the motor and somatosensory cortex were assessed using intracortical microstimulation and multiunit recordings, respectively. Results: Our results indicate that radial nerve injury causes long-lasting sensory and motor dysfunction. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by abnormal cortical activity in the somatosensory and motor cortex. Conclusion: Our results provide a novel characterization of functional deficits that are consistent with the clinical phenotype in patients with radial nerve injury and provide a framework for future studies to evaluate potential interventions.","output":"Radial nerve injury causes long-lasting forelimb sensory impairment and motor dysfunction in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction and Objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, among the safety measures adopted, use of facemasks during exercise training sessions in cardiac rehabilitation programs raised concerns regarding possible detrimental effects on exercise capacity. Our study examined the cardiorespiratory impact of wearing two types of the most common facemasks during treadmill aerobic training. Methods: Twelve healthy health professionals completed three trials of a symptom-limited Bruce treadmill protocol: Without a mask, with a surgical mask and with a respirator. Perceived exertion and dyspnea were evaluated with the Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion and the Borg Dyspnea Scale, respectively. Blood pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) were measured at each 3-minute stage. Results: Using a surgical mask or a respirator resulted in a shorter duration of exercise testing. At peak capacity, using a respirator resulted in higher levels of dyspnea and perceived exertion compared to not wearing a facemask. A significant drop in SpO2 was present at the end of exercise testing only when using a respirator. There were no differences in either chronotropic or blood pressure responses between testing conditions. Conclusions: Professionals involved in cardiac rehabilitation should be aware of the cardiorespiratory impact of facemasks.

Manuscripts on the use of Social Media by a selected age group and information gathering patterns in public libraries, emphasize that a focus on users of information services is still in the forefront as changing services to suit the technologically advanced user is of utmost importance for library services to remain relevant. Closely related is the issue of professionalism of the service providers. Exploring the interpersonal skills of librarians clearly reveal the importance of not only effective service delivery, but also the need for librarian to remain satisfied with their jobs and performance. This issue also publishes three manuscripts on bibliometrics and performance measurement as the LIS discipline matures in measurement methodologies. Having a vast audience to service is of utmost importance to the IJISL. As the discipline of LIS expands, an area which as caught my attention is Digital Scholarship. The higher education landscape has in the past few decades envisioned itself to be moving towards a technologically driven ubiquitous environment. We witnessed a large disparity in the movement as some countries lagged in this reform, but the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic managed to throw everyone into an emergency digitally enabled environment. What was being threaded upon with caution is suddenly a norm. In this new (to some) landscape, how can university libraries move ahead to secure an important role in the Digital Scholarship activities within their universities? Firstly, it is important to define Digital Scholarship within the academic/university institution, as it is considered to be multifaceted in nature needing a multitude of skills. The term digital undoubtedly indicates use of electronic technology, while scholarship indicates learning or knowledge acquired by study. Thus, Digital Scholarship is often described as activities that make use of digital tools and media to advance knowledge and research, and platforms to share, all of which are made possible via collaborative connections within the community. Once defined, the activities relating to institutional practices can be identified. This may include, among others, digital data management, digital information resources provision and use, providing digital tools to improve sharing and publishing. These activities can be successfully practiced with expected outcomes when librarians can form effective collaborative partnerships with the academia and researchers.

OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based estimates of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and projected cumulative numbers of severely ill pediatric COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the US 2020 pandemic. DESIGN: Empirical case projection study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted pediatric severity proportions and adjusted pediatric criticality proportions were derived from clinical and spatiotemporal modeling studies of the COVID-19 epidemic in China for the period January-February 2020. Estimates of total children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States through April 6, 2020, were calculated using US pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) cases and the adjusted pediatric criticality proportion. Projected numbers of severely and critically ill children with COVID-19 were derived by applying the adjusted severity and criticality proportions to US population data, under several scenarios of cumulative pediatric infection proportion (CPIP). RESULTS: By April 6, 2020, there were 74 children who had been reported admitted to PICUs in 19 states, reflecting an estimated 176 190 children nationwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 (52 381 infants and toddlers younger than 2 years, 42 857 children aged 2-11 years, and 80 952 children aged 12-17 years). Under a CPIP scenario of 5%, there would be 3.7 million children infected with SARS-CoV-2, 9907 severely ill children requiring hospitalization, and 1086 critically ill children requiring PICU admission. Under a CPIP scenario of 50%, 10 865 children would require PICU admission, 99 073 would require hospitalization for severe pneumonia, and 37.0 million would be infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Because there are 74.0 million children 0 to 17 years old in the United States, the projected numbers of severe cases could overextend available pediatric hospital care resources under several moderate CPIP scenarios for 2020 despite lower severity of COVID-19 in children than in adults.","output":"COVID-19 in Children in the United States: Intensive Care Admissions, Estimated Total Infected, and Projected Numbers of Severe Pediatric Cases in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundDuring the UKs first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, ambulance services acted to increase capacity rapidly.

Students participated from 3 of 4 partner universities, and lecturers from 2 of the 4. Their responses were transcribed and coded into a framework of the four processes of organisational entry: analysis, recruitment, selection, and induction.ResultsThe participants described barriers and facilitators to the success of the scheme in all four processes. Analysis: job descriptions and working conditions were not always clear to interviewees. Recruitment: some students described feeling under pressure to take part. Lecturers criticised communications, particularly around some of their student paramedics who had withdrawn from study. Selection: students were critical of some aspects of physical assessment being omitted for this new role, but later reinstated for subsequent paramedic recruitment events. Induction: most students praised the initial training and their induction onto ambulance stations, but many felt they should have been given driver training. Lecturers raised concerns that students at risk of failing in placement may not be supported adequately in this new role. Almost all participants praised the schemes intentions and overall delivery, and some suggested a similar role bears consideration for future business-as-usual university placements.ConclusionsParticipants were broadly positive about this scheme, with some suggesting that elements of this hybrid role could feature in a post-pandemic student paramedic programme.

Total type 2 pneumocytes and AMs significantly increased in the pathological groups compared to NC (p < 0.01), except SAD (p = 0.08). However, AMs are significantly reduced in COPD-ES (p < 0.003). Significant changes were observed for tissue co-expression of Furin and TMPRSS2 with ACE2 in SAE, type 2 pneumocytes and AMs. These markers also negatively correlated with lung function parameters, such as FEV(1)/FVC % predicted, FEF25-75%, DLCO% predicted. A strong co-localisation and expression for ACE2 (p < 0.0001), Furin (p < 0.01), and TMPRSS2 (p < 0.0001) was observed in pSAEC treated with 1% CSE than controls. DISCUSSION: The increased expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin, in the SAE, type 2 pneumocytes and AMs of smokers and COPD are detrimental to lung function and proves that these patient groups could be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection. Increased type 2 pneumocytes suggest that these patients are vulnerable to developing post-COVID-19 interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or fibrosis in general. There could be a silently developing interstitial pathology in smokers and patients with COPD. This is the first comprehensive study to report such changes.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Adhesion Site Protein Upregulation in Small Airways, Type 2 Pneumocytes, and Alveolar Macrophages of Smokers and COPD C Possible Implications for Interstitial Fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is prevalent, often chronic, and requires ongoing monitoring of symptoms to track response to treatment and identify early indicators of relapse. Remote Measurement Technologies (RMT) provide an opportunity to transform the measurement and management of MDD, via data collected from inbuilt smartphone sensors and wearable devices alongside app-based questionnaires and tasks. A key question for the field is the extent to which participants can adhere to research protocols and the completeness of data collected. We aimed to describe drop out and data completeness in a naturalistic multimodal longitudinal RMT study, in people with a history of recurrent MDD. We further aimed to determine whether those experiencing a depressive relapse at baseline contributed less complete data. METHODS: Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse C Major Depressive Disorder (RADAR-MDD) is a multi-centre, prospective observational cohort study conducted as part of the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse C Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) program. People with a history of MDD were provided with a wrist-worn wearable device, and smartphone apps designed to: a) collect data from smartphone sensors; and b) deliver questionnaires, speech tasks, and cognitive assessments. Participants were followed-up for a minimum of 11 months and maximum of 24 months. RESULTS: Individuals with a history of MDD (n = 623) were enrolled in the study,. We report 80% completion rates for primary outcome assessments across all follow-up timepoints. 79.8% of people participated for the maximum amount of time available and 20.2% withdrew prematurely. We found no evidence of an association between the severity of depression symptoms at baseline and the availability of data. In total, 110 participants had > 50% data available across all data types. CONCLUSIONS: RADAR-MDD is the largest multimodal RMT study in the field of mental health. Here, we have shown that collecting RMT data from a clinical population is feasible. We found comparable levels of data availability in active and passive forms of data collection, demonstrating that both are feasible in this patient group.

We place the city at the forefront of our analysis by bringing together the geographies of the city and state, together with a wider discussion of factors that may cause both the wounding of the city and an increase in the precariousness of the island. We apply this concept to the advanced city-island-state of Malta (Central Mediterranean), which is a densely populated, urbanised small island archipelago with about 500,000 inhabitants and operates as a single city with an urban core, suburbs, and a rural hinterland that is rapidly decreasing in size. This city-island-state is frequently considered as being safe from external geophysical, climatic, and anthropogenic wounding, but, in reality, Malta, as a city, an island, and an independent nation-state, is faced with multiple internal and external pressures that increase its precariousness and vulnerability to such externalities. Some of these are socio-economic, but others are environmental. We argue that the potential for wounding is particularly marked in Malta, that it is exacerbated by the contemporary globalised neoliberal world of flows and interconnectivities, and that this represents a multi-level wounding cascade: wounding the city wounds the island and, by extension, the state.

We aim to compare the differences in presentation between influenza and non-influenza cases among those with febrile respiratory illness (FRI) to determine predictors of influenza infection. METHODS: Personnel with FRI (defined as fever37.5C, with cough or sore throat) were recruited from the sentinel surveillance system in the Singapore military. Nasal washes were collected, and tested using the Resplex II and additional PCR assays for etiological determination. Interviewer-administered questionnaires collected information on patient demographics and clinical features. Univariate comparison of the various parameters was conducted, with statistically significant parameters entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. The final multivariate model for influenza versus non-influenza cases was used to build a predictive probability clinical diagnostic model. RESULTS: 821 out of 2858 subjects recruited from 11 May 2009 to 25 Jun 2010 had influenza, of which 434 (52.9%) had 2009 influenza A (H1N1), 58 (7.1%) seasonal influenza A (H3N2) and 269 (32.8%) influenza B. Influenza-positive cases were significantly more likely to present with running nose, chills and rigors, ocular symptoms and higher temperature, and less likely with sore throat, photophobia, injected pharynx, and nausea/vomiting. Our clinical diagnostic model had a sensitivity of 65% (95% CI: 58%, 72%), specificity of 69% (95% CI: 62%, 75%), and overall accuracy of 68% (95% CI: 64%, 71%), performing significantly better than conventional influenza-like illness (ILI) criteria.

A thematic analysis of a sample of Reddit threads discussing player experiences of transitioning D&D to remote play during COVID-19 social distancing was undertaken. The findings highlight a variety of player attitudes and preferences towards playing D&D remotely. The data suggest a mostly negative sentiment towards playing D&D online for groups that had transitioned from in-person to remote play. Loss of in-person socialisation was identified as an important contributor to a poor play experience, but groups would persevere with remote play to maintain social relationships, suggesting that, for many players, D&D serves an important social function beyond mere play.

As the sandfly vector transfers the promastigotes into the skin of the human host, the infection is either cured or exacerbated. In the process, there emerge several unsolved paradoxes of leishmaniasis. Chronologically, as the infections starts in skin, the role of the salivary proteins in supporting the infection or the host response to these proteins influencing the induction of immunological memory becomes a conundrum. As the parasite invokes inflammation, the infiltrating neutrophils may act as \\"Trojan Horse\\" to transfer parasites to macrophages that, along with dendritic cells, carry the parasite to lymphoid organs to start visceralization. As the visceralized infection becomes chronic, the acutely enhanced monocytopoiesis takes a downturn while neutropenia and thrombocytopenia ensue with concomitant rise in splenic colony-forming-units. These responses are accompanied by splenic and hepatic granulomas, polyclonal activation of B cells and deviation of T cell responses. The granuloma formation is both a containment process and a form of immunopathogenesis. The heterogeneity in neutrophils and macrophages contribute to both cure and progression of the disease. The differentiation of T-helper subsets presents another paradox of visceral leishmaniasis, as the counteractive T cell subsets influence the curing or non-curing outcome. Once the parasites are killed by chemotherapy, in some patients the cured visceral disease recurs as a cutaneous manifestation post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). As no experimental model exists, the natural history of PKDL remains almost a black box at the end of the visceral disease.","output":"Conundrums in leishmaniasis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Frequently SARS-CoV-2 results in mild or moderate disease with potentially lower concentrations of antibodies compared to those that are hospitalised. Here, we validated an ELISA using SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein, with targeted detection of IgG, IgA and IgM (IgGAM) using serum and dried blood spots (DBS) from adults with mild or moderate disease. METHODS: Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike, a combined anti-IgG, IgA and IgM serology ELISA assay was developed using 62 PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or moderate COVID-19 samples, 14 days post symptom onset and 624 COVID-19 negative samples. The assay was validated using 73 PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or moderate COVID-19 samples, 14 days post symptom onset and 359 COVID-19 negative serum samples with an additional 81 DBSs. The assay was further validated in 226 PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or moderate COVID-19 samples, 14 days post symptom onset and 426 COVID-19 negative clinical samples. RESULTS: A sensitivity and specificity of 98.6% (95% CI, 92.6C100.0), 98.3% (95% CI, 96.4C99.4), respectively, was observed following validation of the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. No cross-reactivities with endemic coronaviruses or other human viruses were observed, and no change in results were recorded for interfering substances. The assay was stable at temperature extremes and components were stable for 15 days once opened. A matrix comparison showed DBS to correlate with serum results. Clinical validation of the assay reported a sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI, 90.9C97.2%) and a specificity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.6C99.3%).

Examination of cognitive function, neurotrophin concentrations, and both brain and systemic inflammatory markers following a simulated game of American football. J Strength Cond Res 36(3): 686-694, 2022-This investigation examined the effect of a simulated American football game on cognitive function, neurotrophin concentrations, and markers of both systemic and brain inflammation. Members of the Israel national team (6 linemen and 9 skill position players) were examined 1 week before (PRE), immediately post (IP) and 24-hour post (24P) game. Blood was obtained, and cognitive function was measured at each assessment. No head injuries to any of the players participating in the study occurred. Significant (p < 0.001) decreases in acute memory, and a trend (p = 0.066) toward a decrease in delayed memory was noted at IP. Significant negative correlations were observed between playing time (number of plays) and concentration changes from PRE to IP (r = -0.801; p = 0.001) and from PRE to 24P (r = -0.549; p = 0.034). All cognitive function measures returned to PRE levels by 24P. Increases from PRE were noted in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) (p = 0.041) at IP and in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (p = 0.009) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.019) concentrations at 24P. Circulating CRP concentrations and the cytokine markers, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-, were significantly elevated in linemen compared with skill players. Brain inflammatory markers (S100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein) and total tau protein (a marker of brain injury) were not elevated from PRE. No change from PRE was noted in either myoglobin or creatine kinase-MM concentrations. In conclusion, muscle damage and inflammatory marker responses observed from the scrimmage game were consistent with muscle desensitization associated with football participation.

However, its expression profile and detailed roles in glioblastoma (GBM) remain unknown. In this study, we mainly investigated the expression and roles of LINC01094 in GBM and focused on the mechanism by which LINC01094 regulates the malignant characteristics of GBM. Patients and Methods: LINC01094 expression in GBM was determined with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo of GBM cells were evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis, migration assay, invasion assay, and tumor xenograft models, respectively. Results: LINC01094 was overexpressed in GBM tissues and cell lines. Moreover, increased LINC01094 expression was associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters in patients with GBM. Loss of LINC01094 inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; promoted cell apoptosis; and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanically, LINC01094 functioned as a molecular sponge for microRNA-577 (miR-577) and consequently enhanced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in GBM cells. Both miR-577 inhibition and BDNF expression enhancement reversed LINC01094 deficiency-mediated inhibition of malignant processes in GBM cells.

Regular testing of all afflicted individuals may not be feasible due to limited resources, as is true with HIV monitoring in resource-limited settings. Pooled testing methods have been developed in order to allow regular testing for all while reducing resource burden. However, the most commonly used methods do not make use of covariate information predictive of treatment failure, which could improve performance. We propose and evaluate four prediction-driven pooled testing methods that incorporate covariate information to improve pooled testing performance. We then compare these methods in the HIV treatment management setting to current methods with respect to testing efficiency, sensitivity, and number of testing rounds using simulated data and data collected in Rakai, Uganda. Results show that the prediction-driven methods increase efficiency by up to 20% compared with current methods while maintaining equivalent sensitivity and reducing number of testing rounds by up to 70%. When predictions were incorrect, the performance of prediction-based matrix methods remained robust. The best performing method using our motivating data from Rakai was a prediction-driven hybrid method, maintaining sensitivity over 96% and efficiency over 75% in likely scenarios. If these methods perform similarly in the field, they may contribute to improving mortality and reducing transmission in resource-limited settings.

It still remains a main public health concern at global level and in Arab world mainly in low-income countries. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the Arab worlds growing contribution to global leishmaniasis research. METHODS: This study describes a bibliometric review of all leishmaniasis research publications published between January 1998 and December 2017 indexed on the Scopus database. RESULTS: The total number of publications published at global level was 17,570 papers, which achieves an average annual productivity of 878.50 papers publications. Brazil was responsible for the greatest output with the total number of publications of 3865 followed by the Unites States (n = 2729), India (n = 2119), the United Kingdom (n = 1363), and Spain (n = 1274). By limiting the analysis to the publications that have been published by Arab world, the research productivity was 993 papers, which represents 5.65% of total research output at global level in research regarding leishmaniasis. Tunisia was responsible for the greatest output from Arab world with the total number of publications of 297 followed by Sudan (n = 192), Saudi Arabia (n = 131), Morocco (n = 119) and Egypt (n = 67). Since 1998, the growth of publications on leishmaniasis fluctuates, overall showing a rising trend in both global and Arab world. There is a highly significant correlation between publication productivity related to leishmaniasis at global level and the Arab world (r = 0.936; p-value< 0.001). Leishmaniasis treatment, intracellular mechanism of infection, and lifecycle of leishmania are the major current hot topics for the research in this subject at global level and the Arab world. CONCLUSIONS: The current study presents a novel review of the current Arab leishmaniasis-related research, and how these results are related to worldwide output. In comparison to the global research output, the Arab world produced less leishmaniasis research. The data presented in the current study by this innovative approach may serve relevant researchers to direct the global leishmaniasis research to Arab counties in which leishmaniasis is endemic.","output":"Arab worlds growing contribution to global leishmaniasis research (1998C2017): a bibliometric study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Every child counts has lost its value even from the political discourse of some societies during the pandemic, proving that the level of culture of inclusion is the true standard of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) commitment. Online education and therapy required rethinking the way we educate children with special needs and, implicitly, prepare them for life. We consider that the personalized approach of the therapeutic intervention was the main difficulty. In this article, we propose a solution to this problem, an approach based on a platform initially developed by tactileimages.org for vision-impaired pupils which became a tool in the universal design of learning materials. This e-learning tool includes an Editor, a browser-based software developed to allow the creation or adaptation of drawings into vector images; the QR code through which areas of educational and therapeutic interest are allocated to pictures for task personalization; and the voice-over function of the companion application. The customized material is identified by image recognition algorithms, and the user's gesture is recognized by artificial intelligence algorithms, which receives (by voice-over) details about therapeutic tasks in remote teaching. The article illustrates the personalization of the therapeutic and educational path. The process starts with defining the child's functioning profile and matching function with the curriculum elements as they are found within the Erasmus + project Cognitive Resources for Toddlers Teens and Experts stored in the virtual library. Information and comunication technology is currently an important vector in attaining the SDG vision.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of efficient sampling strategies and statistical methods for monitoring infection prevalence, both in humans and reservoir hosts. Pooled testing can be an efficient tool for learning pathogen prevalence in a population. Typically pooled testing requires a second phase follow up procedure to identify infected individuals, but when the goal is solely to learn prevalence in a population, such as a reservoir host, there are more efficient methods for allocating the second phase samples. 2. To estimate pathogen prevalence in a population, this manuscript presents an approach for data integration with two-phased testing of pooled samples that allows more efficient estimation of prevalence with less samples than traditional methods. The first phase uses pooled samples to estimate the population prevalence and inform efficient strategies for the second phase. To combine information from both phases, we introduce a Bayesian data integration procedure that combines pooled samples with individual samples for joint inferences about the population prevalence. 3. Data integration procedures result in more efficient estimation of prevalence than traditional procedures that only use individual samples or a single phase of pooled sampling. 4. The manuscript presents guidance on implementing the first phase and second phase sampling plans using data integration.

There is still limited evidence on hemodialysis patients and COVID-19. The clinical and analytical spectrum and treatment responses and mortality are poorly characterized. METHOD: Clinical and analytical features, chest X-ray, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, treatment and outcomes were analyzed in 48 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during March and April 2020 in two coordinated Spanish hemodialysis units. RESULTS: In 200 haemodialysis patients, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 48, of whom 22 were PCR positive, eight PCR negative but seroconverted and two were diagnosed on typical clinical grounds. Despite a mean age of 72.6 years, the overall mortality rate was 5/48 (10%). Among the PCR positive patients, 21 (55%) required admission and five (13%) died. PCR positive patients were more often symptomatic and hospitalized and had higher troponin I levels than PCR negative patients, but did not differ in lymphocyte counts, D-dimer or interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Among PCR negative COVID-19 patients, three out of 10 (30%) required admission, and none died. The most frequent symptom among the 48 patients was fever (31%), followed by asymptomatic patients (23%). A low number of lymphocytes was the only parameter significantly different between hospitalized and ambulatory COVID-19 patients, independently of PCR status. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 hemodialysis patients are frequently asymptomatic, and mortality may be lower than previously reported. Diagnosis may be retrospective, based on seroconversion, as PCR may be negative.

Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) might increase the screening numbers among patients unable or unwilling to undergo conventional colonoscopy. This registry trial aimed to document and determine the CCE indications, findings, complications, and adverse events in outpatient practices and clinics throughout Germany. Methods Patients undergoing CCE between 2010 and 2015 were enrolled in this prospective multicenter registry trial at six German centers. Patient demographics, outcomes, and complications were evaluated. Results A total of 161 patients were included. Of the CCE evaluations, 111 (68.9%) were considered successful. Pathological findings in the colon (n=92, 60.1%) and in the remaining gastrointestinal tract (n=38, 24.8%) were recorded. The main finding was the presence of polyps (n=52, 32.3%). Furthermore, five carcinomas (3.1%) were detected and histologically confirmed later. Adequate bowel cleanliness was more likely to be achieved in the outpatient setting (p<0.0001).

However, it is becoming appreciated that chemically distinct ligands can bind to GPCRs in conformations that lead to different cellular signaling events, a phenomenon termed biased agonism. Despite this, the rigorous experimentation and analysis required to identify biased agonism are often not undertaken in most clinical candidates and go unrealized. Recently, xanomeline, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist, has entered phase III clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia. If successful, xanomeline will be the first novel FDA-approved antipsychotic drug in almost 50 years. Intriguingly, xanomeline's potential for biased agonism at the mAChRs and, in particular, the M4 mAChR, the most promising receptor target for schizophrenia, has not been assessed. Here, we quantify the biased agonism profile of xanomeline and three other mAChR agonists in Chinese hamster ovary cells recombinantly expressing the M4 mAChR. Agonist activity was examined across nine distinct signaling readouts, including the activation of five different G protein subtypes, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, ?-arrestin recruitment, calcium mobilization, and cAMP regulation. Relative to acetylcholine (ACh), xanomeline was biased away from ERK1/2 phosphorylation and calcium mobilization compared to Gi2 protein activation. These findings likely have important implications for our understanding of the therapeutic action of xanomeline and call for further investigation into the in vivo consequences of biased agonism in drugs targeting the M4 mAChR for the treatment of schizophrenia.","output":"Biased Profile of Xanomeline at the Recombinant Human M4 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis remains a major global health issue affecting all countries and age groups.

Most research on food vendors in LMICs has focused on vendors of ready-to-eat street foods and not on vendors of fresh food commodities. A scoping review was undertaken to synthesize existing research on food safety KAP of vendors of food commodities in LMICs. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Ovid Medline, and institutional websites of major research organizations were searched. Over 17,483 titles were screened, and 84 relevant studies were identified. Of these, most were conducted after 2014 and focused on urban and peri-urban Africa. Most used a cross-sectional design with mixed methods and most had small sample sizes. Common food value chains studied were dairy, meat, and fruits and vegetables. Very few studies examined more than one type of commodity or value chain. Food vendors' knowledge typically ranged from none to little, which was also evident from poor observed food handling and storage practices and vendors operating in unsafe and unhygienic conditions. Poor compliance with existing food safety policies, laws, and regulations was evident in some cases; this was primarily due to either limited awareness of existing laws or limited knowledge of how to implement them. However, vendors generally had positive attitudes towards food safety. No significant gaps were found between food safety knowledge and actual practices-though this was not always examined rigorously. Gaps between food safety knowledge and practices, were not found to vary with the vendor's age, gender, type of product sold, or geography.

This retrospective multicenter study was conducted at five hospitals in Korea. Data of sepsis patients aged  18 years who were admitted to the intensive care unit between January 1, 2011 and April 30, 2021 were collected. BT was divided into three groups (hypothermia < 36 C, normothermia 36?38 C, and hyperthermia > 38 C), and age groups were divided using a 75-year age threshold. Kaplan?Meier analysis was performed to assess the cumulative mortality over 90 days. A K-means clustering algorithm using age and BT was used to characterize phenotypes. During the study period, 15,574 sepsis patients were enrolled. Overall, 90-day mortality was 20.5%. Kaplan?Meier survival analyses demonstrated that 90-day mortality rates were 27.4%, 19.6%, and 11.9% in the hypothermia, normothermia, and hyperthermia groups, respectively, in those  75 years old (Log-rank p < 0.001).

At our institutions NPT program, teachers are recruited and trained in the final block of their first year, involving simultaneous learning and teaching of Immunology and Microbiology content to classmates. This year, in-person training and teaching was conducted virtually due to COVID19. This study aims to understand how NPT in a newly virtual curriculum impacted student experiences of learning infectious disease content. METHODS: We conducted one-on-one interviews with student-learners and direct-peer student-teachers at the end of their first year in June 2020. Using constructivist grounded theory, we coded, reconciled, and analyzed interview transcripts to identify themes. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of interviews with students (n=5) and near-peer teachers (n=7) yielded the following themes: 1.Optimized learning environment: Direct peer teaching leads to students feeling more personally invested in their peers lessons and wellbeing, creating a safe community and increased engagement despite the virtual format and recordings. 2.Benefits of education technology: Teachers employed creative virtual learning modalities to promote students mastery of challenging memorization-based microbiology content. 3.COVID-19 relevance: Learning microbiology and immunology content synchronously with the COVID pandemic conferred more content relevance, but presented academic challenges due to social and personal stressors. 4.Educator development: Despite the difficulty of occupying a dual student-teacher role, teachers derived many benefits from teaching, including improved communication skills, which extended to the clinic, content mastery, and increased confidence. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented disruptions in medical education. However, the shift to virtual direct peer teaching presented an opportunity for creative virtual teaching strategies and increased lesson accessibility via recordings.

Repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1; RUNX1; HNF4a; JNK1/c-FOS) were then employed to identify existing drugs manifesting in their effects on gene expression signatures of potential coronavirus infection mitigation agents. Using this strategy, vitamin D and quercetin have been identified as putative 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mitigation agents. Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring candidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of expression profiling experiments (EPEs), indicating that highly structurally similar quercetin, luteolin, and eriodictyol could serve as scaffolds for the development of efficient inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In agreement with this notion, quercetin alters the expression of 98 of 332 (30%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, thus potentially interfering with functions of 23 of 27 (85%) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in human cells. Similarly, Vitamin D may interfere with functions of 19 of 27 (70%) of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by altering expression of 84 of 332 (25%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the potential effects of both quercetin and vitamin D, the inference could be made that functions of 25 of 27 (93%) of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells may be altered. GSEA and EPEs identify multiple drugs, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of testosterone versus estradiol impacts on SARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during the coronavirus pandemic. Estradiol, in contrast with testosterone, affects the expression of the majority of human genes (203 of 332; 61%) encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets, thus potentially interfering with functions of 26 of 27 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. A hypothetical tripartite combination consisting of quercetin/vitamin D/estradiol may affect expression of 244 of 332 (73%) human genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets. Of major concern is the ACE2 and FURIN expression in many human cells and tissues, including immune cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect a broad range of cellular targets in the human body. Infection of immune cells may cause immunosuppression, long-term persistence of the virus, and spread of the virus to secondary targets. Present analyses and numerous observational studies indicate that age-associated vitaminDdeficiency may contribute to the high mortality of older adults and the elderly. Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor. Observations reported in this contribution are intended to facilitate follow-up targeted experimental studies and, if warranted, randomized clinical trials to identify and validate therapeutically viable interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, gene expression profiles of vitamin D and quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly argue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of their potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents. In line with the results of present analyses, a randomized interventional clinical trial evaluating effects of estradiol on severity of the coronavirus infection in COVID19+ and presumptive COVID19+ patients and two interventional randomized clinical trials evaluating effects of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.","output":"Tripartite combination of candidate pandemic mitigation agents: Vitamin D, Quercetin, and Estradiol Manifest properties of medicinal agents for targeted mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic defined by genomics-guided tracing of SARS-CoV-2 targets in human cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although membrane fusion occurs ubiquitously and continuously in alleukaroytic cells, little is known about the mechanism that governs lipidbilayer fusion associated with any intracellular fusion reactions.

In this review, work done in thelast few years on the molecular mechanism of viral membrane fusion will behighlighted, focusing in particular on the role of the fusion peptide and themodification of the lipid bilayer structure. Much of what is known regardingthe molecular mechanism of viral membrane fusion has been gained using liposomesas model systems in which the molecular components of the membrane and the environmentare strictly controlled. Many amphilphilic peptides have a high affinity forlipid bilayers, but only a few sequences are able to induce membrane fusion. Thepresence of -helical structure in at least part of the fusion peptideis strongly correlated with activity whereas, -structure tends to beless prevalent, associated with non-native experimental conditions, and morerelated to vesicle aggregation than fusion. The specific angle of insertionof the peptides into the membrane plane is also found to be an importantcharacteristic for the fusion process.

The evolution of equilibrium and dynamic properties with NP loading, total packing fraction, and strength of interfacial attraction is systematically studied based on a minimalist model. Structural predictions of polymer reference interaction site model integral equation theory are employed to establish the rich behavior of the interfacial cohesive force density, surface excess, and a measure of free volume as a function of PNC variables. The glassy dynamic shear modulus is predicted to be softened, reinforced, or hardly changed relative to the pure polymer melt depending on system parameters, as a result of the competing and qualitatively different influences of interfacial cohesion (physical bonding), free volume, and entropic depletion on dynamic localization and shear elasticity. The localization of polymer segments is the dominant factor in determining bulk PNC softening and reinforcement effects for moderate to strong interfacial attractions, respectively.

METHODS Peripheral blood from 162 cases of SARS, 30 cases of mycoplasma pneumonia and 30 healthy adult volunteers were measured for the number of total B cells (CD19+ B cell), CD5 positive B cells (B1 cell) and mean fluorescent intensity of CD40 on B cell (CD40MF) using tri-color flow cytometry to analyze the distribution of the above parameters in SARS, mycoplasma pneumonia and healthy adult volunteers and their relation to the severity of SARS. RESULTS The number of total B cells of clinically diagnosed SARS was (292 +/- 181) x 10(6)/L, significantly greater than that of healthy adults which was (200 +/- 65) x 10(6)/L (F = 6.17, P < 0.05) but smaller than that of patients infected with mycoplasma pneumonia which was (359 +/- 168) x 10(6)/L (F = 6.28, P < 0.05). During day 11 - 20 of the disease, the number of B1 cells of SARS patients was (24 +/- 14) x 10(6)/L smaller than that of healthy adults which was (39 +/- 20) x 10(6)/L (F = 4.23, P < 0.05). In the early stage of SARS (within 10 days), the expression of CD40 decreased significantly as compared with healthy adults (F = 5.13, P < 0.05). The number of B cells in severe SARS and mild cases were (347 +/- 156) x 10(6)/L and (268 +/- 211) x 10(6)/L respectively. The difference was statistically significant (F = 7.11, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS B cells, B1 cells and the expression of CD40 on B cells were involved in the pathogenesis of SARS. The B cell count correlated with the severity of SARS.

Since the outbreak of the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, a key question has focused on whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells stimulated during acute infection give rise to long-lived memory T cells3. Using spectral flow cytometry combined with cellular indexing of transcriptomes and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing we longitudinally characterize individual SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells of COVID-19 patients from acute infection to one year into recovery and find a distinct signature identifying long-lived memory CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells persisting one year after acute infection re-express CD45RA and interleukin-7 receptor (CD127), upregulate T cell factor-1 (TCF1), and maintain low CCR7, thus resembling CD45RA+ effector-memory T (TEMRA) cells. Tracking individual clones of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, we reveal that an interferon signature marks clones giving rise to long-lived cells, whereas prolonged proliferation and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling are associated with clone contraction and disappearance. Collectively, we identify a transcriptional signature differentiating short-from long-lived memory CD8+ T cells following an acute virus infection in humans.","output":"CD8+ T cell signature in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection identifies memory precursors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 epidemics in Japan and Tokyo were analyzed by a fundamental equation of the dynamic phase transition.

Methods: : We present a compartmental model for the disease where symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals move separately. We introduced healthcare burden parameters allowing to infer possible containment and suppression strategies. In addition, the model was scaled up to describe different interconnected areas, giving the possibility to trigger regionalized measures. It was specially adjusted to Mendoza-Argentinas parameters, but is easily adaptable for elsewhere. Results: : Overall, the simulations we carried out were notably more effective when mitigation measures were not relaxed in between the suppressive actions. Since asymptomatics or very mildly affected patients are the vast majority, we studied the impact of detecting and isolating them. The removal of asymptomatics from the infectious pool remarkably lowered the effective reproduction number, healthcare burden and overall fatality. Furthermore, different suppression triggers regarding ICU occupancy were attempted. The best scenario was found to be the combination of ICU occupancy triggers (on: 50%, off: 30%) with the detection and isolation of asymptomatic individuals. In the ideal assumption that 45% of the asymptomatics could be detected and isolated, there would be no need for complete lockdown, and Mendozas healthcare system would not collapse.

Varicella vaccination is available privately in Sweden and is currently being reviewed for inclusion in the Swedish Public Health Agencys national immunisation program (NIP). A cross-sectional study of parents of Swedish children aged 1C8 years (n = 2212) was conducted to understand parental acceptance, beliefs and knowledge around varicella infection and vaccination. Respondents generally viewed varicella infection as a mild disease, with only a small proportion aware of potential severe complications. While 65% of respondents were aware of the vaccine, only 15% had started the course of vaccination as of February 2019. Further, 43% of parents did not intend to vaccinate, most commonly due to lack of inclusion in the NIP, but also due to perception of mild disease. Nevertheless, if offered within the NIP, 85% of parents would be highly likely to vaccinate their child. A number of statistically significant differences in awareness and behaviours were observed between sociodemographic subgroups. In general, women were more aware of vaccination (72%) compared to men (58%). Among unemployed or respondents with elementary school education, awareness was below 43%, and among respondents with high income the awareness was above 75%. Similarly, among unemployed or respondents with a low income the vaccination rate was as low as 30% compared with at least 57% among respondents with a high income. Respondents from metropolitan areas, those with university degrees and respondents with a higher income were more likely to be aware of the varicella vaccine and to have vaccinated their child.

Different studies have been performed to understand the infection mechanism, and the involved human genes, transcripts and proteins. In parallel, numerous clinical extra-pulmonary manifestations co-occurring with COVID-19 disease have been reported and evidence of their severity and persistence is increasing. Whether these manifestations are linked to other disorders co-occurring with SARS-CoV-2 infection, is under discussion. In this work, we report the identification of toxin-like peptides in COVID-19 patients by application of the Liquid Chromatography Surface-Activated Chemical Ionization C Cloud Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry. Methods: Plasma, urine and faecal samples from COVID-19 patients and control individuals were analysed to study peptidomic toxins profiles. Protein precipitation preparation procedure was used for plasma, to remove high molecular weight proteins and efficiently solubilize the peptide fraction; in the case of faeces and urine, direct peptide solubilization was employed. Results: Toxin-like peptides, almost identical to toxic components of venoms from animals, like conotoxins, phospholipases, phosphodiesterases, zinc metal proteinases, and bradykinins, were identified in samples from COVID-19 patients, but not in control samples. Conclusions: The presence of toxin-like peptides could potentially be connected to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their presence suggests a possible association between COVID-19 disease and the release in the body of (oligo-)peptides almost identical to toxic components of venoms from animals. Their involvement in a large set of heterogeneous extra-pulmonary COVID-19 clinical manifestations, like neurological ones, cannot be excluded. Although the presence of each individual symptom is not selective of the disease, their combination might be related to COVID-19 by the coexistence of the panel of the here detected toxin-like peptides.

STUDY SELECTION: One reviewer screened citations in 2 phases (phase 1: title/abstract; phase 2: full-text) selecting RCTs comparing synchronous telehealth with in-person care for the management of musculoskeletal conditions.

Although high doses of favipiravir are required due to the molecule being a purine analog, its conversion into the active form in infected cells with active viral RNA synthesis enhances the antiviral specificity and selectivity as a chain terminator with lethal mutagenesis. Another characteristic feature is the lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant virus. COVID-19 pneumonia is caused by strong cell-mediated immunity against virus-infected cells, and the inflammatory response induced by adaptive immunity continues to peak for 3 to 5 days despite antiviral treatment. This has also been observed in herpes zoster (HZ) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. Inflammation due to an immune response may mask the effectiveness of favipiravir against COVID-19 pneumonia. Favipiravir significantly shortened the recovery time in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia by 3 days with the start of treatment by the 5th day of symptom onset. Since both CMV and COVID-19 pneumonia are caused by adaptive immunity and prevention of cytomegalovirus pneumonia is the standard treatment due to difficulties in treating refractory CMV pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia should be prevented with early treatment as well. In the present study, we have comprehensively reviewed the optimal antiviral therapy for COVID-19 based on clinical trials of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia and the concurrently established therapies for other viral infections, particularly HZ and CMV pneumonia. Optimally, antivirals should be administered immediately after COVID-19 diagnosis, similar to that after influenza diagnosis, to prevent COVID-19 pneumonia and complications resulting from microangiopathy.","output":"Antiviral therapy for COVID-19: Derivation of optimal strategy based on past antiviral and favipiravir experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting the routine daily life of millions of people.

Designs: An interventional, single-arm, non-randomized clinical trial conducted in Egypt from April 15 to July 21, 2020. Settings: This was a multi-centre study conducted in 3 hospitals in Egypt. Participants: a total of 94 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients using qRT-PCR were enrolled in the study. Intervention: All patients were administered with two plasma units (each unit is 200cc). The volume of donated plasma was 800cc. Main Outcome and Measures: Primary measure was the degree of clinical improvement among the COVID-19 patients who received CPT within seven days Results: A total of 94 patients were enrolled who received CPT either within seven days or after seven days of hospitalization. 82 were severely ill, 12 were critically ill. The average age remained 58 years (SD 15.1 years). Male were 69% and 49% patients got cured while 51% died with CFR 51%. 75% deaths were above 45years of age. The symptoms were dyspnoea (55%), fever (52%), cough (46%), and loss of taste and smell (21%), and cyanosis (15%). The most common co-morbidities among the <40 years remained Diabetes Mellitus (21%) and Asthma (14%).

As elsewhere in Europe and Internationally, associated restrictions initially limited individual mobility and workplace activity to essential services and travel, and significant air quality benefits were widely anticipated. Here, break-point/segment methods are applied to air pollutant time-series from the first half of 2020 to provide an independent estimate of the timings of discrete changes in NO, NO2, NOx, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 time-series from Automatic Urban Rural Network (AURN) monitoring stations across the UK. NO, NO2 and NOx all exhibit abrupt decreases at the time the UK locked down of (on average) 7.6 to 17 g.m-3 (or 32 to 50%) at Urban Traffic stations and 4 to 5.7 g.m-3 (or 26 to 46%) at Urban Background stations. However, after the initial abrupt reduction, gradual increases were then observed through lockdown. This suggests that the return of vehicles to the road during early lockdown has already offset much of the air quality improvement seen when locking down (provisional estimate 50 to 70% by 01 July). While locking down O3 increased (7 to 7.4 g.m-3 or 14 to 17% at Urban stations) broadly in line with NO2 reductions, but later changes suggest significant non-lockdown contributions to O3 during the months that followed. Increases of similar magnitudes were observed for both PM10 (5.9 to 6.3 g.m-3) and PM2.5 (3.9 to 5.0 g.m-3) at both Rural and Urban stations alike, but the distribution of changes suggests the lockdown was not an obvious direct source of changes in levels of either of these species during this period, and that more complex contributions, e.g. from resuspension and secondary aerosol, may be more likely major drivers for these changes.","output":"Early Observations on the impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Air Quality Trends across the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

We use Columbia University for reference values but our approach centers around an online model that allows users to tailor the model and interventions to their local conditions and existing strategies. All interventions are compared relative to implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines alone. Results. At prevalence rate of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community surrounding the university of 0.1%, using a symptom-checking mobile application is cost-saving relative to CDC guidelines alone and the university can expect to remain open. At a prevalence of 1%, standardizing masks will be cost-saving. At a prevalence rate of 2%, thermal imaging cameras cost $965,070 (95% credible interval [CrI] = $198,821, $2.15 million)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. One-time testing on entry costs $1.08 million (95% CrI = $170,703, $3.33 million)/QALY gained. Weekly testing costs $820,119 (95% CrI = $452,673, $1.68 million)/QALY gained. Upgrades to ventilation systems or installation of far-ultraviolet C lighting systems will be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200,000/QALY gained only if aerosols account for 86-90% of all on-campus transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. The value of interventions to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 vary greatly with the prevalence rate of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community surrounding the university.","output":"The cost-effectiveness of common strategies for the prevention of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in universities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To describe the presentation and outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection in an African setting of high non-communicable co-morbidity and also HIV-1 and tuberculosis prevalence. Design Case control analysis with cases stratified by HIV-1 and tuberculosis status. Setting A single-centre observational case-control study of adults admitted to a South African hospital with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection or alternative diagnosis. Participants 104 adults with RT-PCR-proven SARS-CoV2 infection of which 55 (52.9%) were male and 31 (29.8%) HIV-1 co-infected. 40 adults (35.7% male, 30.9% HIV-1 co-infected) admitted during the same period with no RT-PCR or serological evidence of SARS-CoV2 infection and assigned alternative diagnoses. Additional in vitro data from prior studies of 72 healthy controls and 118 HIV-1 uninfected and infected persons participants enrolled to a prior study with either immune evidence of tuberculosis sensitization but no symptoms or microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Results Two or more co-morbidities were present in 57.7% of 104 RT-PCR proven COVID-19 presentations, the commonest being hypertension (48%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (39%), obesity (31%) but also HIV-1 (30%) and active tuberculosis (14%). Amongst patients dually infected by tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2, clinical features could be dominated by either SARS-CoV-2 or tuberculosis: lymphopenia was exacerbated, and some markers of inflammation (D-dimer and ferritin) elevated in singly SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were even further elevated (p less than 0.05). HIV-1 and SARS-CoV2 co-infection resulted in lower absolute number and proportion of CD4 lymphocytes, with those in the lowest peripheral CD4 percentage strata exhibiting absent or lower antibody responses against SARS-CoV2. Death occurred in 30/104 (29%) of all COVID-19 patients and in 6/15 (40%) of patients with coincident SARS-CoV-2 and tuberculosis. Conclusions In this South African setting, HIV-1 and tuberculosis are common co-morbidities in patients presenting with COVID-19. In environments in which tuberculosis is common, SARS-CoV-2 and tuberculosis may co-exist with clinical presentation being typical of either disease. Clinical suspicion of exacerbation of co-existent tuberculosis accompanying SARS-CoV-2 should be high.","output":"Communicable and non-communicable co-morbidities and the presentation of COVID-19 in an African setting of high HIV-1 and tuberculosis prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In low- and middle-income countries, informal caregivers frequently stay in hospitals and perform patient care tasks typically performed by nurses in other contexts. This article reviews qualitative research on these informal caregivers, to gain insight and understanding of their experiences. METHODS We undertook a qualitative meta-synthesis. Relevant literature was identified through searches of electronic databases in 2021. Thematic analysis was conducted to facilitate the identification of conceptual relationships to formulate synthesised findings. RESULTS Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria - 13 from Sub-Saharan Africa, five from Bangladesh, two from India, two from Iran, one from Brazil and one from Peru. Three themes were generated from the meta-synthesis: (1) The unwelcome but tolerated guest, (2) Enduring personal sacrifice and (3) Fulfilling familial obligations. These themes emphasised the significant burden associated with the hospital caregiving experience and highlighted the implicit reliance on informal caregivers in low- and middle-income countries. CONCLUSIONS Informal caregivers perform an essential caregiving role, yet occupy a peripheral and voluntary space in hospitals.

It is having devastating effects on the people of all countries. In this regard, the phytochemicals of medicinal plants could be explored to prevent this disease. M. oleifera is a miracle plant with antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant properties because of its high content of flavonoids, glucosides and glucosinolates. Therefore, we constructed a library of 294 phytochemicals of M. oleifera and filtered it through the FAF-Drugs4. Further, molecular docking studies of filtered phytochemicals were performed with Mpro enzyme to investigate the binding interactions. Drug likeness properties, ADMET prediction were analyzed to determine the therapeutic aspect of these compounds. Based on the binding energy score of the top 4 compounds, the results indicate that Vicenin-2 has the highest binding affinity (-8.6 kcal mol-1) as compared to the reference molecule (-8.4 kcal mol-1). ADMET result reveals that all top four compounds have minimal toxic effects and good absorption. Further, 500 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the top four compounds showed that Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside and Vitexin have good stability with Mpro. These two compounds were then subjected for MMPBSA (last 50 ns) calculation to analyze the protein-ligand stability and dynamic behavior. Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside and Vitexin showed very good binding free energy i.e. -40.136 kJ mol-1 and -26.784 kJ mol-1, respectively.

According to the Health Belief Model (HBM), health-related behavior is determined by perceived barriers and motivators. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how physical activity and sedentary behavior has changed by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. The following results were statistically significant at p < .05. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%; strength-based activity, -30%) and more sedentary (+11%) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents' whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, anxiety r = -.12). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%,), lacked social support (+6%), or had limited access to equipment (+23%) or space (+41%). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%) or strength (-14%) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","output":"A mental health paradox: Mental health was both a motivator and barrier to physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a growing emergence of quarantine hotels that provide accommodation to guests who are mandated to self-isolate for 14 days upon entry to a country to prevent the spread of virus. Why are young hotel workers willing to endure relatively poor working conditions and expose themselves to dangerous COVID-19 workplace environments? Perhaps, the opportunity to participate in meaningful work is the prime motivator for hotel workers who choose to work in quarantine hotels. This study aims to investigate the motivations that young hotel employees hold towards working in a potentially dangerous hotel workplace. Design/methodology/approach: Using personal interviews, this research explored the antecedents behind Generation Z employees (n = 42) actual behaviour towards working in quarantine hotels through the lens of the extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB) model (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived difficulties and meaningful work). Findings: Results revealed that meaningful work such as making the world safer and going beyond the call of duty was a key motivating factor behind a willingness to work in quarantine hotels. Hotel employees also viewed working in quarantine hotels as exciting but dangerous, and the support from their family nuclei was seen as a key underlying motivator. Practical implications: The key implications are the image of the hospitality industry in terms of professional identity to be an industry that is respected by society given the high-risk work environment with increased exposure to COVID-19. Even though Generation Z still see some long-standing negatives in hotel work such as long hours and emotional challenge, it is positive to know that there are contexts in which they can have more pride and meaningfulness from their jobs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first paper to examine Generation Z hotel workers motivations to work in quarantine hotels. A key theoretical contribution to the body of knowledge is the extension of the TPB framework with the additional meaningful work variable. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Job perceptions of Generation Z hotel employees towards working in Covid-19 quarantine hotels: the role of meaningful work"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experienced changes in health behaviors and access to MS care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The USA has the highest recognized number of Covid19 infections globally. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 has not been well characterized in large samples of PwMS to date. The MS patient perspective on COVID-19 would complement the physician-reported cases of MS and COVID-19 in the literature. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of adult PwMS was performed online, using the U.S.-based patient-powered iConquerMS&#8482; platform, in April 2020. RESULTS: There were 1,145 respondents (response rate: 20%). 1,019 had a diagnosis of MS and responded completely (average age: 54.2 years, range: 20-81; 79% female; 64% relapsing remitting, 22% secondary progressive, 12% primary progressive; 88% in the USA). 748 (73%) used a DMT in the last year, primarily higher-efficacy therapies: ocrelizumab (n=238), dimethyl fumarate (n=85), fingolimod (n=80). The most frequent comorbidities were depression (41%), hypertension (26%), and asthma (12%). Women were more worried than men about COVID-19 (p=0.001); non-white-identifying PwMS believed it was a greater danger to their health than white-identifying PwMS (p=0.002). Through the continuum of symptoms to care, 61% of PwMS (n=617) reported symptoms associated with COVID-19, 39% (n=395) knew someone exposed to COVID-19, 4% (n=38) were aware of a personal COVID-19 exposure, 13% (n=128) wanted testing for COVID-19 but could not access it, and 4% (n=43) were tested. Specific to their MS care, 64% (n=650) canceled a medical visit, 22% (n=222) canceled a neurologist visit, 11% (n=112) canceled an MRI, 21% (n=212) canceled a laboratory test, and 10% (n=98) changed their DMT in some way due to COVID19 including 65 delaying at least one dose. 37% (n=382) had a telehealth visit due to COVID-19. 37% of PwMS (n=374) experienced employment changes, most commonly working from home (n=194) and having work hours reduced (n=65) while 32 lost their jobs. Of the 7 cases who tested positive for COVID-19 (<1% of participants) (5 female; age range: 29-64 years), DMTs included dimethyl fumarate (n=2), ocrelizumab (n=1), rituximab (n=1), and a clinical trial drug (n=1). CONCLUSIONS: A majority of people with MS reported interruptions to their MS care along the MS care pathway alongside limited access to COVID-19 testing. Postponements and delays in care were common with 10% of participants reporting a change in their DMT administration. Less than 1% of this self-referred convenience online cohort had a positive test for COVID-19 although more than half reported symptoms that are associated with COVID-19.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health care of >1,000 People living with multiple sclerosis: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper uses new and recently introduced methodologies to study the similarity in the dynamics and behaviours of cryptocurrencies and equities surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prediction of the number of persons carrying the live COVID-19 coronavirus (I) in a susceptible population (S) was achieved using two rate constants describing the rate of increase and decrease in the number of infectious persons on a daily basis. The model was verified using observational data for the city of Heidelberg, Germany. Three hypothetical scenarios, having their counterparts in practice were considered, namely Scenario A - No restrictions on the population; Scenario B - Assumption of a 10-fold higher number of infections than observed; Scenario C - Protective measures introduced only for elderly persons. It could be demonstrated using the model that the lockdown measures introduced prevented a major medical emergency and possibly a near catastrophe in the region. It was further demonstrated that the prospective application of the model can facilitate realtime decisions on pandemic management strategy for the population. This is achieved by curve-fitting for the rate constants, determinants for the number of infectious persons. The calculated maximum numbers of infected and infectious persons daily increased in proportion to the number of persons initially susceptible to the infection. After appearance of the first two infections in Heidelberg, the calculated maximum number of persons carrying live virus was 2,291 at Day 102 (Scenario B), 18,936 infectious persons at Day 139 (Scenario C) and 22,535 infectious at Day 142 (Scenario A). In Scenario A, high values would have persisted for 6 months during which a total of 124,301 persons would have been infected in Heidelberg. The model predicted that the virus would have disappeared within 1 year after being first detected. A disease catastrophe of this magnitude would not be expected provided the rate constant (&#945;) for the rate of increase in the number of infectious persons remained lower than the rate constant (?) for the fall in number of infectious persons.","output":"Evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic using an algorithm based on the Bateman function: Prediction of disease progression using observational data for the city of Heidelberg, Germanya??"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression interferes with maternal engagement in interventions that are effective in improving infant social-emotional and social-communication outcomes. There is an absence of integrated interventions with demonstrated effectiveness in both reducing maternal depression and promoting parent-mediated practices that optimize infant social-emotional and social-communication competencies. Interventions targeting maternal depression are often separate from parent-mediated interventions. To address the life course needs of depressed mothers and their infants, we need brief, accessible, and integrated interventions that target both maternal depression and specific parent practices shown to improve infant social-emotional and social-communication trajectories. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile internet intervention, Mom and Baby Net, with remote coaching to improve maternal mood and promote parent practices that optimize infant social-emotional and social-communication development. METHODS: This is a two-arm, randomized controlled intent-to-treat trial. Primary outcomes include maternal depression symptoms and observed parent and infant behaviors. Outcomes are measured via direct observational assessments and standardized questionnaires. The sample is being recruited from the urban core of a large southern city in the United States. Study enrollment was initiated in 2017 and concluded in 2020. Participants are biological mothers with elevated depression symptoms, aged 18 years or older, and who have custody of an infant less than 12 months of age. Exclusion criteria at the time of screening include maternal homelessness or shelter residence, inpatient mental health or substance abuse treatment, or maternal or infant treatment of a major mental or physical illness that would hinder meaningful study participation. RESULTS: The start date of this grant-funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) was September 1, 2016. Data collection is ongoing. Following the institutional review board (IRB)Capproved pilot work, the RCT was approved by the IRB on November 17, 2017. Recruitment was initiated immediately following IRB approval. Between February 15, 2018, and March 11, 2021, we successfully recruited a sample of 184 women and their infants into the RCT. The sample is predominantly African American and socioeconomically disadvantaged. CONCLUSIONS: Data collection is scheduled to be concluded in March 2022. We anticipate that relative to the attention control condition, which is focused on education around maternal depression and infant developmental milestones with matching technology and coaching structure, mothers in the Mom and Baby Net intervention will experience greater reductions in depression and gains in sensitive and responsive parent practices and that their infants will demonstrate greater gains in social-emotional and social-communication behavior.

Methods During 2020, a convenience sample of 60 PIED consumers (mean age = 26.69;68.3% located outside Australia) completed a quantitative anonymous online survey exploring how the coronavirus pandemic impacted patterns of PIED use and associated exercise habits. The survey was administered via the Qualtrics platform and distributed online through PIED forums as well as through the investigator's networks. Participants were asked about their PIED use and exercise habits prior to and during restricted movement lockdowns. Results Pre-COVID, the majority of the sample opted to blast-cruise (an initial high dose, followed by a lower maintenance dose;71.7%, n = 43). During lockdown, (45%, n = 27) reported a change in PIED use as a result of the restrictions. In light of health concerns during COVID-19, a majority of men (60%, n = 36) did not take any extra precautions relating to their PIED use. A subgroup of men ceased using PIEDs completely (16.7%, n = 10) with the majority (80%, n = 8) of that subgroup following post-cycle therapy (PCT) of some kind. Conclusions This study contributes to the emerging literature of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use, specifically PIED use among men. The results suggest that the pandemic did influence the choice of PIEDs that participants consumed, although there was little disruption to patterns of exercise, an important aspect of PIED use. Of the men who did cease use completely, the majority reported little issue with PCT access;those who reported difficulty accessing PCT compounds indicated experience some mental health concerns related to ceasing their PIED use. Clinicians and those who come into contact with this group should be alert for any negative physical or mental health concerns resulting from disrupted or ceased PIED use.","output":"Investigating the impact of COVID-19 on performance and image enhancing drug use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Masks are believed to slow the spread of Covid-19, and can prevent many deaths, yet this inexpensive, common sense public health measure has ignited a fierce debate in the U.S. Opponents of masks or anti-maskers have resorted to measures such as organizing protests and marches to make their views public.

Baseline characteristics and procedural variables were similar, with the exception of younger age, less frequent history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation and stent retriever use in patients with dissections. The rates of mTICI2b-3 reperfusion, parenchymal hematoma, good outcome and mortality were similar amongst groups. The frequency of S-curves (any side without superimposed atherosclerosis) was 29% in the dissection group versus 7% in controls (p < 0.01). S-curves were typically mirror images within the dissection group (85% had bilateral occurrence). The frequency of C-shaped and 360-degree curves was similar between groups. FMD changes within the craniocervical arteries were statistically more common in dissection patients. Ten patients (41%) of the dissection group had S-curves or classic FMD changes. Multivariate analysis indicated that S-curves were independently associated with the presence of dissections. CONCLUSION S-shaped ICA curves are predictably bilateral, highly associated with carotid dissections in patients with moderate to severe strokes, and may suggest an underlying presence of FMD.","output":"Internal Carotid Artery S-Shaped Curve as a Marker of Fibromuscular Dysplasia in Dissection-Related Acute Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How do we evaluate the value of a medical mask? And how does the mask acquire its meanings? In this paper, I approach the mask as a media entity: a mediated and mediating thing whose meanings and values arise from within a complex network of relations. The recent political divide regarding mask-wearing has roots in the ambivalence and confusion about their efficacy in the first few months of the pandemic. It remained unclear for some time whether masks protected the wearer or those around them, but nonetheless a global mask-making cottage industry emerged, shaped by DIY and citizen science. The DIY community cleverly leveraged this core ambivalence, foregrounding multivalence, and thereby feeding into a binary ethical obligation: for whom does one wear a mask? The mask was thus baptized into regular usage by the ?I/You? utterance that we are now familiar with: ?I wear my mask to protect you, as you wear your mask to protect me?.

Its upregulated expression is implicated in tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, thus making it an attractive target in cancer therapeutics. Currently, a few small molecule inhibitors have been reported to inhibit Hpse, with promising oral administration and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. In the present study, a ligand-based pharmacophore model was generated from a dataset of well-known active small molecule Hpse inhibitors which were observed to display favorable PK properties. The compounds from the InterBioScreen database of natural (69,034) and synthetic (195,469) molecules were first filtered for their drug-likeness and the pharmacophore model was used to screen the drug-like database. The compounds acquired from screening were subjected to molecular docking with Heparanase, where two molecules used in pharmacophore generation were used as reference. From the docking analysis, 33 compounds displayed higher docking scores than the reference and favorable interactions with the catalytic residues. Complex interactions were further evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations to assess their stability over a period of 50 ns. Furthermore, the binding free energies of the 33 compounds revealed 2 natural and 2 synthetic compounds, with better binding affinities than reference molecules, and were, therefore, deemed as hits.

The UK Government introduced a series of measures including national 'lockdowns' and regional 'tiers' to control virus transmission. As the outbreak continued, new variants were detected through two national disease monitoring programmes. Longitudinal records of their emergence and spread provide information with which we investigate factors affecting disease spread and the effectiveness of interventions. Methods We analysed the spatio-temporal dynamics of positive tests for COVID-19 on Teesside, UK throughout 2020. We investigated putative risk factors for infection, specifically, socio-economic deprivation, weather, and government interventions (lockdown). We used a combination of disease mapping and mixed-effect modelling to investigate the dynamics of positive tests from two sampling strategies and the spread of particular variants of the virus as they emerged on Teesside. Results SARS-CoV-2 spread was related to the extent of social deprivation, lockdown interventions and weather conditions over the period of the study. Cases in the first wave appeared to be associated with the first lockdown, but interventions had less impact on the second wave. Conclusions There was spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the distribution of different lineages, with spread faster in some lineages than others and varying across the region. Positive tests within region appeared to be related to levels of socio-economic deprivation. The interventions appeared to have different effects in the two waves of disease, and were associated with reduced numbers of records in the first wave, but having no effect during the second.","output":"Spatio-temporal epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 virus lineages in Teesside, UK, in 2020: effects of social deprivation, weather and lockdown on lineage dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction.

Seeking for the input data homogeneity, we analyze single-stranded RNA viruses only.

In the second approach, the whole RNA genome is divided into parts by adenine or the most frequent nucleotide as a \\"space\\". Rank--frequency distributions are studied in both cases. Within the first approach, the Plya and the negative hypergeometric distribution yield the best fit. For the distributions obtained within the second approach, we have calculated a set of parameters, including entropy, mean sequence length, and its dispersion. The calculated parameters became the basis for the classification of viruses. We observed that proximity of viruses on planes spanned on various pairs of parameters corresponds to related species. In certain cases, such a proximity is observed for unrelated species as well calling thus for the expansion of the set of parameters used in the classification. We also observed that the fourth most frequent nucleotide sequences obtained within the second approach are of different nature in case of human coronaviruses (different nucleotides for MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 versus identical nucleotides for four other coronaviruses).

We evaluated a vimentin-binding small molecule compound ALD-R491 for its effects on cellular processes related to viral infection and for its efficacy in treating SARS-CoV2 infection in vitro and in vivo. In cultured cells, the compound could reduce endocytosis by 10%, endosomal trafficking by 40% and exosomal release by over 30%. In an infection system consisting of a lentiviral pseudotype bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and HEK293 cells over-expressing the human ACE2 receptor with multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, 10 and 100, the compound inhibited the infection up to a maximum of over 90%, with IC 50 < 50 nM, CC50 > 10 M, and SI > 200. After oral administration of ALD-R491 in rats, the plasma concentration of the compound reached the peak (Tmax) at around 5 h with a half-life (T1/2) of about 5 h. The compound was widely distributed and enriched in tissues in vivo in rats with a volume of distribution (Vd) of over 2,000 ml/kg. The lung and the lymph nodes were among the tissues with high drug exposures. In rats receiving oral gavage of the compound at 30 mg/kg, the drug exposure in the lung and the lymph nodes maintained at levels over 1 M from 1 h to 6 h after the oral dosing. In the syngeneic mouse tumor CT26 model, ALD-R491 was found to activate regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vivo and enhance de novo generation of Tregs in lymph nodes of the mice. In the Mouse-Adapted SARS-CoV2 model, aged mice (11-12 months) were used to provide a harder test of recovery from infection that reflects the severeness of COVID-19 in old patients. For therapeutic treatment, the mice were orally administered with the compound 24 h after the SARS-CoV2 infection once per day on Day 1, Day 2 and Day 4. At 10 mg/kg, ALD-R491 significantly reduced the body weight loss of the mice (p<0.01 on Day 5 post-infection). At both 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, the compound significantly reduced the hemorrhagic score for the lungs (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively, on Day 5). These results indicate that vimentin intermediate filament is an effective host-directed antiviral target. Importantly, the vimentin-binding small molecule ALD-R491 impacts multiple aspects of SARS-CoV2 infection, has a favorable oral pharmacokinetics and a wide therapeutic window, and therefore may be a promising therapeutic candidate for treating COVID-19.

The 380 kDa virus has been a perfect storm, especially for those national health systems used to working with limited resources and high intensity rhythms, such as Italy. For the first time in the new century, a virtually unknown fast-spreading disease has caused a public health emergency thus forcing most countries to deal with an insurmountable logistic gap. Hence, every branch of Medicine, even though not directly involved in the treatment, has been called upon to provide its contribution to resolve the crisis. It is now becoming more apparent that Covid-19 is not solely a lung disease, but a complex systemic disease involving several organs and systems. This is due to an abnormal inflammatory response which eventually leads to multisystemic coagulopathy which mainly, but not uniquely, targets the lungs. Although the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still not fully understood, macrophages and their immune complex system seem to play a key role. It is not yet clear why some patients develop the violent immune response which results in pneumonitis while others do not. There are clues indicating that the systemic hyper-inflammation defined as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), or cytokine storm, requires an increase in choline consumption to synthesize phosphatidylcholine and stimulate phagocytosis, organelle biogenesis, secretory functions, and endocytosis.

Patients were classified as either positive or negative according to serum TgAb levels. The recurrence or persistence rates in both groups were compared. Results Of the 109 patients enrolled 14 patients had TgAb positivity. Thirty-two (29.3%) showed disease recurrence or persistent disease during 101 months of follow-up. Twenty-seven of 95 patients (28.4%) with negative TgAb had persistent or recurrent disease, whereas 5 of 14 patients (35.7%) with positive TgAb had persistence or recurrence (P = 0.57). No significant difference in disease-free survival (115.3  10.8 vs. 224.1  16.6 months, P = 0.78) and overall survival (P = 0.59) was observed between TgAb positive and TgAb negative patients. Conclusions TgAb status is not useful as a prognostic and predictive factor for clinical outcomes in patients with PTC in our experience.","output":"Serum antithyroglobulin antibody levels are not a good predictive factor on detection of disease activity in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guessing the meaning of a foreign word before being presented with the right answer benefits recognition performance for the translation compared to reading the full translation outright. However, guessing does not increase memory for the foreign-word-to-translation associations, which is crucial for language acquisition. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether this disadvantage of guessing for performance in cued-recall tests would be eliminated if a restudy phase was added. In Experiments 1C3, we consistently demonstrated that guessing resulted in lower cued-recall performance compared to reading, both before and after restudy. Even for items for which participants successfully recalled their initial guesses on the cued-recall test, accuracy levels did not exceed those from the reading condition. In Experiment 4, we aimed to generalize our findings concerning restudy to a different set of materials C weakly associated word pairs. Even though this time guessing led to better performance than reading, consistent with previous studies, this guessing benefit was not moderated by adding a restudy phase. Our results thus underscore the importance of the initial learning phase for future learning and retention, while undermining the usefulness of the learning-through-guessing strategy for acquiring foreign language vocabulary.","output":"You wont guess that: On the limited benefits of guessing when learning a foreign language"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human periodontitis is associated with a wide range of bacteria and viruses and with complex innate and adaptive immune responses.

Recent studies support the concept that the gut microbiota is involved in the development of hypertension and that dietary fibre intake may act through the gut microbiota to lower blood pressure (BP). Resistant starch is a type of prebiotic fibre which is metabolised by commensal bacteria in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Previous work in pre-clinical models provides strong evidence that both prebiotic fibre as well as SCFAs (i.e. postbiotics) can prevent the development of hypertension. The aim of this clinical trial is to determine if acetylated and butyrylated modified resistant starch can decrease BP of hypertensive individuals via the modulation of the gut microbiota and release of high levels of SCFAs. METHODS: This is a phase IIa double-blinded, randomised, cross-over, placebo controlled trial. Participants are randomly allocated to receive either a diet containing 40 g/day of the modified resistant starch or placebo (corn starch or regular flour) for 3 weeks on each diet, with a 3-week washout period between the two diets. BP is measured in the office, at home, and using a 24-h ambulatory device. Arterial stiffness is measured using carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity. Our primary endpoint is a reduction in ambulatory daytime systolic BP. Secondary endpoints include changes to circulating cytokines, immune markers, and modulation to the gut microbiome. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study will provide the first evidence for the use of a combination of pre- and postbiotics to lower BP in humans. The results are expected at the end of 2021.

This study aims to clarify and solidify the discourse around food policy coordination by differentiating between routine coordination of the activities of government, and strategic coordination of such policy activities with higher-level strategic goals, such as those associated with a healthy and sustainable food system. This framework is applied to the case study based on documentary analysis. In detailing the evidence of coordination in the response, including examples of cross-government working, and collaboration across the public, private and third sectors, the findings illustrate the breadth of actors which constituted the policy and governance response. These included public policymakers in national and local governments, and from a range of different government departments; private sector food businesses; and third sector organisations. There was a high level of routine coordination, but also instances of disconnection and delay. A lack of strategic coordination provides an explanatory device for several instances of disconnection and incoherence, including interventions which failed to prioritise nutrition-related health, and the working conditions of those employed in the food sector.

Differences in adverse clinical outcomes following coronary artery bypass graft between these groups are poorly established. Therefore, a propensity matched comparison of short and longer term mortality and morbidity in insulin-controlled diabetes, tablet-controlled diabetes and non-diabetic patients was undertaken. METHODS: Isolated first-time coronary artery bypass graft surgeries between April 1999 and April 2017 were propensity score matched by pre- and intra-operative variables. RESULTS: 8241 patients; 23.5% diabetics and 76.5% non-diabetics. The groups' demographical and clinical characteristics were comparable after matching. Insulin-controlled diabetes patients had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (3.8% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.05), multisystem failure (2.6% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.05), sternal wound infections requiring debridement (3.6% vs. 1.3%, p < 0.05), respiratory complications (25.6% vs. 21.9%, p < 0.05), new dialysis (4.7% vs. 0.9%, p < 0.05) and longer hospital stays (13.5  13.3 vs. 10.6  8.0, p < 0.05) compared to non-diabetic patients.Tablet-controlled diabetes patients had significantly higher strokes (2.9% vs. 1.2, p < 0.05), superficial sternal wound infections (6.7% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.05), respiratory complications (25.7% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.05), new dialysis (1.7% vs. 0.6%, p < 0.05), post-operative atrial fibrillation (37.1% vs. 33.9%, p < 0.05) and readmission with myocardial infarction (22.4% vs. 19.6%, p < 0.05) compared to non-diabetic patients.

Asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 from nursing facility staff and residents is a major accelerator of infection. Facility-wide point-prevalence testing is an emerging strategy in disease mitigation. Because time is not available to await the results of randomized controlled trials before implementing strategies in this high-risk setting, an expert Delphi panel composed of experienced long-term care medicine professionals has now met to provide testing guidance for SARS-Coronavirus-2 to NFs. After many email and telephone discussions, the panel responded to a questionnaire that included six different scenarios, based on varying availability of Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing and personal protective equipment (PPE). The panel endorsed facility-wide testing of staff and residents without dissent when diagnostic RT-PCR was available. While the panel recognized the limitations of RT-PCR testing, it strongly recommended this testing for both staff and residents in NFs that were either COVID-19 naive or had limited outbreaks. There was also consensus on testing residents with atypical symptoms in a scenario of limited testing capability. The panel favored testing every 1 to 2 weeks if testing was readily available, reducing the frequency to every month as community prevalence declined or as the collection of additional data further informed clinical critical thinking and decision-making. The panel recognized that frequent testing would have consequences in terms of potential staff shortages due to quarantine after positive tests and increased PPE use. However, the panel felt that not testing would allow new clusters of infection to form. The resulting high mortality rate would outweigh the potential negative consequences of testing. The panel also recognized the pandemic as a rapidly evolving crisis, and that new science and increasing experience might require an updating of its recommendations. The panel hopes that its recommendations will be of value to the long-term care industry and to policy makers as we work together to manage through this challenging and stressful time.","output":"Editorial: Diagnostic Testing for SARS-Coronavirus-2 in the Nursing Facility: Recommendations of a Delphi Panel of Long-Term Care Clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Economies have always been sensitive to certain types of shocks in the past.

For this purpose, extended SEAIRD compartmental models are established to describe the epidemic dynamics with both single-dose and double-dose vaccine administration. Taking the vaccination rates in different susceptible compartments as control variables, the optimal vaccine administration problems are then solved under the framework of nonlinear constrained optimal control problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that addresses an optimal vaccine administration strategy considering practical constraints on limited medical care resources. Numerical simulations show that both the single-dose and double-dose strategies can successfully control COVID-19. By comparison, the double-dose vaccination strategy can achieve a better reduction in infection and death, while the single-dose vaccination strategy can postpone the infection peak more efficiently. Further studies of the influence of parameters indicate that increasing the number of medical care personnel and total vaccine supply can greatly contribute to the fight against COVID-19. The results of this study are instructive for potential forthcoming vaccine administration.

Often overlooked, however, is the role PIP2 itself plays in this regulation. Although numerous reports have demonstrated that PIP2 is critical for ion channel regulation, how it impacts vascular function has received scant attention. In this review, we focus on PIP2 as a regulator of ion channels in smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells-the two major classes of vascular cells.

The estimation of TSM is performed using Landsat-8/operational land imager (OLI), and an intercomparison of TSM load during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods is done. It is observed that during the lockdown period, TSM reduced by 30-50%. This is a significant observation considering the ecological balance of the region and the fact that it is home to the largest mangroves in the world. This change in suspended matter presumably reflects the influence of reduction in anthropogenic activities owing to the COVID-19 lockdowns, such as industries, closure of shipping activities (through less dredging), and brick kilns (through less sediment removal), which are generally the primary contributors in this region. Even though these observed changes are representative of the positive influence of the COVID-19 lockdown, its implications in estuarine biogeochemistry still remain poorly quantified. The decrease in TSM content may increase light penetration, thereby increasing the primary productivity. In addition, low sediment load reaching the Bay of Bengal could influence the carbon export due to reduction in ballasting effect as reported from this region. In summary, the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on the biogeochemistry of the aquatic ecosystem appears rather complex than thought earlier and may vary regionally based on local hydrodynamics. The analysis elucidates the complex interplay of regional lockdown and its implication in modulation of local biogeochemistry.

METHODS Clinical data of patients with severe H1N1 influenza virus pneumonia implemented by ECMO in the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College from October 2018 to December 2019 were retrospective analyzed, including general information, ECMO transport distance, time, clinical parameters before and after ECMO, including the patients' oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), respiratory rate (RR), pulse blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2), and pH value, various complications during transport, mechanical ventilation time, patients' prognosis and other indicators. Experience from the aspects of personal protection, transport process and equipment, team cooperation, mid-transit monitoring, quality control, etc., was summarized to provide suggestions for patients with severe COVID-19 using ECMO during inter-hospital transport and protection. RESULTS A total of 6 patients with severe H1N1 influenza virus pneumonia were transported on ECMO. All patients were transported to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College by the ECMO transport team after the establishment of ECMO in the local hospital. The transfer distance was 11 to 197 km, with an average of (93.858.6) km; the transfer time was 30 to 150 minutes, with an average of (79.240.6) minutes. Two patients experienced a drop in ECMO flow and SpO2 during the process, and the main reason was insufficient volume, which was improved after fluid resuscitation and posture adjustment. All patients maintained SpO2 above 0.93. Six patients survived and were discharged. ECMO assisted time was 4-9 days, with an average of (6.51.5) days; mechanical ventilation time was 7-24 days, and median time was 10.0 (8.0, 14.5) days. No H1N1 transmission occurred in medical personnel. To achieve good therapeutic effect, the main experience was to choose the proper timing and mode of ECMO; intact transportation vehicles and equipment to reduce or avoid mechanical complications; the effective management of respiration and circulation during the transportation to avoid ventilation-associated lung injury (VALI) and serious hypoxemia; the appropriate space for the transfer team to quickly handle various critical situations; and personal protection to avoid infection. CONCLUSIONS With an experienced ECMO transport team, good transport equipment, comprehensive protection measures, reasonable transport procedures, and a perfect emergency plan, it is safe to use ECMO transport for COVID-19 patients.","output":"[Study on the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation inter-hospital transport during coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic: based on the transport experience of 6 cases of severe H1N1 influenza virus pneumonia on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The current study aimed to assess and compare the level of knowledge and attitude towards mental illness between secondary school students and their teachers in Oman.

In addition, knowledgeable teachers with positive attitude can assist in early identification of mental illnesses and help students when needed. In turn, students who possess knowledge and positive attitude toward mental illness can share their concerns with their teachers. In the presence of such accepting and cooperative environment, the stigma can be decreased and early detection of mental illness and help-seeking behaviour can be promoted.","output":"A comparison of knowledge and attitude toward mental illness among secondary school students and teachers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The extent to which vaccinated persons who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 contribute to transmission is unclear. During a SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant outbreak among incarcerated persons with high vaccination rates in a federal prison, we assessed markers of viral shedding in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. Methods Consenting incarcerated persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection provided mid-turbinate nasal specimens daily for 10 consecutive days and reported symptom data via questionnaire. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral whole genome sequencing, and viral culture was performed on these nasal specimens. Duration of RT-PCR positivity and viral culture positivity was assessed using survival analysis. Results A total of 978 specimens were provided by 95 participants, of whom 78 (82%) were fully vaccinated and 17 (18%) were not fully vaccinated. No significant differences were detected in duration of RT-PCR positivity among fully vaccinated participants (median: 13 days) versus those not fully vaccinated (median: 13 days; p=0.50), or in duration of culture positivity (medians: 5 days and 5 days; p=0.29). Among fully vaccinated participants, overall duration of culture positivity was shorter among Moderna vaccine recipients versus Pfizer (p=0.048) or Janssen (p=0.003) vaccine recipients. Conclusions As this field continues to develop, clinicians and public health practitioners should consider vaccinated persons who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 to be no less infectious than unvaccinated persons. These findings are critically important, especially in congregate settings where viral transmission can lead to large outbreaks.","output":"Transmission potential of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in a federal prison, July-August 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we discussed a 22-year-old pregnant woman (gestational age: 32 weeks) infected with COVID-19 who presented with fever (39.1 C) and respiratory symptoms. Thoracic computed tomography could not be obtained due to pregnancy. PCR testing was positive. The patient was treated with supportive care and anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents; however, general health status deteriorated and patient was admitted to intensive care unit on day 3. After admission to COVID-19 ICU, clinical picture was rapidly worsened with development of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, \\"extracorporeal cytokine hemoadsorption\\" (CytoSorb?, Cytosorbents Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) was planned and performed with regular intervals in order to remove inflammatory cytokines from circulation and to relieve systemic inflammatory response. The fever response and CRP elevation were controlled by hemoadsorption and cytokine filter performed in alternate days. On day 7 of ICU admission, it was decided to terminate pregnancy due to worsening hypoxemia and a healthy, premature infant was born. On day 2 after cesarean section, the patient was intubated and mechanical ventilation support was initiated. However, the patient showed an increasingly complicated clinical course and died on day 22 after ICU admission. It is seen that COVID-19 positivity carries an important risk for both mother and fetus, particularly in those at advanced stages of gestation, by physiological changes in the mother during pregnancy. We believe that, in the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications during pregnancy, cytokine filter treatment can give time to patient for hemodynamic and metabolic stabilization.","output":"Cytokine Hemoadsorption in the Management of a Pregnant Woman with COVID-19 Pneumonia: Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We document extreme disruption in debt markets during the COVID-19 crisis: a severe price crash accompanied by significant dislocations at the safer end of the credit spectrum Investment-grade corporate bonds traded at a discount to credit default swaps;exchange-traded funds traded at a discount to net asset value, more so for safer bonds The Federal Reserves announcement of corporate bond purchases caused these dislocations to disappear and prices to recover These facts inform potential theories of the disruption The best explanation is an acute liquidity need for specific bond investors, such as mutual funds, leading them to liquidate large positions","output":"When Selling Becomes Viral: Disruptions in Debt Markets in the COVID-19 Crisis and the Feds Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La sant per?ue des travailleurs hospitaliers de nuit (THN), plus vulnrables du fait de leur rythme de travail, demeure peu tudie.

The effects of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on LNCaP prostate cancer cell survival were assessed using clonogenic cell survival assay, quick cell proliferation assay, and caspase-3 activity kits. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was found to inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation as well as promote apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that anti-proliferative effects were associated with downregulation of the pro-proliferative molecule cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). The increased rate of apoptosis was associated with the upregulation of pro-apoptotic molecule Fas ligand (FasL). SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inhibits the growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro by a two-pronged approach of downregulating the expression of CDK4 and upregulating FasL. The introduction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into the body via COVID-19 vaccination may have the potential to inhibit prostate cancer in patients. This potential beneficial association between COVID-19 vaccines and prostate cancer inhibition will require more extensive studies before any conclusions can be drawn about any in vivo effects in a human model.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inhibits growth of prostate cancer: a potential role of the COVID-19 vaccine killing two birds with one stone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a high case fatality rate in some countries even thought the majority of cases are asymptomatic.

METHODS The records of all consecutive patients who received a double-mesh combined with the components-separation technique for ventral hernia repair were reviewed. The clinical, surgical, and follow-up data were analyzed. RESULTS Nine patients [3 women, 6 men; median age = 62 years (range = 26-77)] were included in the study. Median transverse defect size was 20 cm (range = 15-25). The median duration of hospital stay was 8 days (range = 5-17). Postoperative complications occurred in 66% (6/9). Follow-up [median = 13 months (range = 3-49)] showed no recurrent hernias, but one patient had a small hernia after a relaparotomy for colon carcinoma recurrence. The overall occurrence of wound infections was 44% (4/9). There was no mortality.

In this epidemiologically-based observational study we created a large population-based cohort of patients treated for aBM, aiming to: (1) monitor possible time-related changes of the incidence of surgical treatment of aBM-lesions, (2) examine differences in the population and care of patients treated at different treatment centers and (3) examine if findings from a previous pilot study regarding absence of a suitable biopsy of the lesions representing debut of cancer or a relapse has improved the awareness of aBM and hereby increased the focus on regular tumor biopsies and follow-up imaging of cancer patients. Methods: We examined a population-based cohort consisting of all patients treated for aBM 2014-2019. Procedures were performed at five secondary surgical centers (SSC) or one tertiary referral Musculoskeletal Tumor Center (MTC). Patients were followed until end of study (30 September 2021) or death. No patients were lost to follow-up. Results: Four-hundred-fifty-seven patients (493 primary aBM-lesions, 482 procedures) were included. Annual incidence of aBM-surgery was 46 aBM-lesions/million. MTC-patients had a significant better preoperative status than SSC-patients considering factors known for survival. Patients with complete fracture experienced longer surgical delay when treated at MTC compared to SSC: 4 (1-9) and 1 (1-3) days (p < 0.001), respectively. Overall survival for the entire cohort was 37% and 11% at 1 and 5 years (MTC and SSC 1 and 5 year respectively: 44% and 15% vs. 29% and 5%, p < 0.001). In patients with debut or relapse of cancer, 8% and 9% had insufficient biopsies, and 21% and 12% had no biopsy, respectively. Comparison showed no change over time.

There is no published review that clearly indicates documented medicinal plants available in different parts of the country used for treating viral and fungal infections. Currently, viral epidemics with high mortality and morbidity like SARS COV-2 are emerging. Screening of promising drug from plant source is vital to control such viral and fungal infections. In addition, indicating the most commonly used parts of the plant and their route of administration will help for further drug formulation studies. This review aimed to present an indication of the ethnomedicinal plants used for the treatment of fungal and viral infections. METHODS: The databases (Google Scholar, pub med, hinari, and research gate) were searched for published articles on the ethnobotany of medicinal plants used to treat viral and fungal infection in Ethiopia without restriction in the methodology and year of publication. Viral infections, fungal infections, anti-fungal and anti-viral activity, ethnobotany, Ethiopia, and medicinal plants were the key search terms. Studies that did not have complete ethnobotanical data and did not address viral and fungal infection as a disease treated traditionally by the practitioners were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 249 articles were produced by database search. After amendment for exclusion criteria and duplicates, 15 articles were found appropriate for the review. The majority of the studies were qualitative and others were mixed type in nature. All of the medicinal plants traditionally used to treat viral and fungal infections in Ethiopia were not scientifically confirmed. Out of the 95 identified plants, 40.8% were herbs and from the plant parts used and 43.9% and 21.1% were leaves and roots, respectively. The majority, (48.8%), of the plant remedies were given orally. Rabies and Tinea capitis constitute the highest percentage of viral and fungal infections treated by traditional medicinal plants followed by hepatitis and Tinea corporis, respectively. CONCLUSION: Various plants have been used to treat viral and fungal infections. Information obtained from this review serves as a guide to discover novel antiviral and antifungal agents from plants. Therefore, it is advisable for field researchers to properly identify, document, conserve and conduct efficacy and safety studies on such medicinal plants in animal models.","output":"A Systematic Review on Traditional Medicinal Plants Used for the Treatment of Viral and Fungal Infections in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mistrangelo et al raise a number of issues in connection with the International Anal Neoplasia Society guidelines for the practice of High Resolution Anoscopy (HRA) in the era of COVID\\\\19.

The neutralizing activity of sera from 65 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine recipients and convalescent individuals against clinical isolates of ancestral SARS-CoV-2, beta, delta, and omicron VOCs was assessed. Convalescent sera from unvaccinated individuals infected by the ancestral virus during the first wave of COVID-19 in Canada (July, 2020) demonstrated reduced neutralization against beta and omicron VOCs. Convalescent sera from unvaccinated individuals infected by the delta variant (May-June, 2021) neutralized omicron to significantly lower levels compared to the delta variant. Sera from individuals that received three doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines demonstrated reduced neutralization of the omicron variant relative to ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Sera from individuals that were naturally infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine induced significantly higher neutralizing antibody levels against ancestral virus and all VOCs. Importantly, infection alone, either with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 or the delta variant was not sufficient to induce high neutralizing antibody titers against omicron.

Methods: An online questionnaire was distributed in May-June 2020 including demographics, self-reported physical- and work behavior throughout the day before and during the lockdown, Sports Motivation Scale-II assessing motivation for being physically active, and rating on facilitators and barriers for engaging in physical activity during the lockdown. One-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test was computed to investigate differences between those participants who become more-, less-, and equally active during the COVID-19 lockdown. Results: Ninety-nine people (Female=66) completed the questionnaire. Forty-four percent of the participants considered themselves less active than before the lockdown. Respondents reporting becoming more physically active (28%) were more intrinsically motivated than the remaining participants. The most important facilitators for physical activity were good weather, no work-related travel, and flexible work schedules. The most important barriers were no active transportation, closed facilities, and work fatigue.

The single submodels provide a rather accurate description of the COVID-19 evolution in each subpopulation by an extended SEIR model including the class of asymptomatic infectives, which is recognized as a determinant for disease diffusion. The multi-group structure is specifically designed to investigate the effects of the inter-regional mobility restored at the end of the first strong lockdown in Italy (June 3, 2020). In its time-invariant version, the model is shown to enjoy some analytical stability properties which provide significant insights on the efficacy of the implemented control measurements.

The simulation results are in good agreement with the data, so that the model can represent a useful tool for predicting the effects of the combination of containment measures in triggering future pandemic scenarios. Particularly, the simulation shows that, although the unrestricted mobility alone appears to be insufficient to trigger the second wave, the human transfers were crucial to make uniform the spatial distribution of the infection throughout the country and, combined with the restart of the production, trade, and education activities, determined a time advance of the contagion increase since September 2020.","output":"A data-driven model of the COVID-19 spread among interconnected populations: epidemiological and mobility aspects following the lockdown in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unacceptable healthcare disparities in endocrine disease have persisted for decades, and 2021 presents a difficult evolving environment.

The purpose of our investigation was to compare the effect of RYGB, vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), and duodenal switch (DS) on insulin and glucose response to carbohydrate challenge. METHODS Patients meeting National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery selected their bariatric procedure after evaluation and education in this prospective nonrandomized study. Preoperatively and at 6, 9, and 12 months' follow-up, patients underwent blood draw to determine levels of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-peptide, and 2-h oral glucose challenge test. Homoeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA)-IR, fasting to 1-h and 1- to 2-h ratios of glucose and insulin, were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Student's paired t test. All procedures were performed via a laparoscopic technique at a single institution. RESULTS Data from a total of 38 patients (13 RYGB, 12 VSG, 13 DS) were available for analysis. At baseline, all groups were similar; the only statistically significant difference was that DS patients had a higher preoperative weight and body mass index (BMI). All operations caused weight loss (BMI 47.7  10-30.7  6.4 kg/m(2) in RYGB; 45.7  8.5-31.1  5.5 kg/m(2) in VSG; 55.9  11.4-27.5  5.6 kg/m(2) in DS), reduction of fasting glucose, and improved insulin sensitivity. RYGB patients had a rapid rise in glucose with an accompanying rise in 1-h insulin to a level that exceeded preoperative levels. This was followed by a rapid decrease in glucose level. In comparison, DS patients had a lower increase in glucose and 1-h insulin, and the lowest HbA1c. These differences were statistically significant at various data points. For VSG, the results were intermediary. CONCLUSIONS Compared to gastric bypass, DS results in greater weight loss and improves insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis without causing a hyperinsulinemic response. Because the response to challenge after VSG is intermediary, pyloric preservation alone cannot account for this difference.","output":"Response to glucose tolerance testing and solid high carbohydrate challenge: comparison between Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical sleeve gastrectomy, and duodenal switch."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids on outcomes of patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia.

The primary outcome was intubation or death at Day 28. Baseline characteristics of patients were balanced using propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting. Results Among the 891 patients included in the analysis, 203 were assigned to the CTC group. At day 28, corticosteroids did not reduce the rate of the primary outcome (wHR 0.92, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.39) nor the cumulative death rate (wHR 1.03, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.98).

On the basis of the results of our preliminary tests, we apply the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) for this analysis and employ the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) as a robust check and also deploy the vector error correction model (VECM) to determine the direction of causality. We find that long-run relationship exists among the factors in this study. We additionally find that biotechnology has a critical but negative relationship with CO(2) emission in China. Through hierarchical multiple regression analysis and PROCESS macro for mediation, moderation, and conditional process, we establish that biotechnology significantly moderates the relationship between biomass utilization and CO(2) emission in China.

In 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Maria, the largest natural disaster to ever affect the island. Several studies have estimated the excess morbidity and mortality following Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, yet no study has comprehensively examined the underlying health system weaknesses contributing to the deleterious health outcomes. Methods: A qualitative case study was conducted to assess the ability of the UPR health system to provide patient care in response to Hurricane Maria. An established five key resilience framework and inductive analysis was used to identify factors that affected health system resilience. Thirteen Emergency Medicine Physicians, Family Medicine Physicians, and Hospital Administrators in a University of Puerto Rico (UPR) Community Hospital were interviewed as part of our study. Results: Of the five key resiliency components, three domains were notably weak with respect to UPR's resiliency. Prior to the Hurricane, key personnel at the UPR hospital were unaware of the limited capacity of back-up generators at hospitals and were ill-prepared to transfer ICU patients to appropriate hospitals. Post Hurricane, the hospital faced self-regulation challenges when triaging the provision of Hurricane-related emergency services with delivering core health services, in particular for patients with chronic conditions. Finally, during and after the Hurricane, integration of patient care coordination between the UPR hospital ambulances, neighboring hospitals, and national and state government was suboptimal. The two remaining resiliency factors, addressing diverse needs and system adaptiveness in a time of crisis, were seen as strengths. Conclusions: Hurricane Maria exposed weaknesses in the Puerto Rican health system, notably the lack of awareness about the limited capacity of backup generators, poor patient care coordination, and interruption of medical care for patients with chronic conditions. As in other countries, the current COVID epidemic is taxing the capacity of the Puerto Rico health system, which could increase the likelihood of another health system collapse should another hurricane hit the island.

In addition to its design, we describe some example applications that Merlin has enabled on leadership-class HPC resources, such as the ML-augmented optimization of nuclear fusion experiments and the calibration of infectious disease models to study the progression of and possible mitigation strategies for COVID-19.","output":"Enabling Machine Learning-Ready HPC Ensembles with Merlin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As human life expectancy is rising, the incidence of age-associated diseases will also increase. Scientific evidence has revealed that healthy diets, including good fats, vitamins, minerals, or polyphenolics, could have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, with antiaging effects. Recent studies demonstrated that vitamin K is a vital cofactor in activating several proteins, which act against age-related syndromes. Thus, vitamin K can carboxylate osteocalcin (a protein capable of transporting and fixing calcium in bone), activate matrix Gla protein (an inhibitor of vascular calcification and cardiovascular events) and carboxylate Gas6 protein (involved in brain physiology and a cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease inhibitor). By improving insulin sensitivity, vitamin K lowers diabetes risk. It also exerts antiproliferative, proapoptotic, autophagic effects and has been associated with a reduced risk of cancer. Recent research shows that protein S, another vitamin K-dependent protein, can prevent the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 cases. The reduced activation of protein S due to the pneumonia-induced vitamin K depletion was correlated with higher thrombogenicity and possibly fatal outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Our review aimed to present the latest scientific evidence about vitamin K and its role in preventing age-associated diseases and/or improving the effectiveness of medical treatments in mature adults ?50 years old.","output":"The Role of Vitamin K in Humans: Implication in Aging and Age-Associated Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To better understand the immunopathogenesis of chronic inflammatory lung disease, we established a mouse model of disease that develops after respiratory viral infection. The disease that develops in this model is similar to chronic obstructive lung disease in humans. Using this model we have characterized two distinct phases in the chronic disease process. The first phase appears at three weeks after viral infection and depends on type I interferon-dependent expression and then subsequent activation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcRI) on conventional lung dendritic cells, which in turn recruit IL-13-producing CD4(+) T cells to the lower airways. The second phase becomes maximal at seven weeks after infection and depends on invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and lung macrophages. Cellular cross-talk relies on interactions between the semi-invariant V14J18 T-cell receptor on lung iNKT cells and CD1d on macrophages as well as iNKT cell-derived IL-13 and IL-13 receptor on macrophages. These interactions drive macrophages to a pattern of alternative activation and overproduction of IL-13. This innate immune axis is also activated in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, as evidenced by increased numbers of iNKT cells and IL-13-producing alternatively activated macrophages marked by chitinase 1 production. Together the findings identify two new immune pathways responsible for early and late phases of chronic inflammatory lung disease in experimental and clinical settings. These findings extend our understanding of the complex mechanisms that underlie chronic obstructive lung disease and provide useful targets for diagnosis and therapy of this common disorder.","output":"New immune pathways from chronic post-viral lung disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose to examine how diversity relates to variation in career outcomes within a single occupation: the occupation of a finance academic.

This study aims to investigate the effect of ER stress-induced autophagy of alveolar macrophage (AM) on acute lung injury (ALI) and airway inflammation using mouse models. ALI models were induced by intranasal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratio and excised lung gas volume (ELGV) in each group were measured. Mouse bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for cell sorting and protein concentration determination. Expression of tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lung tissues and BALF was also detected. Mouse AMs were isolated to observe the autophagy. Expression of GRP78, PERK, LC3I, LC3II and Beclin1 was further determined. The results indicated that tunicamycin (TM) elevated GRP78 and PERK expression of AMs in ALI mice in a dose-dependent manner. Low dosage of TM abated LC3I expression, increased LC3II and Beclin1 expression, triggered ER stress and AM autophagy, and alleviated pathological changes of AMs in ALI mice. Also, in ALI mice, low dosage of TM attenuated goblet cell proliferation of tracheal wall, and declined LW/BW ratio, ELGV, total cells and neutrophils, protein concentrations in BALF, and IL-6 and TNF- expression in lung tissues and BALF. Collectively, this study suggests that a low dosage of TM-induced ER stress can enhance the autophagy of AM in ALI mice models, thus attenuating the progression of ALI and airway inflammation.","output":"Endoplasmic reticulum stress potentiates the autophagy of alveolar macrophage to attenuate acute lung injury and airway inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Upon virus infection, CD8(+) T cell accumulation is tightly controlled by simultaneous proliferation and apoptosis. However, it remains unclear how TCR signal coordinates these events to achieve expansion and effector cell differentiation. We found that T cellCspecific deletion of nuclear helicase Dhx9 led to impaired CD8(+) T cell survival, effector differentiation, and viral clearance. Mechanistically, Dhx9 acts as the key regulator to ensure LCK- and CD3-mediated ZAP70 phosphorylation and ERK activation to protect CD8(+) T cells from apoptosis before proliferative burst. Dhx9 directly regulates Id2 transcription to control effector CD8(+) T cell differentiation. The DSRM and OB_Fold domains are required for LCK binding and Id2 transcription, respectively. Dhx9 expression is predominantly increased in effector CD8(+) T cells of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we revealed a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that Dhx9 protects activated CD8(+) T cells from apoptosis and ensures effector differentiation to promote antiviral immunity independent of nuclear sensor function.","output":"DExD/H-box helicase 9 intrinsically controls CD8(+) T cellCmediated antiviral response through noncanonical mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed significant threats to the public health and life in China.

BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause significant trauma in the nursing population. The lack of preparation, in combination with a substantial loss of life, may have implications for the longer-term mental health of the nursing workforce. Nursing students have, in many cases, been an important part of the emergency response.DesignA longitudinal cohort study was conducted with data collected at two time points. There was a seven-month time period between data collection.MethodsParticipants completed paper-based questionnaires measuring demographics, academic stressors, clinical stressors, and mental health. 358 nursing students at time point one and 347 at time point two (97% retention) completed the survey.ResultsInadequate preparation (OR: 1.783) and the inadequate preparation x death and dying interaction term (OR: 4.115) significantly increased risk of mental health problems over time. Increased death and dying alone did not increase mental health risk. ConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that it is not the increase in death and dying per se that causes mental health difficulties, but that it is instead the experience of high levels of death and dying in combination with inadequate preparation. The data are considered within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with both inadequate preparation and the scale of death and dying being two significant stressors during the emergency period.

Cytokine storm syndromes can be genetic or a secondary complication of autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders, infections, and haematological malignancies. These syndromes represent a key area of interface between rheumatology and general medicine. Rheumatologists often lead in management, in view of their experience using intensive immunosuppressive regimens and managing cytokine storm syndromes in the context of rheumatic disorders or infection (known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome [sHLH/MAS]). Interleukin (IL)-1 is pivotal in hyperinflammation. Anakinra, a recombinant humanised IL-1 receptor antagonist, is licenced at a dose of 100 mg once daily by subcutaneous injection for rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. In cytokine storm syndromes, the subcutaneous route is often problematic, as absorption can be unreliable in patients with critical illness, and multiple injections are needed to achieve the high doses required. As a result, intravenous anakinra is used in clinical practice for sHLH/MAS, despite this being an off-licence indication and route of administration. Among 46 patients admitted to our three international, tertiary centres for sHLH/MAS and treated with anakinra over 12 months, the intravenous route of delivery was used in 18 (39%) patients. In this Viewpoint, we describe current challenges in the management of cytokine storm syndromes and review the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of intravenous anakinra. There is accumulating evidence to support the rationale for, and safety of, intravenous anakinra as a first-line treatment in patients with sHLH/MAS. Intravenous anakinra has important clinical relevance when high doses of drug are required or if patients have subcutaneous oedema, severe thrombocytopenia, or neurological involvement. Cross-speciality management and collaboration, with the generation of international, multi-centre registries and biobanks, are needed to better understand the aetiopathogenesis and improve the poor prognosis of cytokine storm syndromes.","output":"Silencing the cytokine storm: the use of intravenous anakinra in haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to multiple service delivery changes across acute care sectors in the UK.

Methods: Plasma samples were collected from cohorts of healthcare workers (n = 287) and young children aged from 6 weeks to 2 years old (n = 150) pre-COVID-19 pandemic between September 2018 and November 2019 and post-COVID-19 pandemic between August and December 2020 were simultaneously tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific IgG.

The objective of this paper is to specify and examine early indicators of disease spread risk in cities during the initial stages of outbreak based on patterns of human activities obtained from digital trace data. In this study, the Venables distance (D_v), and the activity density (D_a) are used to quantify and evaluate human activities for 193 US counties, whose cumulative number of confirmed cases was greater than 100 as of March 31, 2020. Venables distance provides a measure of the agglomeration of the level of human activities based on the average distance of human activities across a city or a county (less distance could lead to a greater contact risk). Activity density provides a measure of level of overall activity level in a county or a city (more activity could lead to a greater risk). Accordingly, Pearson correlation analysis is used to examine the relationship between the two human activity indicators and the basic reproduction number in the following weeks. The results show statistically significant correlations between the indicators of human activities and the basic reproduction number in all counties, as well as a significant leader-follower relationship (time lag) between them. The results also show one to two weeks' lag between the change in activity indicators and the decrease in the basic reproduction number. This result implies that the human activity indicators provide effective early indicators for the spread risk of the pandemic during the early stages of the outbreak.

Increased muscle density was a protective factor while increased TAT, VAT, and IMAT were risk factors for hospitalization and MV/death. All these parameters except TAT had borderline effects on death alone. All parameters were associated with SO2 and extension of lung parenchymal involvement at CT; VAT was associated with CRP. Approximately 3% of the effect of age on death was mediated by decreased muscle density.

Given the burden of cancer and other chronic disease diseases along with demographic changes, the need for palliative care is growing in Turkey. This study aimed to review of the available scientific literature on palliative cancer care needs, models and outcomes Turkey. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted with English and Turkish keywords in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Google Scholar, The Turkish Academic Network and Information Centre databases, Turkish Ministry of Health documents, Turkish Council of Higher Education's doctoral thesis, and renowned national and international palliative care as well as cancer conferences 01/ 2000 to 07/ 2020. Results: Out of 27489 papers identified, 320 met the criteria for inclusion. The main focus of these studies was;historical development in palliative care, legislative regulation, professional training, use of opioids, symptom management, care for patients, palliative care centers, public awareness, psychosocial support, and end of life ethics. The majority of this literature used descriptive design, although a few case-control, cohort, and randomized control trials were also found. Our analysis showed that the development of PC in Turkey can be divided into three period. The first (early initiatives, before 2000), the second (dissemination phase, 2000- 2010), and the third stage (government & societial engagement, after 2010). Several studies also analyzed the barriers such as low public & professional awareness, disconnection from cancer care, the opioidfobia and the lack of trained palliative care providers.

Specialty services vary among sites, and patients often need to travel between facilities for different aspects of care. Network science is an established method employed to investigate these complex systems, and can be used to identify bottlenecks, opportunities to increase value and patient-centeredness in health care. The COVID-19 pandemic changed care demand patterns unexpectedly. We wanted to investigate if network analysis would allow us to better understand these changes and challenges - where our patients receive hospital-based care, what services they used and how far they travelled. We focused this analysis on a multispecialty, tertiary care academic center emergency department (AC_ED), with 70,000 patient visits annually. Methods: We extracted patient location information from electronic health records, including originating location and level of care, to create a network representation of all care pathways that passed through our ED. The volume of transfers between nodes and the distance travelled were encoded as weighted/colored edge attributes, with edges between nodes in closer proximity being darker. Nodes include: communities within our service area, EDs, and academic center units, and an outcome of mortality. They are sized/colored by betweenness centrality, reflecting the importance of the node in the integrity of the network. Results: The figure shows the overall network structure was similar for pre- and post-pandemic onset with some changes in details. AC_ED receives patients from many home locations and referring hospitals. A large proportion of visits come from the local area reflected by M16 and M12. There are many patients who travel far to access emergency care at AC_ED, bypassing local EDs though the average distance travelled to access care reduced from 114 to 85 miles. During the pandemic there was more traffic to the AC_ED from the local area (M16), fewer connections to surrounding hospitals and disproportionately reduced visits from distant areas (O and OT). Low ED volumes and restricted outpatient clinic availability during the pandemic time frame likely affected this. Inter-hospital transfer volumes declined overall, several sites transferred very few patients to AC_ED post-pandemic start, and other sites increased their transfer rate (eg, CAH13). Conclusions: Looking at hospital systems through the lens of network science can reveal changes in patterns of referrals, allows for identification of unexpected results by presenting data visually and can assist identifying crucial components of a health care system. Application of this methodology to other variables has the potential to identify new areas of improvement to increase value, outcomes and services to improve patient-oriented care.

They also prevalently used online social networks, but their perceptions seemed more positive than those of their peers without a diagnosis of depression. In fact, their positive perceptions (60%;e.g., ease of access and communication with providers, support from positive peers) were nearly two-fold greater than their negative perceptions. (36%;e.g., self-denigrating comparisons with friends, cyberbullies). Tentatively suggested moderators of risks versus protections were found at the intersection of gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. However, given this relatively new fields limits, these are probably best thought of as screened hypotheses for future full systematic review development and primary research testing.

In Experiment 1,765 calved multiparous Nellore cows were subjected to the same fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocol and rebred. Ultrasound pregnancy diagnosis was performed 30 and 90 days post-FTAI (DPI). Rates of pregnancy and pregnancy loss were determined for three periods: from 30 to 90 DPI, from 30 DPI to calving, and from 90 DPI to calving. The cows were assigned to three groups with different vaccination protocols - namely, Group VACMULT (n=250): vaccine against bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and leptospirosis; Group VACL (n=245): vaccine against leptospirosis alone; Group NOVAC (n=270): no vaccination. Serum antibody titers for BoHV-1, BVDV, and leptospirosis, measured in 57 cows from each group indicated active infection, suggesting circulation of these pathogens in the herd. No differences in pregnancy rates were observed across groups. Pregnancy loss rates did not differ significantly across groups within any of the periods investigated (30 to 90 DPI, 30 DPI to calving, or 90 DPI to calving). In Experiment 2, two vaccination protocols for each vaccine were investigated. Group VACGEST was vaccinated on day zero of FTAI (D0) and again 30 days post-FTAI (30 DPI). Group VACPREV was vaccinated on D0 and again on the day of insemination (D11). No significant difference was observed between groups, or significant gestational loss in the group that received the second vaccine on the day of insemination. The results revealed that neither vaccine interfered with the reproductive performance of multiparous cows. No differences were observed between vaccination carried out on both D0 and D11 and that performed on both D0 and D30...

Among the commonly reported biomaterials in literature, the self-assembling peptides and hydrogels have been recognized as the most potential candidate for treatment of common neurological conditions such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, spinal cord injury, stroke and tumors. The hydrogels, specifically, offer advantages like flexibility and porosity, and mimics the properties of the extracellular matrix of the central nervous system. These factors make them an ideal scaffold for drug delivery through the blood-brain barrier and tissue regeneration (using stem cells).

Habitat hotspots - places attracting a large numbers of individuals or social groups - can significantly alter contact patterns and, hence, disease propagation. Research on the importance of habitat hotspots in wildlife epidemiology has primarily focused on how inter-individual contacts occurring at the hotspot itself increase disease transmission. However, in territorial animals, epidemiologically important contacts may primarily occur as animals cross through territories of conspecifics en route to habitat hotspots. So far, the phenomenon has received little attention. Here, we investigate the importance of these contacts in the case where infectious individuals keep visiting the hotspots and in the case where these individuals are not able to travel to the hotspot any more. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a simulation epidemiological model to investigate both cases in a scenario when transmission at the hotspot does not occur. We find that (i) hotspots still exacerbate epidemics, (ii) when infectious individuals do not travel to the hotspot, the most vulnerable individuals are those residing at intermediate distances from the hotspot rather than nearby, and (iii) the epidemiological vulnerability of a population is the highest when the number of hotspots is intermediate. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: By altering animal movements in their vicinity, habitat hotspots can thus strongly increase the spread of infectious diseases, even when disease transmission does not occur at the hotspot itself. Interestingly, when animals only visit the nearest hotspot, creating additional artificial hotspots, rather than reducing their number, may be an efficient disease control measure.","output":"Transmission of Infectious Diseases En Route to Habitat Hotspots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 and 2020 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic characterized by severe pulmonary inflammation, effusions, and rapid respiratory compromise.

Objectives: To describe the maternal and neonatal clinical features as well as outcome of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this retrospective national-based study, we analyzed the medical records of all SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant patients and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra Hospital, Kuwait, between March 15th 2020 and May 31st 2020. The outcomes of pregnancies were assessed until the end date of follow-up (June 15th 2020). Results: A total of 185 pregnant women were enrolled with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, IQR: 27.5-34), and median gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks (IQR: 18-34). The majority (88%) of the patients had mild symptoms, with fever (58%) being the most common presenting symptom followed by cough (50.6%).

The aim of this study also was to determine the distribution of chronic disease among COVID-19 death patients by revealing the frequencies of the most common chronic diseases. Besides that, trend analysis according to the number of individuals in the ICU and the number of individuals in the ICU with ventilator support is being studied. This is very important to predict the number of ventilators needs while the trend of patients in ICU is increased. The last objective of this study is to determine the distribution of chronic diseases among male and female patients, revealing the most common chronic disease among death patients. Materials and Methods: Data collection started on March 8th 2020 till April 6th, 2020 among the individual who died with COVID-19. The collected data consist of the gender, the cluster of infection, patient chronic disease, number of daily data on COVID-19 death, individuals in the ICU, individual in the ICU with the ventilator.

The seroprevalence of human anti-Brucella antibodies in high-risk populations, as well as their risk factors, have not been well-documented in Zambia. This study aimed at estimating the Brucella seroprevalence in herdsmen and abattoir workers and assess the associated risk factors. Methods: A cross-sectional seroepidemiological study was carried out between May and December 2020 among abattoir workers and herdsmen in Namwala, Monze and Choma districts of Southern Province in Zambia. Seroprevalence was assessed by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i-ELISA) or competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) while a questionnaire was administered to obtain epidemiological data. Results: A total of 153 individuals were recruited in the study. The overall Brucella seroprevalence was 20.3% (95% CI: 14.6C27.5). Seropositivity among herdsmen and abattoir workers was 14.4% (95% CI: 9.2C21.8) and 46.4%, (95% CI: 28.8C65.0), respectively. Comparable seropositive results among districts showed Namwala with 26.9%, which was the highest, seconded by Monze 19.0%, and the least was Choma with 11.36%, seropositivity. The multivariate logistic regression model showed that occupation, age category, and district of residence were predictors of being seropositive to Brucella spp. antibodies. The odds of abattoir workers being seropositive to Brucella antibodies were 8.6 (95% CI: 2.6C28.2) higher than that of herdsmen being the reference group. The odds of age category 17C50 years being seropositive to Brucella antibodies were 7.0 (95% CI: 0.7C72.2) higher than being <16 years as the reference group. The odds of one having attained primary level of education being seropositive to Brucella were 1.3 (95% CI: 0.1C14.7) or secondary level of education were 6.2 (95% CI: 0.5C72.6) or tertiary level of education were 5.1 (95% CI: 0.2, 113.3) higher than that of no level of education as the reference group. Furthermore, the odds of a respondent being seropositive to Brucella antibodies were 4.5 (95% CI: 1.3C15.7) for Namwala and 4.9 (95% CI: 1.1C21.7) for Monze higher than that of Choma as the reference group. Conclusion: Anti-Brucella antibodies are prevalent among herdsmen and abattoir workers in the study areas of Zambia (20.26%), a sign of exposure to Brucella pathogens. Type of profession, age and level of education seem to influence the exposure to Brucella pathogens.

In this study, we aimed to explore the potential roles and molecular mechanisms of action of ADSCs in histone-induced endothelial damage. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 N mice were intravenously injected with ADSCs, followed by histones or a vehicle. The mice in each group were assessed for survival, pulmonary vascular permeability, and histological changes. A co-culture model with primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to histones was used to clarify the paracrine effect of ADSCs. Overexpression and inhibition of miR-126 ADSCs were also examined as causative factors for endothelial protection. RESULTS: The administration of ADSCs markedly improved survival, inhibited histone-mediated lung hemorrhage and edema, and attenuated vascular hyper-permeability in mice. ADSCs were engrafted in the injured lung and attenuated histone-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. ADSCs showed endothelial protection (via a paracrine effect) and Akt phosphorylation in the histone-exposed HUVECs. Notably, increased Akt phosphorylation by ADSCs was mostly mediated by exosomes in histone-induced cytotoxicity and lung damage. Moreover, the expression of miR-126 was increased in exosomes from histone-exposed ADSCs. Remarkably, the inhibition of miR-126 in ADSCs failed to increase Akt phosphorylation in histone-exposed HUVECs.

In Klra17-/- bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), CpG-induced cell death was accompanied by increased cathepsin B leakage from the vesicular compartments into the cytoplasm. Concurrently, IL-1 secretion increased in the CpG-treated Klra17-/- BMDCs, strongly suggesting that the CpG-induced cell death in these cells is pyroptotic in nature. Consistent with these observations, inhibiting cathepsin B or caspase 1 in CpG-stimulated Klra17-/- BMDCs reversed the increase in cell death. Pyroptotic cell death and IL-1 secretion were also observed in BMDCs derived from transgenic mice expressing an ITIM-less Ly49Q (Ly49Q-YF Tg). CpG also increased the IL-1 production and cell death in B2m-/- BMDCs. These results suggest that Ly49Q and MHC class I play important roles for protecting pyroptosis-like cell death of DCs by influencing lysosome state.","output":"The inhibitory NK receptor Ly49Q protects plasmacytoid dendritic cells from pyroptotic cell death."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With covid-19 cases surging and restrictions loosening in the UK, is it time for the country to start vaccinating children?

Herein, we extend the mHealth approach to patients with recent-onset AF at the emergency department (ED). In the proposed TeleWAS-AF approach, on-demand heart rate and rhythm monitoring are used to support a wait-and-see strategy at the ED. All stable patients who present to the ED with recent-onset symptomatic AF and who are able to use mHealth solutions for heart rate and rhythm monitoring are eligible for this approach. Patients will receive both education on AF and instructions on the use of the mHealth technology before discharge from the ED. A case coordinator will subsequently check whether patients are able to activate the mHealth solution and to perform heart rate and rhythm measurements. Forty hours after AF onset, the first assessment teleconsultation with the physician will take place, determining the need for delayed cardioversion. After maximal 7 days of remote monitoring, a second assessment teleconsultation may occur, in which the rhythm can be reassessed and further treatment strategy can be discussed with the patients. This on-demand mHealth prescription increases patient involvement in the care process and treatment decision-making by encouraging self-management, while avoiding excess data-load requiring work-intensive and expensive data management. Implementation of the TeleWAS-AF approach may facilitate the management of AF in the ED and reduce the burden on the ED system, which enhances the capacity for health care utilization.","output":"On-Demand Mobile Health Infrastructure for Remote Rhythm Monitoring within a Wait-and-See Strategy for Recent-Onset Atrial Fibrillation: TeleWAS-AF."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maculopapular exanthem is a commonly encountered presentation in routine clinical practice, and differentiation between its two most common etiologies, i.e., viral- and drug-induced, often poses a diagnostic dilemma.

The COVID-19 pandemic created a new threat to this common \\"slow to learn and adapt\\" model in healthcare. We describe how UPMC committed to a rapid learning health system (LHS) model to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsAn observational cohort study was conducted among 11,429 hospitalized patients from 22 hospitals (PA, NY) with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (March 19, 2020 - June 6, 2021). Sociodemographic and clinical data were captured from UPMC electronic medical record (EMR) systems. Patients were grouped into four time-defined patient \\"waves\\" based on nadir of daily hospital admissions, with wave 3 (September 20, 2020 - March 10, 2021) split at its zenith due to high volume with steep acceleration and deceleration. Outcomes included changes in clinical practice (e.g., use of corticosteroids, antivirals, and other therapies) in relation to timing of internal system analyses, scientific publications, and regulatory approvals, along with 30-day rate of mortality over time. ResultsMean (SD) daily number of hospital admissions was 26 (28) with a maximum 7-day moving average of 107 patients. System-wide implementation of the use of dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab occurred within days of release of corresponding seminal publications and regulatory actions. After adjustment for differences in patient clinical profiles over time, each month of hospital admission was associated with an estimated 5% lower odds of 30-day mortality (adjusted OR = 0.95, 95% confidence interval: 0.92 - 0.97, p < .001). ConclusionsIn our large LHS, near real-time changes in clinical management of COVID-19 patients happened promptly as scientific publications and regulatory approvals occurred throughout the pandemic.

However, it is presently unclear which interventions have been trialled to manage stress in stroke survivors and whether they translate to clinically relevant outcomes. The aim of this scoping review will be to examine stress management interventions in stroke survivors in order to map the types of interventions trialled, commonly reported stress outcome measures and whether a reduction in stress contributes to reductions in relevant clinical outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The methodological framework described in Arksey and O'Malley will be applied to this review. A draft search strategy was developed in collaboration with an experienced senior health research librarian. A systematic search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane library, PsycInfo and Clinicaltrials.gov as well as hand searching of reference lists and reviews will identify relevant studies for inclusion. To be eligible for inclusion, studies must report on the outcomes of an intervention targeting stress management and resilience in stroke survivors. Study selection and critical appraisal of selected studies will be carried out independently by two authors, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Data will be charted using a standard extraction form. Results will be tabulated and narratively summarised to highlight findings relevant to our research questions and to inform recommendations for future research. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study does not require ethics approval. This scoping review will provide a synthesis of evidence for stress management interventions in stroke survivors. It will identify and clarify the gaps in stress research specific to stroke pathologies and highlight promising interventions for future research.

Preliminary data show that inhaled anaesthetics reduce lung inflammation, time to extubation and intensive care unit length of stay compared with intravenous sedatives. However, the impact of inhaled anaesthetics on cognitive and psychiatric outcomes is not well described in this setting. Randomised controlled trials are underway to establish if inhaled anaesthetics affect these and other patient and health system outcomes. Our aim is to summarise the known effects of inhaled sedatives on cognitive and psychiatric outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this systematic review, we will use MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO to identify studies from 1970 to 2021 that assessed cognitive and psychiatric outcomes in critically ill adult patients sedated with inhaled anaesthetics. We will include case series, observational and cohort studies and randomised controlled trials. We will exclude case studies due to the heterogeneity of reporting in these studies. For randomised controlled trials comparing inhaled to intravenous sedation, we will report cognitive and psychiatric outcomes for both study arms.

A total of 139 infections were included: 88 severe infections (63%) (defined as >10% FEV1 loss at infection) and 51 mild infections (37%) (&#8804;10% FEV1 loss). Overall postinfection CLAD incidence was 20%. Associations were estimated on postinfection FEV1 for ribavirin vs no ribavirin (+13.2% [95% CI: 7.79; 18.67]) and severe vs mild infection (-11.1% [95% CI: -14.76; -7.37]).

It is unclear whether pregnant women manifest enhanced disease similar to influenza viral infection or whether specific risk factors might predispose to severe disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe maternal disease and obstetrical outcomes associated with coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy to rapidly inform clinical care. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of pregnant patients with a laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from 6 hospital systems in Washington State between Jan. 21, 2020, and April 17, 2020. Demographics, medical and obstetrical history, and coronavirus disease 2019 encounter data were abstracted from medical records. RESULTS: A total of 46 pregnant patients with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were identified from hospital systems capturing 40% of births in Washington State. Nearly all pregnant individuals with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were symptomatic (93.5%, n=43) and the majority were in their second or third trimester (43.5% [n=20] and 50.0% [n=23], respectively). Symptoms resolved in a median of 24 days (interquartile range, 13-37). Notably, 7 women were hospitalized (16%) including 1 admitted to the intensive care unit. A total of 6 cases (15%) were categorized as severe coronavirus disease 2019 with nearly all patients being either overweight or obese before pregnancy or with asthma or other comorbidities. Of the 8 deliveries that occurred during the study period, there was 1 preterm birth at 33 weeks' gestation to improve pulmonary status in a woman with class III obesity, and 1 stillbirth of unknown etiology. CONCLUSION: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 developed in approximately 15% of pregnant patients and occurred primarily in overweight or obese women with underlying conditions. Obesity and coronavirus disease 2019 may synergistically increase risk for a medically indicated preterm birth to improve maternal pulmonary status in late pregnancy. These findings support categorizing pregnant patients as a higher-risk group, particularly those with chronic comorbidities.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 46 pregnant women with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Washington State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New Ebselen-like derivatives resulted to be very strong in vitro inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. We demonstrated that this activity mainly depends on the electrophilicity of the selenium atom that is considerably higher in the N-substituted 1,2- benzoselenazol-3(2H)-ones respect to the corresponding diselenides allowing it to be rapidly attached by free thiols affording sulfur-selenium intermediates that are further subjected to thiol exchange processes. This data paints a very complex scenario that requires us to consider Ebselen and Ebselen-like derivatives as potential electrophilic substrates for the several other free thiols present in the cell beside the target free cysteine. The sulfur selenium intermediates are milder electrophiles that could be theoretically implicated in both the detoxification process as well as in the final enzymatic inhibition. We here demonstrated that the in vitro inhibition activity is not fully reproduced in the prevention of viral replication in the cell-based assay. This indicates that the structure of the substituents introduced in the Ebselen scaffold is a crucial factor to control the reactivity of the selenated molecule in the network of thiol exchanges, as well as for molecular recognition of the targeted enzymatic cysteine. For this reason, an in-depth investigation is strongly desirable to better understand how to increase the activity and the selectivity of Ebselen derivatives overcoming the issues of the apparent PAINS-like role of Ebselen. Furthermore, besides the antiviral activity, thee selected compounds also showed a different ability to reduce the virus-induced cytopathic effect, indicating that other mechanisms could be implicated.

In vaccinated group, the first injection time of vaccination ranged from July to November 2020, and 10 cases received two doses of vaccine simultaneously and 10 cases received two doses of vaccine at intervals of 14-57 days. The intervals between the completion of vaccination and the onset ranged from 87 days to 224 days. The differences in classification and clinical type between the two groups were significant. Significant differences were observed in case classification and clinical type between vaccinated group and unvaccinated group (P<0.05). The vaccinated group had a relatively high proportion of asymptomatic infections (40.00%, 8/20), while mild infections were mainly observed in the unvaccinated group(76.36%,42/55). The differences in Ct values (ORF1ab gene and N gene) at the diagnosis were not significant between vaccinated group and unvaccinated group (P>0.05), similar results were also observed in lymphocyte subtypes, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein level comparisons. Serum amyloid A level was higher in unvaccinated group than in vaccinated group (P<0.05). However, the SARS-CoV-2 related serum antibody of IgM, IgG and total antibody levels were significantly higher in vaccinated group (P<0.05). Conclusions: Risk of infection still exists with SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination, which can facilitate the production of specific serum antibody of IgM and IgG when people are exposed to the virus. It has a certain protective effect on SARS-CoV-2 infected persons. Vaccination can reduce the clinical symptoms and mitigate disease severity.","output":"[Influence of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of imported COVID-19 cases in Chengdu]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) becomes a global pandemic in 2020.

Multisystemic laboratory abnormalities were observed on admission for severe-critically ill patients. These patients showed more noticeable radiologic abnormalities and more coexisting health issues as compared to the mild-moderate patients. Most of the severe-critically ill COVID-19 patients became deteriorated in 2 weeks after diagnosis. Age, D-dimer, and lymphocytes were independently associated with the progression of severe-critically illness.

At Kaiser Permanente, we implemented a program wherein health care providers drawn from multiple disciplines perform daily telemedicine check-ins on COVID-19 patients, allowing us to both maintain social distancing and make use of providers in specialties who otherwise may have had lower in-clinic volumes. Methods: Kaiser Permanente patients testing positive for COVID-19 between March and October 2020 were referred to our program. Physicians and nurses (RNs) were invited to participate in our program and were trained using Microsoft Teams&#8482; meetings. Patients receive daily phone calls by a physician or RN. Select patients receive portable pulse oximeter devices based on standardized criteria incorporating age and comorbidities. When patients are determined to be clinically stable, they are discharged back to their primary care physician for ongoing management. Results: Descriptive results for the virtual home care program (VHCP) are reported through October 2020, though these results do not represent a planned statistical analysis. Forty-two percent of the patients were male, 43% were black, and 30% were Hispanic. The most common comorbidities of patients in our program were obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2; 35%), followed by hypertension (32%) and diabetes mellitus (19%). Then, 8.2% of patients ultimately required hospital admission. Mortality rate for patients in our program was 1.33%. Discussion: Our program was able to provide virtual care for thousands of COVID-19 positive Kaiser members in the Washington, DC, and Baltimore Metro regions.

All patients were on mechanical ventilation and full telemetery. Results: No drug-related serious adverse events were seen. Hypotension was seen in association with two infusions and diarrhea in association with one, but did not necessitate cessation of therapy. Bigeminy was seen in association with one infusion without sequelae. Seven of eight patients demonstrated a successful course during intensive care and were successfully removed from mechanical ventilation and discharged from intensive care. The eighth patient succumbed to purulent secretions in the lungs. Of those who were discharged from the ICU, six demonstrated successful 30 day survival. The seventh died from a cerebral infract at day 30, deemed unrelated to treatment with VIP. Serum levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor  were obtained in 6 patients at baseline and 24 hours and were seen to decrease with treatment in five patients. Conclusions: Initial clinical results of treatment with VIP in patients with ARDS demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous studies in normal volunteers. The successful clinical course seen in 7 of 8 patients in the setting of an expected 50% survival may suggest that VIP shows promise in the treatment of other infectious conditions that damage the pulmonary epithelium, particularly COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to perform a subgroup analysis of angiographic and clinical outcomes of medium-sized aneurysms in the HELPS trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with medium-sized aneurysms (5-9.9 mm) were selected from the HELPS trial. Outcomes compared between the HydroCoil and bare-platinum groups included the following: 1) any recurrence, 2) major recurrence, 3) retreatment, and 4) mRS score of 2. Subgroup analysis by rupture status was performed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for aneurysm neck size, shape, use of adjunctive device, and rupture status was performed. RESULTS Two hundred eighty-eight patients with medium-sized aneurysms were randomized (144 in each group). At 15-18 months posttreatment, the major recurrence rate was significantly lower in the HydroCoil group than in controls (18.6% versus 30.8%, P = .03, respectively). For patients with recently ruptured aneurysms, the major recurrence rate was significantly lower for the HydroCoil group than for controls (20.3% versus 47.5%, P = .003), while rates were similar between groups for unruptured aneurysms (16.7% versus 14.8%, P = .80). Multivariate analysis of patients with recently ruptured aneurysms demonstrated a lower odds of major recurrence with HydroCoils (OR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.12-0.58; P = .0007). No difference in retreatment rates or mRS of 2 was seen between groups. CONCLUSIONS HydroCoils were associated with statistically significant and clinically relevant lower rates of major recurrence for recently ruptured, medium-sized aneurysms in the HELPS trial. Because this was not a prespecified subgroup analysis, these results should not alter clinical practice but, rather, provide insight into the design of future clinical trials comparing bare platinum with second-generation coils.","output":"HydroCoils reduce recurrence rates in recently ruptured medium-sized intracranial aneurysms: a subgroup analysis of the HELPS trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increased interest to effectively deliver educational curricula remotely to diverse student populations.

Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) Willed Body Program, supplements case-based learning and promotes student exploration and engagement equally in cross-cultural cohorts represented by American and Turkish medical students. Virtual case-based learning activities were developed and presented to American medical students at JABSOM and Turkish medical students, selected based on education and English proficiency, via Zoom. Subject, medical history, and physical exam data were presented to students who were then divided into breakout rooms where hypotheses regarding cadaveric, neurological findings were generated. Students then reviewed radiology and pathology reports and accessed relevant 3D segmented, photogrammetric and illustrative models. An optional survey was completed to evaluate student opinion based on a 5-point Likert scale. Comparisons between groups were performed using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Data was reported as mean, median (min-max), and percentile. Significant differences (two-tailed P) less than 0.05 were significant. Results revealed significant differences between American (n=40) and Turkish (n=16) student opinion. The Turkish scale was significantly higher when asked if MRI scans of cadavers were useful as online learning tools (p =0.002), if MRI scans of cadavers provided an understanding of relevant anatomy (p&lt;0.001), if 3D models provided a better understanding of anatomical relationships (p&lt;0.001), whether students would like more interactive sessions using MRI scans (p&lt;0.001), and if students would use similar resources in the future (p&lt;0.001). The American scale was higher when asked if students were able to communicate effectively with their breakout groups (p=0.037). The learning activity was positively received by both cohorts as shown by no average score less than a 4 out of 5 for each question. The American scales may have been lower due to having previous experience with similar activities, whereas the learning activity was novel and exciting to Turkish students. Differences in communicating effectively in breakout rooms can be explained by the fact that American students were broken into longitudinal dissection groups, whereas Turkish students were randomly assigned. Based on these results, case-based learning, utilizing MRI and XR technology, enhances the learning experience of medical students and can be expanded to cross-cultural student populations.","output":"Cross-cultural classroom: Virtual case-based learning utilizing MRI and extended-reality technology delivered to American and Turkish medical students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Around 10 % of the bariatric surgery patients experience postoperative complications (<30 days). It could be hypothesized that complications influence postoperative weight loss, which is one of the most important endpoints of bariatric surgery. Therefore, this study inventoried the effect of complications on postoperative weight loss. METHODS A consecutive database including patients who were operated from November 2007 onwards was retrospectively reviewed. All short-term complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Weight loss was assessed at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS A total of 1130 patients underwent either primary (n = 907, 80.3 %) or revisional (n = 233, 19.7 %) surgery till October 2013. Short-term complications occurred in 115 (10.2 %) patients, of whom 48 (41.7 %) had a severe (Clavien-Dindo  3) complication. One year post surgery, 184 patients (16.3 %) were lost to follow-up. Patients with a short-term complication had a higher percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) at 6 months (58.6 (SD 16.6) versus 52.9 (SD 17.6), p = 0.003) and 1 year (71.9 (SD 22.3) versus 65.9 (SD 21.3), p = 0.017) of follow-up. Although a trend was seen toward higher BMI loss and total weight loss (TWL) after 6 months, no effect was seen 1 year postoperatively. In multivariable linear regression analysis, complications were not a significant predictor for 1-year %EWL. CONCLUSIONS Although short-term complications alter 1-year %EWL, no effect was seen on BMI loss and TWL. In addition, complications were not a predictor in a multivariable linear regression model for 1-year %EWL.

Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed the replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in cultured cells. The 90% effective concentration (EC(90)) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 M. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide suppressed the replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. Under a microscope, the viral RNA replication-transcription complex in cells, which is thought to be detectable using antibodies specific for nsp3 and double-stranded RNA, was observed to fall in the presence of ciclesonide in a concentration-dependent manner. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. New and effective antiviral agents that combat the disease are needed urgently. Here, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide, suppresses the replication of coronaviruses, including betacoronaviruses (murine hepatitis virus type 2 [MHV-2], MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alphacoronavirus (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E]), in cultured cells. Ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family.

For insights, we review health insurance moral hazard, agricultural infectious disease policy, and deterrence theory, but find that classic enforcement strategies of punishing noncompliant people are stymied. One mechanism is for policymakers to indemnify individuals for losses associated with taking those socially desirable behaviors to reduce the spread.

However, it was impossible to consistently detect the low levels of these organisms which were suspected to be present in endemic infections. Application of highly sensitive real-time PCR and ELISA methods for detection of Chlamydophila spp. DNA and of antibodies against Chlamydophila spp., respectively, in a series of prospective cohort studies revealed a high prevalence of Chlamydophila spp. genital infections in female calves (61%) and adult heifers (53%).

Such infections proceed without apparent disease or with only subtle expressions of disease, but potentially have a large impact on bovine herd health and fertility.","output":"Bovine Chlamydophila spp. infection: Do we underestimate the impact on fertility?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hallux valgus (HV) defines a valgo deviation from the metatarsophalangeal joint and in a varo of the first metatarsal. The surgery aims to restore joint congruence, correct deformity and decrease pain. There is little literature on the results in the geriatric population. The purpose of this study is intended to demonstrate that the open surgical technique of Lelivre and Vidalot achieves acceptable radiographic results in that population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 68 patients between 60 and 85 years of age were involved with Lelivre Technique and Vidalot for moderate to severe HV of Isham, between January 2014 and January 2017. Immediate postoperative and six month radiographs were evaluated with conventional radiometry for this condition; All measurements were made in digital system. The data was entered in Microsoft Excel. p values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Out of 68 patients (54 women and 14 men), average age 68.0 years. 12 had bilateral concern. 28 second finger claw. The metatarsphasopalangic angle with a preoperative mean was 36.6o, increased by 100% of cases of intermetatarsal angle 1-2, with a correlation p 0.05 between intermetatarsal angle and metatarsal angle increase.

Microplastics accumulate in the bodies of living organisms and adversely affect them. In this study, a new method for the rapid detection of microplastics using peptides was proposed. Among the various types of plastics distributed in the ocean, polystyrene and polypropylene were selected. The binding affinity of the hydrophobic peptides suitable for each type of plastic was evaluated. The binding affinities of peptides were confirmed in unoxidized plastics and plasma-oxidized plastics in deionised or 3.5% saline water. Also, the detection of microplastics in small animals' intestine extracts were possible with the reported peptide biosensors. We expect plastic-binding peptides to be used in sensors to increase the detection efficiency of microplastics and potentially help separate microplastics from seawater.","output":"Sensitive and specific capture of polystyrene and polypropylene microplastics using engineered peptide biosensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the late 90s, the way companies acquire novel ideas and bring resulting products to the market is in a paradigm shift moving towards open innovation concepts and making use of crowd-based approaches.

However, incidence might be affected by lower testing rates among vulnerable populations. We aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence, disease severity, and neutralising antibody activity after infection among people with and without HIV receiving care in a county hospital system over a 3-month period. METHODS: In this matched case-control observational study, remnant serum samples were collected between Aug 1 and Oct 31, 2020, from all people living with HIV who underwent routine outpatient laboratory testing in a municipal health-care system (San Francisco General Hospital, CA, USA). Samples from people living with HIV were date of collection-matched (same day) and age-matched (5 years) to samples from randomly selected adults (aged 18 years or older) without HIV receiving care for chronic conditions at the same hospital. We compared seroprevalence by HIV status via mixed-effects logistic regression models, accounting for the matched structure of the data (random effects for the matched group), adjusting for age, sex, race or ethnicity, and clinical factors (ie, history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes). Severe COVID-19 was assessed in participants with past SARS-CoV-2 (IgG or PCR) infection by chart review and compared with multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex. SARS-CoV-2 IgG, neutralising antibody titres, and antibody avidity were measured in serum of participants with previous positive PCR tests and compared with multivariable mixed-effects models, adjusting for age, sex, and time since PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: 1138 samples from 955 people living with HIV and 1118 samples from 1062 people without HIV were tested. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was 37% (95% CI 24 to 50) among people with HIV compared with 74% (57 to 92) among people without HIV (adjusted odds ratio 050, 95% CI 030 to 083). Among 31 people with HIV and 70 people without HIV who had evidence of past infection, the odds of severe COVID-19 were 552 (95% CI 101 to 6448) times higher among people living with HIV. Adjusting for time since PCR-confirmed infection, SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations were lower (percentage change -53%, 95% CI -4 to -76), pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres were lower (-67%, -25 to -86), and avidity was similar (7%, -73 to 87) among people living with HIV compared with those without HIV. INTERPRETATION: Although fewer infections were detected by SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing among people living with HIV than among those without HIV, people with HIV had more cases of severe COVID-19. Among people living with HIV with past SARS-CoV-2 infection, lower IgG concentrations and pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres might reflect a diminished serological response to infection, and the similar avidity could be driven by similar time since infection.

The analysis uses two waves of survey data: one fielded prior to the pandemic in November 2019, and the other fielded during the pandemic in April 2020. The surveys polled a combined 1,500 hiring managers which includes executives, VPs, and managers- so the results reflect the views and plans of those with direct influence over businesses remote work decisions. In short, these results provide before and after snapshots of how relevant decision makers view the remote work experiment so far and how it has affected their plans.

Methods: In ADVANCE (NCT03105128) and MOTIVATE (NCT03104413), patients with moderately to severely active CD and intolerance or inadequate response to conventional and/or biologic therapy (ADVANCE) or to biologic therapy (MOTIVATE) received intravenous (IV) RZB induction therapy or placebo (PBO) for 12 weeks. Patients achieving clinical response to IV RZB induction were re-randomised in a maintenance study (FORTIFY, NCT03105102) to receive subcutaneous (SC) RZB or SC PBO (ie, withdrawal) for 52 weeks. This post hoc analysis included patients who received RZB 600 mg IV in either ADVANCE or MOTIVATE and patients who received RZB 360 mg SC in FORTIFY. Clinical and endoscopic outcomes were evaluated in patient subgroups stratified by CD location at baseline (ileal only, colonic only, ileal-colonic) using non-responder imputation incorporating multiple imputation to handle missing data due to COVID-19. Results: At week 12, significantly greater proportions of patients receiving RZB 600 mg IV achieved the co-primary endpoints CD Activity Index (CDAI) clinical remission and endoscopic response vs PBO in the colonic only (n = 190) and ileal-colonic (n = 252) subgroups (P < .001;Figure 1A-1B).

It shapes how economists think about the purpose and functioning of the system as a whole. I identify three approaches to understanding value in economics: the British classical approach, exemplified by Smith and Ricardo, the neoclassical approach based on marginal utility theory, and Marxian value theory. The classical and neoclassical tradition explain exchange value by transhistorical use values. This gives rise to a conception of capitalism as a real economy, i.e. a system that produces goods and services for the purpose of satisfying people's needs and wants. Ecological economists adopt and extend the classical and neoclassical view, by predominantly studying a real real economy, i.e. matter-energy stocks and flows and ultimate social outcomes. This allows an ecological critique of the economic process but fails to address underlying social drivers of ecological destruction. Marxian value theory provides a systemic (macro) understanding of value, which results in a realistic conception of capitalism as a monetary market economy. Marx's approach is the only value theory in economics that provides a fundamental critique of capitalism.

There is a need to characterize the complexity of mutant spectra in coronaviruses sampled from infected patients. In particular, the possible relationship between SARS-CoV-2 mutant spectrum complexity and disease associations has not been established. In the present study, we report an ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) analysis of the mutant spectrum of amplicons from the nsp12 (polymerase)- and spike (S)-coding regions of thirty nasopharyngeal isolates (diagnostic samples) of SARS-CoV-2 of the first COVID-19 pandemic wave (Madrid, Spain, April 2020) classified according to the severity of ensuing COVID-19. Low frequency mutations and deletions, counted relative to the consensus sequence of the corresponding isolate, were overwhelmingly abundant. We show that the average number of different point mutations, mutations per haplotype and several diversity indices was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients who developed mild disease than in those associated with moderate or severe disease (exitus). No such bias was observed with RNA deletions. Location of amino acid substitutions in the three dimensional structures of nsp12 (polymerase) and S suggest significant structural or functional effects. Thus, patients who develop mild symptoms may be a richer source of genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 than patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. IMPORTANCE The study shows that mutant spectra of SARS-CoV-2 from diagnostic samples differ in point mutation abundance and complexity, and that significantly larger values were observed in virus from patients who developed mild COVID-19 symptoms. Mutant spectrum complexity is not a uniform trait among isolates. The nature and location of low frequency amino acid substitutions present in mutant spectra anticipate great potential for phenotypic diversification of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Point Mutation and Deletion Spectra, and Their Association with Different Disease Outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated rapid changes in medical practice. Many of these changes may add value to care, creating opportunities going forward. OBJECTIVE: To provide an evidence-informed, expert-derived review of genitourinary cancer care moving forward following the initial COVID-19 pandemic. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A collaborative narrative review was conducted using literature published through May 2020 (PubMed), which comprised three main topics: reduced in-person interactions arguing for increasing virtual and image-based care, optimisation of the delivery of care, and the effect of COVID-19 in health care facilities on decision-making by patients and their families. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Patterns of care will evolve following the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine, virtual care, and telemonitoring will increase and could offer broader access to multidisciplinary expertise without increasing costs. Comprehensive and integrative telehealth solutions will be necessary, and should consider patients mental health and access differences due to socioeconomic status. Investigations and treatments will need to maximise efficiency and minimise health care interactions. Solutions such as one stop clinics, day case surgery, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and oral or less frequent drug dosing will be preferred. The pandemic necessitated a triage of those patients whose treatment should be expedited, delayed, or avoided, and may persist with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in circulation. Patients whose demographic characteristics are at the highest risk of complications from COVID-19 may re-evaluate the benefit of intervention for less aggressive cancers. Clinical research will need to accommodate virtual care and trial participation. Research dissemination and medical education will increasingly utilise virtual platforms, limiting in-person professional engagement; ensure data dissemination; and aim to enhance patient engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic will have lasting effects on the delivery of health care. These changes offer opportunities to improve access, delivery, and the value of care for patients with genitourinary cancers but raise concerns that physicians and health administrators must consider in order to ensure equitable access to care. PATIENT SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the care provided to many patients with genitourinary cancers. This has necessitated a transition to telemedicine, changes in threshold or delays in many treatments, and an opportunity to reimagine patient care to maintain safety and improve value moving forward.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Genitourinary Cancer Care: Re-envisioning the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter examines the journey of Magical Realism to India through a comparative reading of Indian and Latin American fictional works that share several similar aesthetic and stylistic features as well as political and ideological agendas.

The authors evaluated their initial experience using novel needlescopic VATS wedge resection combined with the subcostal trans-diaphragmatic (SCTD) approach for managing undetermined peripheral pulmonary nodules. METHODS Between 2009 and 2012, 35 patients who had 36 operations underwent needlescopic VATS wedge pulmonary resection with the SCTD approach. Preoperative percutaneous CT-guided marking of the nodule was performed. Two 3-mm miniports were placed in the thorax for the thoracoscopic camera and minigrasper. Just anterior to the 10th rib, a 2-cm subcostal incision was made, and a 12- or 15-mm port was placed trans-diaphragmatically into the chest cavity. Wedge resection of the lung was performed with endostaplers introduced through a subcostal port. RESULTS The median tumor size was 1.1 cm. Localization of the tumor was widely distributed. The mean operation time was 51 min, and the mean blood loss was 4.2 mL. No patients required conversion to thoracotomy, and one patient required conversion to conventional VATS. Additional thoracic ports were placed in five patients, and the needlescopic incision was extended to 15 mm in one patient. The median duration of chest drainage was 1 day. Additional analgesia was not required for 22 patients and was used for less than 1 day for three patients, less than 2 days for seven patients, and less than 3 days for seven patients. The pathologic diagnosis of the nodules was malignant for 28 patients and benign for 8 patients. On postoperative day 7 or at admission, 34 patients were free of postoperative neuralgia.

Thus, this study was designed to contribute to proper planning of COVID-19 intervention measures among taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 417 taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town during July to August, 2020. The data was collected using a structured questionnaire and an observational checklist. The collected data was checked, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. The outcome variables of this study were good or poor knowledge, positive or negative attitude and good or poor frequent hand hygiene practices towards COVID-19. Bivariate (Crude Odds Ratio [COR]) and multivariable (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]) logistic regression analysis were employed to identify factors significantly associated with good knowledge, positive attitude and good frequent hand hygiene practices among taxi drivers. Significance level of variables was declared at a p < 0.05 from the adjusted analysis. MAIN FINDINGS: Out of the total 417 taxi drivers, 69.8% [95% CI: 65.2C73.9], 67.6% [95%CI: 63.1C72.2] and 66.4% [95% CI: 62.1C71.0] of the drivers had good knowledge, positive attitude and good frequent hand hygiene practices, respectively. Educational level (AOR = 7.55, 95% CI = 4.55C12.54), place of residence (AOR = 5.41, 95% CI = 1.4C20.08) and attitude towards COVID-19 prevention (AOR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.02C2.74) were factors associated with good knowledge about COVID-19. Further, age of taxi drivers greater than 30 years (AOR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.76C5.13), educational level of secondary or above (AOR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.88C5.31), income (AOR = 3.36, 95% CI = 1.48C7.61), and knowledge about COVID-19 (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.21C3.54) were factors associated with positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention.

An improvement in the mental state of patients during psychotropic therapy is associated with an 11.11-fold decrease in the risk of poor outcome of coronavirus infection (HR 0.09;95% CI 0.01-0.76;p=0.027). Delirium is a predictor of low patient survival, especially in prolonged hospitalizations (HR 4.55;95% CI 1.66-12.48;p=0.003). The severity of coronavirus infection makes the greatest contribution to the poor outcome: the risk of death increases by 33.17 times (CR 33.17;95% CI 4.01-274.65;p<0.001). The severity of the mental disorder had a greater impact on the risk of death compared with age, increasing it by 4.55 times (p=0.003). Conclusion. We found significant differences between the groups of deceased and surviving patients with COVID-19 concerning the variables related to certain mental disorders, their severity and dynamics, and the severity of coronavirus infection. In addition, the age of the patients had a significant impact on the prognosis of COVID-19. The results reflect the special prognostic significance of delirium in the structure of mental disorders developing in patients with coronavirus infection.","output":"Impact of mental disorders on COVID-19 outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Complex ventral hernia repair can be challenging despite the recent advances in surgical techniques. Here, we aimed to examine the effectiveness of preoperative combined use of botulinum toxin A (BTA) and preoperative progressive pneumoperitoneum (PPP) for surgical preparation of patients with complex ventral hernia. Methods: In this prospective, observational study, we included 22 patients with complex ventral hernia between January 2018 and May 2021. All patients were treated with BTA injections into the lateral abdominal muscles and PPP before hernia repair. The lengths of abdominal wall muscles, the volumes of the incisional hernia (VIH), the volumes of the abdominal cavity (VAC), and the VIH/VAC ratio were measured before and after BTA and PPP using abdominal CT scan. All Hernias were repaired using laparoscopic intra-peritoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) or laparoscopic-open-laparoscopic (LOL) techniques. Results: Imaging showed a significant increase in the mean lateral abdominal muscle length from 13.1 to 17.2 cm/side (p < 0.01). Before and after BTA and PPP, the mean VIH was 894 cc and 1209 cc (P < 0.01), and the mean VAC was 6,692 cc and 9,183 cc (P < 0.01). The VAC increased by 2,491 cc (P < 0.01) and was greater than the mean VIH before PPP. An average reduction of 0.9% of the VIH/VAC ratio after BTA and PPP was obtained (p > 0.05). All hernias were surgically reduced with mesh, hernia recurrence occurred in only two patients.

In patients with COVID-19, the mechanisms lead to thrombocytopenia seems to be multifactorial. Thrombotic consumption of platelets in microvasculature, cytokine release, sepsis, and drug induced, direct infection of megakaryocytes and autoimmune destruction of platelets are the leading etiologies in COVID-19 and thrombocytopenia. In this overview, the research was conducted by screening the relevant articles evaluating the COVID-19 associated thrombocytopenia in children. An electronic search was performed in online databases of Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science and Medline (via PubMed) with English language from December 2019 up to September 2020. Thrombocytopenia at admission in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is common, but delayed phase thrombocytopenia (occurring 2 weeks after beginning of symptoms) is uncertain. The delayed phase thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 is more prevalent in infected case with low lymphocyte count at admission and has a significant correlation with higher mortality rate. In majority of cases with COVID-19 and thrombocytopenia, the platelet count is mildly decreased. Severe thrombocytopenia or a prompt decline in number of platelets often indicates immune mediated thrombocytopenia or in late terminal stages of this infection. Thrombocytopenia is a significant finding in patients with severe type of COVID -19. Immune mediated platelet destruction might account for the delayed-phase thrombocytopenia in a group of patients, and can manifest as severe thrombocytopenia.

Pandemics are very low-probability events associated with deep uncertainty about the timing of such events and ensuing damages. National policy-makers generally rely on a set of risk indices associated with natural disasters and pandemics to assess the country's vulnerability and strategy formulation for such rare events. This paper explores the efficacy of early warning systems (disasters and epidemics-based risk ratings) in predicting the country-level exposure to COVID-19. Utilizing three real data-sets reflecting the risk exposure of individual countries to disasters, epidemics, and COVID-19, we explore relations among the associated risk dimensions, namely hazard and exposure, vulnerability, and lack of coping capacity. A comprehensive methodology integrating Pearson's correlation, ANOVA, and Bayesian Belief Networks-based techniques is adopted to explore and triangulate relations among the three risk indices. Results show that the risk ratings associated with epidemic risk and COVID-19 risk are statistically strongly correlated. However, only the vulnerability dimension of epidemic risk significantly influences the two risks.","output":"Efficacy of early warning systems in assessing country-level risk exposure to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high degree of parallelism of todays computing systems often requires executing applications and their tasks in parallel due to a limited scaling capability of individual applications. In such scenarios, considering the differing importance of applications while scheduling tasks is done by assigning priorities to the tasks. However, priorities may lead to starvation in highly utilized systems. A solution is offered by aging mechanisms that raise the priority of long waiting tasks. As modern systems are often dynamic in nature, we developed a two-level aging mechanism and analyzed its effect in the context of 6 dynamic scheduling algorithms for heterogeneous systems. In the context of task scheduling, aging refers to a method that increases the priority of a task over its lifetime. We used a task-based runtime system to evaluate the mechanism on a real system in two scenarios. The results show a speed up of the average total makespan in 9 out of 12 conducted experiments when aging is used with the cost of additional waiting time for the applications/jobs with higher priority. However, the job/application with the highest priority is still finished first in all cases. Considering the scheduling algorithms, Minimum Completion Time, Sufferage, and Relative Cost benefit in both experiments by the aging mechanism.

Here, we report our intubation team experience and activity as well as patient outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The MERIT members followed a protocolized early tracheal intubation model. Over a seven-week period during the peak of the pandemic, prospective data were collected on MERIT activity, COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis in the team members, and demographic, procedural, and clinical outcomes of patients. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 150 primary tracheal intubation episodes, with 101 (67.3%) of those occurring in men, and with a mean (standard deviation) age of 55.7 (13.8) yr. Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups accounted for 55.7% of patients. 91.3% of tracheal intubations were performed with videolaryngoscopy, and the first pass success rate was 88.0%. The 30-day survival was 69.2%, and the median [interquartile range] length of critical care stay was 11 [6-20] days and of hospital stay was 12 [7-22] days. Seven (11.1%) MERIT healthcare professionals self-isolated because of COVID-19 symptoms, with a total 41 days of clinical work lost. There was one reported incident of a breach of personal protective equipment and multiple anecdotal reports of doffing breaches.

Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals. COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogrens syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Stills disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens. Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used. Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices.

In this paper, we investigate properties of $R_e$ for a modified SEIR model of COVID-19 in the city of Houston, TX USA, in which the population is divided into low-risk and high-risk subpopulations. The response of $R_e$ to two types of control measures (testing and distancing) applied to the two different subpopulations is characterized. A nonlinear cost model is used for control measures, to include the effects of diminishing returns. We propose three types of heuristic strategies for mitigating COVID-19 that are targeted at reducing $R_e$, and we exhibit the tradeoffs between strategy implementation costs and number of deaths. We also consider two variants of each type of strategy: basic strategies, which consider only the effects of controls on $R_e$, without regard to subpopulation; and high-risk prioritizing strategies, which maximize control of the high-risk subpopulation. Results showed that of the three heuristic strategy types, the most cost-effective involved setting a target value for $R_e$ and applying sufficient controls to attain that target value. This heuristic led to strategies that begin with strict distancing of the entire population, later followed by increased testing. Strategies that maximize control on high-risk individuals were less cost-effective than basic strategies that emphasize reduction of the rate of spreading of the disease.

This prospective study was initiated to investigate if such an association exists for COVID-19. In this cohort study performed at Ankara University, 132 COVID-19 patients (56 asymptomatic, 51 mild-intermediate, and 25 patients with severe disease) were genotyped for KIR and ligands. Ankara University Donor Registry (n:449) KIR data was used for comparison. Clinical parameters (age, gender, comorbidities, blood group antigens, inflammation biomarkers) and KIR genotypes across cohorts of asymptomatic, mild-intermediate, or severe disease were compared to construct a risk prediction model based on multivariate binary logistic regression analysis with backward elimination method. Age, blood group, number of comorbidities, CRP, D-dimer, and telomeric and centromeric KIR genotypes (tAA, tAB1, and cAB1) along with their cognate ligands were found to differ between cohorts. Two prediction models were constructed; both included age, number of comorbidities, and blood group. Inclusion of the KIR genotypes in the second prediction model exp (-3.52 + 1.56 age group - 2.74 blood group (type A vs others) + 1.26 number of comorbidities - 2.46 tAB1 with ligand + 3.17 tAA with ligand) increased the predictive performance with a 92.9% correct classification for asymptomatic and 76% for severe cases (AUC: 0.93; P < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.88, 0.99).

Through them, interactive and sensory experiences are created developing educational and training spaces, which constitute pedagogical mediators that help teachers make their virtual classes more innovative, creating the interest of their students. This article describes the interactive museums as pedagogical mediators that propose a fusion of knowledge and new experiences, which transport the student to a cultural environment fostering the interest of interacting, knowing and visiting museums;in this way they can renew and create new interactive and innovative experiences. Through interactive museums, it is intended to promote a different learning dynamic, and at the same time improve the students disposition to receive new knowledge. This proposal contributes to the teaching-learning process with the use of innovative, interactive teaching resources that are at the same time consistent with the current environment in which children grow up. It is relevant to be able to encourage teachers to apply new educational strategies supported by technology, and thereby enrich their teaching management, achieve better teaching results with their students and seek other interrelationships. The study is also consistent and timely with current times, as teachers and students continue to interact in a virtual mode.

Thus, it is unclear whether these findings translate to older individuals and with longer administration periods. OBJECTIVE: Extending previous work, this study investigated the safety and tolerability of chronic intranasal OT in generally healthy older men. METHODS: Data were from a randomized, placebo (P)-controlled, double-blind clinical trial evaluating the effects of 4 weeks of self-administered intranasal OT (24 IU twice daily) in older adults with no major physical or cognitive impairments. Heart rate, blood pressure, urine osmolality, and serum metabolic biomarkers were obtained before and at the end of the intervention. AEs were collected during the first 3 weeks and 1 week after cessation of treatment. RESULTS: Of 103 participants recruited, 95 were randomized and received the intervention (OT = 49, P = 46). OT had no significant impact on cardiovascular, urine, or serum measures. The AEs reported for both treatments were generally mild and few in number, though one participant assigned to OT and two assigned to P dropped out due to AEs. Relative to P, OT did not significantly increase the likelihood of reporting AEs, nor the number or severity of AEs reported. CONCLUSION: Chronic intranasal OT appears safe and well-tolerated in generally healthy older men.

METHODS: Through a qualitative synthesis of evidence, this systematic scoping review aims to: identify EIS for AMR surveillance that operate across human, animal and environmental health sectors; describe their technical characteristics and capabilities; and assess whether there is evidence for the effectiveness of the various EIS for AMR surveillance. Studies and reports between 1 January 2000 and 21 July 2021 from peer-reviewed and grey literature in the English language were included. RESULTS: 26 studies and reports were included in the final review, of which 27 EIS were described. None of the EIS integrated AMR data in a One Health approach across all three sectors. While there was a lack of evidence of thorough evaluations of the effectiveness of the identified EIS, several surveillance system effectiveness indicators were reported for most EIS. Standardised reporting of the effectiveness of EIS is recommended for future publications. The capabilities of the EIS varied in their technical design features, in terms of usability, data display tools and desired outputs. EIS that included interactive features, and geospatial maps are increasingly relevant for future trends in AMR data analytics.

Four chemiluminescence immunoassay systems, including seven IgM/IgG antibody detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 (A_IgM, A_IgG, B_IgM, B_IgG, C_IgM, C_IgG and D_Ab), were employed to detect antibody concentrations. The chi-square test, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Youden's index were determined to verify the cut-off value of each detection system. RESULTS: The repeatability verification results of the A, B, C and D systems are all qualified. D_Ab performed best (92% sensitivity and 99.23% specificity), and B_IgM performed worse than the other systems. Except for the A_IgM and C_IgG systems, the optimal diagnostic thresholds and cut-off values of the other kits and their recommendations are inconsistent with each other.

METHODOLOGY: Two irrigation protocols - Protocol A using 2% NaOCl used 5mL/5 min and Protocol B with 2% NaOCl (5mL/5 min) followed by 17% EDTA (5mL/3 min) were used to prepare dentine. The chemical and microstructural changes following irrigation were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (n=5) on dentine obtained from the mid-root and coronal parts of extracted human teeth. Four sealers (AH Plus, BioRoot, MTA Fillapex, TotalFill) were characterized by SEM/EDS (n=3). The ability of the sealers to eradicate intratubular Enterococcus faecalis biofilms was assessed by live/dead dye and confocal laser scanning microscopy to measure the percentage of living cells. The effect of combined irrigation and root filling on the dentine was assessed by SEM and EDS analysis (n=5). Statistical analysis was undertaken using one-way ANOVA and a number of post hoc tests to detect intergroup differences. The F test was used for comparison of variances in the microbiology testing. RESULTS: The use of NaOCl alone left the smear layer seemingly intact, with traces of chlorine remaining on dentine. The use of BioRoot sealer restored the calcium ion levels of dentine which are depleted by the irrigation with EDTA. BioRoot exhibited antimicrobial properties against intratubular bacteria even in the presence of smear layer (Protocol A). The smear layer removal improved the bactericidal effect of all sealers and Ca2+ leaching. The use of a chelating agent was important for the intratubular sealer penetration for AH Plus but not the other sealers. CONCLUSION: The removal of smear layer was associated with greater penetration of AH Plus into the dentinal tubules but not for the penetration of HCSC sealers.

RESULTS: According to emerging evidence, treating obesity may be antecedent to the development and progression of T2D. While clinical benefits typically set in upon achieving a weight loss of 3C5%, these benefits are progressive leading to further health improvements, and weight loss of >15% can have a disease\\\\modifying effect in people with T2D, an outcome that up to recently could not be achieved with any blood glucose\\\\lowering pharmacotherapy. However, advanced treatment options with weight\\\\loss effects currently in development including the dual GIP/GLP\\\\1 receptor agonists may enable simultaneous achievement of individual glycemic and weight goals. CONCLUSION: Despite considerable therapeutic progress, there is still a large unmet medical need in patients with T2D who miss their individualized glycemic and weight\\\\loss targets. Nonetheless, it is to be expected that development of future therapies and their use will favourably change the scenario of weight and glucose control in T2D.","output":"Managing weight and glycaemic targets in people with type 2 diabetesHow far have we come?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Data regarding outcome of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are lacking. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective study on patients with AIH and COVID-19 from 34 centers in Europe and the Americas. We analyzed factors associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care admission, and/or death. The outcomes of patients with AIH were compared to a propensity score-matched cohort of patients without AIH but with chronic liver diseases (CLD) and COVID-19. The frequency and clinical significance of new-onset liver injury (alanine aminotransferase > 2  the upper limit of normal) during COVID-19 was also evaluated. We included 110 patients with AIH (80% female) with a median age of 49 (range, 18-85) years at COVID-19 diagnosis. New-onset liver injury was observed in 37.1% (33/89) of the patients. Use of antivirals was associated with liver injury (P = 0.041; OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.05-10.78), while continued immunosuppression during COVID-19 was associated with a lower rate of liver injury (P = 0.009; OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.71). The rates of severe COVID-19 (15.5% versus 20.2%, P = 0.231) and all-cause mortality (10% versus 11.5%, P = 0.852) were not different between AIH and non-AIH CLD. Cirrhosis was an independent predictor of severe COVID-19 in patients with AIH (P < 0.001; OR, 17.46; 95% CI, 4.22-72.13). Continuation of immunosuppression or presence of liver injury during COVID-19 was not associated with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This international, multicenter study reveals that patients with AIH were not at risk for worse outcomes with COVID-19 than other causes of CLD. Cirrhosis was the strongest predictor for severe COVID-19 in patients with AIH. Maintenance of immunosuppression during COVID-19 was not associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19 but did lower the risk for new-onset liver injury during COVID-19.","output":"Outcome of COVID-19 in Patients With Autoimmune Hepatitis: An International Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Widespread acceptance of the COVID\\\\19 vaccine will be the next important step in fighting the novel coronavirus disease. Though the Pakistani government has successfully implemented robust policies to overcome the COVID\\\\19 pandemic; however, studies assessing public intention to get COVID\\\\19 vaccination (IGCV) are limited. The aim of this study is to deal with this literature gap and has also expanded the conceptual framework of planned behaviour theory. We have introduced three new considerations (risk perceptions of the pandemic, perceived benefits of the vaccine, and unavailability of vaccine) to have a better understanding of the influencing factors that encourage or discourage public IGCV. METHODS: Results are based on a sample collected from 754 households using an inclusive questionnaire survey. Hypotheses are tested by utilizing the structural equation modelling approach. RESULTS: The results disclose that the intention factors, that is, attitude, risk perceptions of the pandemic, and perceived benefits of the vaccine, impart positive effects on public IGCV. In contrast, the cost of the vaccine and the unavailability of the vaccine have negative effects. Notably, environmental concern has an insignificant effect.

At first, fabrics were sensitized with citric acid then the formation of Cu(2)O particles was done by Fehling solution method. In second step, the cuprous oxide particles were deposited on cotton fabrics. Three different types of reducing agents with different concentrations were selected to make the Cu(2)O particles. Surface morphology and presence of metals were analysed by scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, FTIR, EDS and XRD. The antibacterial activity of cuprous oxide coated fabrics was tested against qualitative and quantitative measurements. The strongest antibacterial effect was found for the fabrics coated with cuprous oxide particles reduced with sodium hydrosulphite at 1 g/l. Furthermore, the utility of hygienic antimicrobial developed fabrics were analysed for the comfort properties regarding air permeability and stiffness. At the end, durability of coating was confirmed by measuring the antibacterial properties and SEM analysis after washing.","output":"Development of Antimicrobial Multifunctional Textiles to Avoid from Hospital-Acquired Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic corona virus situation having progressed and become intensive by the end of academic year of so there is a big question in the minds of every teacher how to assess the students in medical institutes The purpose of this review is to identify the various challenges in medical education the Universities are facing in learning, teaching and assessments and recommendations for coping strategies The mostpressing challenges that are emerging may include alternative assessments to the pen and paper assessments previously planned In conclusion no matter what learning, teaching and assessment methods are employed by the various Universities each and every student has to have an individual responsibility to be self-accountable as they need to face the future with the knowledge they gain through these professional courses as online assessments are a significant technological advancement in today's era","output":"Challenges in Medical Education on Student Learning, Teaching and Assessments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This exploratory paper aims to examine the literature on the impact of COVID-19 on safeguarding adults practice Design/methodology/approach: A literature search was carried out in recently published articles to locate literature relating to COVID-19 and safeguarding adults in the UK and internationally This included policy guidance and law, to describe the existing knowledge base, gaps in practice and areas that may require further research Findings: The findings suggest that measures to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to remote working and virtual safeguarding practice The findings highlight the need for empirical research into the impact of virtual safeguarding adults assessments and effective ways to support the needs and outcomes of those who may be at risk of or experiencing abuse and neglect while shielding, socially isolating or when working in an environment where social distancing is required Research limitations/implications: The paper is based on a review and analysis of published documents and not on other types of research Originality/value: Little is known about effective safeguarding adults practice in the era of shielding, self-isolation, social distancing and remote working The paper adds to the body of knowledge in the field ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Safeguarding adults practice and remote working in the COVID-19 era: challenges and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome(MIS) in children (MIS-C) associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) is well recognised in children, however, rarely reported in newborns.

In a multivariate linear regression (LR) model we showed that the antibody response depended on the IgG prevaccine titer and on the exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals, IgG reached a plateau after the second dose, and those who voluntarily refrained from receiving the second dose (n = 7) retained their antibody response. Gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle pain, and fever markedly positively correlated with increased IgG responses. By contrast, all asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic and unexposed individuals showed an important increase after the second dose.CONCLUSIONOne vaccine dose is sufficient in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects to reach a high titer of antibodies, suggesting no need for a second dose, particularly in light of current vaccine shortage.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04387929.FUNDINGDolce & Gabbana and the Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca corrente).","output":"One dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine exponentially increases antibodies in individuals who have recovered from symptomatic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-quality research is essential in guiding evidence-based care, and should be reported in a way that is reproducible, transparent and where appropriate, provide sufficient detail for inclusion in future meta-analyses.

With the recent rise in volume of research using artificial intelligence (AI), additional factors need to be evaluated, which do not neatly conform to traditional reporting guidelines (eg, details relating to technical algorithm development). In this review, reporting guidelines are highlighted to promote awareness of essential content required for studies evaluating AI interventions in healthcare. These include published and in progress extensions to well-known reporting guidelines such as Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-AI (study protocols), Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-AI (randomised controlled trials), Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-AI (diagnostic accuracy studies) and Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis-AI (prediction model studies).

DESIGN: Population-based prospective study. SETTING: We conducted VTE surveillance at all relevant tertiary care facilities and outpatient clinics in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma during 2012 to 2014, using both active and passive methods. Active surveillance involved reviewing all imaging reports used to diagnose VTE. Passive surveillance entailed identifying VTE events from hospital discharge data and death certificate records. MEASUREMENTS: We used Poisson regression to calculate crude, age-stratified, and age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates per 1,000 population per year and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The incidence rate of all VTE was 3.02 (2.92-3.12) for those age &#8805;18 years and 0.05 (0.04-0.08) for those <18 years.

In this study, we investigate the capacity of human MAIT cells to respond directly to S. aureus. MAIT cells co-cultured with dendritic cells (DCs) infected with S. aureus rapidly upregulate CD69, express IFN and Granzyme B and degranulate. DC secretion of IL-12, but not IL-18, was implicated in this immune response, while TCR binding of MR1 is required to commence cytokine production. MAIT cell cytotoxicity resulted in apoptosis of S. aureus-infected cells, and reduced intracellular persistence of S. aureus.

Emerging data are showing that screening for breast and colon cancer has dramatically decreased. It is unknown whether the same trend has affected patients with melanoma. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of melanoma patients at two large-volume cancer centers. Patients were compared for 8 months before and after the lockdown. Outcomes focused on delay in treatment and possible resultant upstaging of melanoma. RESULTS: A total of 375 patients were treated pre-lockdown and 313 patients were treated post-lockdown (17% decrease). Fewer patients presented with in situ disease post-lockdown (15.3% vs. 17.9%), and a higher proportion presented with stage III-IV melanoma (11.2% vs. 9.9%). Comparing patients presenting 2 months before versus 2 months after the lockdown, there was an even more significant increase in Stage III-IV melanoma from 7.1% to 27.5% (p < 0.0001). Finally, in Stage IIIB-IIID patients, there was a decrease in patients receiving adjuvant therapy in the post lockdown period (20.0% vs. 15.2%). CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the recent pandemic, it appears there has been a shift away from melanoma in situ and toward more advanced disease, which may have significant downstream effects on prognosis and could be due to a delay in screening.

In vitro, ectopic expression of transcription factors, in particular CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP) and C/EBP, can convert B cells into functional macrophages. However, little is known about the specific ligands responsible for such phenotype conversion. Here, we investigated whether spike protein of SARS-CoV can act as a ligand to trigger the conversion of B cells to macrophages. We transduced SARS-CoV spike protein-displayed recombinant baculovirus (SSDRB), vAtEpGS688, into peripheral B cells and B lymphoma cells. Cell surface expression of CD19 or Mac-1 (CD11b) was determined by flow cytometry. SSDRB-mediated changes in gene expression profiles of B lymphoma cells were analyzed by microarray. In this report, we showed that spike protein of SARS virus could induce phenotypic conversion of human B cells, either from peripheral blood or B lymphoma cells, to macrophage-like cells that were steadily losing the B-cell marker CD19 and in turn expressing the macrophage-specific marker Mac-1. Furthermore, we found that SSDRB enhanced the expression of CD86, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1), suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS or STAT-induced STAT inhibitor)-3, C/EBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), Krpple-like factor (KLF)-5, and CD54, without marked influence on C/EBP or PU.1 expression in transduced cells. Prolonged exposure to hypoxia could also induce macrophage-like conversion of B cells. These macrophage-like cells were defective in phagocytosis of red fluorescent beads. In conclusion, our results suggest that conversion of B cells to macrophage-like cells, similar to a pathophysiological response, could be mediated by a devastating viral ligand, in particular spike protein of SARS virus, or in combination with severe local hypoxia, which is a condition often observed in afflicted lungs of SARS patients.","output":"SARS spike protein induces phenotypic conversion of human B cells to macrophage-like cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has led to lockdowns across the world with people being separated from their loved ones including partners, family, and friends.

The climate of fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic has fostered the emergence of a wide range of COVID-19 conspiracy theories that have the potential to shape public opinion and hinder the effective dissemination of valid information. Beliefs in conspiracy theories have been associated with maladaptive personality traits such as schizotypy and paranoia, as well as other non-psychotic psychological characteristics (e.g., social isolation, stress). METHODS: An online survey was conducted to examine the associations between beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and psychotic-like experiences in a Portuguese community sample (N = 438), while also addressing the role of sociodemographic variables, psychological outcomes (e.g., stress, affective states), confinement-related factors (e.g., confinement conditions/behaviors), and pandemic-related factors (e.g., health concerns, financial issues). RESULTS: Findings suggest that psychotic-like experiences are associated with beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, particularly perceptual abnormalities and persecutory ideation. Moreover, increased health-related concerns and reduced education levels also seem to be liability factors for these conspiracy beliefs. CONCLUSION: These results add important insights into how the adherence to illogical and erroneous disease-related arguments can be related to psychotic-like experiences. COVID-19 conspiracy theories are yet another major challenge that governments and policymakers must contemplate when defining strategic directions to manage the current and future pandemics.","output":"What drives beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories?

Along with vaccines and targeted therapeutics, there is a critical need for rapid diagnostic solutions. In this work, we employ deep learning-based protein design to engineer molecular beacons that function as conformational switches for high sensitivity detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD). The beacons contain two peptides, together forming a heterodimer, and a binding ligand between them to detect the presence of S-RBD. In the absence of S-RBD (OFF), the peptide beacons adopt a closed conformation that opens when bound to the S-RBD and produces a fluorescence signal (ON), utilizing a fluorophore-quencher pair at the two ends of the heterodimer stems. Two candidate beacons, C17LC21 and C21LC21, can detect the S-RBD with limits of detection (LoD) in the sub-picomolar range. We envision that these beacons can be easily integrated with on-chip optical sensors to construct a point-of-care diagnostic platform for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Sub-Picomolar Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RBD via Computationally-Optimized Peptide Beacons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has raised concerns about transmission through faecal microbiota transplantation procedures. Validation parameters of authorised tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in respiratory samples are described in product labelling, whereas the published methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection from faecal samples have not permitted a robust description of the assay parameters. We aimed to develop and validate a test specifically for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human stool. METHODS: In this validation study, we evaluated performance characteristics of a reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-rtPCR) test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human stool specimens by spiking stool with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 material. A modified version of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention RT-rtPCR SARS-CoV-2 test was used for detection of viral RNA. Analytical sensitivity was evaluated in freshly spiked stool by testing two-fold dilutions in replicates of 20. Masked samples were tested by a second laboratory to evaluate interlaboratory reproducibility. Short-term (7-day) stability of viral RNA in stool samples was assessed with four different stool storage buffers (phosphate-buffered saline, Cary-Blair medium, Stool Transport and Recovery [STAR] buffer, and DNA/RNA Shield) kept at ?80C, 4C, and ambient temperature (approximately 21C). We also tested clinical stool and anal swab specimens from patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive by nasopharyngeal testing. FINDINGS: The lower limit of detection of the assay was found to be 3000 viral RNA copies per g of original stool sample, with 100% detection across 20 replicates assessed at this concentration. Analytical sensitivity was diminished by approximately two times after a single freeze-thaw cycle at ?80C. At 100 times the limit of detection, spiked samples were generally stable in all four stool storage buffers tested for up to 7 days, with maximum changes in mean threshold cycle values observed at ?80C storage in Cary-Blair medium (from 294 [SD 027] at baseline to 308 [017] at day 7; p<00001), at 4C storage in DNA/RNA Shield (from 285 [015] to 298 [009]; p=00019), and at ambient temperature in STAR buffer (from 304 [024] to 324 [062]; p=00083). 30 contrived SARS-CoV-2 samples were tested by a second laboratory and were correctly identified as positive or negative in at least one of two rounds of testing. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using this assay in the stool and anal swab specimens of 11 of 23 individuals known to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: This is a sensitive and reproducible assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human stool, with potential uses in faecal microbiota transplantation donor screening, sewage monitoring, and further research into the effects of faecal shedding on the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Ethiopia, the waiting time in the hospitals particularly in the outpatient department is lengthy. Studies at Jimma University specialized hospital indicated patients are forced to wait an average of 4.5 waiting hours to get service. Even there are many hospitals found in the zone, there is a paucity of information regarding waiting time and associated factors. Hence, this study is aimed to assess waiting time and associated factors at outpatient departments in Public Hospitals of Jimma zone, southwest Ethiopia. METHODS An institution-based cross-sectional study design was used from March 22 to June 3, 2020. A total of 422 study subjects were included in the study and systematic random sampling methods were used. The data were collected by observing the whole service points of each patient. The exit interview was made at the last point of the service unit. Descriptive statistics, bi-variable and multi-variable logistic regressions were used. RESULTS The whole waiting time patients spent in the hospitals before getting service was a minimum of 41 and a maximum of 185 min. Patients who came far from the hospitals were 1.93 times (AOR = 1.93; 95% CI, 1.16, 3.21) more likely to spend longer waiting time as compared to those who came from the hospital's area. Patients visited on Monday were 2.64 times (AOR = 2.64; 95% CI, 1.45, 4.79) more likely to spend longer waiting time than those who visited the hospital on Friday. Patients who arrived early in the morning were 3.22 times (AOR = 3.22; 95% CI, 1.32, 7.86) more likely to spend longer waiting time than those who arrived in the afternoon. CONCLUSIONS The mean waiting time was higher than the average recommended time by Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and more than five out of every ten clients spent long waiting time at outpatient departments Waiting time was affected by Educational status, residence, arrival time, and date of the visit.","output":"Waiting time and its associated factors in patients presenting to outpatient departments at Public Hospitals of Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herein, we discuss fast development of the new coronavirus disease COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic, and associated with relatively high mortality rate COVID-19 risk originates from its ability to transmit easily from person to person through the respiratory droplets released during sneezing, breathing, talking, singing, or coughing within a range of nearly 1 5C2 m The review begins with an overview of COVID-19 origin and symptoms that range from common cold to severe respiratory illnesses and death Then, it sheds light on the role of nanotechnology as an effective tool for fighting COVID-19 via contributions in diagnosis, treatment, and manufacture of protective equipment for people and healthcare workers Emergency-approved therapeutics for clinical trial and prospective vaccines are discussed Additionally, the present work addresses the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission via wastewater and means of wastewater treatment and disinfection via nanoscale materials The review concludes with a brief assessment of the government's efforts and contemporary propositions to minimize COVID-19 hazard and spreading","output":"Environmental aspect and applications of nanotechnology to eliminate COVID-19 epidemiology risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk factors associated with COVID-19 related severity, morbidity, and mortality, i.e., obesity (often associated with NAFLD), hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia all cluster together as metabolic syndrome (MetS). Instead of studying association of these risk factors with COVID-19, it makes sense studying the association between MetS on one hand and COVID-19 on the other. This study explores a molecular basis underpinning the above association. Severity of COVID-19 patients with MetS could be due to functional alterations of host proteins due to their interactions with viral proteins. We collected data from Enrichr (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/), DisGeNET (https://www.disgenet.org/) and others and carried out enrichment analysis using Enrichr. Various biological processes and pathways associated with viral protein interacting partners are known to involve in metabolic diseases. The molecular pathways underlying insulin resistance, insulin signaling and insulin secretion are not only involved in diabetes but also in CVD and obesity (associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease;NAFLD). Lipid metabolism/lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation and inflammation are associated with MetS. Viral interacting host proteins are associated and enriched with terms like hyperglycemia, coronary artery disease, hypertensive disease related to CVD and liver diseases in DisGeNET. Association of viral interacting proteins with disease-relevant biological processes, pathways and disease-related terms suggests that altered host protein function following interaction with viral proteins might contribute to frequent occurrence and/or severity of COVID-19 in subjects with MetS.

It also explores the impact of government relationships with civil society as a predictor of infection and mortality rates. Methods: Data were extracted from the Johns Hopkins University database, World Bank records and the National Civic Space Ratings 2020 database. This study used data from 86 countries which had at least 1,000 confirmed cases on 30th April 2020. Negative binomial regression model was used to assess the association between case fatality (a ratio of total number of confirmed deaths to total number of confirmed cases) and healthcare capacity index adjusting for other covariates. Findings: Regression analysis shows that greater healthcare capacity was related to lesser case-fatality [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.5811; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4727C0.7184; p < 0.001] with every additional unit increase in the healthcare capacity index associated with a 42% decrease in the case fatality. Health expenditure and civil society variables did not reach statistical significance but were positively associated with case fatalities. Interpretation: Based on preliminary data, this research suggests that building effective multidimensional healthcare capacity is the most promising means to mitigate future case fatalities.

METHODS: Four primary outcome measures, namely the quality of life (QOL), maximum urine flow ratio (UFR), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and prostate volumes, as well as four urethra-related and 35 non-urethra-related symptoms, were investigated to evaluate the effects on 31 BPH patients subjected to WM (Terazosin Hydrochloride Hytrin, THH) and 30 cases to TCM (herbal Saxifrage tablet, HST). The effects of both treatments are compared by the two-sample KolmogorovCSmirnov test. The contributions of symptoms for four assessments are analysed by the logistic regression model and the Chow test. RESULTS: The effect of TCM is weaker than that of WM in the assessment of the IPSS score (p < 0.05), and both treatments are similar in the prostate volumes, the maximum UFR and the QOL assessments (p > 0.05), as well as in the effective number of urethra-related or non-urethra-related symptoms before and after treatment (p > 0.05). By comparing the linear regression models, different urethra-related and non-urethra-related symptom patterns associated with TCM and WM therapies are detected for four assessments, especially for the prostate volume assessment (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: TCM (HST) is a potentially effective treatment in improving the QOL, prostate volumes and maximum UFR for patients with BPH, though it is less effective in ameliorating the IPSS score when compared with WM (THH).

METHODS: Long-term trends in mental health among 16C34 year old men and women between 1991 and 2018, and changes between 2018C19 and JulyCSeptember 2020 were examined using all waves from the British Household Panel Study (1991C2008), the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009C20), and the first five UKHLS COVID-19 waves administered in April, May, June, July, and September 2020. Findings are based on the GHQ-12 continuous score (0C36), clinically significant cases (4 + /12) and severe cases (7 + /12) for mental distress, and item endorsements. RESULTS: Between 1991 and 2018, the prevalence of cases (4 + /12) increased from 14C22% to 19C32% across groups. Increases were largest in women aged 16C24. In April 2020, the risk of caseness (4 + /12) increased across groups by 55% to 80% compared to the 2018C19 baseline.

Systemic hyperinflammation and cytokine storm play a critical role in the pathogenesis of both COVID-19 and AOSD. We aimed to compare the similarities and differences focusing on ferritin and cytokine levels between severe COVID-19 and active AOSD. A literature search was performed using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science to collect the levels of cytokine including IL-1?, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-&#945;, IL-10, and ferritin in severe COVID-19 patients. After extracting available data of indicators of interest, we acquired these statistics with a single-arm meta-analysis. Furthermore, a comparison was conducted between 52 patients with active AOSD in our center and severe COVID-19 patients from databases. The levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in severe COVID-19 compared with those in active AOSD. There were no significant differences on the cytokine of IL-1? and TNF-&#945;. Fold changes of IL-18 were defined as the mean expression level ratio of severe COVID-19 to healthy controls in the COVID-19 study and active AOSD to healthy controls in our study, individually. Although the fold change of IL-18 in patients with AOSD was significantly higher than patients with severe COVID-19 (fold change: 594.00 vs 2.17), there was no statistical comparability. In addition, the level of ferritin was higher in active AOSD in comparison with severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that severe COVID-19 and active AOSD have differences in cytokine panel and ferritin level, indicating the pathogenic role of ferritin in overwhelming inflammation. And it paves the way to make efficacy therapeutic strategy targeting the hyperinflammatory process in COVID-19 according to AOSD management, especially in severe COVID-19.","output":"Cytokine Storm in Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Adult-Onset Still's Disease: Similarities and Differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein phosphorylation plays key roles in a variety of essential cellular processes.

Methods: A national survey, adapted for the IDD community, was distributed to a convenience sample of IDD organizations throughout New York State, in five languages. Constructs included vaccine intention, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and trusted sources of vaccine information. Zip code data were used to map respondent location and vaccine preferences. Results: Of n= 825 respondents, approximately 75% intended to or had received the vaccine, across roles (i.e., people with disabilities, family members, direct care workers) and racial/ethnic groups. Greater vaccine hesitancy was reported in younger individuals and those making decisions on behalf of a person with IDD. Concerns included side effects and the swiftness of vaccine development. Black and Hispanic participants had heightened concerns about being an experiment for the vaccine. Trusted sources of information included healthcare providers and family members. Respondents who intended/got the vaccine were distributed throughout the state. Conclusions: Vaccine preferences in this New York State disability community sample align with national data. Identified concerns suggest the need for community education that addresses misperceptions. Age and race differences in perspectives highlight the need for tailored education, delivered by trusted messengers.","output":"COVID 19 Vaccine Perceptions in the New York State Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many developing countries have highly unequal health systems across their regions. The pandemic of COVID-19 brought an additional challenge, as hospital structures equipped with doctors, intensive care units and respirators are not available to a sufficient extent in all regions. Using Data Envelopment Analysis, we create a COVID Index to verify whether the hospital structures in 543 Brazilian microregions are adequate to deal with COVID-19 and to verify whether public policies were implemented in the right direction. The results indicate that hospital structures in the poorest microregions were the most vulnerable, although the peak of COVID-19 occurred in the richest microregions (Sao Paulo). The Southeast states could relocate hospital resources or even patients between their regions. The relocation was not possible in many states in the Northeast, as the health system poorly assisted the interior of these states. These findings reveal that the heterogeneity of microregions' hospital structures follows the patterns of socioeconomic inequalities. We conclude that it is easier for the wealthier regions to reallocate hospital resources internally than for the poorest regions. By using the COVID Index, policymakers and hospital managers have straightforward information to decide which regions must receive new investments and reallocate underutilized resources.","output":"COVID Health Structure Index: The Vulnerability of Brazilian Microregions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The biggest challenge of influenza A virus vaccine development is the constant mutation of the virus, especially the antigenic drift.

The study included all critically ill hospitalized patients between March 6, 2020, and May 5, 2020. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization included mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and mortality stratified by race. RESULTS: Of 288 patients included (mean age, 63  16 years; 45% female), 210 (73%) were African American. African Americans had significantly higher rates of comorbidities compared to other races, including hypertension (80% vs 59%, P = 0.001), diabetes (49% vs 34%, P = 0.026), and mean BMI (33 kg/m2 vs 28 kg/m2, P < 0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1760 anonymous digital X-ray images of real patients between January 2017 and June 2020 were collected for this experiment. In order to concentrate the feature extraction ability of the model more on the lung region and restrain the influence of external background factors, a two-stage pipeline from coarse to fine was established. First, the U-Net model was used to extract the lung regions on each sides of the collection images. Second, the ResNet-34 model with transfer learning strategy was implemented to learn the image features extracted in the lung region to achieve accurate classification of pneumoconiosis patients and normal people. RESULTS: Among the 1760 cases collected, the accuracy and the area under curve of the classification model were 92.46% and 89% respectively. CONCLUSION: The successful application of deep learning in the diagnosis of pneumoconiosis further demonstrates the potential of medical artificial intelligence and proves the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Much effort has been devoted to measuring these phenotypes, but predicting their impact on the course of the pandemic - especially that of immune escape - remains a challenge. Here, we use a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of wildtype and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of vaccine rollout and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We show that variants with enhanced transmissibility easily rise to high frequency, whereas partial immune escape, on its own, often fails to do so. However, when these phenotypes are combined, enhanced transmissibility can carry the variant to high frequency, at which point partial immune escape may limit the ability of vaccination to control the epidemic. Our findings suggest that moderate immune escape poses a low risk unless combined with a substantial increase in transmissibility.","output":"Population impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility and/or partial immune escape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Although pulmonary embolism (PE) is a frequent complication of the clinical course of COVID-19, there is a lack of explicit indications regarding the best algorithm for diagnosing PE in these patients. In particular, it is not clear how to identify subjects who should undergo computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), rather than simply X-ray and/or high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed COVID-19 patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) of our University hospital with acute respiratory failure, or that developed acute respiratory failure during hospital stay, to determine how many of them had a theoretical indication to undergo CTPA for suspected PE according to current guidelines. Next, we looked for differences between patients who underwent CTPA and those who only underwent X-ray and/or HRCT of the chest. Finally, we determined whether patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PE had specific characteristics that made them different from those with a CTPA negative for PE. Results: Out of 93 subjects with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure, 73 (78.4%) had an indication to undergo CTPA according to the revised Geneva and Wells scores and the PERC rule-out criteria, and 54 (58%) according to the YEARS algorithm. However, in contrast with these indications, only 28 patients (30.1%) underwent CTPA. Of note, they were not clinically different from those who underwent X-ray and/or HRCT of the chest. Among the 28 subjects who underwent CTPA, there were 10 cases of PE (35.7%). They were not clinically different from those with CTPA negative for PE. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure undergo CTPA, X-ray of the chest, or HRCT without an established criterion. Nonetheless, when CTPA is performed, the diagnosis of PE is anything but rare.

Although vaccination programs have been launched in most countries, emerging new strains of the virus along with geographical variations are leading to varying success rates of the available vaccines. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension is responsible for increasing the severity of COVID-19 and, thus, the COVID-19 mortality rate. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for entry into host cells, is widely expressed in the lungs, kidneys, testes, gut, adipose tissue, and brain. Infection within host cells mediates RAS overactivation, which leads to a decrease in the ACE2/ACE ratio, AT2R/AT1R ratio, and MasR/AT1R ratio. Such imbalances lead to the development of heightened inflammatory responses, such as cytokine storms, leading to post-COVID-19 complications and mortality. As the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypertension remains unclear, this report provides an overview of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with hypertension. We discuss here the interaction of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2, focusing on neuronal ACE2 (nACE2), and further shed light on the possible involvement of nACE2 in hypertension. SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain through neuronal ACE2 and spreads in various regions of the brain.

Based on the studies suggesting efficacy in prophylaxis combined with the known safety profile of ivermectin, a citywide prevention program using ivermectin for COVID-19 was implemented in Itaja, a southern city in Brazil in the state of Santa Catarina. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of regular ivermectin use on subsequent COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. Materials and methods: We analyzed data from a prospective, observational study of the citywide COVID-19 prevention with ivermectin program, which was conducted between July 2020 and December 2020 in Itaja, Brazil. Study design, institutional review board approval, and analysis of registry data occurred after completion of the program. The program consisted of inviting the entire population of Itaja to a medical visit to enroll in the program and to compile baseline, personal, demographic, and medical information. In the absence of contraindications, ivermectin was offered as an optional treatment to be taken for two consecutive days every 15 days at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day. In cases where a participating citizen of Itaja became ill with COVID-19, they were recommended not to use ivermectin or any other medication in early outpatient treatment. Clinical outcomes of infection, hospitalization, and death were automatically reported and entered into the registry in real time. Study analysis consisted of comparing ivermectin users with non-users using cohorts of infected patients propensity score-matched by age, sex, and comorbidities. COVID-19 infection and mortality rates were analyzed with and without the use of propensity score matching (PSM). Results: Of the 223,128 citizens of Itaja considered for the study, a total of 159,561 subjects were included in the analysis: 113,845 (71.3%) regular ivermectin users and 45,716 (23.3%) non-users. Of these, 4,311 ivermectin users were infected, among which 4,197 were from the city of Itaja (3.7% infection rate), and 3,034 non-users (from Itaja) were infected (6.6% infection rate), with a 44% reduction in COVID-19 infection rate (risk ratio [RR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.53-0.58; p < 0.0001). Using PSM, two cohorts of 3,034 subjects suffering from COVID-19 infection were compared. The regular use of ivermectin led to a 68% reduction in COVID-19 mortality (25 [0.8%] versus 79 [2.6%] among ivermectin non-users; RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.20-0.49; p < 0.0001). When adjusted for residual variables, reduction in mortality rate was 70% (RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.19-0.46; p < 0.0001). There was a 56% reduction in hospitalization rate (44 versus 99 hospitalizations among ivermectin users and non-users, respectively; RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.31-0.63; p < 0.0001). After adjustment for residual variables, reduction in hospitalization rate was 67% (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 023-0.66; p < 0.0001).

In clinical trials, severe complications are recorded as serious adverse events (SAE). We analyzed the effect of SAE on functional outcome and predictors of SAE in the randomized controlled WAKE-UP trial (Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke). METHODS We performed a post hoc analysis of WAKE-UP, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of magnetic resonance imaging-guided intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke and unknown time of onset. Functional outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale 90 days after the stroke. SAE were reported to a central safety desk and recorded and categorized by organ system using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology. We used logistic regression analysis to determine the effect of SAE on functional outcome and linear multiple regression analysis to identify baseline predictors of SAE. RESULTS Among 503 patients randomized, 199 SAE were reported for n=110 (22%) patients. Of those patients who did suffer a SAE, 20 (10%) had a fatal outcome. Patients suffering from at least one SAE had a lower odds of reaching a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-1) at 90 days (adjusted odds ratio, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.21-0.61], P<0.001). Higher age (P=0.04) and male sex (P=0.01) were predictors for the occurrence of SAE. CONCLUSIONS SAEs were observed in about one in 5 patients, were more frequent in elderly and male patients and were associated with worse functional outcome. These results may help to assess the risk of SAE in future stroke trials and create awareness for severe complications after stroke in clinical practice.

We postulated therefore that the ability of the virus to stimulate certain host immunological factors may be important for protection of the brain against invasion and replication of the virus. In this study we performed preliminary experiments to investigate the potential role of two host factors in protection of the brain against MHV invasion: cytotoxic T cells and interferon. Four week old beta 2M(-/-) mice, lacking beta 2 microglobulin, MHC class I expression and functional cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were inoculated intracerebrally (IC) with MHV-2 and analyzed at various intervals post infection for histopathology and viral titers in organs. Histology revealed both acute hepatitis and acute encephalitis. Acute encephalitis was observed in periventricular areas. Mononuclear lymphocytic infiltration involved the choroid plexus, the ependyma and in the surrounding brain parenchyma. There was no involvement of other areas of the brain including areas that are typically involved in A59 infection of C57B1/6 mice. By contrast, C57b1/6 mice infected with MHV-2 showed no involvement of the brain parenchyma and only slight inflammation of the choroid plexus was present.

Uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) may participate in the regulation of glucose metabolism, thus measurement of ucOC could be useful in evaluating interactions between bone and glucose metabolism. We developed recombinant antibodies and immunoassay to specifically detect ucOC in human blood samples. ucOC-specific recombinant antibodies were selected from an antibody library by phage display. Four candidates were characterized, and one (Fab-AP13) was used to set up an immunoassay with a pre-existing MAb. Plasma ucOC levels were measured in subjects with normal fasting blood glucose ( 6 mmol/l, N = 46) or with hyperglycemia ( 7 mmol/l, N = 29). Further, we analyzed ucOC in age- and gender-matched patients with diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D, N = 49). Antibodies recognized ucOC without cross-reaction to carboxylated osteocalcin. Antibodies had unique binding sites at the carboxylation region, with Glu17 included in all epitopes. Immunoassay was set up and characterized. Immunoassay detected ucOC in serum and plasma, with on average 1.6-fold higher levels in plasma. ucOC concentrations were significantly lower in subjects with hyperglycemia (median 0.58 ng/ml, p = 0.008) or with T2D diagnosis (0.68 ng/ml, p = 0.015) than in subjects with normal blood glucose (1.01 ng/ml). ucOC negatively correlated with fasting plasma glucose in subjects without T2D (r = - 0.24, p = 0.035) but not in T2D patients (p = 0.41).

Schools often rely on partnerships with community organizations to provide mental health services to students. However, collaboration and communication challenges often hinder implementation of evidence-based mental health strategies. Interventions informed by team science, such as Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS), have the potential to improve treatment implementation and collaboration within schools. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to improve communication and collaboration strategies among mental health and school staff by adapting an evidence-based team science intervention for school settings. We present a protocol for a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to adapt TeamSTEPPS using stakeholder feedback, develop a tailored implementation plan, and pilot the adapted content in eight schools. METHODS: Study participants will be recruited from public and charter schools and agencies overseeing school mental health services in the local metro area. We will characterize current services by conducting a needs assessment including stakeholder interviews, observations, and review of administrative data. Thereafter, we will establish an advisory board to understand challenges and develop possible solutions to guide additional TeamSTEPPS adaptations along with a complementary implementation plan. In aim 3, we will implement the adapted TeamSTEPPS plus tailored implementation strategies in eight schools using a pre-post design. The primary outcome measures include the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted TeamSTEPPS. In addition, self-report measures of interprofessional collaboration and teamwork will be collected from 80 participating mental health and school personnel. School observations will be conducted prior to and at three time points following the intervention along with stakeholder interviews. The analysis plan includes qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods analysis of feasibility and acceptability, school observations, stakeholder interviews, and administrative data of behavioral health and school outcomes for students receiving mental health services. RESULTS: Recruitment for the study has begun. Goals for aim 1 are expected to be completed in Spring 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study utilizes team science to improve interprofessional collaboration among school and mental health staff and contributes broadly to the team science literature by developing and specifying implementation strategies to promote sustainability. Results from this study will provide knowledge about whether interventions to improve school culture and climate can ready both mental health and school systems for implementation of evidence-based mental health practices.

Many vaccine development studies at clinical trials are currently conducted to combat SARS-CoV-2. Plants are a rich source of phytochemicals with different biological activities, including antiviral activities, which are the focus of many studies. AREAS COVERED: This review shows compounds of traditional plants listed on RENISUS list have therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 targets. EXPERT OPINION: The rise of new variants, more pathogenic and virulent, impacts in the increase of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thus, the control of the outbreaks of disease remains a global challenge. Other's drug and vaccines development is an essential element in controlling SARS-COV-2. Therefore, it is imperative that approach to tackle this pandemic has to be solidly evidence-informed. It should be noticed that the immune system does play critical roles in fighting viruses. Studies show that T cells levels decreased continuously as the disease progressed. T cell-mediated cellular immune response, probably by immunological memory, is essential for direct virus eradication after infection whilst B cells functions in producing antibodies that neutralize virus.But, have distinct patterns of T cell response exist in different patients, suggesting the possibility of distinct clinical approaches. Efforts are concentrated to elucidate the underlying immunological mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and progression for better design of diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive strategies. We seek to identify biomolecules with the potential to act in biomarkers that predict how severe the disease can get. But it is important to warn that the plants that produce the compounds mentioned here should not be used without a physician prescription. Finally, we speculate that these compounds may eventually attract the attention of physicians and researchers to perform tests in specific contexts of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if they show positive results, be tested in Clinical trials.","output":"Compounds of plants with activity against SARS-CoV-2 targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been reported unexpectedly in Wuhan, China, with staggering infection speed across China and around the world To date, seven known strains of HCoVs belonging to four genera (i e , alpha?, beta?, gamma, and delta-CoV) have been recognized;the latest one has been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 Although the common transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 is the respiratory tract, it seems that other routes such as the gastrointestinal tract may be effective for the entry of the virus in the body Although there are no biological markers to predict the susceptibility of humans to COVID-19, several risk factors have been identified to predict the susceptibility of patients to COVID-19 Initial data revealed that males, pregnant women, elderly, and underlying conditions predispose patients to higher morbidity or mortality and also might be at risk for a severe infection of COVID-19 There is a greater need to better understand the mechanisms and risk factors of transmission routes To date, despite the whole world effort to review various aspects of SARS-CoV-2, including epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment options, there are still gaps in the knowledge of this disease and many issues remain unclear Therefore, there is an urgent need for update data on SARS-CoV-2 Here, this study provide the current epidemiological status (transmission routes and risk of transmission, possible origins and source, mortality and morbidity risk, and geographical distribution) of the SARS-CoV-2 in the world in 2020","output":"Emerging coronaviruses: first SARS, second MERS and third SARS-CoV-2: epidemiological updates of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To reveal the molecular mechanism of Chaiyin Granules in treatment of coronavirus infection based on network pharmacology and molecular docking Methods: The chemical constituents of Chaiyin Granules were collected by TCMSP database SwissTargetPrediction database and GeneCards database were used to predict the potential targets of active ingredients and coronavirus The potential active ingredients and its targets of Chaiyin Granules in the treatment of coronavirus infection were found through Venn diagram The potential active compounds-targets network and the PPI network were visualized by Cytoscape 3 7 0 GO-enriched analysis and KEGG pathways analysis were constructed on STRING database The molecular docking of potential active compounds and key targets was achieved by autodock vina 1 1 2 Results: Fifty-one potential active ingredients and 14 potential targets for Chaiyin Granules on treatment of coronavirus infection were obtained KEGG pathways analysis showed that 44 metabolic pathways were involved to Chaiyin Granules effect on coronavirus infection, including MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway and IL-17 signaling pathway The results of molecular docking showed that baicalin, cubebin, coptisine, daidzein-4,7-diglucoside, linarin, liquiritin, luteolin and wogonin in Chaiyin Granules had strong affinity with NTRK2, PRKC, TNF, VEGFA, GSK3 Conclusion: This study elaborated that baicalin, cubebin and coptisine in Chaiyin Granules interacted with NTRK2, PRKC, TNF, VEGFA, GSK3 and regulated PI3K-Akt/mTOR, ErbB/Ras and IL-17 signaling pathways to inhibit the invasion and replication of coronavirus and enhance immunity to battle against coronavirus infection This study provides a research basis and theoretical basis for the application of Chaiyin Granules in the treatment of anti-coronavirus infection","output":"Potential molecular mechanism for Chaiyin Granules against coronavirus infection based on network pharmacology and molecular docking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the drying process, the water activity and moisture content of the foods are reduced, so the growth of microorganisms in the foods is largely prevented/postponed.

Challenges remain though in terms of their detection sensitivity and specificity for short-length target genes. Herein, we demonstrate the successful combination of the catalytic hairpin DNA assembly (CHA) approach with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-mimicking techniques for a simple, sensitive, and sequence-specific colorimetric assay to detect short SARS-CoV-2 target cDNA. In the developed CHA-based chemiluminescent assay, a low concentration of target cDNA is continuously recycled to amplify dimeric DNA probes from two biotinylated hairpin DNA until the hairpin DNA is completely consumed. The dimeric DNA probes are effectively immobilized in a neutravidin-coated microplate well and then capture neutravidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase via biotin-neutravidin interactions, resulting in a sensitive and selective colorless-to-blue color change. The developed sensing system exhibits a high sensitivity with a detection limit of ~1 nM for target cDNA as well as the ability to precisely distinguish a single-base mismatched mutant gene within 2 h. As the proposed system does not require complex protocols or expensive equipment to amplify target cDNA, it has the potential to be utilized as a powerful tool to improve the detection sensitivity of target genes for clinical diagnostics with colorimetric detection.","output":"Catalytic hairpin DNA assembly-based chemiluminescent assay for the detection of short SARS-CoV-2 target cDNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emerging strategies of accelerating the cleavage reaction in tumor through locally enriching the reactants is promising.

In this study, we quantified the associations between residential mobility index (RMI), air pollution, meteorology, and daily cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Sao Paulo, Brazil Objectives To acquire time-series data to estimate the associations between daily residential mobility index (RMI), air pollution, and meteorology, and daily cases and deaths for COVID-19 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods We applied a semiparametric generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate: 1) the association between residential mobility index and cases and deaths due to COVID-19, accounting for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), relative humidity, temperature and delayed exposure between 3-21 days and 2) the association between exposure to for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), accounting for relative humidity, temperature and mobility. Results We found an RMI of 45.28% results in 1,212 cases (95% CI: 1,189 to 1,235) and 44 deaths (95% CI: 40 to 47). Reducing mobility 5% would avoid 438 cases and 21 deaths. Also, we found that an increment of 10 g m-3 of PM2.5 risk of 1.140 (95% CI: 1.021 to 1.274) for cases and of 1.086 (95% CI: 1.008 to 1.170 for deaths, while O3 produces a relative risk of 1.075 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.150) for cases and 1.063 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.124) for deaths, respectively. Discussion We compared our results with observations and literature review, finding well agreement. These results implicate that authorities and policymakers can use such mobility indices as tools to support social distance activities and assess their effectiveness in the coming weeks and months. Small increments of air pollution pose a risk of COVID-19 cases. Conclusion Spatial distancing is a determinant factor to control cases and deaths for COVID-19. Small increments of air pollution result in a high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

PROMs may complement oncological evaluations by adding patients' perspectives on their care priorities. Aim: to address more accurately the management of tumor related symptoms or drug related toxicities to bring he therapies more accurately to bring patients the best quality of life diarrhea, dyspnea, vomiting and nausea. These symptoms were graded according to their severity using the Common Toxicity Criteria v5.0. Results: 49 patients admitted to Medical Oncology Hospitalization were included from July of 2020 to January 2021, 80% in advanced disease. Median age 63yo, 32% above 70 yo. Baseline data showed that 27% patients (19% stage IV) had fever at admission, decreasing at 48h to 4%. Patients who had vomiting at admission were 33% (28% stage IV) median grade 2 becoming 20% and grade 1 at 48h. Nausea was present in 49% patients (35% stage IV) at the time of admission with a median grade 1.5, and it decreased to 16% at 48h with a median grade 2. Diarrhea was reported in 12% patients (6% stage IV) median grade 2 at baseline and it was reduced to 10% median grade 1 at 48h. The median severity of diarrhea at admission was 2 and only 1 at 48h. At admission, 33% (all stage IV) of patients presented dyspnea with a median grade 3, while at 48h it was present in 26% of patients and reduced to median grade 2. Conclusions: By systematically measuring symptoms, patients achieved better control of diarrhea, dyspnea, vomiting and nausea after admission. It should be noted that nausea was the variable that decreased the most at 48h, followed by fever, vomiting, dyspnea and diarrhea. All patients with stage IV disease had dyspnea and most of them had nausea and vomiting. These results reflect that these symptoms are more usual in patients with advanced disease compared to those with localized disease.

METHODS: Sixty nursing home residents (44 female; age, 53-100 years), of whom 10 had previously been diagnosed of COVID-19, and 18 healthy controls (15 female; age, 27-54 years) were recruited. Pre- and post-vaccination blood specimens were available for quantitation of total antibodies binding SARS-CoV-2 S protein and enumeration of SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive IFN- CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The seroconversion rate in presumably SARS-CoV-2 na?ve nursing home residents (41/43; 95.3%), was similar to controls (17/18; 94.4%). A booster effect was documented in post vaccination samples of nursing home residents with prior COVID-19. Plasma antibody levels were higher (P<0.01) in recovered nursing home residents (all 2,500 IU/ml) than in individuals across the other two groups (median, 1,120 IU/ml in na?ve nursing home residents and 2,211 IU/ml in controls).

The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion.

The following variables were used in the study: daily noise levels averaged over 14 days; daily incidence rates, average cumulative incidence over 14 days; hospital admissions, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and mortality due to COVID-19. We controlled for the effect of the pollutants PM(10) and NO(2) as well as for variables related to seasonality and autoregressive nature. GLM models with Poisson regressions were carried out using significant variable selection (p<0.05) to calculate attributable RR. The results of the modeling using a single variable show that the levels of noise (leq24h) were related to the incidence rate, the rate of hospital admissions, the ICU admissions and the rate of average cumulative incidence over 14 days. These associations presented lags, and the first association was with incidence (lag 7 and lag 10), then with hospital admissions (lag 17) and finally ICU admissions (lag 22). There was no association with deaths due to COVID-19. In the results of the models that included PM1(0), NO(2), Leq24h and the control variables simultaneously, we observed that only Leq24h went on to become a part of the models using COVID-19 variables, including the 14-day average cumulative incidence.

Here, we performed proteomics and metabolomics analyses of plasma and bone marrow supernatant, together with transcriptional analysis of CD8+ T cells from SAA patients and healthy donors, to find key pathways that are involved in pathogenic CD8+ T-cell activation. We identified 21 differential proteins and 50 differential metabolites in SAA patients that were mainly involved in energy metabolism, complement and coagulation cascades, and HIF-1 signaling pathways. Interestingly, we found that these pathways are also enriched in T cells from SAA patients by analyzing available single-cell RNA sequencing data. Moreover, CD8+ T cells from SAA patients contain a highly activated CD38+ subset, which was increased in the bone marrow of SAA patients and a murine model of SAA. This subset presented enriched genes associated with the glycolysis or gluconeogenesis pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and complement associated pathways, all of which were of importance in T-cell activation. In conclusion, our study reveals new pathways that may regulate CD8+ T-cell activation in SAA patients and provides potential therapeutic targets for SAA treatment.","output":"Multi-Omics Profiling Identifies Pathways Associated With CD8+ T-Cell Activation in Severe Aplastic Anemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue fever, a mosquito-transmitted viral disease, is present in many neighborhoods in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia. One factor likely to affect its distribution is the socio-economic status of local neighborhoods; however, the absence of socio-economic census data in Saudi Arabia has precluded detailed investigation. This study aims to develop a proxy measure of socio-economic status in Jeddah City in order to assess its relationship with the occurrence of dengue fever. The Delphi method was used to assess the socio-economic status (high, medium or low) of local neighborhoods in Jeddah City. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was applied to understand the distribution of dengue fever according to the socio-economic status of Jeddah City neighborhoods. Low-socio-economic status neighborhoods in south Jeddah City, with poor environmental conditions and high levels of poverty and population density, reported most cases of dengue fever. Nevertheless, dengue continues to increase in high socio-economic status neighborhoods in the northern part of the city, possibly due to ideal breeding conditions caused by the presence of standing water associated with high levels of construction. Moreover, the low-socioeconomic-status neighborhoods had the highest average number of cases, being 3.95 times that of high-status neighborhoods for the period 2006C2009. The Delphi approach can produce a useful and robust measure of socio-economic status for use in the analysis of patterns of dengue fever. Results suggest that there are nuances in the relationship between socio-economic status and dengue that indicate that higher status areas are also at risk. A useful additional tool for researchers in Saudi Arabia would be the development of census data or other systematic measures that allow socio-economic status to be included in spatial analyses of dengue fever and other diseases.","output":"Evaluation of Neighborhood Socio-Economic Status, as Measured by the Delphi Method, on Dengue Fever Distribution in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Promoting the psychosocial flourishing of emerging adults is crucially important. The tendency to feel awe, as captured by dispositional awe, may be a protective factor that promotes psychosocial flourishing. Inspired by the broaden-and-build theory, the present study sought to investigate the underexplored relationship between dispositional awe and psychosocial flourishing among emerging adults by establishing a dual-mediated model, which focuses on an intrapersonal mechanism of meaning in life and an interpersonal mechanism of social connectedness. Data were collected from a cross-sectional sample of 1213 Chinese emerging adults who completed a series of anonymous questionnaires regarding dispositional awe, psychosocial flourishing, meaning in life, and social connectedness. Results of the correlation analysis revealed positive and significant associations among dispositional awe, meaning in life, social connectedness, and psychosocial flourishing. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that meaning in life and social connectedness fully mediated the association between dispositional awe and psychosocial flourishing. The mediation effect of meaning in life was stronger than that of social connectedness.

METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate provider response to CDS alerts triggered during ordering of QT-prolonging medications for adult patients. The primary outcome was the proportion of orders triggering QTc alerts that were continued without intervention during a specified preimplementation phase (n = 49) and during a postimplementation phase (n = 100). Patient risk factors for QTc prolongation, provider alert response, and interventions to reduce the risk of QTc-associated adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of order continuation without intervention was 82% in the preimplementation phase and 37% in the postimplementation phase, representing an 55% reduction in continued verified orders following implementation of the QT-focused CDS tool. Most alerts were initially responded to by the prescriber, with pharmacist intervention needed in only 33% of cases. There were no significant differences in patient QTc-related risk factors between the 2 study groups (P = 0.11); the postimplementation group had a higher proportion of patients using at least 2 QTc-prolonging medications (48%, compared to 26% in the preimplementation group; P = 0.02).

However, most pregnancy screening tests are not available in the settings they are needed the most. A mobile deviceCenabled technology based on MSAFP for screening birth defects could enable the rapid screening and triage of high-risk pregnancies, especially where maternal serum screening and fetal ultrasound scan facilities are not easily accessible. Shifting the approach from clinic- and laboratory-dependent care to a mobile platform based on our point-of-care approach will enable translation to resource-limited settings and the global health care market. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop and perform proof-of-concept testing of a lateral flow immunoassay on a mobile platform for rapid, point-of-care quantification of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, from a drop of human serum, within a few minutes. METHODS: The development of the immunoassay involved the selection of commercially available antibodies and optimization of their concentrations by an iterative method to achieve the required detection limits. We compared the performance of our method with that of commercially obtained human serum samples, with known AFP concentrations quantified by the Abbott ARCHITECT chemiluminescent magnetic microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). RESULTS: We tested commercially obtained serum samples (N=20) with concentrations ranging from 2.2 to 446 ng/mL to compare the results of our point-of-care assay with results from the Abbott ARCHITECT CMIA. A correlation of 0.98 (P<.001) was observed on preliminary testing and comparison with the CMIA. The detection range of our point-of-care assay covers the range of maternal serum AFP levels observed during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary test results from the AFP test on the mobile platform performed in this study represent a proof of concept that will pave the way for our future work focused on developing a mobile deviceCenabled quad-screen point-of-care testing with the potential to enable the screening of high-risk pregnancies in various settings. The AFP test on the mobile platform can be applied to enable screening for high-risk pregnancies, within a few minutes, at the point of care even in remote areas where maternal serum tests and fetal ultrasound scans are not easily accessible; assessment of whether clinical follow-up and diagnostic testing may be needed after a positive initial screening evaluation; and development of surveillance tools for birth defects.","output":"Point-of-Care Quantification of Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein for Screening Birth Defects in Resource-Limited Settings: Proof-of-Concept Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract GenCOUNSEL is the largest genetic counseling research grant awarded to date and brings together experts in genetic counseling, genomics, law and policy, health services implementation, and health economics research.

Method Doctors and nurses were encouraged to participate. The survey consisted of self-report measures: demographics, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 28 and Impact of Events Scale (IES). A questionnaire enquiring about changes in life's priorities due to SARS and circumstances that helped with coping was used. Participation was strictly voluntary and responses anonymous. Results In total 177 out of 661 (27%) participants [40 out of 113 (35%) doctors and 137 out of 544 (25%) nurses] had a GHQ 28 score 5. Doctors [P = 0.026, odds ratio (OR) = 1.6 and 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1C2.5] and single health care workers were at higher risk (P = 0.048, OR = 1.4 and 95% CI = 1.02C2.0) compared to nurses and those who were married. Approximately 20% of the participants had IES scores 30, indicating the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Four areas were classified as more important using factor analysis: health and relationship with the family, relationship with friends/colleagues, work and spiritual. The areas for coping strategies were clear directives/precautionary measures, ability to give feedback to/obtain support from management, support from supervisors/colleagues, support from the family, ability to talk to someone and religious convictions. Support from supervisors/colleagues was a significant negative predictor for psychiatric symptoms and PTSD. Work and clear communication of directives/precautionary measures also helped reduce psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions Many health care workers were emotionally affected and traumatized during the SARS outbreak.

Objective To investigate the effect of antiviral treatment serum cytokines in severe COVID-19 patients. Methods Blood was obtained from 29 patients (aged 32-79yr) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 upon admission and 7 days after antiviral (Favipiravir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir) treatment. Patients also received standard supportive treatment in this retrospective observational study. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated to investigate lung manifestations of COVID-19. Serum was also obtained and cytokines levels were evaluated. 19 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were studied. Results Anti-viral therapy significantly reduced CT scan scores and the elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In contrast, sserum levels of IL-6, CXCL8 and IFN were elevated at baseline in COVID-19 subjects compared to healthy subjects with IL-6 (p=0.002) and CXCL8 (p=0.023) levels being further elevated after antiviral therapy.

Its importance in infection, diagnostics, and vaccinations has created a large demand for purified Spike for clinical and research applications.

Alternatively, Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) is commonly expressed with higher titers, though it has lower sensitivity in serological assays. Here, we improve transient Spike expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We demonstrate that Spike titers increase significantly over the expression period, maximizing at 14 mg/L at day 7. In comparison, RBD titers peak at 54 mg/L at day 3. Next, we develop 8 Spike truncations (T1-T8) in pursuit of a truncation with high expression and antibody binding. The truncations T1 and T4 express at 130 mg/L and 73 mg/L, respectively, which are higher than our RBD titers. Purified proteins were evaluated for binding to antibodies raised against full-length Spike. T1 has similar sensitivity as Spike against a monoclonal antibody and even outperforms Spike for a polyclonal antibody.

Higher GI symptoms were significantly related to higher State-Cognitive (r(s) = .476; P < .01); State-Somatic (r(s) = .525; P < .01); Trait-Cognitive (r(s) = .367; P < .01); and Trait-Somatic (r(s) = .500; P < .01) anxiety subscales scores. CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms and anxiety were prominent in our sample during the COVID-19 pandemic. Females exhibited higher GI symptoms and State and Trait anxiety compared to males. GI symptoms were positively correlated with State and Trait anxiety. It may be warranted to screen individuals, especially females, for anxiety when presenting with GI symptoms.

In this study, the literature was reviewed, and interviews were conducted with a director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a regulatory manager of a multinational medical equipment company. On the basis of that research, this article examines how crisis learning has facilitated a South Korean disease control agencys surveillance of infectious diseases and its development of in vitro diagnosis kits.

It is an oleaginous plant whose seeds have been used mainly in biodiesel production. Plant seed oil can be extracted mechanically or using solvents, generating castor bean cake and castor bean meal as by-products, respectively. Accidental ingestion of these by-products can cause poisoning in animals and humans, characterized by digestive signs resulting from the presence of a toxalbumin called ricin. Seed toxicity varies among animal species; in horses, the lethal dose of seeds is 0.1 g/kg of body weight. The literature presents plenty of studies addressing poisoning by R. communis in different animal species and in humans; however, reports are scarce and little information is available on the pathological aspects of poisoning regarding equines. Therefore, the present study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical and pathological aspects observed in an outbreak of accidental poisoning with castor bean cake in horses. The equines were supplemented with palm kernel (Elaeis guianeesis) cake; however, in the purchase of a new batch, there was an error in the order, and castor bean cake was requested instead. Four horses that received castor bean cake presented clinical signs indicative of colic, which started about 21 hours after administration. Three of these horses died, with clinical evolution from 2 to 4.5 hours; the other animal was treated with intravenous fluid and antibiotic therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and recovered after five days. In the necropsy of two of these horses, the main lesions were found in the small intestine, where mucosae with pronounced redness and covered with a thin layer of yellow fibrous material were observed. In the intestinal lumen, there was a large amount of bloody liquid. The stomach was full, and dark lumps similar to crushed castor bean seeds were observed in the contents. The adrenal glands of both horses presented congestion and hemorrhage in the cortex. In microscopy, the main lesion was an acute, diffuse and accentuated fibrin-necrotic enteropathy affecting the jejunum. The diagnosis of castor bean cake poisoning was based on the circumstantial evidence of by-product consumption supported by clinical and pathological aspects. The results indicate that castor bean cake commercially available as fertilizer is extremely toxic when ingested, and there is a need for appropriate detoxification or labeling informing of its toxicity.(AU)","output":"Accidental poisoning by castor bean (Ricinus communis) cake in horses/ Intoxica??o acidental por torta de mamona (Ricinus communis) em equinos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There has been significant speculation regarding the association between the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and smoking. We provide an overview of the available literature regarding the association between smoking, risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and risk of severe COVID-19 and poor clinical outcomes, with the aim of informing public health policy and practice, particularly in England. METHODS: Publications were identified utilising a systematic search approach on PUBMED and Google Scholar. Publications presenting a systematic review or meta-analysis considering the association between smoking and SARS-COV-2 infection or COVID-19 outcomes were included. RESULTS: Eight studies were identified. One considered the relationship between smoking and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, three considered the association between COVID-19 hospitalisation and smoking history, and six reviewed the association between smoking history and development of severe COVID-19. One study specifically investigated the risk of mortality. The studies considering risk of severe disease indicate that there is a significant association between COVID-19 and current or ever smoking. CONCLUSIONS: This is a rapidly evolving topic. Current analysis remains limited due to the quality of primary data, although, early results indicate an association between smoking and COVID-19 severity. We highly recommend public health messaging to continue focusing on smoking cessation efforts.","output":"Smoking, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: A review of reviews considering implications for public health policy and practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the absence of vaccines and antiviral drugs available to prevent and treat COVID-19, it becomes imperative to find or use all those products with the potential to fight this virus.

We tested different configurations in an experimental setup with manikin heads wearing masks (surgical type I), face shields (22.5 cm high with overhang under the chin of 7 cm and circumference of 35 cm) on an emitter or a receiver manikin head, or both. The manikins were face to face, 25 cm apart, with an intense particle emission (52.5 L/min) for 30 s. The particle counter calculated the total cumulative particles aspirated on a volume of 1.416 L In our experimental conditions, when the receiver alone wore a protection, the face shield was more effective (reduction factor = 54.8%), while reduction was lower with a mask (reduction factor = 21.8%) (p = 0.002). The wearing of a protective device by the emitter alone reduced the level of received particles by 96.8% for both the mask and face shield (p = NS). When both the emitter and receiver manikin heads wore a face shield, the protection allowed for better results in our experimental conditions: 98% reduction for the face shields versus 97.3% for the masks (p = 0.01). Face shields offered an even better barrier effect than the mask against small inhaled particles (<0.3 m-0.3 to 0.5 m-0.5 to 1 m) in all configurations.

We introduce a single new parameter corresponding to a power-law exponent of the susceptibility distribution that characterizes the population heterogeneity. We show that our generalized model is as simple as the original model which is contained as a limiting case. Because of this simplicity, numerical solutions can be generated easily and key properties of the epidemic wave can still be obtained exactly. In particular, we present exact expressions for the herd immunity level, the final size of the epidemic, as well as for the shape of the wave and for observables that can be quantified during an epidemic. We find that in strongly heterogeneous populations the epidemic reaches only a small fraction of the population. This implies that the herd immunity level can be much lower than in commonly used models with homogeneous populations. Using our model to analyze data for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Germany shows that the reported time course is consistent with several scenarios characterized by different levels of immunity. These scenarios differ in population heterogeneity and in the time course of the infection rate, for example due to mitigation efforts or seasonality. Our analysis reveals that quantifying the effects of mitigation requires knowledge on the degree of heterogeneity in the population. Our work shows that key effects of population heterogeneity can be captured without increasing the complexity of the model.

HYPOTHESIS Ultrafiltration during cardiac surgery increases the risk of developping Acute kidney Injury. METHODS We searched PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and SCOPUS through July 2021. The RevMan (version 5.4) software was used to calculate the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences along with their associated confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS We identified 12 studies with a total of 8005 patients. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of AKI between the group who underwent UF and the control group who did not (RR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.64-1). Subgroup analysis on patients with previous renal insufficiency also yielded nonsignificant difference (RR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.53 -1.33, p = .47). Subgroup analysis based on volume of ultrafiltrate removed (> or <2900 ml) was not significant and did not increase the AKI risk as predicted (RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.63 -1.07, p = .15). We also did subgroup analysis according to the type of UF and again no significant difference in AKI incidence between UF groups and controls was observed in either the conventional ultrafiltration (CUF), modified ultrafiltration (MUF), zero-balanced ultrafiltration (ZBUF), or combined MUF and CUF subgroups.

It has drawn great attention from the International Health Organization and was declared an international public health emergency on January 31, 2020. Because the population is generally susceptible to the virus, there are no effective drugs and vaccines, and active participation of the entire population in self-protection and self-isolation has become the key to cutting off transmission routes and effectively controlling the epidemic. China has vast land and a vast area with a large population. Although the agricultural population has decreased this year with the acceleration of urbanization, according to national demographics, 40% of China's rural population is still living in remote areas. This population is relatively lacking in material and economic conditions and has limited access to medical services and education. Influencing factors such as traditional health habits and consciousness should not be underestimated in rural areas. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak coincided with the Chinese New Year, and peoples return and post-holiday resumption of work greatly increased the chance of transmission of the virus. Rural residents accounted for 60% of the people returning to the Spring Festival. They are the most mobile and susceptible group and are at high risk of viral transmission. The knowledge, consciousness, attitude and behavior of rural residents with regard to COVID-19 control are related to the success or failure of epidemic prevention and control. To investigate the knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to the prevention and control of COVID-19 among rural residents, to analyze the influencing factors, difficulties and challenges of prevention and control in this population, and to develop a plan to improve rural residents' awareness of COVID-19 prevention and control. Targeted interventions for prevention and control capabilities provide scientific evidence.Methods: A self-designed questionnaire to assess residents knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19 prevention and control was borrowed from the Questionnaire Star service platform, and snowball sampling was used to invite rural residents to complete the questionnaire on WeChat. Data analysis was performed with SPSS 22.0 statistical software.Results: A total of 554 valid questionnaires were collected. Rural residents average score of knowledge about the prevention and control of new coronary pneumonia was 39.75  6.703, the average score of prevention and control attitude was 45.40  3.341, and the average score of prevention and control behavior was 104.69  12.167. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that male residents scores for knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to SARS were significantly higher than those of women who had not experienced SARS (P <0.01);the scores of attitudes and behaviors of rural residents aged 30 and under were significantly higher than those of other age groups (P <0.01) 0.01);residents with an education level of junior high school or below and those who worked as farmers had significantly lower scores in knowledge, attitude, and behavior than those with other education levels (P <0.05);the knowledge and behavior scores of respondents with poor family economic conditions were significantly lower than those with good and moderate family economic conditions (P <0.05);and residents with chronic diseases and those living in areas with confirmed cases had significantly higher knowledge and behavior scores than those without chronic diseases and no or unknown living cases (P <0.05). Rural residents scores for knowledge and attitudes, attitudes and behaviors, and knowledge and behavior were positively correlated with new coronary pneumonia control (P <0.05). The difficulties and challenges they perceived during the epidemic were a ack of protective equipment and travel difficulties (lack of transportation) and weak awareness of prevention and control.Conclusions: Rural residents have a good grasp of COVID-19 and a positive attitude toward the need for prevention and control by individuals, communities, and the government during the epidemic. They use common chopsticks or split meals and take Chinese herbal medicines that nourish yin, invigorate the spleen, and nourish the lungs. Protective measures such as cleaning furniture with alcohol or chlorine disinfectant, returning home, and handwashing with soap before and after meals and after contact with pollutants need to be further strengthened.

Specimens from the first day of his admission were among the first to demonstrate the novel coronavirus, by culture, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and rising of specific antibody, but proper protective measures remained unknown. The authors instituted airborne, droplet and contact precautions from the time of admission, and reviewed the efficacy of these measures. MATERIAL AND METHOD A specific unit was set up to care for the physician, beginning by roping off an isolated room and using a window fan to create negative pressure, and later by constructing a glass-walled antechamber, designated changing and decontamination areas, and adding high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was consistently enforced by nurse managers for all the staff and visitors, including a minimum of N95 respirators, goggles or face shields, double gowns, double gloves, full head and shoe covering, and full Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) for intubation. To assess the adherence to PPE and the possibility of transmission to exposed staff a structured questionnaire was administered and serum samples tested for SARS coronavirus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Exposure was defined as presence on the SARS ward or contact with laboratory specimens, and close contact was presence in the patient's room. RESULTS The WHO physician died from respiratory failure on day 19. 112 of 129 exposed staff completed questionnaires, and the 70 who entered the patient's room reported a mean of 42 minutes of exposure (range 6 minutes-23.5 hours). 100% reported consistent handwashing after exposure, 95% consistently used a fit-tested N95 or greater respirator, and 80% were fully compliant with strict institutional PPE protocol. No staff developed an illness consistent with SARS. Serum samples from 35 close contacts obtained after day 28 had a negative result for SARS coronavirus antibody.

The broad-spectrum formulation of N247 includes essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements that are adequately balanced in regard to synergies and related metabolic functions. Moreover, tolerance, safety, and nutrient availability is an important aspect of daily, long-term use of N247. After 3 months of regular N247 use, levels of vitamins and minerals in serum were significantly increased in the N247 group compared with the control group and a placebo group, with excellent compliance rates. Coupled with additional natural ingredients that aim to increase the potency of the nutrients, N247 may represent a novel and beneficial supplement for individuals with nutritional deficiencies.

Following introduction of national antibiotic recommendations for suspected bacterial respiratory tract infection complicating COVID-19, a point prevalence survey of prescribing was conducted across acute hospitals in Scotland. METHODS: Patients in designated COVID-19 units were included and demographic, clinical and antimicrobial data were collected from 15 hospitals on a single day between 20(th) and 30(th) April 2020. Comparisons were made between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients and patients on non-critical care and critical care units. Factors associated with antibiotic prescribing in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were examined using Univariable and multivariable regression analyses. FINDINGS: There were 820 patients were included, 64.8% were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 14.9% were managed in critical care, and 22.1% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were considered probable or definite nosocomial infections. On the survey day, antibiotic prevalence was 45.0% and 73.9% were prescribed for suspected respiratory tract infection. Amoxicillin, doxycycline and co-amoxiclav accounted for over half of all antibiotics in non-critical care wards and meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and co-amoxiclav accounted for approximately half prescribed in critical care. Of all SARS-CoV-2 patients, 38.3% were prescribed antibiotics. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, COPD/chronic lung disease and CRP  100 mg/l were associated with higher odds and probable or confirmed nosocomial COVID-19, diabetes and management on an elderly care ward had lower odds of an antibiotic prescription. Systemic antifungals were prescribed in 9.8% of critical care patients and commenced a median of 18 days after critical care admission. INTERPRETATION: A relatively low prevalence of antibiotic prescribing in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalised patients and low proportion of broad spectrum antibiotics in non-critical care settings was observed potentially reflecting national antimicrobial stewardship initiatives. Broad spectrum antibiotic and antifungal prescribing in critical care units was observed indicating the importance of infection prevention and control and stewardship initiatives in this setting.

The challenges in quantifying COVID-19 complexities include effectively modeling its process and data uncertainties. The uncertainties are embedded in implicit and high-proportional undocumented infections, asymptomatic contagion, social reinforcement of infections, and various quality issues in the reported data. These uncertainties become even more apparent in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the relevant knowledge, case reporting and testing were all limited. Here we introduce a novel hybrid approach SUDR by expanding the foundational compartmental epidemic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with two compartments to a Susceptible-Undocumented infected-Documented infected-Recovered (SUDR) model. First, SUDR (1) characterizes and distinguishes Undocumented (U) and Documented (D) infections commonly seen during COVID-19 incubation periods and asymptomatic infections. Second, SUDR characterizes the probabilistic density of infections by capturing exogenous processes like clustering contagion interactions, superspreading, and social reinforcement. Lastly, SUDR approximates the density likelihood of COVID-19 prevalence over time by incorporating Bayesian inference into SUDR. Different from existing COVID-19 models, SUDR characterizes the undocumented infections during unknown transmission processes. To capture the uncertainties of temporal transmission and social reinforcement during COVID-19 contagion, the transmission rate is modeled by a time-varying density function of undocumented infectious cases. By sampling from the mean-field posterior distribution with reasonable priors, SUDR handles the randomness, noise and sparsity of COVID-19 observations widely seen in the public COVID-19 case data. The results demonstrate a deeper quantitative understanding of the above uncertainties, in comparison with classic SIR, time-dependent SIR, and probabilistic SIR models.","output":"Modeling time evolving COVID-19 uncertainties with density dependent asymptomatic infections and social reinforcement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT No defined pre-treatment factors are able to predict the response to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule (AFTN). OBJECTIVE Primary endpoint was to evaluate the success rate of RFA to restore euthyroidism in a cohort of adult patients with small solitary AFTN compared with medium-sized nodules. Secondary endpoints included nodule volume reduction and rate of conversion from hot nodules to cold using scintiscan. METHODS This was a 24-month prospective monocentric open parallel-group trial. Twenty-nine patients with AFTN were divided into two groups based on thyroid volume: 15 patients with small nodules (<12 mL) in group A and 14 patients with medium nodules (>12 mL) in group B. All patients underwent a single session of RFA and were clinically, biochemically, and morphologically evaluated at baseline and at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment. RESULTS After RFA, there was greater nodule volume reduction in group A compared with group B (p < 0.001 for each follow-up point). In group A, there was a greater increase in TSH levels than in group B at 6 (p = 0.01), 12 (p = 0.005), and 24 months (p < 0.001). At 24 months, the rate of responders was greater in group A than in group B (86 vs. 45%; p < 0.001). In group A, 86% of nodules converted from hot to cold compared with 18% in group B (p < 0.001).

Effective testing allows infected individuals to be quarantined, thus reducing the spread of COVID-19, saving countless lives, and helping to restart the economy safely and securely. Developing a good testing strategy can be greatly aided by contact tracing that provides health care providers information about the whereabouts of infected patients in order to determine whom to test. Countries that have been more successful in corralling the virus typically use a \`\`test, treat, trace, test'' strategy that begins with testing individuals with symptoms, traces contacts of positively tested individuals via a combinations of patient memory, apps, WiFi, GPS, etc., followed by testing their contacts, and repeating this procedure. The problem is that such strategies are myopic and do not efficiently use the testing resources. This is especially the case with COVID-19, where symptoms may show up several days after the infection (or not at all, there is evidence to suggest that many COVID-19 carriers are asymptotic, but may spread the virus). Such greedy strategies, miss out population areas where the virus may be dormant and flare up in the future. In this paper, we show that the testing problem can be cast as a sequential learning-based resource allocation problem with constraints, where the input to the problem is provided by a time-varying social contact graph obtained through various contact tracing tools. We then develop efficient learning strategies that minimize the number of infected individuals. These strategies are based on policy iteration and look-ahead rules.

For COVID-19, infections in the absence of apparent symptoms have been reported frequently alongside circumstantial evidence for asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission. We estimated the potential contribution of pre-symptomatic cases to COVID-19 transmission. Methods: Using the probability for symptom onset on a given day inferred from the incubation period, we attributed the serial interval reported from Shenzen, China, into likely pre-symptomatic and symptomatic transmission. We used the serial interval derived for cases isolated more than 6 days after symptom onset as the no active case finding scenario and the unrestricted serial interval as the active case finding scenario. We reported the estimate assuming no correlation between the incubation period and the serial interval alongside a range indicating alternative assumptions of positive and negative correlation. Results: We estimated that 23% (range accounting for correlation: 12 - 28%) of transmissions in Shenzen may have originated from pre-symptomatic infections. Through accelerated case isolation following symptom onset, this percentage increased to 46% (21 - 46%), implying that about 35% of secondary infections among symptomatic cases have been prevented. These results were robust to using reported incubation periods and serial intervals from other settings.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether spotted hyenas also had been infected with these viruses and to assess risk factors for infection. Serum samples were collected between 1993 and 2001 from 119 animals in a single clan for which behavioral data on social structure were available and from 121 hyenas ill several other clans. All animals resided in the Masai Mara National Reserve. Antibodies to CDV, FIV, FPLV/CPV, FECV/FIPV, FCV, and FHV1 were present in 47%, 3.5%, 81%, 36%, 72%, and 0.5% of study hyenas, respectively. Antibody prevalence was greater in adults for FIV and FECV/FIPV, and being a female of high social rank was a risk factor for FIV. Hyenas near human habitation appeared to be at lower risk to have CDV, FIV, and FECV/FIPV antibodies, whereas being near human habitation increased the risk for FPLV/CPV antibodies. Canine (distemper virus and FECV/FIPV antibody prevalence varied considerably over time, whereas FIV, FPLV/CPV, and FCV had a stable, apparently endemic temporal pattern. These results indicate that hyenas might play a role in the ecology of these viruses in the Serengeti ecosystem. The effect of these viruses on hyena health should be further investigated.

Notably, a few cases of thrombocytopenia and thrombotic events developed in recipients of either adenoviral vector- or mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines that resemble APS have been reported. The aim of this review is therefore to speculate on the plausible role of aPLs in the pathogenesis of these rare adverse events. Adenoviral vector-based vaccines can bind platelets and induce their destruction in the reticuloendothelial organs. Liposomal mRNA-based vaccines may instead favour the activation of coagulation factors and confer a pro-thrombotic phenotype to endothelial cells and platelets. Furthermore, both formulations may trigger a type I interferon response that is associated with the generation of aPLs. In turn, aPLs may lead to aberrant activation of the immune response with participation of innate immune cells, cytokines and the complement cascade. NETosis, monocyte recruitment and cytokine release may further support endothelial dysfunction and promote platelet aggregation. These factors suggest that aPLs may represent a risk factor for thrombotic events following COVID-19 vaccination, and deserve further investigations.","output":"Antiphospholipid antibodies and risk of post-COVID-19 vaccination thrombophilia: The straw that breaks the camel's back?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, provoking COVIDC19 disease, progresses rapidly worldwide.

There is ample evidence suggesting that zinc depletion, also prevalent in highCincome nations, compromises immune functions. Notably, major risk groups for COVIDC19, the elderly, men more than women, obese individuals and patients with diabetes are all at risk of zinc deficiency. Moreover, various widely used antihypertensive drugs and statin therapy have been reported to negatively influence zinc status. As zinc depletion impairs antiviral immunity, it is hypothesised to increase susceptibility for COVIDC19.

METHODS The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) screening tool was used to detect the proportion of US adults screening positive for high levels of anxiety symptoms. Anxiety symptoms was assessed in 2019 using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; N = 30,915) and during the pandemic using biweekly surveys collected as part of the Understanding America Study (UAS; N=8,022 Obs.=121,768) between March and December 2020. RESULTS The proportion of participants with high levels of anxiety symptoms increased significantly from 8.1% (95% CI[7.7, 8.5]) in 2019 to 21.4% (95% CI[19.9, 22.9]) at the beginning of April, 2020.

We present recent data on disease-modifying therapies (DMT) before/during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, with treatment recommendations. RECENT FINDINGS: Observational data support the safety of injectable DMTs (glatiramer acetate, interferon-beta) for use in pregnancy, while some oral DMTs might be associated with fetal risk. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) before pregnancy such as rituximab or natalizumab likely do not pose significant fetal risks, but can cross the placenta with neonatal hematological abnormalities if given in the second trimester or later. Breastfeeding is associated with decreased risk of postpartum relapses. Finally, injectables and mAbs likely have low transfer into breastmilk. SUMMARY: Many women with MS do not require DMTs during pregnancy, although injectables could be continued. For women with highly active MS, cell-depleting therapies could be given before conception, or natalizumab could be continued through pregnancy, with monitoring of the fetus. Women should be encouraged to breastfeed, and those with higher relapse risk could consider injectables or mAbs while breastfeeding. Further data on safety of DMTs around pregnancy are needed.

METHODS: The National Institute of Health surveyed (12 times) a random sample of Portuguese families. IV coverage was estimated and was adjusted for age distribution and country region. Independence of age and sex coverage distribution was tested using a modified F-statistic with a 5% significance level. The effect of SARS, A (H5N1), and the A (H1N1)2009 pandemic was tested using a meta-regression model. The model was adjusted for IV coverage in the general population and in the age groups. RESULTS: Between 1998/99 and 2010/11 IV, coverage in the general population varied between 14.2% (CI (95%): 11.6%C16.8%) and 17.5% (CI (95%): 17.6%C21.6%). There was no trend in coverage (p = 0.097). In the younger age group (<15 years) a declining trend was identified until 2008/09 (p = 0.005). This trend reversed in 2009/10. There was also a gradual and significant increase in seasonal IV coverage in the elderly (p for trend < 0.001). After 2006/07, IV coverage remained near 50%. Adjusting for baseline trends, there was significantly higher coverage in the general population in 2003/04 (p = 0.032) and 2005/06 (p = 0.018). The high coverage observed in the <15-year age group in season 2009/10 was also significant (p = 0.015).

Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are the priority group for vaccination due to them having the highest risk of exposure to infection. This survey aimed to assess their acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in Bangladesh. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire was conducted between January 3 to 25, 2021, among HCPs (n=834) in Bangladesh. The main outcome measures were vaccine acceptance by HCPs if one was available. RESULTS Less than 50% of HCPs would receive the vaccine against COVID-19 if available and 54% were willing to take the vaccine at some stage in the future. Female participants (OR:1.64;95%CI:1.172-2.297), respondents between 18-34 years old (OR:2.42; 95% CI:1.314-4.463), HCPs in the public sector (OR:2.09; 95% CI:1.521-2.878), and those who did not receive a flu vaccine in the previous year (OR:3.1; 95% CI:1.552-6.001) were more likely to delay vaccination. CONCLUSIONS The study revealed that, if available, less than half of the HCPs would accept a COVID-19 vaccine in Bangladesh.

We conducted a survey of fourth-year medical students to examine factors that may be influencing the decision to pursue radiation oncology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An anonymous online survey was sent to medical students at 9 participating US medical schools. RESULTS: A total of 232 medical students completed the survey. Of the 153 students who stated they were never interested in radiation oncology, 77 (50%) reported never having been exposed to the specialty as their reason for not pursuing radiation oncology. The job market was the most commonly cited factor among students who said they were once interested in but ultimately chose not to pursue radiation oncology. Conversely, the recent low pass rates for board examinations and a perception of a lack of diversity within radiation oncology had the least influence. CONCLUSIONS: Despite discussion of potential measures to address this disquieting trend, there have been minimal formal attempts to characterize and address potential causes of a decreasing interest in radiation oncology. This study's data are consistent with previous research regarding the trend of decreased medical student interest in radiation oncology and may be used as part of ongoing introspective assessment to inform future change within radiation oncology.","output":"Why an Increasing Number of Unmatched Residency Positions in Radiation Oncology?

METHODS We developed a physical model for the spread of an Ebola-like virus. The scenario involved 3 computerized mannequins. One case was a febrile patient after Ebola exposure. Four residents (group A) had only masks and gloves and were initially unaware of exposure history, whereas 4 residents (group C) had known exposure history and had full PPE present in the room. Infected mannequins and surrounding surfaces were coated with Glo Germ, a UV tracer. Fluorescence to UV light was recorded after each scenario. Both tracer groups were compared with a control group (group B) in which no tracer was used to account for background fluorescence. RESULTS There was transfer of contagion to providers, other patients, nurse and family member confederates, and other treatment rooms. Half of group C used full PPE, and half used partial PPE. There were 3 contaminations in group C with full PPE use, 15 contaminations in group C with partial PPE, and 65 contaminations in group A. CONCLUSIONS The UV tracer seems to be a useful analog of contaminated bodily fluids because it spread easily and its spread decreased with the use of barrier methods. This model could be used in future studies to measure the effectiveness of different forms of PPE and to study the effectiveness of provider education on appropriately donning and doffing PPE.","output":"Beating the Spread: Developing a Simulation Analog for Contagious Body Fluids."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundCOVID-19 Vaccinations have been shown to be effective in reducing risk of severe infection, hospitalization, and death. They also have been shown to be safe and effective in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on biologic therapies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of vaccination among patients with IBD on biologic therapies. MethodsA single-center prospective cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary care inflammatory bowel disease center. Data from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who attended the gastroenterology infusion clinic from June 1st, 2021 until October 31st, 2021 were retrieved. Patients received infliximab or vedolizumab at least 6 weeks before recruitment were included. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination. The secondary outcome was to assess whether prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination differed based sex, age, type of biologic therapy and citizenship status. ResultsThe total number of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients enrolled in the study was 280 (56.0% male and 44.0% female). The median age was 33.2 years and BMI was 24.8 kg/m2. 112 patients with ulcerative colitis (40.0%) and 168 (60.0%) with Crohns disease. 117 (41.8%) were vaccinated with either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 163 (58.2%) were not vaccinated. Female patients were more likely to receive the vaccine compared to male patients (83.0% vs. 63.8%, p < 0.001). In addition, older patients (above the age 50) were also more likely to receive the vaccine than younger patients, below the age of 50 (95.6% vs 31.2% p< 0.001). Expatriates were more likely to receive the vaccine than citizens (84.8% vs 25.0%, p < 0.001). There was no statistical difference between patients on Infliximab and vedolizumab in terms of prevalence of vaccination (40.0% vs 48.0%, p= 0.34). ConclusionThe overall prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on biologic therapies was lower than the general population and world health organization (WHO) recommendation. Female patients, patients above the age of 50, and expatriates were more likely to be vaccinated. On the other hand, male patients, patients below the age of 50, and citizens were less likely to be vaccinated.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease on Biologic Therapies; A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present COVID-SEE, a system for medical literature discovery based on the concept of information exploration, which builds on several distinct text analysis and natural language processing methods to structure and organise information in publications, and augments search by providing a visual overview supporting exploration of a collection to identify key articles of interest.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of 25 consecutive patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Health system rearrangement, patients' clinical presentation, diagnostic tools role, laboratory finding, treatment and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Health system rearrangement was fast. There was no clear prevalence of comorbidity or surgery type between confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. Nine positive swabs tests and 14 cases with only suspected CT scan findings were recorded. Several laboratory changes have been reported since the onset of symptoms: anemia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, coagulation abnormalities, alkaline phosphatase, liver enzymes and C-reactive protein alterations. Nineteen patients were treated by oxygen supplement, three patients were administered antivirals, eight antibiotic therapy, and nine hydroxychloroquine. The number of discharges reported in this study was greater than 52% and the number of deaths reached 20%. CONCLUSION: To our experience, the development of patient management algorithms allows the differentiation of the clinical pathways of negative and suspected/positive patients, reducing exposure, and virus spreading. The execution of swabs on all patients allows an early diagnosis and a more adequate management. Considering the different therapy patterns used, there were no significant differences, but anti-thromboembolic prophylaxis administered to all the orthopedic patients may have contributed to complications and mortality rates reduction.","output":"Covid-19 orthopedic trauma patients characteristics and management during the first pandemic period: report from a single institution in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is a severe flu-like illness which is associated with hyperinflammation and immune dysfunction. The virus induces a strong T and B cell response but little is known about the immune pathology of this viral infection. Acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria also causes acute clinical illness and is characterized by hyperinflammation due to the strong production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a massive activation of T cells. In malaria, T cells express a variety of co-inhibitory receptors which might be a consequence of their activation but also might limit their overwhelming function. Thus, T cells are implicated in protection as well as in pathology. The outcome of malaria is thought to be a consequence of the balance between co-activation and co-inhibition of T cells. Following the hypothesis that T cells in COVID-19 might have a similar, dual function, we comprehensively characterized the differentiation (CCR7, CD45RO) and activation status (HLA-DR, CD38, CD69, CD226), the co-expression of co-inhibitory molecules (PD1, TIM-3, LAG-3, BTLA, TIGIT), as well as the expression pattern of the transcription factors T-bet and eomes of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells of PBMC of n = 20 SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to n = 10 P. falciparum infected patients and n = 13 healthy controls. Overall, acute COVID-19 and malaria infection resulted in a comparably elevated activation and altered differentiation status of the CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell populations. T effector cells of COVID-19 and malaria patients showed higher frequencies of the inhibitory receptors T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) and Lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3) which was linked to increased activation levels and an upregulation of the transcription factors T-bet and eomes. COVID-19 patients with a more severe disease course showed higher levels of LAG-3 and TIM-3 than patients with a mild disease course. During recovery, a rapid normalization of these inhibitory receptors could be observed. In summary, comparing the expression of different co-inhibitory molecules in CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells in COVID-19 vs. malaria, there is a transient increase of the expression of certain inhibitory receptors like LAG-3 and TIM-3 in COVID-19 in the overall context of acute immune activation.","output":"Analysis of Co-inhibitory Receptor Expression in COVID-19 Infection Compared to Acute Plasmodium falciparum Malaria: LAG-3 and TIM-3 Correlate With T Cell Activation and Course of Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is widely thought that the main reason for ovarian follicular atresia is apoptosis of granulosa cells, however, accumulating evidence suggests that autophagy plays a role in the fate of granulosa cells.

METHODS: Data were collected across 24 clusters in 12 RACFs over 18 months during a cluster randomised controlled trial which was testing the effectiveness of music interventions in people living with dementia. Data were collected on resources required for recruitment and assessment of baseline data, as well as reasons for participant non-attendance at the interventions. RESULTS: Time between contacting next of kin and receiving formal consent often exceeded 45 days. The ratio of time between direct and indirect research activity was approximately 1:2. Participant intervention adherence is at risk from unplanned RACF lockdowns and reasons for non-attendance include those both related directly to the participant and to staff resources, scheduling or other practical considerations.

Many patients also develop cardiovascular complications during and after COVID-19 infection. Underlying cardiovascular disease increases the severity of COVID-19 infection;however, it is unclear if COVID-19 increases the risk of or causes cardiovascular complications in patients without preexisting cardiovascular disease. The review is aimed at informing the primary care physicians of the potential cardiovascular complications, especially in patients without underlying cardiovascular disease. A comprehensive literature review was performed on cardiac and vascular complications of COVID-19. The primary cardiac and vascular complications include myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial injury, arrhythmia, heart failure, shock, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, venous and arterial thrombotic events, stroke, and coagulopathy. A detailed analysis of the pathogenesis revealed six possible mechanisms: direct cardiac damage, hypoxia-induced injury, inflammation, a dysfunctional endothelial response, coagulopathy, and the catecholamine stress response. Autopsy reports from studies show cardiomegaly, hypertrophy, ventricular dilation, infarction, and fibrosis. A wide range of cardiac and vascular complications should be considered when treating patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Elevated troponin and natriuretic peptides indicate an early cardiac involvement in COVID-19. Continuous monitoring of coagulation by measuring serum D-dimer can potentially prevent vascular complications. A long-term screening protocol to follow-up the patients in the primary care settings is needed to follow-up with the patients who recovered from COVID cardiovascular complications.

We apply our approach to understand drastic differences in COVID-19 infection and fatality counts, observed between Hubei (Wuhan) and other Mainland China provinces. We find that these unintuitive data may be explained through an interplay of differences in transmissibility, effective protection, and detection efficiencies between Hubei and other provinces.

The obtained results demonstrate the applicability of our developed method to extract key infection parameters directly from publically available data so that it can be globally applied to outbreaks of COVID-19 in a number of countries.

In this study we have carried out a model-based evaluation of the effectiveness of social distancing, using Austria and Slovenia as examples. Whereas the majority of comparable studies have postulated a negative relationship between the stringency of social distancing (reduction in social contacts) and the scale of the epidemic, our model has suggested a sinusoidal relationship, with tipping points at which the system changes its predominant regime from less social distancing - more cumulative deaths and infections to less social distancing - fewer cumulative deaths and infections. This relationship was found to persist in scenarios with distinct seasonal variation in transmission and limited national intensive care capabilities. In such situations, relaxing social distancing during low transmission seasons (spring and summer) was found to relieve pressure from high transmission seasons (fall and winter) thus reducing the total number of infections and fatalities. Strategies that take into account this relationship could be particularly beneficial in situations where long-term containment is not feasible.","output":"Covid-19 social distancing: when less is more"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of people worldwide.

In addition to causing cardiovascular and respiratory lethal dysfunction, these viruses can cause neurodegeneration leading to neurological disorders. Review of the current scientific literature reveals the multiple neuropathies and neuronal dysfunction associated with these viruses. Here, we review the major findings of these studies and discuss the main neurological sequels and outcomes of coronavirus infections with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. This article analyzes and discusses the main mechanisms of coronavirus-induced neurodegeneration according to the current experimental and clinical studies. Coronaviruses can damage the nerves directly through endovascular dysfunctions thereby affecting nerve structures and synaptic connections. Coronaviruses can also induce neural cell degeneration indirectly via mitochondrial dysfunction inducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Thus, coronaviruses can cause neurological disorders by inducing neurovascular dysfunction affecting nerve structures and synaptic connections, and by inducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. While some of these mechanisms are similar to other RNA viruses, the neurotoxic mechanisms of COVID-19, MERS, and SARS-CoV viruses are unknown and need detailed clinical and experimental studies.","output":"Neuropathies and neurological dysfunction induced by coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: According to guidelines, the use of steroid and/or hyaluronate (HA) intra-articular injections for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is controversial. Heterogeneity of studies and difference in HAs characteristics does not allow to draw safe conclusions. One of the major concerns is the accuracy of the procedure as up to 1/3 of injections could miss joint space when performed blindly (1), negatively affecting the efficacy of HA that needs to be placed correctly in the joint space Objectives: The aim of our study was to evaluate the longterm efficacy of a novel association of a Cross-Linked Sodium Hyaluronate Combined With Triamcinolone Hexacetonide (SHCTH) in patients with KOA in a real life setting. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and ultrasonographic (US) data of patients (pts) affected by symptomatic KOA with intra-articular injections of SHCTH (1 injection every 6 months). Pts with concomitant inflammatory arthropaties were excluded. US guidance was carried out with the in plane technique choosing either the lateral suprapatellar or midpatellar approach. All pts were evaluated for pain with a VAS 0-10 for pain at baseline and after 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, with the WOMAC questionnaire and with US, scoring joint effusion, synovial hypertrophy (SH) and power Doppler (PD) synovial signal. Due to the retrospective design, the WOMAC data were available as VAS or Likert scales;to allow comparability these values were standardized. Clinical and US variables at different time points were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sing test, the McNemar test or the paired samples t-test, depending on the variable. Results: 49 knees (43 pts, median age 70.6 years, 24 women) were included in the study. Kellgren Lawrence grade was 1 for 5 knees, 2 for 10, 3 for 17 and 4 for 9. SHCTH was delivered correctly in the joint space in all patients as assessed by US check during the injection and no side effects occurred. Of the 49 knees, 28 had an available 6 months follow-up, while 21 completed the 12 months follow-up, with an attrition mostly related to the COVID 19 pandemic. A rapid and sustained statistically significant decrease of both VAS pain and the WOMAC subscales was observed. The reduction of pain was already significant at 2 weeks, probably thanks to the corticosteroid component. At US evaluation, effusion significantly decreased at all time points. Although SH scores also significantly decreased, the effect on the proportion of affected joints was not as relevant. The reduction of PD was significant until month 9. Detailed results are presented in Table 1. Conclusion: Our data show that US guided SHCTH injections provide a rapid and sustained clinical response in patients with symptomatic OA. Besides the effect on pain, the US data confirm the effect of the drug on the inflammation. US guidance guaranteed the correct placement of the product in all patients and eliminated the bias of wrong placement that may occur with blind injections, thus allowing to draw safe conclusions on the efficacy of SHCTH for the treatment of KOA.","output":"Efficacy of ultrasound guided injections of a cross-linked sodium hyaluronate combined with triamcinolone hexacetonide for osteoarthritis of the knee"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during wastewater treatment leads to concerns about whether this process may represent a focal point for the transmission of COVID-19 An epidemiological analysis, based on a COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, performed on 134 wastewater workers from 59 wastewater treatment plants from the province of Granada (Spain) showed a seroprevalence of 8 95% in IgG for SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to the incidence rate found for the general population of the province (9 6%;95%CI = 7 2C12 8) These findings suggests that current safety measures are sufficient for the protection of workers against SARS-CoV-2 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of International Journal of Water Resources Development is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 associated with wastewater treatment: a seroprevalence study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paracardioscopy provides totally endoscopic access to the heart via a transabdominal, transdiaphragmatic approach.

However, whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection interferes with females fertility and causes different symptoms among pregnant and non-pregnant females remains unknown. Here, we examined the differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers, proinflammatory cytokines, and levels of T cell activation after SARS-CoV-2 sub-lethal infection between pregnant and non-pregnant human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme II (ACE2) transgenic mouse models. Both mice showed elevated levels of viral loads in the lung at 4 days post-infection (dpi). However, viral loads in the pregnant group remained elevated at 7 dpi while decreased in the non-pregnant group. Consistent with viral loads, increased production of proinflammatory cytokines was detected from the pregnant group, and the IgM or SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody in serum of pregnant mice featured delayed elevation compared with non-pregnant mice. Moreover, by accessing kinetics of activation marker expression of peripheral T cells after infection, a lower level of CD8(+) T cell activation was observed in pregnant mice, further demonstrating the difference of immune-response between pregnant and non-pregnant mice. Although vertical transmission did not occur as SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in the uterus and fetus from the infected pregnant mice, a lower pregnancy rate was observed when the mice were infected before embryo implantation after mating, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection may interfere with mices fertility at a specific time window.

Increasingly the focus amongst the policy makers and general public is on the potential third wave. Due to uncertainties regarding emergence of new variants and reinfections, instead of projecting our best guess scenario, in this report we conduct an extensive scenario analysis for Mumbai and track peak fatalities in the coming months in each of these scenarios. Our key conclusions are - As per our model, about 80% of Mumbai population has been exposed to Covid-19 by June 1, 2021. Under the assumption that all who are exposed have immunity against further infection, it is unlikely that Mumbai would see a large third wave. It is the reinfections that may lead to a large wave. Reinfections could occur because of declining antibodies amongst the infected as well as by variants that can break through the immunity provided by prior infections. Even under a reasonably pessimistic scenario we observe the resulting peak to be no larger than that under the second wave. We further observe that under the scenario where the reinfections are mild so that they affect the fatality figures negligibly, where the new variants (beyond the existing delta variant) have a mild impact, as the city opens up, we observe a small wave in the coming months. However, if by then the vaccine coverage is extensive, this wave will be barely noticeable.

Solid-organ transplantation (SOT) recipients are at higher risk due to their suppressed immune system. In this study, we aimed to conduct a systematic review on COVID-19 clinical manifestations and treatment strategies in SOT recipients. METHODS: We searched three databases for relevant terms related to COVID-19 and transplantation. 50 studies, including 337 patients, were reviewed. RESULTS: 236 patients were male, with a mean age of 49.9 years. The most prevalent group was the kidney 57.0%, followed by 17.2% heart, and 13.6% liver. Fever and Cough were the most reported clinical presentations. Infiltration (55.4%) in chest x-ray and ground-glass opacity (67.1%) in CT scans were the most radiological findings. It was found that 96.8% and 72.4% of patients present with CRP level and lymphocytopenia, respectively, and 70.6% of kidney recipients patients presented with high creatinine levels. The most common baseline immunosuppressants were Calcineurin inhibitors (88.9%), and antimetabolites (73.2%).

MethodsUsing an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada, we compared a base case with limited testing, isolation, and quarantine to scenarios with: enhanced case finding; restrictive social distancing measures; or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive social distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected ICU bed occupancy. We present median and credible intervals (CrI) from 100 replicates per scenario using a two-year time horizon. ResultsWe estimated that 56% (95% CrI: 42-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107,000 (95% CrI: 60,760-149,000) cases in hospital and 55,500 (95% CrI: 32,700-75,200) cases in ICU. For fixed duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive social distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the two-year period. Dynamic social distancing interventions could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontarios ICU capacity.

Nonemergency health services, such as cancer screening, have been scaled down or withheld as a result of travel restrictions and resources being redirected to manage the pandemic. The present article discusses the challenges to cancer screening implementation in the pandemic environment, suggesting ways to optimize services for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. METHODS: The manuscript was drafted by a team of public health specialists with expertise in implementation and monitoring of cancer screening. A scoping review of literature revealed the lack of comprehensive guidance on continuation of cancer screening in the midst of waxing and waning of infection. The recommendations in the present article were based on the advisories issued by different health agencies and professional bodies and the authors' understanding of the best practices to maintain quality-assured cancer screening. RESULTS: A well-coordinated approach is required to ensure that essential health services such as cancer management are maintained and elective services are not threatened, especially because of resource constraints. In the context of cancer screening, a few changes in invitation strategies, screening and management protocols and program governance need to be considered to fit into the new normal situation. Restoring public trust in providing efficient and safe services should be one of the key mandates for screening program reorganization. This may be a good opportunity to introduce innovations (eg, telehealth) and consider de-implementing nonCevidence-based practices. It is necessary to consider increased spending on primary health care and incorporating screening services in basic health package.

Data about preventive health care visits and vacciantions of infants and preschool children in pediatrician practises in primary health care in Croatia were extracted from the Central Health Information System of the Republic of Croatia and comparison of 2019 and 2020 data was made, respectively month by month. We analized data only for infants and preschool children, from 0 to 6 years old. In total, during 2019, 268,556 preventive health care visits of infants and preschool children were recorded compared to 252,690 during the 2020, which is decline of 5.9%. The biggest decline, 42.6%, was recorded during the March 2020, but with notable increase in the following months which almost overturned the impact of the initial decline. New decline in the visits was seen during the November, but far smaller than during the begining of epidemic. Regarding vacciantions, during the 2019, 238,799 vaccinations were recorded to be administred, compared to 262,157 during the 2020, which is increase of 9,8%.

Begining of COVID-19 epidemic in Croatia caused a major decline in the number of preventive health care visits and vaccinations already during March 2020.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of a urinary tract infection (UTI) pocket card on preferred antibiotic prescribing for patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a diagnosis of cystitis. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, pre-post study was conducted to compare outcomes following the introduction of a UTI pocket card. The primary outcome was prescribing rates for institutional first-line preferred antibiotics (cephalexin and nitrofurantoin) versus other antimicrobials for cystitis. Secondary outcomes included prescriber adherence to recommended therapy in regards to discharge dose, frequency, duration, and healthcare utilization rates. RESULTS: The study included 915 patients in total, 407 in the preintervention group and 508 in the postintervention group. The frequency of preferred antibiotic prescribing was significantly increased after the introduction of a UTI pocket card compared to prior to its introduction (81.7% vs 72.0%, P = 0.001). Significant increases in prescribing of an appropriate antibiotic dose (78.0% vs 66.8%, P < 0.0001) and frequency (64.2% vs 47.4%, P < 0.0001) were also found post intervention. No significant differences were seen between the pre- and postintervention groups with regards to healthcare utilization rates. CONCLUSION: A UTI pocket card increased preferred antibiotic prescribing for cystitis in the ED. This study provides data on a successful antimicrobial stewardship intervention in the ED setting.","output":"Urinary tract infection pocket card effect on preferred antimicrobial prescribing for cystitis among patients discharged from the emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Canine hepacivirus (CHV) was recently identified in domestic dogs and horses. The finding that CHV is genetically the virus most closely related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) has raised the question of whether HCV might have evolved as the result of close contact between dogs and/or horses and humans. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the NS3/4A serine protease of CHV specifically cleaves human mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-beta (TRIF). The proteolytic activity of CHV NS3/4A was evaluated using a bacteriophage lambda genetic screen. Human MAVS- and TRIF-specific cleavage sites were engineered into the lambda cI repressor. Upon infection of Escherichia coli cells coexpressing these repressors and a CHV NS3/4A construct, lambda phage replicated up to 2000-fold more efficiently than in cells expressing a CHV protease variant carrying the inactivating substitution S139A. Comparable results were obtained when several HCV NS3/4A constructs of genotype 1b were assayed. This indicates that CHV can disrupt the human innate antiviral defense signaling pathway and suggests a possible evolutionary relationship between CHV and HCV.","output":"Canine Hepacivirus NS3 Serine Protease Can Cleave the Human Adaptor Proteins MAVS and TRIF"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibody titers to a group of viral antigens have been determined in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), control groups with inflammatory diseases and normals.

This indicator provides information on the persons state of health. The EQ-5D-Y questionnaire was used to measure health-related quality of life, due to its simplicity and ease of use. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to describe the perceived quality of life in Peruvian school adolescents. Despite the increase in health-related quality of life studies, there is little research on the Latin American population. For this reason, it would be important to have normative data in Peru in order to estimate the impact on health-related quality of life in adolescents, since it allows comparisons of health-related quality of life between the general population and the pathological population. The results have shown that there are differences in the EQ-5D-Y between ages, as well as between weight groups established according to body mass index. In conclusion, adolescents have perceived favorable health-related quality of life sensations and the EQ-5D-Y has shown to be a feasible and useful questionnaire, in addition to having internationally recognized and validated cross-cultural characteristics. ABSTRACT: (1) Introduction: There is a growing interest in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adolescent population. The EQ-5D-Y is a generic HRQOL instrument that allows adolescents to understand the health status of different levels of physical, mental, and social health. This study was carried out with an adolescent population in Peru. The main objective of this article is to report the normative values of the EQ-5D-Y questionnaire in Peruvian adolescents. (2) Methods: The EQ-5D-Y questionnaire was administered to Peruvian adolescent students. A total of 1229 young people participated in the survey. The EQ-5D-Y score was reflected as a function of sex and age. (3) Results: The mean utility index of the EQ-5D-Y for the total sample was 0.890; this rating was significantly better for males at (0.899) and females at (0.881). The ceiling effect was higher for adolescent males with (47.3) females (40.7).

To better understand the pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2, we developed a rhesus macaque model to mimic natural infection via the nasal route, resulting in the SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding in the nose and stool up to 27 days. Importantly, we observed the pathological progression of marked interstitial pneumonia in the infected animals on 5-7 dpi, with virus dissemination widely occurring in the lower respiratory tract and lymph nodes, and viral RNA was consistently detected from 5 to 21 dpi. During the infection period, the kinetics response of T cells was revealed to contribute to COVID-19 progression. Our findings implied that the antiviral response of T cells was suppressed after 3 days post infection, which might be related to increases in the Treg cell population in PBMCs.

The article under review describes an approach to achieve this goal by developing an antiviral rhodanine derivative effective against enveloped viruses targeting the viral lipid membrane. By intercalating into the viral membrane, the compound irreversibly inactivates the virions with virucidal effects. Potential toxic effects on hosts could be minimized by continuous regeneration of cellular membranes. The present strategy exploits the therapeutic window that exists between static viral membranes and biogenic cellular membranes and provides a useful guideline for future research endeavors towards broad-spectrum antiviral approaches for enveloped viruses.

First, we show that burley varieties KT 204LC and NCBH 129LC accumulate TSNAs to different levels but not as a result of a variety-specific abundance of TSNA precursors. Next, we measured the levels of reactive oxygen species, and we show that the variety that accumulates more TSNAs, NCBH 129LC, had significantly higher levels of hydrogen peroxide than KT 204LC. The NCBH 129LC also has more oxidatively damaged and glutathionylated proteins. Finally, we analyzed the antioxidant levels in KT 204LC and NCBH 129LC and their tolerance to oxidative stress. NCBH 129LC contained more of the essential antioxidant glutathione and was more tolerant to the oxidative stress-generating compound paraquat.

It is the most severe viral disease that adversely affects the sericulture industry. Breeding BmNPV-resistant silkworm varieties is the most economic and effective solution. However, BmNPVs from different geographical strains have different pathogenicities. This brings the challenges of cultivating BmNPV-resistant silkworm varieties with wider adaptabilities. In this study, the genomes of two BmNPV strains (BmNPV ZJ and BmNPV YN) were sequenced and characterized to compare the difference in pathogenicity between the two strains. A total of 76 different genes in these two viruses were found with amino acid mutations. These included genes were associated with BmNPV replication and infection. In addition, the relative gene expression of the BmNPV YN strain was lower than that BmNPV ZJ. Thus, we speculate that the mutations in some genes may affect viral functions and may be the cause of the higher pathogenicity of BmNPV YN despite its lower proliferation rate. The present research provides new clues for further exploring the mechanism determining the difference in pathogenicity of different BmNPV strains. ABSTRACT: The pathogenicity of different concentrations of Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus- Zhenjiang strain (BmNPV ZJ) and Yunnan strain (BmNPV YN) was assessed in Baiyu larvae. The structures of the two viral strains were observed by negative-staining electron microscopy, and their proliferation was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The genomic sequences of these two viruses were obtained to investigate the differences in their pathogenicity. The lethal concentration 50 (LC(50)) of BmNPV ZJ against Baiyu larvae was higher than that of BmNPV YN, indicating a relatively more robust pathogenicity in BmNPV YN. Electron microscopic images showed that the edges of BmNPV YN were clearer than those of BmNPV ZJ. The qPCR analysis demonstrated significantly higher relative expressions of immediately early 1 gene (ie-1), p143, vp39, and polyhedrin genes (polh) in BmNPV ZJ than in BmNPV YN at 12C96 h. The complete genomes of BmNPV ZJ and BmNPV YN were, respectively, 135,895 bp and 143,180 bp long, with 141 and 145 coding sequences and 40.93% and 39.71% GC content. Considering the BmNPV ZJ genome as a reference, 893 SNP loci and 132 InDel mutations were observed in the BmNPV YN genome, resulting in 106 differential gene sequences. Among these differential genes, 76 (including 22 hub genes and 35 non-hub genes) possessed amino acid mutations. Thirty genes may have been related to viral genome replication and transcription and five genes may have been associated with the viral oral infection. These results can help in understanding the mechanisms of pathogenicity of different strains of BmNPV in silkworms.","output":"Pathogenicity Detection and Genome Analysis of Two Different Geographic Strains of BmNPV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the face of the global pandemic of coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19), peoples adherence to precautionary behavioral measures (e.g. social distancing) largely influences the effectiveness of those measures in containing the spread of the coronavirus.

In this immune pathway, viral peptides within infected cells are presented to T-lymphocytes by the polymorphic human leukocyte antigens (HLA). HLA alleles exert selective pressure on the peptide regions and immune escape mutations that occur at some of the targeted sites can enable the virus to adapt to the infected host. The pattern of ongoing immune escape and reversion associated with several human HLA alleles has been studied extensively. Such mutations revert upon transmission to a host without the HLA allele because the escape mutation incurs a fitness cost. However, to-date there has been little attempt to study permanent loss of CTL epitopes due to escape mutations without an effect on fitness. RESULTS: Here, we set out to determine the extent of adaptation of HIV-1 to three well-characterized HLA alleles during the initial exposure of the virus to the human cytotoxic immune responses following transmission from chimpanzee. We generated a chimpanzee consensus sequence to approximate the virus sequence that was initially transmitted to the human host and used a method based on peptide binding affinity to HLA crystal structures to predict peptides that were potentially targeted by the HLA alleles on this sequence. Next, we used codon-based phylogenetic models to quantify the average selective pressure that acted on these regions during the period immediately following the zoonosis event, corresponding to the branch of the phylogenetic tree leading to the common ancestor of all of the HIV-1 sequences. Evidence for adaptive evolution during this period was observed at regions recognised by HLA A*6801 and A*0201, both of which are common in African populations. No evidence of adaptive evolution was observed at sites targeted by HLA-B*2705, which is a rare allele in African populations. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the ancestral HIV-1 virus experienced a period of positive selective pressure due to immune responses associated with HLA alleles that were common in the infected human population. We propose that this resulted in permanent escape from immune responses targeting unconstrained regions of the virus.","output":"Evidence of HIV-1 adaptation to host HLA alleles following chimp-to-human transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animal models of human diseases are vital in better understanding the mechanism of pathogenesis and essential for evaluating and validating potential therapeutic interventions.

Estrogen deficiency accelerates the aging of women. Oxidative stress damage is regarded as the main pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the bone microenvironment plays a role in osteoblast and osteoclast apoptosis. Improving the oxidative state is essential for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. There are three classes of antioxidant defense systems in the body to eliminate free radicals and peroxides including antioxidant substances, antioxidant enzymes, and repair enzymes. In our review, we demonstrated the mechanism of antioxidants and their effect on bone metabolism in detail. We concluded that glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) conversion involved the PI3K/Akt-Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and that the antioxidant enzyme-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway of osteoblasts was necessary for the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Since the current therapeutic effects of targeting bone cells are not significant, improving the systemic peroxidation state and then regulating bone homeostasis will be a new method for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.","output":"Three Classes of Antioxidant Defense Systems and the Development of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we show that human parainfluenza viruses and Sendai virus (SeV), like other respiratory viruses, use TMPRSS2 for their activation.

Our objective was to evaluate the socioeconomic and psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on radiologists. MATERIAL AND METHODS: French radiologists were invited to answer an online survey during the pandemic through mailing lists. The questionnaire was accessible for nine days. It covered socio-demographic information, exposure to COVID-19 at work and impact on work organisation, and included the Insomnia Severity Index and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Outcomes were moderate to severe insomnia, definite symptoms of depression or anxiety. Risk and protective factors were identified through multivariate binary logistic regression. RESULTS: 1515 radiologists answered the survey. Overall, 674 (44.5 %) worked in a highCOVID-19 density area, 671 (44.3 %) were women, and 809 (53.4 %) worked in private practice. Among responders, 186 (12.3 %) expressed insomnia, 222 (14.6 %) anxiety, and 189 (12.5 %) depression symptoms. Lack of protective equipment, increased teleradiology activity and negative impact on education were risk factors for insomnia (respectively OR [95 %CI]:1.7[1.1-2.7], 1.5[1.1-2.2], and 2.5[1.8-3.6]). Female gender, respiratory history, working in COVID-19 high density area, increase of COVID-19 related activity, and impacted education were risk factors for anxiety (OR[95 %CI]:1.7[1.2-2.3], 2[1.1-3.4], 1.5[1.1-2], 1.2[1-1.4], and 2.1[1.5-3]). Conversely, working in a public hospital was a protective factor against insomnia, anxiety, and depression (OR[95 %CI]:0.4[0.2-0.7], 0.6[0.4-0.9], and 0.5[0.3-0.8]). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 pandemic, many radiologists expressed depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms. Working in a public hospital was a protective factor against every psychological symptom.

We show that the time series of infected population and deaths of the most impacted and unprepared countries exhibits an asymptotic power law behavior, compatible with the propagation of a signal in a fractal network. We propose a model which predicts an asymptotically self-similar expansion of deaths in time before containment, and the final death toll under total containment measures, as a function of the delay in taking those measures after the expansion is observed. The physics of the model resembles the expansion of a flame in a homogeneous domain with a fractal dimension 3.75. After containment measures are taken, the natural fractal structure of the network is drastically altered and a secondary evolution is observed. This evolution, akin to the homogeneous combustion in a static isolated enclosure with a final quenching, has a characteristic time of 20.1 days, according to available data of the pandemic behavior in China. The proposed model is remarkably consistent with available data, which supports the simplifying hypotheses made in the model.

The generation pathways of halogen radicals from 3DOM* is still not fully understood. In this study, the generation of halogen radicals from DOM was investigated with Suwanee River fulvic acid (SRFA) as a representative and detailed generation pathways were further revealed with anthraquinone-2-sodium sulfonate (AQ2S) as a triplet sensitizer. The results showed that in SRFA solutions with halogen ions, various halogen radicals can be generated. Among which, Br is formed by the reaction of Br- with 3AQ2S*, and Cl is produced by the reaction of Cl- with AQ2S+ that generated in the presence of dissolved oxygen (DO). Cl2- and Br2- were generated via the subsequent combination of Cl/Br with another Cl-/Br-. In solutions without DO, BrCl- is mainly generated through the combination of Br with Cl-, and BrCl- could also be generated through the combination of Cl with Br- in solutions with DO.

As a precautionary measure, many clinical studies halted enrollment during the initial surge of the global Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. In this case report, we detail the successful treatment of a relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patient treated with an anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy immediately following clinical recovery from COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: The 57 year old Caucasian male patient had a 4-year history of MM and was considered penta-refractory upon presentation for CAR T cell therapy. He had a history of immunosuppression and received one dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC) the day prior to COVID-19 diagnosis; this patient was able to mount a substantial immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antiviral antibodies remain detectable 2 months after receiving anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy. The recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this patient did not exacerbate CAR T-associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and conversely the CAR T cell therapy did not result in COVID-19-related complications. One month after CAR T cell infusion, the patient was assessed to have an unconfirmed partial response per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. CONCLUSION: Our case adds important context around treatment choice for MM patients in the era of COVID-19 and whether CAR T therapy can be administered to patients who have recovered from COVID-19. As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues, the decision of whether to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion weighing the potential risks and benefits of therapy. This case suggests that it is possible to successfully complete anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy after recovery from COVID-19.

In response to this crisis, the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief funds programs that serve orphans and vulnerable children affected by HIV and their families. These programs retain case workers, known as activistas, who provide and refer beneficiaries to services to increase beneficiaries' knowledge of their HIV status and to improve retention in care among those living with HIV. To improve program effectiveness, implementing organizations need to understand how different case management attributes affect beneficiary outcomes. We applied fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), based on 119 interviews, to identify the combinations of case management attributes that led to (1) increased knowledge of HIV status, and (2) high percentages of beneficiaries with known HIV status. We identified 6 pathways for the first outcome and 5 pathways for the second outcome. Each pathway demonstrates an alternative combination of conditions that positively influences the outcome and is equally sufficient in achieving the outcome. To improve knowledge of HIV status, programs in a similar context as this study may select any of the identified pathways based on their existing resources and work on ensuring the presence of each of the conditions in the pathway. Overall, based on the presence of some of the factors in multiple pathways, we conclude that to improve knowledge of HIV status it is important that programs implement a formal process to assign cases considering case complexity and existing caseload to reduce overwork; provide activistas with external support such as weekly care team meetings, weekly supervisor meetings, and/or low supervision ratios; hire experienced activistas; provide all activistas with follow-up trainings so they have the tools to address challenging cases; expand the financial resources offered to activistas; and reimburse activistas for work-related expenses.","output":"A Qualitative Comparative Analysis of the Drivers of HIV Status Knowledge in Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Mozambique."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After its outbreak in China, the novel COronaVIrus Disease 19 is spreading across the globe.

Multiple surgical professional bodies initially recommended appendicitis be managed conservatively or with judicious open surgery to mitigate potential risks with Covid-19 transmission. This study compares the investigation, operative findings and outcomes of patients who underwent appendicectomy before and after the National lockdown. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective cohort study of patients who had emergency appendicectomy in four West of Scotland hospitals between September 2019 and November 2020. Electronic records were interrogated and patients dichotomised into two groups with those presenting before the introduction of the UK National lockdown of 23(rd) March 2020 compared to those presenting post-lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 559 appendicectomies were performed (280 pre-lockdown and 279 post-lockdown) in four hospitals and included in the analyses. More males than females had appendicectomy in the post-lockdown period (60.6% vs 52.1%, p 0.044). Pre-operative CT scanning was performed more often post-lockdown (71.7% vs 56.8%, p < 0.001) and an open approach was adopted more frequently post-lockdown (19.0% vs 3.6%, p < 0.001). The proportion of operations for complicated appendicitis increased post-lockdown (31.9% vs 22.1%, p = 0.009). Median hospital stay was equal in both groups (3 vs 3 days, p = 0.787).

METHODS: We prospectively studied 103 in-patients admitted to a Northern-Italian hospital (age 66.1  14.1 years, 70 males) for severely-symptomatic COVID-19. Fifty-two subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection but mild COVID-19 symptoms (mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 patients) and 206 subjects without SARS-CoV-2 infection were controls. We measured 25OHD and IL-6 levels at admission and focused on respiratory outcome during hospitalization. RESULTS: Severely-symptomatic COVID-19 patients had lower 25OHD levels (18.2  11.4 ng/mL) than mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 patients and non-SARS-CoV-2-infected controls (30.3  8.5 ng/mL and 25.4  9.4 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). 25OHD and IL-6 levels were respectively lower and higher in severely-symptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care Unit [(ICU), 14.4  8.6 ng/mL and 43.0 (19.0-56.0) pg/mL, respectively], than in those not requiring ICU admission [22.4  1.4 ng/mL, p = 0.0001 and 16.0 (8.0-32.0) pg/mL, p = 0.0002, respectively].

However, it is toxic to the eye and skin. This study investigated the neutralization of BAK using ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation as an effort to reduce BAK toxicity potential. METHODS: BAK solutions were irradiated with a germicidal UVC lamp at various doses. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) were then exposed to the UVC-irradiated BAK solutions for 5 minutes. After exposure, the cultures were assessed for metabolic activity using PrestoBlue; for cell viability using confocal microscopy with viability dyes; and for tight junction proteins using immunofluorescence staining for zonula occludens (ZO)-1. RESULTS: UVC radiation reduced BAK toxicity on cell metabolic activity in a dose-dependent manner. When the solution depth of BAK was 1.7 mm, the UVC doses needed to completely neutralize the toxicity of BAK 0.005% and 0.01% were 2.093 J/cm2 and 8.374 J/cm2, respectively. The cultures treated with UVC-neutralized BAK showed similar cell metabolic activity and cell viability to those treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (p = 0.806 a?? 1.000). The expression of ZO-1 was greatly disturbed by untreated BAK; in contrast, ZO-1 proteins were well maintained after exposure to UVC-neutralized BAK. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the cell toxicity of BAK can be neutralized by UVC radiation, which provides a unique way of detoxifying BAK residues.

In the times of ever-growing patient population on precision oncology therapies, timely identification of drug induced lung injury can be challenging. Here we highlight pulmonary toxicity as an adverse effect of brentuximab vedotin (BV). Case Report: A 70-year-old male, former smoker with a recent diagnosis of advanced stage classic Hodgkin's lymphoma recently started on BV, presented with two days of progressive dyspnea, fever and productive cough. He denied exposure to sick contacts and recent travel. Of note, he was hospitalized ten days earlier for suspected pneumonia and had completed a course of antibiotics. Vital signs were notable for temperature 101.7F, heart rate 110 beats/minute, respiratory rate 30 breaths/minute and oxygen saturation of 90% on 6L of oxygen. Physical examination was noteworthy for bibasilar rhonchi. Lab workup was unremarkable and COVID-19 test was negative. Imaging studies displayed new bilateral basal infiltrates on CXR and CT scan of the chest demonstrated new alveolar opacities involving the lower lobes, and interval improvement was noted in the upper lobe opacities. He was treated for presumed pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics. However, his oxygen requirements continued to increase, necessitating a further infectious and rheumatologic workup which was negative. After thorough diagnostic evaluation, in the absence of other plausible etiology, the patient's symptoms were attributed to pneumonitis secondary to the chemotherapeutic agent BV. Henceforth, intravenous steroids were initiated which resulted in clinical improvement. Further treatment with BV was withheld and he was discharged on a steroid taper. One month later, a subsequent CT scan of the chest demonstrated complete resolution of bilateral alveolar opacities. Discussion: BV is a CD30 directed antibody-drug conjugate used in advanced or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is known to cause a higher rate of pulmonary toxicity when combined with bleomycin containing regimens with a reported incidence of 40%, hence this combination is contraindicated. However, the incidence of pneumonitis is noted to be only 5% in patients receiving BV in combination with non-bleomycin regimens, which was the case in our patient in lieu of his two back-to-back hospitalizations after receiving two cycles of BV. The exact mechanism of action is unclear but is probably due to hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Although it is a diagnosis of exclusion, a high degree of suspicion is crucial for prompt cessation of the drug in order to prevent adverse outcomes.","output":"Deceptive lungs: Is it brentuximab induced pneumonitis or pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This retracts the article on p 419 in vol 36, PMID: 33487918 ]","output":"Retraction: Convalescent plasma therapy in COVID 19: Every dark cloud has a silver lining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global pandemic.

During the first 14 days of hospitalization, patients with deteriorating symptoms were administered QPD along with Western medicine therapy (the antiviral medicine selected from interferon, lopinavir, or arbidol). The clinical characteristics and blood laboratory indices (blood routine, inflammatory factors, and multi-organ biochemical indices) were examined, and the total lung severity scores were evaluated in each patient by reviewing chest computed tomography before treatment and at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Before QPD treatment, the combined treatment group showed higher blood C-reactive protein levels and more severe pulmonary inflammation and clinical symptoms than the Western medicine treatment group. Both groups met the discharge criteria after a similar length of hospitalization. At the end of treatment, circulating white blood cells, total lymphocyte count, and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase levels improved dramatically in both groups (P < 0.05). In contrast, C-reactive protein, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-myocardial band, lactate dehydrogenase, and blood urea nitrogen levels were improved only in the combined treatment group (P < 0.05), and C-reactive protein and creatine kinase were the most pronounced (P < 0.01). Compared with baseline, at the end of treatment, the proportion of patients with normal values of C-reactive protein, total lymphocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase were increased in the combined treatment group (P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was observed in the Western medicine treatment group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of QPD with Western medicine demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects compared with those of only Western medicine in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19; however, neither mortality nor length of hospitalization was affected. Moreover, the combined treatment tended to mitigate the extent of multi-organ impairment. Long-term randomized controlled trials with follow-up evaluations are required to confirm the results presented here.","output":"Clinical retrospective study on the efficacy of Qingfei Paidu decoction combined with Western medicine for COVID-19 treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report about the successful extension of the class of organogtetrel sulfide clusters by further examples of the still rare silicon-based species, synthesized from RSiCl 3 with R = phenyl (Ph, I ), naphthyl (Np, II ), and styryl (Sty, III ) with Na 2 S.

The story of SARS illustrates vividly some NOS features advocated in the school science curriculum, including the tentative nature of scientific knowledge, theory-laden observation and interpretation, multiplicity of approaches adopted in scientific inquiry, the inter-relationship between science and technology, and the nexus of science, politics, social and cultural practices. The story also provided some insights into a number of NOS features less emphasised in the school curriculumfor example, the need to combine and coordinate expertise in a number of scientific fields, the intense competition between research groups (suspended during the SARS crisis), the significance of affective issues relating to intellectual honesty and the courage to challenge authority, the pressure of funding issues on the conduct of research and the peace of mind of researchers, These less emphasised elements provided empirical evidence that NOS knowledge, like scientific knowledge itself, changes over time. They reflected the need for teachers and curriculum planners to revisit and reconsider whether the features of NOS currently included in the school science curriculum are fully reflective of the practice of science in the 21st century. In this paper, we also report on how we made use of extracts from the news reports and documentaries on SARS, together with episodes from the scientists interviews, to develop a multimedia instructional package for explicitly teaching the prominent features of NOS and scientific inquiry identified in the SARS research.","output":"Turning Crisis into Opportunity: Nature of Science and Scientific Inquiry as Illustrated in the Scientific Research on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: With the advent of COVID-19 in Pakistan, the already fragmented blood transfusion services (BTS) received a severe blow, putting the lives of transfusion-dependent thalassemia children on stake. This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 on blood transfusion therapy (BTT) of thalassemia patients and suggest ways to ensure safe and reliable blood supplies amid such health crises. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2019 (before COVID-19) to July 2020 (during COVID-19) based on the data provided by a thalassemia center, named Help International Welfare Trust, Karachi, Pakistan. SPSS version 24.0 was used for the data analysis. Data were described in the form of means and percentages. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the consumption of PRBCs bags after the emergence of COVID-19 (P=0.002). Moreover, the number of thalassemia patients receiving BTT was dropped by 10.56% during the pandemic. There was a strong negative correlation observed between the rising cases of COVID-19 in Pakistan and the number of patients missing their therapy sessions (r=-0.914, P=0.030). A considerable decline in the reserves of all Rhesus-negative blood groups amid the COVID-19 outbreak was also observed. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the already suboptimal care catered to thalassemia patients in Karachi, Pakistan. The fear of the virus contraction coupled with the lockdown and restricted mobility has disrupted the entire transfusion chain from donor to the recipient. Collaborated efforts by the government and healthcare authorities are essential to ensure sufficient blood for thalassemia patients amid the pandemic.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients of Karachi, Pakistan: A single-center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human sense of smell is the unique sense through which the olfactory system can identify aromatic molecules within the air and provide a taste sensation. Still, also it plays an essential role in several other functions, warning about environmental safety and even impacts our emotional lives. Recently, olfactory impairment has become an issue of interest due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dysfunction may vary from only reduced smell detection (hyposmia) to complete loss of it (anosmia) but also includes changes in the normal perception of odors (parosmia). Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) are the modalities of choice to evaluate the olfactory pathways. CT is the initial imaging modality for olfactory disturbances, allowing recognition of sinonasal pathologies, inflammatory processes, or bone-related tumors. MRI with dedicated protocols for olfactory disorders enables a detailed assessment of the sinonasal compartment and the anterior cranial fossa. Provides a better depiction of olfactory bulb volume, morphology and signal intensity, as well the status of signal intensity of the central olfactory projection areas. Several diseases can affect the olfactory nerve, such as congenital disorders, trauma, inflammatory or infectious diseases, neoplasms, and even post-operative involvement.

The clinical phenotype of dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency, characterized by allergic manifestations, increased infections, and increased IgE levels, overlaps with the clinical presentation of atopic dermatitis (AD). Despite the identification of metabolomics and cytokine biomarkers, distinguishing between the two conditions remains clinically challenging. The present study used a label-free untargeted proteomics approach using liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry with network pathway analysis to identify the differentially regulated serum proteins and the associated metabolic pathways altered between the groups. Serum samples from DOCK8 (n = 10), AD (n = 9) patients and healthy control (Ctrl) groups (n = 5) were analyzed. Based on the proteomics profile, the PLS-DA score plot between the three groups showed a clear group separation and sample clustering (R2 = 0.957, Q2 = 0.732). Significantly differentially abundant proteins (p < 0.05, FC cut off 2) were identified between DOCK8-deficient and AD groups relative to Ctrl (n = 105, and n = 109) and between DOCK8-deficient and AD groups (n = 85). Venn diagram analysis revealed a differential regulation of 24 distinct proteins from among the 85 between DOCK8-deficient and AD groups, including claspin, haptoglobin-related protein, immunoglobulins, complement proteins, fibulin, and others. Receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis identified claspin and haptoglobin-related protein, as potential biomarkers with the highest sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 1), capable of distinguishing between patients with DOCK8 deficiency and AD. Network pathway analysis between DOCK8-deficiency and AD groups revealed that the identified proteins centered around the dysregulation of ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Herein, proteomic profiling of DOCK8-deficiency and AD groups was carried out to determine alterations in the proteomic profiles and identify a panel of the potential proteomics biomarker with possible diagnostic applications.

METHODS: Nineteen breast cancer patients were randomized to intervention or control for the duration of chemotherapy (16C24 weeks). The intervention was one aerobic exercise session at 80C90% VO(2max) for 25 min/week and 65%-75% VO(2max) for  50 min/week. Adherence to the tailored home-based program was assessed by heart rate monitors. Acceptability, tolerability, feasibility, efficacy, change in VO(2max), and patient reported outcomes, safety, and clinical events were assessed. RESULTS: 25.7% of eligible women consented (acceptability). Adherence was 87.6%. Women were not able to maintain exercise intensity as chemotherapy progressed (23.7% of exercise minutes were completed at prescribed heart rate during maintenance). Efficacy of the intervention was demonstrated by maintenance of VO(2max) (?1.0  13.2%) compared to (?27.5  7.4%) the control group. Further, during and after therapy, patients in the intervention arm reported less fatigue (control-baseline: 14.4  15.9; midpoint: 19.0  11.4; follow-up: 29.4  20.0; intervention-baseline: 29.2  24.6; midpoint: 24.6  14.4; follow-up: 23.6  11.9), impairment in activities (control-baseline: 13.7  16.0; midpoint: 32.8  17.0; follow-up: 58.6  27.9; intervention-baseline: 38.7  31.8; midpoint: 47.1  27.5; follow-up: 47.5  31.0), and pain (control-baseline: 80.8  17.1; midpoint: 73.9  20.7; follow-up: 50.7  25.7; intervention-baseline: 68.7  28.4; midpoint: 61.4  22.5; follow-up: 65.3  22.4).

However, few studies have been conducted to investigate whether IN is effective even in treatment-refractory cases, such as in those with steroid dependency and anti-TNF refractoriness. METHODS In the INDIGO study, 86 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to an IN group (0.5-2.0 g daily) or placebo group. The rate of clinical response (CR), mucosal healing (MH), and change in fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels was compared between refractory [patients with steroid-dependent disease, previous use of anti-TNF-, and concomitant use of immunomodulators (IM)] and non-refractory patients. We also analyzed factors predicting CR and MH at week 8. RESULTS The rates of CR of IN group were significantly higher than placebo group, even in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p < 0.001), previous use of anti-TNF- (p = 0.002), and concomitant use of IM (p = 0.013). The rates of MH in IN group were significantly higher than in placebo group in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p = 0.009). In the IN group, median FCP levels, at week 8, were significantly lower than baseline in patients with steroid-dependent disease and patients with the previous use of anti-TNF- (p < 0.001, respectively).

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)- indicated absence of drugs confirmed by testing and as THC + confirmed THC without another drug present. RESULTS Of the 4849 patients included, 1373 (28.3%) were THC+. The THC + cohort was younger, had more males, and was more likely to be injured by penetrating mechanism (P < 0.001 for all) than THC-. THC + patients had shorter median length of stay (LOS) (P < 0.001) and intensive care unit LOS (P < 0.001).

This study aimed to understand students mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest measures to prevent depressive anxiety among them. METHOD: Undergraduate and graduate students at one national and two private universities in the Kansai region were surveyed. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6 was used to assess the students mental health. Questions were included to assess students awareness of COVID-19 and changes in lifestyle habits, including drinking, smoking, gaming, and other addictive habits. The University of Tokyo Health Sociology's version of the Sense of Coherence Scale was used to assess the ability to cope with stressors. RESULTS: More than 50% of undergraduate and graduate students felt more than mild depressive anxiety and approximately 11% felt severe depressive anxiety, indicating that anxiety about the future worsened the levels of depressive anxiety. Life with reversed day and night schedules was associated with the worsening of depressive anxiety levels, but a high sense of coherence was associated with decreased levels of depressive anxiety. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic triggered isolation which led to worsening the mental health of undergraduate and graduate students.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019-2020 corona virus pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV. It is thought to have a zoonotic origin. The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking. People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. COVID-19 patients currently remain the primary source of infection. An epidemiological survey indicated that the general population is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The spectrum of this disease ranges from mild to life-threatening. Fever is the most common symptom, although older people and those with comorbidities may experience fever later in the disease. Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying percentages. Some cases might progress promptly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multiple organ function failure. Asymptomatic carriers and those in the incubation period may also be infectious.Aim. To determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19 at the screening clinic of a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan.Methodology. In this descriptive study, we analysed data of patients presenting to a newly established Covid-19 screening clinic in Rehman Medical Institute. Anyone who reported with new onset fever and/or cough was tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the screening clinic. We documented and analysed demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, which included age, sex, travel history, clinical features, comorbidities and laboratory data of patients confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR at Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar, Pakistan from 15 March till 21 April 2020. Paired specimens of throat swabs and nasal swabs were obtained from 845 patients, ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by the RT-PCR assay.Results. A total of 845 specimens were taken as described above. The positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 was about 14.3%. Male and older population had a significantly higher positive rate. Of the 121 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 43.19 years (sd, 17.57) and the infections were more frequent among male gender accounting for 85 (70.25a??%) patients. Common symptoms included fever (88 patients, 72a??%), cough (72 patients, 59.5a??%) and shortness of breath (69 patients, 57a??%). Twenty-two (18a??%) patients had recent travel history outside Pakistan in the previous 14 days, the majority of whom had returned back from Saudi Arabia.Conclusion. In this single-centre, prospective, descriptive study, fever, cough and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. Old age (>50 years), chronic underlying comorbidities and travel history may be risk factors. Therefore, we concluded that viral nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection in a screening clinic, which helped with isolation and cohorting of these patients.","output":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases at a screening clinic during the early outbreak period: a single-centre study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides an introduction to the special issue on post-neoliberalism.

The exposure to predation and environmental perturbations in the canopy space further obstruct the movement process. How to effectively move through the canopy space thus requires effective navigation tactics and movement skills. In the Australian stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum, the first instar nymphs hatch on the forest floor and disperse toward tree canopies in the daytime. Here, we address the movement ecology of dispersal in the E. tiaratum nymphs under controlled laboratory conditions. We found the newly hatched nymphs ascend with high endurance, accomplishing 100+ m within 60 minutes. Their navigation toward open canopies is generally directed by negative gravitaxis, positive phototaxis and tactic response to vertically oriented contrast patterns. We also found nymphal E. tiaratum use directed jumping to cross air gaps and respond to tactile stimulations and potential threat with self-dropping reflexes, actions which both lead to aerial descent. In sum, the post-hatch dispersal in E. tiaratum consists of various visually mediated movements both on vegetational structures and in air, within which context gliding is an effective mechanism for height recovery after predator- and perturbation-induced descent. These results further support the fundamental role of a diurnal temporal niche, in addition to spatial niche, to the evolution of gliding in wingless arboreal invertebrates.","output":"Canopy parkour: movement ecology of post-hatch dispersal in a gliding nymphal stick insect (Extatosoma tiaratum)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The component separation technique (CST) was developed to improve the integrity of abdominal wall reconstruction for large, complex hernias. Open CST necessitates large subcutaneous skin flaps and, therefore, is associated with significant ischemic wound complications. The minimally invasive or endoscopic component separation technique (MICST) has been suggested in preliminary studies to reduce wound complication rates post-operatively. In this study, we systematically reviewed the literature comparing open versus endoscopic component separation and performed a meta-analysis of controlled studies. METHODS A comprehensive search of electronic databases was completed. All English, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized comparison study, and case series were included. All comparison studies included in the meta-analysis were assessed independently by two reviewers for methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools. RESULTS 63 primary studies (3,055 patients) were identified; 7 controlled studies and 56 case series. The total wound complication rate was lower for MICST (20.6 %) compared to Open CST (34.6 %). MICST compared to open CST was shown to have lower rates of superficial infections (3.5 vs 8.9 %), skin dehiscence (5.3 vs 8.2 %), necrosis (2.1 vs 6.8 %), hematoma/seroma formation (4.6 vs 7.4 %), fistula tract formation (0.4 vs 1.0 %), fascial dehiscence (0.0 vs 0.4 %), and mortality (0.4 vs 0.6 %.) The open component CST did have lower rates of intra-abdominal abscess formation (3.8 vs 4.6 %) and recurrence rates (11.1 vs 15.1 %). The meta-analysis included 7 non-randomized controlled studies (387 patients). A similar suggestive overall trend was found favoring MICST, although most types of wound complications did not show to significance. MICST was associated with a significantly decreased rate of fascial dehiscence and was shown to be significantly shorter procedure. CONCLUSION This systematic review and meta-analysis comparing MICST to open CST suggests MICST is associated with decreased overall post-operative wound complication rates. Further prospective studies are needed to verify these findings.","output":"Endoscopic versus open component separation: systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Webpage: Attempts in the United States to use legal means to hold the People's Republic of China responsible for its role in novel coronavirus-linked harms are legally flawed and politically fraught So far, they have taken several forms, each problematic in its own way--often a case of bad lawmaking or reflecting heated politics, domestically and internationally This need not be so Other, more promising ways to use law to promote accountability and, more importantly, to help reduce risks of future similar crises are possible But they require a more engaged and less adversarial approach to international legal norms and related political ones--and to China--than will be forthcoming from Washington, at least under the Trump administration To date, American efforts to invoke law to address China's role and hold China accountable for the COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] pandemic have included: lawsuits brought--necessarily under existing law--by private class action plaintiffs and state attorneys general;proposed legislation to strip China of immunity from suit and create new grounds for legal liability;and calls from members of Congress, the Trump administration, and others to, in various forms, sanction or punish China through proposed measures that implicate international law COVID-19 (Disease);Liability (Law);China","output":"Pursuing Politics Through Legal Means: Efforts to Hold China Responsible for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the mental health situation and job stress levels of Funeral Service Workers (FSW) during the first months of the pandemic.

The endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria interact to maintain the normal function of cells by maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis. As proven by previous research, glycine (Gly) can regulate the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and enhance mitochondrial function to improve oocyte maturation in vitro. The effect of Gly on ER function during oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) is not clear. In this study, we induced an ER stress model with thapsigargin (TG) to explore whether Gly can reverse the ER stress induced by TG treatment and whether it is associated with calcium regulation. The results showed that the addition of Gly could improve the decrease in the average cumulus diameter, the first polar body excretion rate caused by TG-induced ER stress, the cleavage rate and the blastocyst rate. Gly supplementation could reduce the ER stress induced by TG by significantly improving the ER levels and significantly downregulating the expression of genes related to ER stress (Xbp1, ATF4, and ATF6). Moreover, Gly also significantly alleviated the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential ( m) to improve mitochondrial function in porcine oocytes exposed to TG. Furthermore, Gly reduced the [Ca(2+)](i) and mitochondrial Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](m)) levels and restored the ER Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](ER)) levels in TG-exposed porcine oocytes. Moreover, we found that the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) may be caused by changes in the distribution and expression of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP(3)R1) and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), while Gly can restore the distribution and expression of IP(3)R1 and VDAC1 to normal levels. Apoptosis-related indexes (Caspase 3 activity and Annexin-V) and gene expression Bax, Cyto C, and Caspase 3) were significantly increased in the TG group, but they could be restored by adding Gly.

On the other hand, the oncology patient sometimes can show asymptomatic COVID-19 disease with a risk of longer viral shedding and spreading the infection to others immunosuppressed individuals. Oncology patients also regularly travel between hospital and sometimes lodge in boarding house for routine chemotherapy. As we known, prevention strategy for COVID-19 among pediatric oncology patients can be implemented by minimizing these risks factors for transmission by identifying all patients infected with COVID-19. Here, we report our experience before and after implementing COVID-19 testing policy of patients with hematology and oncology diseases in our center. METHOD: We collected data of pediatric oncology patients admitted to Hasan Sadikin General hospital between July 1(st), 2020 to January 8(th), 2021. The data consisted of the total number of patients and COVID-19 status by using SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) performed in the patient during two periods. In the first period, we performed NAAT if the patient was suspected of COVID-19. In the second period, after the policy was changed, NAAT was performed routinely as screening for all oncologic patients admitted to the hospital. RESULTS: Between July 1(st) to December 2(nd), 2020, the first period, there was 3 positive results from 36 suspected COVID-19 patients among 181 total pediatric oncology patients. In the second period, we found 8 positive results from 121 hospitalized patients, none of them had signs and symptoms of COVID-19; and 4 of them came from boarding house. CONCLUSION: Routine screening for COVID-19 should be considered as a policy for hospitalization of a pediatric oncology patient because of the high risk that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients can transmit the infection to other patient and to health care workers in the hospital.","output":"#30: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Incidence in Pediatric Oncology Patient: Does Routine Screening Affect the Risk for the Transmission in the Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been well-documented that concerns about side effects prevent many from soliciting immunization.

However, many countries in Europe and elsewhere implemented strict, horizontal lockdowns because of extensive viral spread in the community which challenges the capacity of the healthcare systems. However, strict lockdowns have various untintended adverse social, economic and health effects, which have yet to be fully elucidated, and have not been considered in models examining the effects of various mitigation measures. Unlike commonly suggested, the dilemma is not about health vs wealth because the economic devastation of long-lasting lockdowns will definitely have adverse health effects in the population. Furthermore, they cannot provide a lasting solution in pandemic containment, potentially resulting in a vicious cycle of consecutive lockdowns with in-between breaks. Hospital preparedness has been the main strategy used by governments. However, a major characteristic of the COVID-19 pandemic is the rapid viral transmission in populations with no immunity. Thus, even the best hospital system could not cope with the demand. Primary, community and home care are the only viable strategies that could achieve the goal of pandemic mitigation. We present the case example of Greece, a country which followed a strategy focused on hospital preparedness but failed to reinforce primary and community care. This, along with strategic mistakes in epidemiological surveillance, resulted in Greece implementing a second strict, horizontal lockdown and having one of the highest COVID-19 death rates in Europe during the second wave. We provide recommendations for measures that will reinstate primary and community care at the forefront in managing the current public health crisis by protecting hospitals from unnecessary admissions, providing primary and secondary prevention services in relation to COVID-19 and maintaining population health through treatment of non-COVID-19 conditions.

Exposures Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]).

Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]).

However, that role is not clear for grasslands where most precipitation falls during the growing season when the demand for water is high. Our question was: Does litter affect forage production in such an environment? Location: Typical steppe, Inner Mongolia. Methods: We examined the role of plant litter in two experiments where litter was either removed or added in a protected or heavily grazed site, respectively, in autumn and in spring in a split plot design. The treatments (control, moderate and heavy litter application) were applied once in five replications but repeated at new locations in each of 3 years. This was done to examine only the direct effect of litter on annual net primary production and selected plant characteristics and not potential secondary effects. We also measured soil moisture and soil temperature. Results: Removing litter caused a reduction in the amount of grass (Leymus chinensis) that was produced, but litter addition caused an inconsistent effect among years, with moderate applications producing the most positive effects. Litter removal resulted in shorter and less dense plants of L. chinensis and Carex duriuscula, while heavy litter addition in autumn reduced plant height of both Cleistogenes squarrosa and C. duriuscula. Conclusions: Litter was effective for enhancing soil moisture status and reducing soil heat units in the typical steppe of Inner Mongolia. Therefore, litter mass may serve as an index of grassland health in such environments.","output":"Can plant litter affect net primary production of a typical steppe in Inner Mongolia?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chorioamnionitis is associated with increased rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in ventilated preterm infants. Budesonide when added to surfactant decreased lung and systemic inflammation from mechanical ventilation in preterm lambs and decreased the rates and severity of BPD in preterm infants. We hypothesized that the addition of budesonide to surfactant will decrease the injury from mechanical ventilation in preterm lambs exposed to intra-amniotic (IA) lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: Lambs at 126  1 day GA received LPS 10 mg IA 48 h prior to injurious mechanical ventilation. After 15 min, lambs received either surfactant mixed with: (1) saline or (2) Budesonide 0.25 mg/kg, then ventilated with normal tidal volumes for 4 h. Injury markers in the lung, liver, and brain were compared. RESULTS: Compared with surfactant alone, the addition of budesonide improved blood pressures, dynamic compliance, and ventilation, while decreasing mRNA for pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung, liver, and multiple areas of the brain. LPS caused neuronal activation and structural changes in the brain that were not altered by budesonide. Budesonide was not retained within the lung beyond 4 h. CONCLUSIONS: In preterm lambs exposed to IA LPS, the addition of budesonide to surfactant improved physiology and markers of lung and systemic inflammation. IMPACT: The addition of budesonide to surfactant decreases the lung and systemic responses to injurious mechanical ventilation preterm lambs exposed to fetal LPS. Budesonide was present in the plasma by 15 min and the majority of the budesonide is no longer in the lung at 4 h of ventilation. IA LPS and mechanical ventilation caused structural changes in the brain that were not altered by short-term exposure to budesonide. The budesonide dose of 0.25 mg/kg being used clinically seems likely to decrease lung inflammation in preterm infants with chorioamnionitis.","output":"Budesonide with surfactant decreases systemic responses in mechanically ventilated preterm lambs exposed to fetal intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The physiotherapist's practice involves taking care of patients with various chronic pathologies: neurological, rheumatic, respiratory, etc. The physiotherapist must carry out an educational approach in these patients, at the same time as the physical work of re-education, in order to induce behavioural changes beneficial to their physical and psychological health and to empower them in the best possible way in the management of their pathology.","output":"[Therapeutic education for people with chronic respiratory disease]./ ducation thrapeutique des personnes atteintes de maladie respiratoire chronique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The end of this year's winter brings much-needed hope.","output":"A Most Welcome Spring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19, particularly the association of renal replacement therapy to mortality. DESIGN: A single-center prospective observational study was carried out. SETTING: ICU of a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Consecutive adults with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. INTERVENTION: Renal replacement therapy. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Demographic data, medical history, illness severity, type of oxygen therapy, laboratory data and use of renal replacement therapy to generate a logistic regression model describing independent risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Of the total of 166 patients, 51% were mechanically ventilated and 26% required renal replacement therapy. The overall hospital mortality rate was 36%, versus 56% for those requiring renal replacement therapy, and 68% for those with both mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. The logistic regression model identified four independent risk factors for mortality: age (adjusted OR 2.8 [95% CI 1.8-4.4] for every 10-year increase), mechanical ventilation (4.2 [1.7-10.6]), need for continuous venovenous hemofiltration (2.3 [1.3-4.0]) and C-reactive protein (1.1 [1.0-1.2] for every 10mg/L increase).

These alterations may be presumed on the basis of the following two observations. Firstly, the virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the Covid-19 infection uses an important renin-angiotensin system element - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - as a receptor protein for the entry into target cells and, in consequence, disturbs the function of the main (circulating) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and of the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) localized in different tissues and organs. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 leads to the down-regulation of this enzyme and, in the aftermath, to the excess of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Thus, in the later stage of Covid-19 infection, the beneficial effects of ACI and ARB could be presumed. It is hypothesized that the local RAS dysregulation in the adipose tissue is the main cause of the negative role of obesity as a risk factor of severe outcome of the Covid-19 infection. Secondly, the outcome of Covid-19 strongly depends on the age of a patient. The age-related hormonal deficiencies, especially that of melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone may contribute to morbidity/mortality in older people. The usefulness of melatonin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (the latter only in later phases of the infection) as adjuvant drugs is probable but needs careful clinical trials.","output":"Endocrine and metabolic aspects of Covid-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, and by 24 April 2020, it had affected >2.73 million people in 185 countries and caused >192,000 deaths.

Its social acceptability, which affects both what systems (infrastructure) can be put in place and to what extent their implementation will be successful, is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, often not well understood. In light of the growing evidence that decisions to build new infrastructure are often contested by the public, there is a clear need to understand the role of scientific evidence in public perception, particularly as environmental infrastructure delivery is often objected to by the public on environmental grounds. In this paper the need for waste management infrastructure is reviewed, and the way its delivery in the UK has evolved is used as an example of the role of public perception in the planning and delivery of waste facilities. Findings demonstrate the vital role of public communication in waste management infrastructure delivery. Public perception must be taken into account early in the decision making process, with the public informed and engaged from the start. There is a pressing need for people not simply to accept but to understand and appreciate the need for infrastructure, the nature of infrastructure investments and development, the costs and the benefits involved, and the technological aspects.

The heterogeneous spread of the pandemic within EU regions elicited a wide range of policies, such as school closure, transport restrictions, etc. However, the implementation of these interventions is not accompanied by the implementation of quantitative methods, which would indicate their effectiveness. As a result, the efficacy of such policies on reducing the spread of the virus varies significantly. This paper investigates the effectiveness of using deep learning paradigms to accurately model the spread of COVID-19. The deep learning approaches proposed in this paper are able to effectively map the temporal evolution of a COVID-19 outbreak, while simultaneously taking into account policy interventions directly into the modelling process. Thus, our approach facilitates data-driven decision making by utilizing previous knowledge to train models that predict not only the spread of COVID-19, but also the effect of specific policy measures on minimizing this spread. Global models at the EU level are proposed, which can be successfully applied at the national level. These models use various inputs in order to successfully model the spatio-temporal variability of the phenomenon and obtain generalization abilities.

Virtual Tumour Boards (vTBs) were therefore established. Our objective was to assess physicians satisfaction with vTB use during the crisis. Materials & Methods: Twenty-eight physicians in onco-urology involved in a vTB in a single department in Paris, France, were asked to answer an online survey between March 17th and April 28th, 2020. A validated scale employed for teleconsultations was adapted to assess physician satisfaction with the vTB (e.g. Telehealth Usability Questionnaire - TUQ) including additional criteria such as ergonomic, learnability and satisfaction items. A satisfying experience was defined as TUQ score >85. Participants were stratified into two groups, senior and junior, to assess any differences in opinion. Results: A total of 23/28 physicians (82.1%) responded to the questionnaire (median age: 36-years [IQR: 32-40], male: female ratio 2.8, 11 senior physicians (47.8%)). Overall, 164 medical cases were discussed, representing a 23.4% decrease when compared to the similar period in 2019 (n=214). Median TUQ score was 100 [IQR: 92-109] and 22 participants (95.7%) reported a satisfying experience with no significant difference between senior and junior physicians. Limitations include the small sample size, monocentric design, use of a modified telehealth questionnaire in order to fit the vTB, and potential bias inherent in self-reporting. Conclusions: The vTB was a rapid and effective way to deal with onco-urology cases. vTB adherence was high and we believe that this way of working will continue beyond the current crisis.","output":"Assessment of physicians satisfaction with a virtual tumour board in a French academic centre during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, Missouri has followed an overall upward trend in opioid overdose deaths In 2018, Missouri was the state with the largest absolute and percentage increase in opioid-related overdose fatality rates per capita over the previous year (18 3% and 3 1/100,000) This increase occurred despite an overall decrease in U S opioid-related death rates in the same period This report identifies illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) (and analogues) as the drug most responsible for this rise in opioid deaths in Missouri, with stimulant overdoses (primarily from methamphetamine) in second place Within Missouri, we find the areas where opioid deaths are highest: St Louis and the city's fringe areas, following the national trend for high rates in fringe areas Based on reports from CDC Wonder data, county medical examiners, law enforcement agencies, and drug addiction prevention agencies, we conclude that IMF and related synthetic opioids arriving from China are primarily responsible for fatal narcotic overdoses in Missouri Despite the COVID-19 disruption of fentanyl manufacturing and distribution centers in and around Wuhan, China early in the pandemic, preliminary 2020 data from medical examiners' offices show an upswing in opioid deaths, an indicator that Chinese fentanyl producers have restored the supply chain","output":"Missouri's Fentanyl Problem: The China Connection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Look for it and the all-knowing search engine will find it [ ]the outpouring of extreme emotions and various conspiracies stoked by social media has been building across the world for some time To expand research and enable diverse collaboration on artificial intelligence, Stanford University, for example, has introduced the National Research Cloud to bring the federal government, research universities, and private enterprise together (Etchemendy & Li, 2020) In the COVID-19 vaccine development, pre-publication platforms have increased knowledge sharing but also lifted the characteristic of academic research, in particular, the peer-review process","output":"The Resilience Forum: A Lingering Conclusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular dynamics (MD) and enhanced sampling MD was performed for 100 ns on the biological assembly of the COVID-19 protease ( a href=\\"https://www rcsb org/structure/6lu7\\" 6LU7 /a ), and a template of the COVID-19 S-protein:ACE2 receptor interface (99 88% coverage of 6M0J;model03, a href=\\"https://swissmodel expasy org/interactive/HLkhkP/models/\\" swissmodel /a ) Apo-site pharmacophores of the resulting structural clusters were used to mine the FDA database (8700 compounds), and a multi-target library was developed from MD-based hits in high affinity sites across 100 ns Consensus hits from high throughput docking in crystal structures 5R82, 6LU7 and 6Y2F (protease), and 6VW1 (S-protein:ACE2) were also added, and the resulting libraries were re-docked into MD sites to collect potential COVID-19 re-purposed therapeutics by estimated binding energies","output":"COVID-19 Repurposed Therapeutics Targeting the Viral Protease and Spike-protein:ACE2 Interface using MD-based Pharmacophore and Consensus Virtual Screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly progressed to a global health emergency. Respiratory illness is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients with the disease spectrum ranging from asymptomatic subclinical infection, to severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is growing evidence describing pathophysiological resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 infection with other coronavirus infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Disruption of this receptor leads to cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms. Hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and coronary heart disease are amongst major cardiovascular disease comorbidities seen in severe cases of COVID-19. There is growing literature exploring cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2. Myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of COVID-19. As a surrogate for myocardial injury, multiple studies have shown increased cardiac biomarkers mainly cardiac troponins I and T in the infected patients especially those with severe disease. Myocarditis is depicted as another cause of morbidity amongst COVID-19 patients. The exact mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury are direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response by Type 1 and 2 helper T cells, in addition to coronary plaque destabilization, and hypoxia.","output":"Myocardial injury and COVID-19: Possible mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forty parents of youth soccer players of ages 5-17 years, in Sicily, Italy completed a survey measuring knowledge of concussion symptoms and facts.

METHODS: We queried the electronic medical record system for an integrated health system of 10 hospitals in the Chicago metropolitan area to identify cases of COVID-19. Comorbidities and outcomes were ascertained by ICD-10-CM coding and medical record data. We evaluated the risk for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and respiratory failure associated with OSA by univariate tests and logistic regression, adjusting for diabetes, hypertension, and BMI to account for potential confounding in the association between OSA, COVID-19 hospitalization, and progression to respiratory failure. RESULTS: We identified 9405 COVID-19 infections, among which 3185 (34%) were hospitalized and 1779 (19%) were diagnosed with respiratory failure. OSA was more prevalent among patients requiring hospitalization than those who did not (15.3% versus 3.4%, p < 0.0001; OR 5.20, 95% CI (4.43, 6.12)), and among those who progressed to respiratory failure (19.4% versus 4.5%, p < 0.0001; OR 5.16, 95% CI (4.41, 6.03)). After adjustment for diabetes, hypertension, and BMI, OSA was associated with increased risk for hospitalization (OR 1.65; 95% CI (1.36, 2.02)) and respiratory failure (OR 1.98; 95% CI (1.65, 2.37)). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with OSA experienced approximately 8-fold greater risk for COVID-19 infection compared to a similar age population receiving care in a large, racially, and socioeconomically diverse healthcare system. Among patients with COVID-19 infection, OSA was associated with increased risk of hospitalization and approximately double the risk of developing respiratory failure.","output":"Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Risk of COVID-19 Infection, Hospitalization and Respiratory Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ectopia cordis (EC) is a rare congenital condition characterized by a partial or complete defect of the anterior chest wall. It is associated with ventricular and atrial septal defects (ASD), Ebstein's anomaly, truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels, tetralogy of Fallot, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. This study aimed to explore the cardiac manifestations of EC complicated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19). A 23\\\\year\\\\old male, born with EC, was admitted to the hospital for acute cough and fever. The patient was diagnosed with EC and ASD by computed tomography and COVID\\\\19 via a polymerase chain reaction swab test. Patients with ECs rarely survive till adulthood. However, due to the rarity of this syndrome, upon literature review, we did not find a case of EC with concurrent COVID\\\\19 infection. The patient underwent the required investigations and conventional treatment such as fluid resuscitation, antibiotics administration, and full code cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The interventions performed were unsuccessful, and the patient died. This case demonstrates a patient who lived with EC and its associated cardiac anomalies but died of COVID\\\\19 and its complications despite full resuscitation attempts. Our findings suggest that patients with EC may survive to adulthood if they have an incomplete EC, fewer intracardiac defects except for ASD, and an absence of an omphalocele.","output":"Ectopia cordis in an adult patient with COVID\\\\19: A case report and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case study involves: the design and evaluation of serious games;the use of longitudinal research and remote testing in an international setting Current methods for cognitive assessment tend to be inconvenient, costly and infrequently performed This is unfortunate because cognitive assessment is an important tool In the young it can detect atypical development, and in older people it can detect cognitive decline For both young and old, cognitive assessments can identify problems and trigger interventions for reducing harms (e g , adverse reactions to drugs) or providing treatment Serious games for cognitive assessment can potentially be self-administered and played on an on-going basis so as to track cognitive status over time, something that is not practical with current methods Inspired by this opportunity the BrainTagger team has developed a suite of cognitive assessment games Studies are being carried out to assess the validity of these games for measuring the cognitive functions that they target, but those studies don't address the issue of whether people will be willing to play the game repeatedly, without supervision, over an extended period of time Thus we carried out a longitudinal study with BrainTagger We report on the logistical challenges of running this study with an international team located in Canada and Japan during the COVID19 pandemic We also report on how the perceived \\"fun\\"of games changed over time Our games were all versions of Whack-a-mole games, with each game requiring a different cognitive function to distinguish between targets (moles to hit) and distractors (moles to avoid) While the basic Whack-a-mole game is fun to play, having to play the same games again and again over a larger time period appeared to be more challenging than anticipated and motivation and acceptance seemed to gradually decrease over the course of the study We conclude that addition of gamification features, such as leaderboards and in-game rewards, are needed to sustain enjoyment of our BrainTagger games and likely other games as well ? 2021 Owner/Author","output":"Monitoring Cognitive Performance with a Serious Game: A Longitudinal Case Study on Online Cognitive Assessment Using Serious Games"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common type of disease and has a high fatality rate in humans. Early diagnosis is critical for the prognosis of CVD. Before using myocardial tissue strain, strain rate, and other indicators to evaluate and analyze cardiac function, accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) endocardium is vital for ensuring the accuracy of subsequent diagnosis. For accurate segmentation of the LV endocardium, this paper proposes the extraction of the LV region features based on the YOLOv3 model to locate the positions of the apex and bottom of the LV, as well as that of the LV region; thereafter, the subimages of the LV can be obtained, and based on the Markov random field (MRF) model, preliminary identification and binarization of the myocardium of the LV subimages can be realized. Finally, under the constraints of the three aforementioned positions of the LV, precise segmentation and extraction of the LV endocardium can be achieved using nonlinear least-squares curve fitting and edge approximation. The experiments show that the proposed segmentation evaluation indices of the method, including computation speed (fps), Dice, mean absolute distance (MAD), and Hausdorff distance (HD), can reach 2.1C2.25 fps, 93.57  1.97%, 2.57  0.89 mm, and 6.68  1.78 mm, respectively.

Any departure from this policy has a welfare cost. Prioritizing the allocation of vaccines to the most vulnerable people save 70,000 seniors, but it also increases the death toll of younger people by 14,000. Vaccine nationalism is modeled by assuming two identical Frances, one with a vaccine production capacity and the other without it.

Here, primary microglia from adult AD (5xFAD) mice were utilized to demonstrate that 5xFAD microglia fail to degrade A and express low levels of autophagy cargo receptor NBR1. In 5xFAD mouse brains, we show for the first time that AD microglia express elevated levels of microRNA cluster Mirc1/Mir17-92a, which is known to downregulate autophagy proteins. By in situ hybridization in post-mortem AD human tissue sections, we observed that the Mirc1/Mir17-92a cluster member miR-17 is also elevated in human AD microglia, specifically in the vicinity of A deposits, compared to non-disease controls. We show that NBR1 expression is negatively correlated with expression of miR-17 in human AD microglia via immunohistopathologic staining in human AD brain tissue sections. We demonstrate in healthy microglia that autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 is required for A degradation. Inhibiting elevated miR-17 in 5xFAD mouse microglia improves A degradation, autophagy, and NBR1 puncta formation in vitro and improves NBR1 expression in vivo.

A significant proportion of patients with OSA in the UK are undiagnosed. This study aims to identify risk factors for OSA in an obese cohort. METHOD: A population-based study was conducted of obese patients (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2) from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). A logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for developing OSA according to other clinicopathological characteristics. Multivariate analysis was conducted of individual factors that affect the propensity to develop OSA. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.050. RESULTS: From 276,600 obese patients identified during a data extraction of the CPRD in July 2017, the prevalence of OSA was 5.4%. The following risk factors were found to be independently associated with increased likelihood of OSA: male sex (OR = 3.273; p < 0.001), BMI class II (OR = 1.640; p < 0.001), BMI class III (OR = 3.768; p < 0.001), smoking (OR = 1.179; p < 0.001), COPD (OR = 1.722; p < 0.001), GERD (OR = 1.557; p < 0.001), hypothyroidism (OR = 1.311; p < 0.001), acromegaly (OR = 3.543; p < 0.001), and benzodiazepine use (OR = 1.492; p < 0.001). Bariatric surgery was associated with reduced risk of OSA amongst this obese population (OR = 0.260; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In obese patients, there are numerous comorbidities that are associated with increased likelihood of OSA. These factors can help prompt clinicians to identify undiagnosed OSA.

Although historically kaumtua (elder Mori) faced a dominant society that failed to realise their full potential as they age, Mori culture has remained steadfast in upholding elders as cultural/community anchors. Yet, many of todays kaumtua have experienced cultural dissonance as the result of a hegemonic dominant culture subjugating an Indigenous culture, leading to generations of Indigenous peoples compelled or forced to dissociate with their culture. The present research project, Kaumtua Mana Motuhake P (KMMP) comprises two interrelated projects that foreground dimensions of wellbeing within a holistic Te Ao Mori (Mori epistemology) view of wellbeing. Project 1 involves a tuakana-teina/peer educator model approach focused on increasing service access and utilisation to support kaumtua with the greatest health and social needs. Project 2 focuses on physical activity and cultural knowledge exchange (including te reo Mori--Mori language) through intergenerational models of learning. METHODS: Both projects have a consistent research design and common set of methods that coalesce around the emphasis on kaupapa kaumatua; research projects led by kaumtua and kaumtua providers that advance better life outcomes for kaumtua and their communities. The research design for each project is a mixed-methods, pre-test and two post-test, staggered design with 2C3 providers receiving the approach first and then 2C3 receiving it on a delayed basis. A pre-test (baseline) of all participants will be completed. The approach will then be implemented with the first providers. There will then be a follow-up data collection for all participants (post-test 1). The second providers will then implement the approach, which will be followed by a final data collection for all participants (post-test 2).

Although ACE2 is a known receptor for the virus and has been shown to mediate viral entry into the lungs, accumulating reports highlight the presence of neurological symptoms resulting from infection. As ACE2 expression is low in the central nervous system (CNS), these neurological symptoms are unlikely to be caused by ACE2-virus binding. In this review, we will discuss a proposed interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in the CNS. TLR2 is an innate immune receptor that recognizes exogenous microbial components but has also been shown to interact with multiple viral components, including the envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, TLR2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that TLR2 may play a critical role in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infiltration in the CNS, thereby resulting in the induction or acceleration of AD and PD pathologies in patients.","output":"Does SARS-CoV-2 affect neurodegenerative disorders?

In this investigation, a classic dose-response model is used on the one hand to find out retrospectively the probable viral load of the infectious source patient at the time of transmission in 25 documented outbreaks. We showed that an infection due to airborne transmission at a distance from the infectious person was probably only possible in the 25 outbreaks examined, with attack rates of 4-100%, if the viral load had been higher than 1E+08 viral copies/ml. This demonstrates that the viral load estimated from the swab might overestimate a person's infectivity via aerosol, because a person is generally considered infectious, independent of the transmission way, when the viral load from the swab is 1E+06 viral copies/ml. On the other hand, a possible approach is presented to predict the probable situational Attack Rate (PARs) of a group of persons in a room through aerosol particles emitted by an infectious source patient. Four main categories of influence on the risk of infection are formed: First the emitted viruses, depending on the viral load and the amount of respiratory particles, and necessary number of reproducible viruses for infection, second the room-specific data and duration of stay of the group of people, third the activity of the exposed persons, and fourth the effect of personal protection (e.g. wearing masks from infectious and/or susceptible person). Furthermore, a simplified method is presented to calculate either the maximum possible number of persons in a room, so that probably a maximum of one person becomes infected when an infectious person is in the room, or the PARs,simple for a given number of persons, ventilation rate and time of occupancy. We additionally show, taking into account organizational preventive measures, which person-related virus-free supply air flow rates are necessary to keep the number of newly infected persons to less than 1. The simple approach makes it easy to derive preventive organizational and ventilation measures. Our results show that the volume flow rate or a person-related flow rate is a much more effective parameter to evaluate ventilation for infection prevention than the air change rate. We suggest to monitor the CO2 concentration as an easy to implement and valid measurement system for indoor spaces. Finally, we show that of the three measures, besides of wearing masks and increasing ventilation, testing contributes the most to the joint protective effect. This corresponds to the classic approach to implement protection concepts: preventing the source from entering the room and emitting viruses at all.

Population health issues such as outbreak surveillance and controlled substance tracking during emergencies all require a secure, easily accessible database. While the healthcare industry is typically slow to adapt to change, blockchain technology lends itself well to many healthcare issues. METHODS: We utilized a 3D framework using difficulty, novelty and necessity to examine the adoption of blockchain technology in population health, based on the 2D framework of difficulty and novelty as driving factors for the development of foundational technologies in the world of business by Iansiti and Lakhani in The Harvard Business Review. RESULTS: We find that by implementing the third dimension of necessity into an evaluation framework, we can better predict the adoption of technology. We found how different areas of population health fit into the evaluation framework and how necessity can eliminate barriers from implementing novel technologies. CONCLUSION: The byproduct of this paper will be the extension of the Iansiti and Lakhani framework. We will show that blockchain, in all of these domains, shows promise to improve population health as we move past COVID-19 and into the future of healthcare.","output":"Blockchain and population health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radionuclide therapy (RNT) may increase tumor immunogenicity. We aimed at exploiting this effect by combining RNT with immunotherapy in a mouse model of prostate cancer (PC). Experimental Design: C57BL/6-mice bearing syngeneic RM1-PGLS tumors were treated with 225Ac-PSMA617, an anti-PD-1 antibody, or both. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by tumor volume measurements (computed tomography), time to progression (TTP) and survival. Results: PSMA-RNT or anti-PD-1 alone tended to prolong TTP (isotype-control 25d; anti-PD-1 33.5d, p=0.0153; RNT 30d, p=0.1038) and survival (control 28d; anti-PD-1 37d, p=0.0098; RNT 32d, p=0.1018). Combining PSMA-RNT and anti-PD-1 significantly improved disease control compared to either monotherapy. TTP was extended to 47.5d (p<0.0199 vs. monotherapies), and survival to 51.5d (p<0.0251 vs. monotherapies).

Immunocompromised patients, including IBD, were presumed to have higher risk. AIMS: We hypothesized patients with IBD would have higher-than-baseline anxiety, high perceived vulnerability and significant lifestyle impacts as a result of the pandemic. We sought to assess the impact of these changes on disease and management. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients with Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis and IBD-unspecified was conducted. Patients were invited to participate by email in an IRB-approved brief, voluntary survey. Survey questions focused on disease characteristics, healthcare access and self-reported psychological well-being. RESULTS: Responses from 492 (CD = 337, UC = 141,IC = 14) patients were included in the analysis. The majority of patients with IBD had increased anxiety since the pandemic, which correlated with an increase in GI symptoms. This risk of symptoms was mitigated by communication with their provider. Many patients had lifestyle changes including requesting time off work due to perceived vulnerability and changes in eating habits. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support an increase in illness-associated anxiety and perceived vulnerability among patients with IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Open communication with providers is important to maintain adequate control of disease and reduce symptoms of flares triggered by ongoing stress.

Influenza A viruses circulate in reservoir of wild aquatic birds, occasionally cause human pandemics, undergo antigenic drift and antigentic shift, and have been used as model viruses to understand many fundamental processes including receptor binding, membrane fusion, protein structure, and adaptive immunity. Influenza A and B viruses contain a hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein, the dominant surface antigen that promotes receptor binding and membrane fusion during viral entry, and a neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein, a secondary antigen that has receptor-destroying activity necessary for virus release from infected cells. Influenza C viruses contain a single antigen, the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) protein, which possesses receptor binding, membrane fusion, and virus release functions. The HA and HEF proteins are prototypic, trimeric, structural class I viral fusion proteins with a membrane-distal, immunodominant (and highly variable) receptor-binding head domain and a more highly conserved membrane-proximal, metastable, stalk domain that catalyzes membrane fusion. The tetrameric NA protein has a membrane-distal globular head domain with an antiparallel -propeller topology and a membrane-proximal coiled-coil stalk. For the influenza A and B viruses, the HA protein is the predominant target for naturally acquired and vaccine-induced adaptive immunity. Recent structural studies of broadly reactive monoclonal antibodies bound to the HA protein, along with complementary immunological experiments, suggest ways to generate universal influenza vaccines that are effective after antigenic drift and shift.","output":"Orthomyxoviruses: Structure of Antigens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) has been used worldwide to contrast SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since April 2020, it has also been used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in the Veneto region (Italy), along with all the other available drugs and therapeutic tools. Here we report data analysis and clinical results in 1,517 COVID-19 inpatients treated with CP containing high-titre neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (CCP). Mortality after 30 days of hospitalization has been considered primary outcome, by comparing patients treated with CCP vs all COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals of the Veneto region in a one-year period (from April 2020 to April 2021). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult inpatients with a severe form of COVID-19 have been enrolled, with at least one of the following inclusion criteria: 1) tachypnea with respiratory rate (RR)  30 breaths/min; 2) oxygen saturation (SpO(2))  93% at rest and in room air; 3) partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2))/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2))  200 mmHg, 4) radiological picture and/or chest CT scan showing signs of interstitial disease and/or rapid progression of lung involvement. Patients received a maximum of three therapeutic fractions (TFs) of CCP with a neutralizing antibody titre of  1:160, administered over a period of 3C5 days. If TFs of CCP with titre  1:160 were unavailable, 2 with antibody titre of  1:80 have been administered. RESULTS: Of the 1,517 patients treated with CCP, 209 deceased at the 30-day follow-up (14%). Death was significantly associated with an older age (p<0.001), a longer time of hospitalization before CCP infusion (p<0.001), a greater number of inclusion criteria (p<0.001) and associated comorbidities (p<0.001). Conditions significantly associated with an increased frequency of death were PaO(2)/FiO(2)  200 (p<0.001) and tachypnea with RR>30 (p<0.05) at entry, concurrent arterial hypertension (p<0.001), cardiovascular disease (p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (p<0.001), dyslipidemia (p<0.05) and cancer (p<0.05). Moreover, factors leading to an unfavorable prognosis were a life-threatening disease (p<0.001), admission to Intensive Care Unit (p<0.001), high flow oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation (p<0.05) and a chest X-ray showing consolidation area (p<0.001). By analyzing the regional report of hospitalized patients, a comparison of mortality by age group, with respect to our series of patients treated with CCP, has been made. Mortality was altogether lower in patients treated with CCP (14% v. 25%), especially in the group of the elderly patients (23% vs 40%,), with a strong significance (p<0.001). As regards the safety of CCP administration, 16 adverse events were recorded out of a total of 3,937 transfused TFs (0,4%). CONCLUSIONS: To overcome the difficulties of setting up a randomized controlled study in an emergency period, a data collection from a large series of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to CCP therapy with well-defined inclusion criteria has been implemented in the Veneto region. Our results have shown that in patients with severe COVID-19 early treatment with CCP might contribute to a favourable outcome, with a reduced mortality, in absence of relevant adverse events.","output":"Outcome of SARS CoV-2 inpatients treated with convalescent plasma: One-year of data from the Veneto region (Italy) Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"-Phenylethylamine hydrochloride (PEA-HCl) and ethyl acetoacetate (EAA) are anti-microbials with applications in food processing.

A combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was used to analyze solutions of PEA(-HCl) or EAA in beef broth or water. In addition, the anti-microbial activity of PEA-HCl and EAA was compared between heated and unheated samples at a range of concentrations. The gas chromatograms of PEA(-HCl) and EAA showed one peak at early retention times that did not differ between the heated and unheated samples. The mass spectra for PEA and EAA were near identical to those from a spectral database and did not show any differences between the heated and unheated samples. We conclude that PEA(-HCl) and EAA formed pure solutions and were not altered during the heating process.

The incidence of pericarditis caused by this organism is underreported as it is often dismissed as a skin flora contaminant. However, if left untreated, Cutibacterium acnes can cause pericarditis with serious complications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the literature regarding pericarditis caused by Cutibacterium acnes along with a case presentation from our institution. In our institution, a 20-year-old man with history of atrial septal defect presented with chest pain radiating to the back along with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection including headaches and myalgia. Electrocardiogram was remarkable for diffuse low-voltage waves. Echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade features. Pericardiocentesis drained 1.2 L of milky fluid. Pericardial fluid analysis grew Cutibacterium acnes after being cultured for 8 days. The patient received 3 weeks of IV penicillin followed by 3 weeks of oral amoxicillin along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine with no recurrence. Pericarditis caused by Cutibacterium acnes requires a high clinical suspicion since isolation of this organism can be dismissed as a skin flora contaminant.

Purpose To evaluate cardiac involvement in participants who had recovered from COVID-19 without clinical evidence of cardiac involvement by using cardiac MRI. Materials and Methods This prospective observational cohort study included 40 participants who had recovered from COVID-19 with moderate (n = 24) or severe (n = 16) pneumonia and who had no cardiovascular medical history, were without cardiac symptoms, had normal electrocardiograms, had normal serologic cardiac enzyme levels, and had been discharged for more than 90 days between May and September 2020. Demographic characteristics were recorded, serum cardiac enzyme levels were measured, and cardiac MRI was performed. Cardiac function, native T1, extracellular volume fraction (ECV), and two-dimensional (2D) strain were quantitatively evaluated and compared with values in control subjects (n = 25). Comparisons among the three groups were performed by using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons (for normal distribution) or Kruskal-Wallis tests with post hoc pairwise comparisons (for nonnormal distribution). Results Forty participants (mean age, 54 years  12 [standard deviation]; 24 men) were enrolled; participants had a mean time between admission and cardiac MRI of 158 days  18 and between discharge and cardiac MRI examination of 124 days  17. There were no left or right ventricular size or functional differences between participants who had recovered from COVID-19 and healthy control subjects.

The differing vulnerability of businesses to the recent pandemic raises a fundamental question about how best to build resilience to reduce vulnerabilities. Built on the vulnerability characteristics identified in the taxonomy, this article suggests factors that contribute to the resilience of businesses in each cluster. Further, the present paper develops a novel validation method to demonstrate the goodness of the clustering results. Business leaders and government officials might draw considerable assistance from the taxonomy of vulnerabilities presented herein to build more resilient businesses to crises.","output":"A reflection on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Australian businesses: Toward a taxonomy of vulnerabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurological manifestations are common in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including life-threatening acute muscle weakness, due to neuromuscular disorders such as acute transverse myelitis (TM) and Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS).

GBS was diagnosed due to the presence of motor signs, albumin-cytological dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid examination and axonal damage according to nerve condition tests. However, abnormal areas on MRI of the thoracic spine and lack of improvement with intravenous immunoglobulin supported a diagnosis of TM. Therefore, a possible overlap between GBS and TM was established. To our knowledge, this is the third case report of GBS/TM overlap syndrome after COVID-19.

The relationship between wine tourism and rural tourism (RT) has been approached from many angles in the past. Ranking sixth in Europe in having its surface cultivated with vines, Romania is one of the major players in the Old World of wine producers. In Romania, the scientific literature on wine tourism is scarce and has a limited coverage on the subject. The present paper, by its main purpose, raises the curtain of Romanian wine tourism drawing a consumer profile and analyzes the relationship between WT and RT. Through quantitative research with 850 valid wine tourist respondents and a margin of error of 3.36%, we discovered that people who know what wine tourism means are 1.85 times more confident that it will contribute to the development of rural tourism compared to those who know less about the subject. A high number of visits leads to a decrease in the confidence that rural tourism can be developed through wine tourism due to the poor diversification of leisure activities offered by wine cellars and a weak connection between economic activity and local space. In the end, we draw some practical implications for wine cellars. By developing local-based leisure activities, vineyards can contribute to the sustainable development of the local community. Due to the COVID-19 impact on tourism, there are some limitations to our study. Future studies are needed to cover the changes and evolution of this type of tourism.","output":"Romanian Wine Tourism-A Paved Road or a Footpath in Rural Tourism?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary carcinosarcoma of the prostate is an extremely rare and aggressive malignancy.

We aimed to investigate whether the presence or concentration of individual or multiple viruses were associated with disease severity in acute bronchiolitis and to evaluate whether detected viruses modified the response to inhaled racemic adrenaline. Methods. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 363 infants with acute bronchiolitis in a randomized, controlled trial that compared inhaled racemic adrenaline versus saline. Virus genome was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction analyses. Severity was assessed on the basis of the length of stay and the use of supportive care. Results. Respiratory syncytial virus (83%) and human rhinovirus (34%) were most commonly detected. Seven other viruses were present in 8%C15% of the patients. Two or more viruses (maximum, 7) were detected in 61% of the infants. Virus type or coinfection was not associated with disease severity. A high genomic load of respiratory syncytial virus was associated with a longer length of stay and with an increased frequency of oxygen and ventilatory support use.

Proteopathic seeds can be released into the extracellular space, secreted in association with extracellular vesicles (EV) or exchanged by direct cell-to-cell contact. The extent to which each of these pathways contributes to the prion-like spreading of protein misfolding is unclear. Exchange of cellular cargo by both direct cell-to-cell contact as well as via EV depends on receptor-ligand interactions and subsequent release of cargo into the cytosol. We hypothesized that enabling these interactions through viral ligands enhances the aggregate-inducing capacity of EV-associated proteopathic seeds. Using different cellular models propagating model prion-like protein aggregates, mouse-adapted prions or pathogenic Tau aggregates, we demonstrate that vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein and SARS-CoV-2 spike S increase protein aggregate induction by direct cell-to-cell contact or via viral glycoprotein-decorated EV. Thus, receptor-ligand interactions are major determinants of intercellular aggregate dissemination. Further, our data raise the intriguing possibility that acute or latent viral infections contribute to proteopathic seed spreading by facilitating intercellular cargo transfer.

There is little data examining the correlation between serum albumin levels and COVID-19 disease severity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether admission albumin levels reliably predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 181 patients from two hospitals who had COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and radiologic imaging, who were hospitalized between March and July 2020. We recorded demographics, COVID-19 testing techniques, and day of admission labs. The outcomes recorded included the following: venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, discharge with new or higher home oxygen supplementation, readmission within 90 days, in-hospital mortality, and total adverse events. A multivariate modified Poisson regression analysis was then performed to determine significant predictors for increased adverse events in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients (60.2%) had hypoalbuminemia (albumin level < 3.3 g/dL). Patients with higher albumin levels on admission had a 72% decreased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (adjusted relative risk [RR]:0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.14-0.53, p<0.001) for every 1 g/dL increase of albumin. Moreover, higher albumin levels on admission were associated with a lower risk of developing ARDS (adjusted RR:0.73, 95% CI:0.55-0.98, p = 0.033), admission to the ICU (adjusted RR:0.64, 95% CI:0.45-0.93, p = 0.019), and were less likely to be readmitted within 90 days (adjusted RR:0.37, 95% CI:0.17-0.81, p = 0.012). Furthermore, higher albumin levels were associated with fewer total adverse events (adjusted RR:0.65, 95% CI:0.52-0.80, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Admission serum albumin levels appear to be a predictive biomarker for outcomes in COVID-19 patients. We found that higher albumin levels on admission were associated with significantly fewer adverse outcomes, including less VTE events, ARDS development, ICU admissions, and readmissions within 90 days. Screening patients may lead to early identification of patients at risk for developing in-hospital complications and improve optimization and preventative efforts in this cohort.","output":"Higher albumin levels on admission predict better prognosis in patients with confirmed COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) virus has caused a worldwide pandemic because of the viruss ability to transmit efficiently human-to-human. A key determinant of infection is the attachment of the viral spike protein to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Because of the presumed zoonotic origin of SC2, there is no practical way to assess every species susceptibility to SC2 by direct challenge studies. In an effort to have a better predictive model of animal host susceptibility to SC2, we expressed the ACE2 and/or transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) genes from humans and other animal species in the avian fibroblast cell line, DF1, that is not permissive to infection. We demonstrated that expression of both human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes is necessary to support SC2 infection and replication in DF1 and a non-permissive sub-lineage of MDCK cells. Titers of SC2 in these cell lines were comparable to those observed in control Vero cells. To further test the model, we developed seven additional transgenic cell lines expressing the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 derived from Felis (cat), Equus (horse), Sus (pig), Capra (goat), Mesocricetus (Golden hamster), Myotis lucifugus (Little Brown bat) and Hipposideros armiger (Great Roundleaf bat) in DF1 cells. Results demonstrate permissive replication of SC2 in cat, Golden hamster, and goat species, but not pig or horse, which correlated with the results of reported challenge studies. The development of this cell culture model allows for more efficient testing of the potential susceptibility of many different animal species for SC2 and emerging variant viruses. IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 (SC2) is believed to have originated in animal species and jumped into humans where it has produced the greatest viral pandemic of our time. Identification of animal species susceptible to SC2 infection would provide information on potential zoonotic reservoirs, and transmission potential at the human-animal interface. Our work provides a model system to test the ability of the virus to replicate in an otherwise non-permissive cell line by transgenic insertion of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes from human and other animal species. The results from our in vitro model positively correlate with animal infection studies enhancing the predicative capability of the model. Importantly, we demonstrate that both proteins are required for successful virus replication. These findings establish a framework to test other animal species for susceptibility to infection that may be critical zoonotic reservoirs for transmission, as well as to test variant viruses that arise over time.","output":"Development of an in vitro model for animal species susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 replication based on expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in avian cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among candidate treatment options for COVID-19, propolis, produced by honey bees from bioactive plant exudates, has shown potential against viral targets and has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties.

State chiropractic licensing boards play an important role in protecting the public via regulation of licensure and provision of guidance regarding standards of practice, especially during times of change or uncertainty. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to summarize the guidance provided in each of the 50 United States, related to chiropractic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A review of the public facing websites of governors and state chiropractic licensing boards was conducted in the United States. Data were collected regarding the official guidance provided by each state's chiropractic licensing board as well as the issuance of stay-at-home orders and designations of essential personnel by state governors. Descriptive statistics were used to report the findings from this project. RESULTS: Each of the 50 state governor's websites and individual state chiropractic licensing board's websites were surveyed. Stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders were issued in 86% of all states. Chiropractors were classified as essential providers in 54% of states, non-essential in one state (2%), and no guidance was provided in the remaining 44% of all states. Fourteen states (28%) recommended restricting visits to only urgent cases and the remaining states (72%) provided no guidance. Twenty-seven states (54%) provided information regarding protecting against infectious disease and the remaining states (46%) provided no guidance. Twenty-two states (44%) provided recommendations regarding chiropractic telehealth and the remaining states (56%) provided no guidance. Seventeen states (34%) altered license renewal requirements and eight states (16%) issued warnings against advertising misleading or false information regarding spinal manipulation and protection from COVID-19. CONCLUSION: State guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic was heterogenous, widely variability in accessibility, and often no guidance was provided by state chiropractic licensing boards.

Although resistance exercise (RE) and protein supplementation partially protect against sarcopenia under controlled conditions, the efficacy of home-based, unsupervised RE (HBRE) and multi-ingredient supplementation (MIS) is largely unknown. In this randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind trial, we examined the effects of HBRE/MIS on muscle mass, strength, and function in free-living, older men. Thirty-two sedentary men underwent twelve weeks of home-based resistance band training (3 d/week), in combination with daily intake of a novel five-nutrient supplement (Muscle5; M5, n = 16, 77.4  2.8 y) containing whey, micellar casein, creatine, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids, or an isocaloric/isonitrogenous placebo (PLA; n = 16, 74.4  1.3 y), containing collagen and sunflower oil. Appendicular and total lean mass (ASM; +3%, TLM; +2%), lean mass to fat ratios (ASM/% body fat; +6%, TLM/% body fat; +5%), maximal strength (grip; +8%, leg press; +17%), and function (5-Times Sit-to-Stand time; ?9%) were significantly improved in the M5 group following HBRE/MIS therapy (pre vs. post tests; p < 0.05). Fast-twitch muscle fiber cross-sectional areas of the quadriceps muscle were also significantly increased in the M5 group post intervention (Type IIa; +30.9%, Type IIx, +28.5%, p < 0.05). Sub-group analysis indicated even greater gains in total lean mass in sarcopenic individuals following HBRE/MIS therapy (TLM; +1.65 kg/+3.4%, p < 0.05). We conclude that the Muscle5 supplement is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective complement to low-intensity, home-based resistance exercise and improves lean mass, strength, and overall muscle quality in old age.","output":"A Five-Ingredient Nutritional Supplement and Home-Based Resistance Exercise Improve Lean Mass and Strength in Free-Living Elderly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What do citizens demand of their governing bodies to cope with the spread of emerging infectious diseases after recognizing the growing danger? What are the similarities and differences in political participation via online citizen petitions regarding COVID-19 across cities with different degrees of pandemic experience? This study aims to answer these questions by examining citizen petitions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in urban areas of South Korea. The pattern of citizens requests is a part of integrative socio-ecological and political systems with spatial and temporal dimensions. We compare the pattern of online citizen petitions in four Korean cities, namely Seoul, Busan, Daegu, and Incheon, some of which were epicenters of the COVID-19 outbreak. By applying relevant big data analysis techniques such as text mining, topic modeling, and network analysis, we compare the characteristics of citizen petitions on COVID-19 in the four cities, particularly whether (and how) they want financial or welfare support or COVID-19 prevention. We find that cities that experience a rapid spread are likely to have more petitions for prevention than for support. By comparison, cities without such experience are likely to have more petitions for support. This study contributes by tracing citizen and local government interactions in response to emerging infectious diseases by empirically analyzing the related big data on petitions. Policy implications suggest that urban authorities should listen to analyze and respond to the urgent needs of citizens.","output":"Online citizen petitions related to COVID-19 in South Korean cities: a big data analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the food environment has been implicated in diet-related health disparities, individuals ability to shape the food environment by limiting attention to a subset of products has not been studied.

Despite the constant accumulation of genetic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 population, there was little evidence for the emergence of significantly more transmissible lineages in the first half of 2020. Starting around November 2020, several more contagious and possibly more virulent Variants of Concern (VoCs) were reported in various regions of the world. These VoCs share some mutations and deletions that haven arisen recurrently in distinct genetic backgrounds. Here, we build on our previous work modelling the association of mutations to SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and characterise the contribution of individual recurrent mutations and deletions to estimated viral transmissibility. We then assess how patterns of estimated transmissibility in all SARS-CoV-2 clades have varied over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic by summing transmissibility estimates for all individual mutations carried by any sequenced genome analysed. Such an approach recovers the Delta variant (21A) as the most transmissible clade currently in circulation, followed by the Alpha variant (20I). By assessing transmissibility over the time of sampling, we observe a tendency for estimated transmissibility within clades to slightly decrease over time in most clades. Although subtle, this pattern is consistent with the expectation of a decay in transmissibility in mainly non-recombining lineages caused by the accumulation of weakly deleterious mutations. SARS-CoV-2 remains a highly transmissible pathogen, though such a trend could conceivably play a role in the turnover of different global viral clades observed over the pandemic so far. Caveats This work is not about the severity of disease. We do not analyse the severity of disease. We do not present any evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has decreased in severity. Lineage replacement dynamics are affected by many factors. The trend we recover for a decrease in inferred transmissibility of a clade over time is a small effect. We caution against over-interpretation. This result would not affect the management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: for example, we make no claims about any impact on the efficacy of particular non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Our phylogeny-based method to infer changes in estimated transmissibility due to recurrent mutations and deletions makes a number of simplifying assumptions. These may not all be valid. The consistent trend for the slight decrease we report might be due to an as-yet-unidentified systematic bias.","output":"A phylogeny-based metric for estimating changes in transmissibility from recurrent mutations in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesSARS-CoV-2 infection causes most cases of severe illness and fatality in older age groups. In China, over 99% of individuals aged [>=]12 years have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (albeit with vaccines developed against historical lineages), while 65.0% children aged 3-11 years have been vaccinated their first doses (as of November 12, 2021). Here, we aimed to assess whether, in this vaccination landscape, the importation of Delta variant infections could shift the COVID-19 burden from adults to children. MethodsWe developed an age-structured susceptible-infectious-removed model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics to simulate epidemics triggered by the importation of Delta variant infections and project the age-specific incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, cases, hospitalisations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths. ResultsIn the context of the vaccination programme targeting individuals aged []12 years (as it was the case until mid-October 2021), and in the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the importation of Delta variant infections could have led to widespread transmission and substantial disease burden in mainland China, even with vaccination coverage as high as 97% across the eligible age groups. Extending the vaccination roll-out to include children aged 3-11 years (as it was the case since the end of October 2021) is estimated to dramatically decrease the burden of symptomatic infections and hospitalisations within this age group (54% and 81%, respectively, when considering a vaccination coverage of 99%), but would have a low impact on protecting infants (aged 0-2 years).

We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. METHODS: Assuming a basic reproduction number of 30, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics.

We hypothesized that they might be of particular relevance to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Objectives: To assess the involvement of the Activin-Follistatin-axis in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Methods: Levels of Activins -A, -B and their physiological inhibitor Follistatin, were retrospectively analyzed in 314 serum samples from 117 COVID-19 patients derived from two independent centers and compared with common demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. Optimal-scaling with ridge-regression was used to screen variables and establish a prediction model.

While gNO has been shown, in vitro, to be an effective antibacterial agent (at 160 ppm), NO-donor compounds have been shown to inhibit a variety of viruses at varying stages of replication. This research was done in order to determine whether gNO at 80 or 160 ppm possesses an antiviral effect on influenza viruses. Three strains of influenza (A and B) were exposed to gNO for up to 180 min, before and after infection of MDCK cells. In search for possible mechanism of antiviral action, Neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay of H1N1 that was exposed to gNO was performed. Results show that when virions were exposed to gNO prior to infection a complete inhibition of infectivity was achieved for all three strains. Post infection exposure of influenza with gNO resulted in about 30% inhibition of infectivity. Further testing showed that when eliminating the pH effect by exposing a dried virus to gNO, 90% inhibition was found after 2 h exposure. NA activity, of whole dried H1N1 virus, was found to be inhibited by gNO (80%). These results suggest that 80 and 160 ppm gNO have a time dependent antiviral effect on influenza strains of viruses during various stages of cellular infection, which are not due to concomitant changes in pH in the surrounding milieu.

However, studies evaluating how patients using dental prostheses have been affected by the pandemic are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate how patients using different types of dental prostheses were being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 129 randomly selected individuals from among those who had been examined in the same clinic before the COVID-19 outbreak were included in the study. The study participants were divided into 4 groups according to their type of prosthesis: complete dentures, implant-retained removable dentures, tooth-supported fixed partial dentures, and implant-supported fixed partial dentures. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire was implemented by telephone interviews with the study participants, who were also asked about their concerns and steps made regarding prosthetic hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc Dunn tests, and multivariate logistic regression analysis with forward selection was carried out to identify predictors of the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) status (&#945;=.05). RESULTS: OHIP-14 total scores did not vary significantly among the groups (P>.05). When the domain scores of OHIP-14 were considered separately, the analysis revealed that the implant-retained removable denture group had significantly poorer functional limitations when compared with the tooth-supported fixed partial denture (P=.005) and implant-supported fixed partial denture (P=.031) groups. The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated a statistically significant association between OHRQoL during the COVID-19 pandemic and the frequency of tooth or denture cleaning (1 time a day versus less than 1 time a day: P=.011; 2-3 times a day versus less than 1 time a day: P=.032). CONCLUSIONS: All prosthesis users exhibited increased interest in dental hygiene and an increase in the frequency of prosthesis cleaning during the pandemic. Furthermore, the study determined that the frequency of tooth or denture cleaning was associated with significantly improved OHRQoL during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the denture groups, those treated with implant-retained removable dentures had the poorest functional limitation in terms of OHRQoL, which can be linked to postponement of routine maintenance appointments.

Sub-themes for individual-level challenges were: fear of getting or transmitting infection, feeling demotivated and unappreciated, disappointment due to peoples lack of compliance with COVID-19 protocols, physical exhaustion, and fatigue. For the healthcare system, sub-themes were: Infrastructure, logistics, management, and communications response of the hospital/healthcare system and financial stressors. For sub-themes under hope for the future were the improved disease knowledge and vaccine development. The overall perceptions and experiences of FHCWs evolved from fear, grief, and negativity to hope and positivity as the curve of COVID-19 went down. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the individuals and systems were not prepared to deal with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings highlight the challenges faced by individuals and health systems during the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The healthcare workers were emotionally and physically taxed, while the health systems were overwhelmed by COVID-19. The overall perceptions of FHCWs evolved with time and became negative to positive as the curve of COVID-19 went down during the first wave of COVID-19 in Pakistan.","output":"Documenting response to COVID-individual and systems successes and challenges: a longitudinal qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerged in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world despite authorities having made available a number of vaccines. While the coronavirus has been around for a significant period of time, people and authorities still feel the need for awareness due to the mutating nature of the virus and therefore varying symptoms and prevention strategies. People and authorities resort to social media platforms the most to share awareness information and voice out their opinions due to their massive outreach in spreading the word in practically no time. People use a number of languages to communicate over social media platforms based on their familiarity, language outreach, and availability on social media platforms. The entire world has been hit by the coronavirus and India is the second worst-hit country in terms of the number of active coronavirus cases. India, being a multilingual country, offers a great opportunity to study the outreach of various languages that have been actively used across social media platforms. In this study, we aim to study the dataset related to COVID-19 collected in the period between February 2020 to July 2020 specifically for regional languages in India. This could be helpful for the Government of India, various state governments, NGOs, researchers, and policymakers in studying different issues related to the pandemic. We found that English has been the mode of communication in over 64% of tweets while as many as twelve regional languages in India account for approximately 4.77% of tweets. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"IRLCov19: A Large COVID-19 Multilingual Twitter Dataset of Indian Regional Languages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Iron is a trace element that is used to replicate the virus and has a role in the vital functions of the body and the hosts innate immune system. The mechanism of iron in COVID-19 severity is still not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the iron with COVID-19 severity. A caseCcontrol study was performed on 147 patients with a positive PCR test result and 39 normal individuals admitted to the Persian Gulf Martyrs Hospital in Bushehr, Iran. The iron profiles and related tests were measured along with hematological analytes. Hemoglobin (Hb), Fe, and saturated transferrin decreased in all the groups compared to the controls, but ferritin increased in the patient groups. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that increased ferritin levels augmented the odds ratio (OR) of the disease in the moderate (OR = 2.95, P = 0.007), severe (OR = 6.1, P < 0.001), and critical groups (OR = 8.34, P < 0.001). The decreased levels of Fe reduced the OR of the disease in the mild (OR = 0.96, P < 0.001), moderate (OR = 0.96, P < 0.001), severe (OR = 0.95, P < 0.001), and critical (OR = 0.98, P = 0.001) groups. Fe (AUC = 85.95, cutoff < 75.5 g/dL, P < 0.001) and ferritin (AUC = 84.45, cutoff > 157.5 ng/dL, P < 0.001) have higher AUC for disease prognosis, but only ferritin (AUC = 74.89, cutoff > 261.5 ng/dL, P < 0.001) has higher AUC for disease severity assays. It could be concluded that the use of iron chelators to reduce iron intake can be considered a therapeutic goal. In addition, measuring Fe and ferritin is beneficial for the diagnosis of the disease and determining its severity.

Many studies already investigated the effect on different aspects in orthopedic and trauma care. However, the current literature lacks data regarding the consequence on daily surgical business. Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze the development of knee-related pathologies and surgical procedures in a German university level-one trauma center during the lockdown phase and early lockdown phase to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on orthopedic and trauma knee surgery. Material and Methods. The amount of knee joint surgeries performed during the high-peak COVID-19 crisis in the period of January to May 2020 was evaluated retrospectively and compared to the corresponding time periods of the previous years (2017-2019). RESULTS: The COVID-19 lockdown led to a significant decrease in the number of knee injuries in March and April 2020 by 83.3%. Surgical procedures were reduced by 84.8% during the same period. In May 2020, the number of knee joint procedures returned to an almost prepandemic level. The distribution of urgent and elective knee surgery changed to predominantly acute trauma care at the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown and persisted through to May 2020. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a high impact on emergency and elective knee surgery in a level-one trauma center in Germany during the lockdown phase. It also showed that a level-one trauma center in the German healthcare system is able to handle urgent trauma and orthopedic operations during a worldwide medical crisis and to return to a prepandemic level within a short phase.","output":"Knee Surgery during the COVID-19 LockdownExperiences of a Level-One Trauma Center in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microcirculation dysfunction and organ injury after ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) result from a complex pathologic process consisting of multiple links, with metabolism impairment in the ischemia phase and oxidative stress in the reperfusion phase as initiators, and any treatment targeting a single link is insufficient to cope with this.

NF-B activation is a common pro-inflammatory response of host cells to viral infection. The aims of this study were to (i) find an effective combination treatment for coronaviral infections through targeting of the virus per se and cellular NF-B activity; and (ii) to study the underling mechanisms. We found that tylophorine-based compounds target the TGEV viral RNA and effectively inhibit TGEV replication. NF-B inhibition also leads to anti-TGEV replication. NF-B activation induced by TGEV infection was found to be associated with two convergent pathways, IKK-2_IB/p65 and JAK2 mediated p65 phosphorylation, in swine testicular cells. JAK2 inhibition either by CYT387 (a JAK family inhibitor) or by silencing JAK2-expression revealed a dominant JAK2 mediated p65 phosphorylation pathway for NF-B activation and resulted in NF-B inhibition, which overrode the IB regulation via the IKK-2. Finally, tylophorine-based compounds work cooperatively with CYT387 to impart comprehensive anti-TGEV activities. The combination treatment, wherein a tylophorine compound targets TGEV and a JAK2 inhibitor blocks the alternative dominant NF-B activation mediated by JAK2, is more effective and comprehensive than either one alone and constitutes a feasible approach for the treatment of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.","output":"Targeting Coronaviral Replication and Cellular JAK2 Mediated Dominant NF-B Activation for Comprehensive and Ultimate Inhibition of Coronaviral Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-FDG-PET) findings following complete radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment of malignant lung tumors.

All tumors were completely ablated. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the tumor and surrounding lung at baseline and at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after RFA was measured. In addition, the size, histology, location of the tumor, presence of underlying emphysema, electrode type, and complications from RFA were recorded. Data were analyzed using Fisher exact test. RESULTS Baseline tumor SUV was variable (mean, 1.8  1.5 [range, 0.7-7]). The post-RFA F-FDG-PET appearances could be divided into 2 groups. A ring of peripheral activity and central photopenia was seen following 13 (68%) of 19 of ablations, and no ring was noted following 6 (32%) of 19 of ablations. The ring of F-FDG-PET activity was present at 1 month in 62%, at 6 months in 69% and at both 1 and 6 months in 31%. In all cases, central photopenia at 1 or 6 months was replaced by increased activity as the ring resolved at 6 or 12 months, mimicking local tumor progression. The presence of a ring of activity was associated with the use of a cluster electrode (P = 0.01). Lesion size, histology, location, baseline SUV, electrode type, or development of cavitation following RFA were not significantly associated with a post-RFA ring (P > 0.05) on PET scans. At 12 or 24 months, the SUV in the center of the lesion was equal to or greater than the SUV at baseline in 9 (47%) of 19 cases.

INTRODUCTION The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted clinical practice with important changes in the most affected areas, resulting in increased mortality from heart disease (myocardial infarction). The feasibility of continuing a temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) program is unknown. PURPOSE Our objective was to analyze the survival of patients requiring short-term MCS with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) or Impella CP? during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Retrospective study including all VA-ECMO and Impella CP? implants in a referral hospital since March 2020 compared to previous implants results. RESULTS Out of 167 short-term MCS implanted from 2013, 25 (15%) were conducted during the time of COVID-19 pandemic: 19 VA-ECMO and 6 Impella CP? (Table). Compared to preCOVID-19 implants, patients requiring MCS in the COVID era presented more frequently right ventricular dysfunction (p = 0.005) and showed a trend towards older age (p = 0.069) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.063), without other significant differences regarding the baseline situation and implant technique (Table). Encephalopathy was more frequent in the COVID-19 era, with no differences in other complications (Table). Survival at discharge was 43.7% in the pre-COVID era vs 36% during COVID-19 pandemic, without finding statistically significant differences (p = 0.313). CONCLUSION: Survival after temporary MCS did not get worse significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The possibility of short-term MCS should be maintained for cardiogenic shock and other cases of hemodynamic instability.","output":"COVID-19 era: time for temporary mechanical circulatory support?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are important avian pathogens that can cause enormous economic loss on the poultry industry. Different respiratory etiological agents may induce similar clinical signs that make differential diagnosis difficult. Importantly, AIV brings about severe threat to human public health. Therefore, a novel method that can distinguish these viruses quickly and simultaneously is urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, an oligonucleotide microarray system was developed. AIV, including H5, H7, and H9 subtypes; NDV; and IBV were simultaneously detected and differentiated on a microarray. Three probes specific for AIV, NDV, and IBV, as well as three other probes for differentiating H5, H7, and H9 of AIV, were first designed and jet-printed to predetermined locations of initiator-integrated poly(dimethylsiloxane) for the synchronous detection of the six pathogens. The marked multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were hybridized with the specific probes, and the results of hybridization were read directly with the naked eyes. No cross-reaction was observed with 10 other subtypes of AIV and infectious bursal disease virus, indicating that the oligonucleotide microarray assay was highly specific. The sensitivity of the method was at least 100 times higher than that of the conventional PCR, and the detection limit of NDV, AIV, H5, H7, and H9 can reach 0.1 EID(50) (50% egg infective dose), except that of IBV, which was 1 EID(50) per reaction. In the validation of 93 field samples, AIV, IBV, and NDV were detected in 53 (56.99%) samples by oligonucleotide microarray and virus isolation and in 50 (53.76%) samples by conventional PCR. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully developed an approach to differentiate AIV, NDV, IBV, H5, H7, and H9 subtypes of AIV using oligonucleotide microarray. The microarray is an accurate, high-throughput, and relatively simple method for the rapid detection of avian respiratory viral diseases. It can be used for the epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of AIV, IBV, and NDV.

We conducted a comprehensive sampling and reconstructed the phylogenetic tree using plastid and mitochondrial genomic data from 91 to 66 taxa, respectively, representing all the 16 families of Poales. Our analyses support the finding of Bromeliaceae and Typhaceae as the earliest diverging groups within the Poales while having phylogenetic relationships with the polytomy. The clade of Ecdeiocoleaceae and Joinvilleaceae is recovered as the sister group of Poaceae. The three families, Mayacaceae, Eriocaulaceae, and Xyridaceae, of the xyrid assembly diverged successively along the backbone of the Poales phylogeny, and thus this assembly is paraphyletic. Surprisingly, we find substantial phylogenetic conflicts within the plastid genomes of the Poales, as well as among the plastid, mitochondrial, and nuclear data. These conflicts suggest that the Poales could have a complicated evolutionary history, such as rapid radiation and polyploidy, particularly allopolyploidy through hybridization. In sum, our study presents a new perspicacity into the complex phylogenetic relationships and the underlying phylogenetic conflicts within the Poales.","output":"Organelle Phylogenomics and Extensive Conflicting Phylogenetic Signals in the Monocot Order Poales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several analyses have highlighted racial and ethnic disparities related to COVID-19 health outcomes across the United States. Less focus has been placed on more localized contexts, such as carceral settings, where racial and ethnic inequities in COVID-19 health outcomes also exist, but the proximal drivers of inequality are different. In this study, we analyzed mortality rates among incarcerated people in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) to assess racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality. We obtained monthly demographic and mortality information of the TDCJ population from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2021 from TDCJ monthly reports and open record requests filed by the Texas Justice Initiative. We estimated the risk of COVID-19 mortality for the Hispanic and Black population relative to the White population using a Bayesian regression framework, adjusting for sex and age. In the first 12 months of the pandemic, Hispanic and Black all-cause mortality rates were higher than that of the White population, reversing the pattern observed the 12 months prior. Adjusted risk of COVID-19 mortality relative to the White population was 1.96 (CI 1.32-2.93) for the Hispanic population and 1.66 (CI 1.10-2.52) for the Black population. We find that COVID-19 related mortality has disproportionately impacted Hispanic and Black individuals within the TDCJ population. As the proximal mechanisms which drive these inequalities are likely different than those which lead to racial inequalities in the non-incarcerated populations, future studies should look to assess and address the specific drivers of COVID-19 related disparities in carceral settings.","output":"Racial and ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality within carceral settings: An analysis of Texas prisons and jails"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gene silencing using RNA-interference, first described in mammalian systems almost a decade ago, is revolutionizing therapeutic target validation efforts both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the potential for using short interfering RNA (siRNA) as a therapy in its own right is also progressing at a significant pace. However, the widespread use of such approaches is contingent on having appropriate systems to achieve clinically appropriate, safe, and efficient delivery of siRNA. There are many physicochemical and biological barriers to such delivery, and a growing emphasis on the design and characterisation of non-viral technologies that will overcome these barriers and expedite targeted delivery. This review discusses the considerations and challenges associated with use of siRNA-based therapeutics, including stability and off-target effects. Speculation is made on the properties of an ideal delivery system and the non-viral delivery approaches used to date, both in vitro and in vivo, are classified and discussed.

Uncontrolled charging has recently emerged as the main detrimental factor to this otherwise environmentally friendly and paradigm shifting technology due to the incurred impact on the energy grid. In addition, people are usually hesitant in allowing their vehicles to be controlled by external units;therefore, controlled charging strategies that offer users the option to have some control over their vehicles seems to be a sensible choice moving towards a gasoline-free vehicles market. This work investigated two price-sensitive charging strategies that allowed users to control the charging of their vehicle in order to receive cost benefits. These strategies were of a parametric nature;thus, the analysis focused on providing useful rules of thumb to guide users in choosing the most suitable strategy and the relevant parameters according to their driving profiles. The results show that when driving less than 40 km/h on average and employing a price-sensitive charging strategy with the proposed optimized parameters, electric car users may obtain 30C40% of the running cost reduction.","output":"Minimizing the Cost of PHEV Usage with Price Sensitive Charging Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the worst public health crisis of the century.

With no effective treatment yet, vaccination seems to be the most effective method of prevention. Recently developed vaccines have been approved for emergency use only and are currently applied to large populations. Considering both the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases (AIIRDs) and the immunosuppressive drugs used in treatment, vaccination for COVID-19 deserves special attention in such patients. In this article, we aimed to give simple messages to the clinicians for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with AIIRDs based upon the current evidence regarding the use of other vaccines in this patient group. For this purpose, we conducted a Pubmed search using the following keywords: Influenza, Hepatitis B, Pneumococcal, and Shingles vaccines and the frequently used conventional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Likewise, an additional search was performed for the COVID-19 immunization in patients with AIIRDs and considering such drugs. In summary, patients with AIIRDs should also be vaccinated against COVID-19, preferably when disease activity is under control and when there is no concurrent infection. Low-degree immunosuppression does not appear to decrease antibody responses to vaccines. Ideally, vaccinations should be done before the initiation of any biological DMARDs. Patients receiving rituximab should be vaccinated at least 4 weeks before or 6 months after treatment. Since tofacitinib may also reduce antibody responses, especially in combination with methotrexate, it may be appropriate to discontinue this drug before vaccination and to restart after 14 days of immunization.","output":"A practical approach for vaccinations including COVID-19 in autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatic diseases: a non-systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A widE-Ranging investigation of the first COVID-19 LOCkdown effects on the atmospheric composition in five Italian Urban Sites (AERCLOCUS) has been carried out and is presented in this study. The analysis uses particle and gas concentrations from surface in situ sampling, column aerosol and gas properties from photometer/spectrometers, and satellite NO2 determinations at five sites distributed over the whole Italian territory: Aosta, Milan, Bologna, Rome, and Taranto. These data are related to meteorological conditions to identify the numerous events of long-range transport and separate local from remote influences. Four different types of long-range transport over Italy are identified during the lockdown period, affecting PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 concentrations, and aerosol optical depths: fires plumes from Eastern Europe and Montenegro, dust from the Caspian area and from the Sahara, and pollution from the Po Valley. Once the long-range transport events are identified and excluded, the variation of gas and particle concentrations occurring during the containment period is calculated with respect to the period 2015C2019. A general decrease of PM10 (ranging from a maximum of ?52% in Aosta to a minimum of ?4% in Taranto), PM2.5 (from ?46% in Aosta and Milan to ?0.6% in Bologna), BC (from ?77% in Aosta to ?25% in Milan), NO2 (from ?72% in Rome to ?4% in Taranto), and benzene (about ?50%) concentration is found. A positive variation of PM2.5 is conversely found during March in the southern sites due to some stagnation events, and a strong increase of benzene (up to +104%) in the industrial area of Taranto. Ozone is found to increase by an average of about 30% in all sites. The removal of the long-range transport contributions affects the variations with respect to the reference period reducing the concentrations by up to 22% for PM10 and 29% for PM2.5 in the northern sites, and 18% for PM10 and 16% for PM2.5 in the southern sites. For NO2 the reduction due to the removal is up to 14% in Milan and 6% in the southern sites, while for the aerosol optical depth it is up to 70% in Aosta and 50% in Rome.","output":"A wide-ranging investigation of the COVID-19 lockdown effects on the atmospheric composition in various Italian urban sites (AER C LOCUS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 is a highly infectious virus that is responsible for the COVID\\\\19 global pandemic that swept the world in 2020. Disease outcomes range from asymptomatic to fatal. The virus initiates entry into host cells by the binding of its spike protein to the ACE2 receptor. Entry is finalized by the activation of spike glycoprotein by proteases including transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and FURIN which cleave the spike protein of the virus. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMPRSS2 may lead to functional changes which could underlie differences in disease severity. TMPRSS2 is also known to activate different respiratory illnesses including coronaviruses and influenza A (Shen et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown that knockout TMPRSS2 mice appeared healthy, experienced a decrease in viral spread within the respiratory system, and had a less severe immune response when infected with SARS\\\\CoV and MERS\\\\CoV (Baughn et al., 2020). Thus, we asked whether genetic variations in TMPRSS2 in humans lead to differences in infection rates or severity of disease symptoms of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. We examined the NCBI dbSNP database to identify SNPs in the TMPRSS2 gene. As of 10 December 2020, we found there were 11,023 intron variants, 393 missense variants, 186 synonymous variants, 3 in\\\\frame insertion variants, 2 in\\\\frame deletion variants, and 1 initiator codon variant reported. To narrow these down to 23 SNPs of interest, we first searched the ClinVar database to identify SNPs with general clinical significance, followed by searching the literature to determine SNPs specifically related to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 severity. One missense variant, rs12329760, results in an amino acid substitution, V160M, which has been predicted to alter TMPRSS2 function. A subset of these SNPs show differences in frequency in world populations, and we wondered if these SNPs had structural and functional consequences for the protein. A crystal structure of TMPRSS2 is not currently available. To visualize the structural consequences of amino acid substitutions, we performed homology modeling on TMPRSS2 (UniProt O15393) using the structure prediction software HHPred, RaptorX, and SwissModel based on the ~30% similarity to hepsin. The predicted structures of TMPRSS2 with various amino acid substitutions were then docked to the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 spike protein using I\\\\TASSER and Haddock 2.4 to observe differences in binding interactions and therefore determine which sequence changes are predicted to alter binding interactions, potentially contributing to the wide variation of symptoms caused by COVID\\\\19.

In this paper we review use of causal inference methods to assess the impact of aspects of patient management other than the randomised intervention in RCTs. METHODS We identified papers that used causal inference methodology in RCT data from Medline, Premedline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from 1986 to September 2014, using a forward citation search of five seminal papers, and a keyword search. We did not include studies where inverse probability weighting was used solely to balance baseline characteristics, adjust for loss to follow-up or adjust for non-compliance to randomised treatment. Studies where the exposure could not be assigned were also excluded. RESULTS There were 25 papers identified. Nearly half the papers (11/25) estimated the causal effect of concomitant medication on outcome. The remainder were concerned with post-randomisation treatment regimens (sequential treatments, n =5 ), effects of treatment timing (n = 2) and treatment dosing or duration (n = 7). Examples were found in cardiovascular disease (n = 5), HIV (n = 7), cancer (n = 6), mental health (n = 4), paediatrics (n = 2) and transfusion medicine (n = 1). The most common method implemented was a marginal structural model with inverse probability of treatment weighting.

ABSTRACT: Advances in the using in vitro transcribed (IVT) modRNA in the past two decades, especially the tremendous recent success of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, have brought increased attention to IVT mRNA technology. Despite its well-known use in infectious disease vaccines, IVT modRNA technology is being investigated mainly in cancer immunotherapy and protein replacement therapy, with ongoing clinical trials in both areas. One of the main barriers to progressing mRNA therapeutics to the clinic is determining how to deliver mRNA to target cells and protect it from degradation. Over the years, many different vehicles have been developed to tackle this issue. Desirable vehicles must be safe, stable and preferably organ specific for successful mRNA delivery to clinically relevant cells and tissues. In this review we discuss various mRNA delivery platforms, with particular focus on attempts to create organ-specific vehicles for therapeutic mRNA delivery.","output":"Lipid Nanoparticles for Organ-Specific mRNA Therapeutic Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first consensus report of the working party of the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) set up in 2004 on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) was published in 2009.

Based on the prospective data analysis of nearly 1400 patients, the AARC consensus was published in 2014. In the past nearly four-and-a-half years, the AARC database has been enriched to about 5200 cases by major hepatology centers across Asia. The data published during the interim period were carefully analyzed and areas of contention and new developments in the field of ACLF were prioritized in a systematic manner. The AARC database was also approached for answering some of the issues where published data were limited, such as liver failure grading, its impact on the Golden Therapeutic Window, extrahepatic organ dysfunction and failure, development of sepsis, distinctive features of acute decompensation from ACLF and pediatric ACLF and the issues were analyzed. These initiatives concluded in a two-day meeting in October 2018 at New Delhi with finalization of the new AARC consensus. Only those statements, which were based on evidence using the Grade System and were unanimously recommended, were accepted. Finalized statements were again circulated to all the experts and subsequently presented at the AARC investigators meeting at the AASLD in November 2018.

Key aspects of BIOTOX are the prehospital provision of specialized advance life support for toxic injuries and the protection of responders in contaminated environments. BIOTOX was successfully used during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in France.","output":"Terrorism in France."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Profound lymphopenia has been observed during many acute viral infections, and our laboratory has previously documented a type I IFN-dependent loss of CD8 T cells immediately preceding the development of the antiviral T cell response. Most memory (CD44(high)) and some naive (CD44(low)) CD8 T cells are susceptible to IFN-induced attrition, and we show in this study that the IFN-induced attrition of CD8(+)CD44(high) T cells is associated with elevated activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8. We questioned whether TCR engagement by Ag would render CD8 T cells resistant to attrition. We tested whether a high concentration of Ag (GP33 peptide) would protect lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV)-specific naive CD8 T cells (TCR transgenic P14 cells specific for the GP33 epitope of LCMV) and memory CD8 T cells (GP33-specific LCMV-immune cells) from depletion. Both naive P14 and memory GP33-specific donor CD8 T cells decreased substantially 16 h after inoculation with the Toll receptor agonist and IFN inducer, poly(I:C), regardless of whether a high concentration of GP33 peptide was administered to host mice beforehand. Moreover, donor naive P14 and LCMV-specific memory cells were depleted from day 2 LCMV-infected hosts by 16 h posttransfer. These results indicate that Ag engagement does not protect CD8 T cells from the IFN-induced T cell attrition associated with viral infections. In addition, computer models indicated that early depletion of memory T cells may allow for the generation for a more diverse T cell response to infection by reducing the immunodomination caused by cross-reactive T cells.","output":"IFN-induced attrition of CD8 T cells in the presence or absence of cognate antigen during the early stages of viral infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected nephrology. Firstly, dialysis patients appear to be at increased risk for infection due to viral transmission next to an enhanced risk for mortality as compared to the general population, even in the face of an often apparently mild clinical presentation. Derangements in the innate and adaptive immune systems may be responsible for a reduced antiviral response, whereas chronic activation of the innate immune system and endothelial dysfunction provide a background for a more severe course. The presence of severe comorbidity, older age, and a reduction of organ reserve may lead to a rapid deterioration of the clinical situation of the patients in case of severe infection. Secondly, patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), which is related to the severity of the clinical disease. The presence of AKI, and especially the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), is associated with an increased risk of mortality. AKI in COVID-19 has a multifactorial origin, in which direct viral invasion of kidney cells, activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, a hyperinflammatory response, hypercoagulability, and nonspecific factors such as hypotension and hypoxemia may be involved. Apart from logistic challenges and the need for strict hygiene within units, treatment of patients with ESRD and COVID-19 is not different from that of the general population. Extracorporeal treatment of patients with AKI with RRT can be complicated by frequent filter clotting due to the hypercoagulable state, for which regional citrate coagulation provides a reasonable solution. Also, acute peritoneal dialysis may be a reasonable option in these patients. Whether adjuncts to extracorporeal therapies, such as hemoadsorption, provide additional benefits in the case of severely ill COVID-19 patients needs to be addressed in controlled studies.","output":"COVID-19 in ESRD and Acute Kidney Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 may spread rapidly in densely populated urban informal settlements. Kenya swiftly implemented mitigation policies; we assess the economic, social and health-related harm disproportionately impacting women. DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal cohort study with repeated mobile phone surveys in April, May and June 2020. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 2009 households across five informal settlements in Nairobi, sampled from two previously interviewed cohorts. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes include food insecurity, risk of household violence and forgoing necessary health services due to the pandemic. Gender-stratified linear probability regression models were constructed to determine the factors associated with these outcomes. RESULTS: By May, more women than men reported adverse effects of COVID-19 mitigation policies on their lives. Women were 6 percentage points more likely to skip a meal versus men (coefficient: 0.055; 95% CI 0.016 to 0.094), and those who had completely lost their income were 15 percentage points more likely versus those employed (coefficient: 0.154; 95% CI 0.125 to 0.184) to skip a meal. Compared with men, women were 8 percentage points more likely to report increased risk of household violence (coefficient: 0.079; 95% CI 0.028 to 0.130) and 6 percentage points more likely to forgo necessary healthcare (coefficient: 0.056; 95% CI 0.037 to 0.076).

The aim of this study was to compare 6-month outcomes in older adults diagnosed with medical conditions in the ED then admitted inappropriately to surgical wards (defined as outliers), with outcomes in comparable patients admitted to medical wards (controls). METHODS In a matched cohort study, 100 consecutive medical outliers from the ED aged 75 years and over were matched according to age, sex and diagnosis to 200 controls. Collected data included number of diagnoses reported in acute care, level of patient illness severity, length of stay, mortality and destination of patients discharged from acute care units (home, rehabilitation facility, nursing home or palliative care facility). An assessment was made of patient vital status and living environment (home, nursing home or hospital) at 6 months post-ED admission. RESULTS Mean age was 85.6 years. The most common ED diagnoses were gait disorders/falls (18%), neurological disorders (17%) and exhaustion (16%). Outliers displayed lower illness severity levels (0.001) and shorter lengths of stay from ED admission to acute care discharge (p=0.040). Subsequent to acute care, outliers were less commonly discharged home (45% vs 59%) and more commonly discharged to rehabilitation facilities (42% vs 28%). At 6 months post-ED admission, multivariable regression analysis showed that outlier status (OR=0.44 (0.25-0.83); p=0.011) and numbers of diagnoses reported in acute care (OR=0.87 (0.76-0.98); p=0.028) were independently associated with lower probability of living at home. CONCLUSION Outlying of older patients to surgical wards negatively affects their prospects of living at home at 6 months after hospital admission. Older patients hospitalised via the ED are entitled to appropriate medical care.","output":"Older medical outliers on surgical wards: impact on 6-month outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to accurately predict the early progression of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality rates in severely affected patients. However, the utility of biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes remains elusive in HFRS. The aims of the current study were to analyze the serum levels of immune function-related proteins and identify novel biomarkers that may help ascertain clinical outcomes of HFRS. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Luminex, and bioanalyzer assays were used to quantitatively detect 15 biomarkers in 49 serum samples of 26 patients with HFRS. High hemoglobin (HGB) and low urine output (UO) levels were identified as potential biomarkers associated with the acute HFRS. The serum soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) values increased in the early phase of diseases. Elevated suPAR, interleukin-10 (IL-10), CXCL10, and decreased transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-3) were representative predictors of the disease severity. Upregulation of the HGB showed a significant correlation with high levels of suPAR and CXCL10. Reduced UO positively correlated with increased suPAR, CXCL10, and TGF-2, and decreased vascular endothelial growth factor and TGF-3. The changing HGB and UO criteria, high suPAR, IL-10, CXCL10, and low TGF-3 of HFRS raise significant awareness for physicians regarding prospective biomarkers for monitoring early warning signs of HFRS.

Therefore, it is a cause for concern around the world, and forecasting the number of future patients and death cases, although not entirely accurate, helps the governments and health-policy makers to make the necessary decisions and impose restrictions to reduce prevalence. METHODS: In this study, we aimed to find the best model for forecasting the number of confirmed and death cases in Iran. For this purpose, we applied nine models including NNETAR, ARIMA, Hybrid, Holt-Winter, BSTS, TBATS, Prophet, MLP, and ELM network models. The quality of forecasting models is evaluated by three performance metrics, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The best model is selected by the lowest value of performance metrics. Then, the number of confirmed and the death cases forecasted for the 30 next days. The used data in this study is the absolute number of confirmed, death cases from February 20 to August 15, 2020. RESULTS: Our findings suggested that based on existing data in Iran, the suitable model with the lowest performance metrics for confirmed cases data obtained MLP network and the Holt-Winter model is the suitable model for forecasting death cases in the future. These models forecasted on September 14, 2020, we will have 2,484 new confirmed and 114 new death cases of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study and the existing data, we concluded that the MLP and Holt-Winter models had the lowest error in forecasting in comparison to other methods. Some models had fitted poorly in the test phase and this is because many other factors that are either not available or have been ignored in this study and can affect the accuracy of forecast results. Based on the trend of data and forecast results, the number of confirmed cases and death cases are almost constant and decreasing, respectively.

We found that the population flow out of Wuhan had a long\\\\term impact on the epidemic's spread. In the outbreak period, a large population flow out of Wuhan led to nationwide migration mobility, which directly increased the epidemic in each province. Meanwhile, quick emergency responses mitigated the spread. Although low population flow to provinces far from Hubei delayed the outbreak in those provinces, relatively delayed emergency response increased the epidemic in the control period.

Significant differences were detected for 3 out of 26 problems. We then identified abnormally short problem attempts indicative of potential rapid answer copying, by fitting the attempt duration distribution of each problem with finite-mixture models, using mixtures of either normal or skewed distributions. We detected a significantly smaller fraction of short attempts from self-reporting students on only 3 out of 26 problems and found no statistically significant difference in percentage correct of short attempts between the populations. In conclusion, our analysis did not find evidence indicating widespread rapid answer copying among students. We also explored differences in learning behavior between the two populations by applying process mining to the event logs of one of the homework learning modules, which reveals that some students may have copied answers after spending a longer time or using multiple attempts on a given problem.

Concurrently, a transversal study was carried out in patients on active systemic cancer treatment for symptomatology and seroprevalence (IgG/IgM by ELISA-method) against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Cohort 2). RESULTS: A total of 215 patients (Cohort 1) were admitted to hospital with a confirmed COVID-19 infection between February 28 and April 30, 2020, and 17 died (7.9%). A medical record of cancer was noted in 43 cases (20%), 6 of them required Intensive care unit ICU attention (14%), and 7 died (16%). There were thirty-six patients (83%) who tested IgG/IgM positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients on immunosuppressive therapies presented a lower ratio of seroconversion (40% vs. 8%; p = 0.02). In Cohort 2, 166 patients were included in a symptoms-survey and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Any type of potential COVID-19-related symptom was referred up to 67.4% of patients (85.9% vs. 48.2% vs. 73.9%, for patients on chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies respectively, p < 0.05).

CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer present higher risks for hospital needs for COVID-19 infection. The lack of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion may be a concern for patients on immunosuppressive therapies. Patients receiving systematic therapies relayed a high rate of potentially COVID-19-related symptoms, particularly those receiving chemotherapy. However, the seroconversion rate remains low and in the range of general population.","output":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Patients with Cancer: Retrospective and Transversal Studies in Spanish Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study is to investigate the opinions of architecture students about the usage of online platforms as alternative socialization environments during the Covid-19 outbreak.

Persons living with diagnosed HIV may be more prone to COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes, yet few studies have assessed this possibility at a population level. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between HIV diagnosis and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and in-hospital death in New York State. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study, conducted in New York State, including New York City, between March 1 and June 15, 2020, matched data from HIV surveillance, COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed diagnoses, and hospitalization databases to provide a full population-level comparison of COVID-19 outcomes between persons living with diagnosed HIV and persons living without diagnosed HIV. EXPOSURES: Diagnosis of HIV infection through December 31, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and in-hospital death. COVID-19 diagnoses, hospitalizations, and in-hospital death rates comparing persons living with diagnosed HIV with persons living without dianosed HIV were computed, with unadjusted rate ratios and indirect standardized rate ratios (sRR), adjusting for sex, age, and region. Adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) for outcomes specific to persons living with diagnosed HIV were assessed by age, sex, region, race/ethnicity, transmission risk, and CD4(+) T-cell countCdefined HIV disease stage, using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: A total of 2988 persons living with diagnosed HIV (2109 men [70.6%]; 2409 living in New York City [80.6%]; mean [SD] age, 54.0 [13.3] years) received a diagnosis of COVID-19. Of these persons living with diagnosed HIV, 896 were hospitalized and 207 died in the hospital through June 15, 2020. After standardization, persons living with diagnosed HIV and persons living without diagnosed HIV had similar diagnosis rates (sRR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.91-0.97]), but persons living with diagnosed HIV were hospitalized more than persons living without diagnosed HIV, per population (sRR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.29-1.47]) and among those diagnosed (sRR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.37-1.56]). Elevated mortality among persons living with diagnosed HIV was observed per population (sRR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.07-1.40]) and among those diagnosed (sRR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.13-1.48]) but not among those hospitalized (sRR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.83-1.09]). Among persons living with diagnosed HIV, non-Hispanic Black individuals (aRR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.40-1.81]) and Hispanic individuals (aRR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.83-2.37]) were more likely to receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 than White individuals, but they were not more likely to be hospitalized once they received a diagnosis or to die once hospitalized. Hospitalization risk increased with disease progression to HIV stage 2 (aRR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.11-1.49]) and stage 3 (aRR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.38-2.07]) relative to stage 1. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, persons living with diagnosed HIV experienced poorer COVID-related outcomes relative to persons living without diagnosed HIV; Previous HIV diagnosis was associated with higher rates of severe disease requiring hospitalization, and hospitalization risk increased with progression of HIV disease stage.","output":"COVID-19 Outcomes Among Persons Living With or Without Diagnosed HIV Infection in New York State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE During COVID-19 lockdown the enforced social isolation and other pandemic-related changes highly increased the risk of mental health problems. We aimed to discover how elderly people coped with the psychological burdens of pandemic and the social isolation in Hungary. METHODS This study included 589 (441 females) Hungarian individuals, aged 60-83 (M = 68.1, SD = 4.46). We collected online survey data to reach a wide population of elderly. Results of hierarchical linear modelling and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses established how the current life-changing circumstances, the intolerance of uncertainty, loneliness and social support influence the mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, well-being) of the elderly. The model was used to explore how adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the effects. RESULTS Findings showed that perceived change in mood, social connectedness, and quality of life was negatively affected by catastrophizing and loneliness; whereas positive refocusing and contamination fear had a positive effect. According to the SEM analysis, intolerance of uncertainty and loneliness directly affected mental health. Further, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the connection between intolerance of uncertainty, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. Whereas adaptive emotion regulation strategy mediated the connection between social support from friends, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. CONCLUSION Overall, our research might help the understanding of how external and internal factors contributed to the well-being of elderly people during the COVID-19. The model can also be translated into professional interventions to develop coping strategies among elderly for the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic in their lives.","output":"Psychological well-being and coping strategies of elderly people during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interferon induced transmembrane-protein 3 (IFITM3) plays an important role in the defence against viral infection.

Decreased infant mortality might be expected, consequentially to result in greater morbidity in older children due to complications later in childhood and adolescence. This study aims to evaluate the use of cardiovascular medication (CVM) as an indicator of disease burden in children born with CHD in the first 10 years of life. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Six population-based registries from the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) network participated. Data from live born children with major congenital anomalies (CA) born from 2000 to 2014 were linked to prescription databases. Four groups of children were analysed: CA, CHD, severe CHD (sCHD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) without sCHD. Live born children without CA were included as reference group. PARTICIPANTS: We obtained data on 61 038 children born with a CA, including 19 678 with CHD, 3392 with sCHD, 12 728 children with VSD without sCHD, and 1 725 496 reference children. RESULTS: Children born with sCHD were the most likely to receive a CVM prescription (42.9%, 95% CI, 26.3 to 58.5) in the first year of life compared with 13.3% (6.7 to 22.0) of children with any CHD, 5.9% (3.7 to 8.7) of children with any CA and 0.1% (0.0 to 0.1) of reference children. Medication was less likely to be prescribed after the first year of life for sCHD; 18.8% (14.8 to 23.1) for children 1C4 years and 15.8% (12.0 to 20.1) 5C9 years. Children with sCHD were most likely to receive a diuretic (36.4%, 18.6 to 54.5), an antihypertensive (6.9%, 3.7 to 11.3) or a beta-blocker (5.5%, 2.9 to9.2). CONCLUSION: Almost half of all children with sCHD were prescribed CVM in their first year of life.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients who underwent EUS-FNB between June 2016 and March 2020 in our hospital. Two types of needles were evaluated a 20-gauge Menghini needle with a lateral forward bevel and a 22-gauge Franseen needle. Rapid on-site evaluation was performed in all the cases. A multivariate analysis was performed to clarify the negative predictive factors for obtaining a histological diagnosis. Propensity score matching was performed to compare the diagnostic yields of these two needles. Results We analyzed 666 patients and 690 lesions. The overall diagnostic rate of histology alone was 88.8%, and the overall adverse event rate was 1.5%. Transduodenal access and small lesions (2 cm) were identified as negative predictive factors for obtaining a histological diagnosis. After propensity score matching, 482 lesions were analyzed. The diagnostic accuracy rates of histology in the M and F needle groups were 89.2% and 88.8%, respectively (p=1.00).

The new CoViD-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), developed in China, is characterized as a rapid compilation tool (10 minutes), easily understandable and appreciated by people. AIM: The objectives of this study were: (1) the validation of the Italian version of the CPDI, and (2) the measurement of the prevalence of peritraumatic distress in this phase 1 CoViD-19. METHOD: CPDI has been translated using a standard forward-backward-translation procedure and offered online to 329 people (191 females and 137 males, aged 46.49  13.58 years). The CPDI showed an internal-consistency of Cronbach's &#945; =0.916. Content validity was judged satisfactory by two psychologists experienced in stress and trauma. The construct validity is given by the high correlation with the dimensions of Intrusion, Avoidance and Hyperarousal as measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (r=0.63, r=0.57, r=0.71, respectively). RESULTS: Our results are comparable to the Chinese ones. A third of people experienced symptoms of mild/moderate and severe peritraumatic distress. Females have higher scores, compared to males. Older people are more resilient, compared to younger, and those who have been in quarantine report less distress than those didn't, as evidenced by the results of the multivariate logistic regression model. High distress was associated with use of psychotropic drugs (AOR=4.28; 95% CI=1.55-11.85), sleeping remedies (AOR=4.05; 95% CI=2.07-7.94), be worried about dying in case of contagion CoViD-19 (AOR=3.33; 95% CI=1.83-6.06), female gender (AOR=2.95; 95% CI=1.58-5.53) and have a religious belief (AOR=1.97; 95% CI=1.05-3.70). To be aged 51-71 years, to have been in quarantine and to have received psychological support were variables associated with lower distress scores. CONCLUSIONS: The psychometric properties of the Italian version are satisfactory and confirm that CPDI is a tool fast, non-intrusive, administered online, and therefore 'safe' in a phase with a high risk of contagion. It allows, like a psychic thermoscan, to quickly detect the needs of the population and propose equally rapid interventions.","output":"Italian validation of CoViD-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index and preliminary data in a sample of general population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare, malignant tumor of the sebaceous glands.

We examined whether COVID-19 risk differs according to antihypertensive drug class in patients treated by ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) compared with calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Three exclusive cohorts of prevalent ACE inhibitors, ARB and CCB users, aged 18 to 80 years, from the French National Health Insurance databases were followed from February 15, 2020 to June 7, 2020. We excluded patients with a history of diabetes, known cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, or chronic respiratory disease during the previous 5 years, to only consider patients treated for uncomplicated hypertension and to limit indication bias. The primary end point was time to hospitalization for COVID-19. The secondary end point was time to intubation/death during a hospital stay for COVID-19. In a population of almost 2 million hypertensive patients (ACE inhibitors: 566 023; ARB: 958 227; CCB: 358 306) followed for 16 weeks, 2338 were hospitalized and 526 died or were intubated for COVID-19.

Among all the countries, Japan became one of the countries with the highest COVID-19 vaccination rate in several months, although the vaccine confidence in Japan is the lowest worldwide. ObjectiveWe attempted to find the reasons for the rapid coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in Japan under the lowest vaccine confidence in the world by Twitter analysis. Materials and methodsWe downloaded COVID-19 related Japanese tweets from a large-scale public COVID-19 Twitter chatter dataset within the timeline of February 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021. The daily number of vaccination cases was collected from the official website of the Prime Ministers Office of Japan. After preprocessing, we applied unigram and bigram token analysis, then calculated the cross correlation and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the term frequency and daily vaccination cases. Then we identified vaccine sentiments and emotions of tweets and used the topic modeling to look deeper into the dominant emotions. ResultsWe selected 190,697 vaccine-related tweets after filtering. By n-gram token analysis, we discovered the top unigrams and bigrams over the whole period. In all the combinations of the top six unigrams, tweets with both keywords \\"reserve\\" and \\"venue\\" showed the largest r = 0.912 (P < 0.001) with the daily vaccination cases. In sentiment analysis, negative sentiment overwhelmed positive sentiment, and fear was the dominant emotion across the period. For the latent Dirichlet allocation model on tweets with fear emotion, the two topics were identified as \\"infect\\" and \\"vaccine confidence\\". The expectation of the number of tweets generated from topic \\"infect\\" was larger than \\"vaccine confidence.\\" ConclusionOur work indicated that awareness of the danger of COVID-19 might increase the willingness to get vaccinated; With sufficient vaccine supply, effective vaccine reservation information delivery may be an important factor for people to get vaccinated; We didnt find evidence for increased vaccine confidence in Japan during the period in our research.

We aimed to compare self-perceived proficiency of PPE use and objective performance, and identify predictors of low compliance and PPE misuse. METHODS: An observational study combined with subjective questionnaires were carried out during a bioterror simulation drill. Forty-two observers evaluated performance under PPE. Mistakes were recorded and graded using a structured observational format and were correlated with the subjective questionnaires and with demographic parameters. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-eight HCWs from community clinics and hospitals were included. The mean self-perceived proficiency was high (6.1 out of 7), mean level of comfort was moderate (4.0 out of 7), and mean objective performance was intermediate (9.5 out of 13). There was no correlation between comfort and objective performance scores. Self-perceived proficiency was in correlation with donning and continuous performance with PPE but not with doffing.

Despite the approval of the first malaria vaccine Mosquirix? and very promising data using cryopreserved P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ), further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of humoral immunity for the development of next-generation vaccines and alternative malaria therapies including antibody therapy. A high prevalence of antibodies against AMA1 in immune individuals has made this antigen one of the major blood-stage vaccine candidates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using antibody phage display, an AMA1-specific growth inhibitory human monoclonal antibody from a malaria-immune Fab library using a set of three AMA1 diversity covering variants (DiCo 1C3), which represents a wide range of AMA1 antigen sequences, was selected. The functionality of the selected clone was tested in vitro using a growth inhibition assay with P. falciparum strain 3D7. To potentially improve affinity and functional activity of the isolated antibody, a phage display mediated light chain shuffling was employed. The parental light chain was replaced with a light chain repertoire derived from the same population of human V genes, these selected antibodies were tested in binding tests and in functionality assays. RESULTS: The selected parental antibody achieved a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 1.25 mg/mL. The subsequent light chain shuffling led to the generation of four derivatives of the parental clone with higher expression levels, similar or increased affinity and improved EC(50) against 3D7 of 0.29 mg/mL. Pairwise epitope mapping gave evidence for binding to AMA1 domain II without competing with RON2. CONCLUSION: We have thus shown that a compact immune human phage display library is sufficient for the isolation of potent inhibitory monoclonal antibodies and that minor sequence mutations dramatically increase expression levels in Nicotiana benthamiana. Interestingly, the antibody blocks parasite inhibition independently of binding to RON2, thus having a yet undescribed mode of action.","output":"Isolation and light chain shuffling of a Plasmodium falciparum AMA1-specific human monoclonal antibody with growth inhibitory activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": COVID-19 has strained hospital capacity, detracted from patient care, and reduced hospital income.

Lack of emotional well-being could be a reason for workforce attrition. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress among Swedish midwives in relation to background variables. METHODS A random sample of 1000 midwives were asked to participate and complete a questionnaire. Participants completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and Quality of Life inventories together with demographic and work-related data. RESULTS In all, 470 midwives responded to the questionnaire (48%). The prevalence of moderate/severe/very severe symptoms of depressive symptoms was 12%, anxiety 8.6%, and stress 7.2%. Midwives aged <40 years and those with <10 years work experience reported higher levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress. The factors most strongly associated with symptoms of depression were personal burnout (AOR=12.26), client burnout (AOR=1.95) and quality of life (AOR=0.26) The factors most strongly associated with symptoms of anxiety were work burnout (AOR=2.53) and personal burnout (AOR=5.61). The factors most strongly associated with stress were personal burnout (AOR=3.90) and work burnout (AOR=3.58) and high quality of life (AOR=0.34).

We describe the rationale and methods of the Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Registry (INSPIRE) that combines patient-reported outcomes with data from digital health records to understand predictors and impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: INSPIRE is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study of individuals with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in eight regions across the US. Included are adults fluent in English or Spanish, with self-reported symptoms suggestive of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, enrolled within 42 days of having a US Food and Drug Administration approved SARS-CoV-2 viral test (i.e., nucleic acid amplification test or antigen test). Recruitment occurs in-person, by phone or email, and through online advertisement. A secure online platform is used to facilitate the collation of consent-related materials, digital health records, and responses to self-administered surveys. Participants will be followed for up to 18 months, with patient-reported outcomes collected every three months via survey and linked to concurrent digital health data; follow-up includes no in-person involvement. Our maximum expected enrollment is 4,800 participants, including 3,600 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 1,200 SARS-CoV-2 negative participants (as a concurrent comparison group). These data will allow assessment of longitudinal outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection and comparison of the relative risk of outcomes in individuals with and without infection.

AIM Establish possible prognostic factors of severe psoriasis. METHODS Three groups of patients were included: 118 were on topical therapy, 83 used conventional systemic drugs and 112 were treated with biological agents. Based of the fact that patients on topical therapy have a lower grade of disease severity than patients treated systemically, we compared a variety of comorbidities and epidemiological parameters between the three groups. RESULTS Patients treated more aggressively have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (p = 0.044), suffer more from depression (p = 0.020), hyperuricemia (p = 0.031) and nonspecific non-infectious liver disease (p = 0.005). Male gender (p < 0.001), increased height (p < 0.001), early age of disease onset (p < 0.001), viral upper respiratory infections (p = 0.049) and periods of hormonal changes (p = 0.045) are associated with these therapies. CONCLUSION Psoriasis severity is directly related to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, hyperuricemia and nonspecific non-infectious liver disease.

Each paradigm is then investigated on its own. This in particular allows for the derivation of a general and attainable bound.

The creation of correlations part is devoted to the quantitative study of how much correlations can be created for a given amount of energy. After having precisely formulated the problem of interest, we solve it for arbitrary finite dimensional bipartite systems for vanishing background temperatures.

RESULTS Fusion rates were 82% to 100% for allograft and 88% to 98% for PEEK interbody devices. The reported data were insufficient to perform meta-analysis. Structural allograft had the highest reported rate of reoperation (14%), and PEEK interbody devices had the highest reported subsidence rate (18%). Patient-reported outcomes improved in both groups. There was insufficient high-quality evidence to compare the associations of various PEEK modifications with fusion rates. CONCLUSION Fusion rates were similar between structural allograft and PEEK interbody devices when used for ACDF for cervical spine degeneration. Currently, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to assess associations of PEEK modifications with fusion rates.

E-cigarette flavors has driven adolescents to use these convenient, USB-like devices, designed to create a desired social image, while being seemingly unaware of the serious health consequences of their behavior. Vaping impacts protective pulmonary barriers by attenuating the mucociliary clearance and by increasing peribronchial inflammation and fibrosis. The recent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been characterized by a plethora of unusual disease presentations. Among them, a unique presentation seen exclusively in children and adolescents was multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Seventy percent of adolescents who had MIS-C also had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and we speculate that there may exist common denominator that links MIS-C and adolescents: the use of e-cigarettes. The virus targets the angiotensin converting receptor (ACE receptor), and studies have shown nicotine-based e-cigarettes or vaping cause oxidative stress and resulting in the upregulation of ACE2, which might worsen ARDS in MIS-C. Our mini-review highlights that adolescents using e-cigarette have alterations in their pulmonary defenses against SARS-CoV-2: an upregulation of the ACE2 receptors, the primary target of SARS-CoV-2. Their compromised immune system makes them more uniquely vulnerable to Covid-19 related MIS-C, increasing their risk for ARDS and related morbidities. Currently, studies have shown an association between MIS-C and vaping, we speculate that adolescents who vape/smoke might be especially vulnerable to serious respiratory symptoms if they develop a hyper-inflammatory state MIS-C.","output":"Vaping, SARS-CoV-2, and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome: A Perfect Storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The rapid recovery of smell and taste functions in COVID-19 patients could be attributed to a decrease in interleukin-6 levels rather than central nervous system ischemic injury or viral damage to neuronal cells. To correlate interleukin-6 levels in COVID-19 patients with olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions and to investigate the role of IL-6 in the onset of these disorders, this observational study investigated 67 COVID-19 patients with taste or smell disorders or both, who did not require intensive care admission, admitted at COVID Hospital of Policlinico of Bari from March to May 2020. Interleukin-6 was assayed in COVID-19 patients with taste or smell disturbances at the time of admission and at the time of swab negativization. At the same time, patients have been given a specific survey to evaluate the severity of taste and smell disturbances. Of 125 patients with smell or taste dysfunctions at onset of disease, 67 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, while 58 were excluded because 35 of them required intensive care admission, 5 were unable to answer, 5 died, 7 had finished chemotherapy recently, and 5 refused to participate. The evaluation of taste and smell disorders was carried out using a survey performed at the time of admission and at the time of swab negativization. Sinonasal outcome test 22 (SNOT-22) was used as a reference for olfactory function assessment, and Taste and Smell Questionnaire Section of the US NHANES 2011C2014 protocol (CDC 2013b) was used as reference for gustatory function assessment. A venous blood sample was taken for each patient to measure IL-6 levels upon entry and at swab negativization. Interleukin-6 levels in COVID-19 patients in relation to olfactory or gustatory disorders were correlated from the time of their admission to the time of swab negativization. Statistically significant correlations were obtained between the decrease of interleukin-6 levels and the improvement of smell (p value < 0.05) and taste (p = 0.047) functions at swab negativization.

The purpose of this study was to describe the knowledge, protective behaviors, and psychological impact of COVID-19 on Chinese immigrants and determine whether having school-age children was associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Methods: : Using an online survey of 757 Chinese immigrants in Canada from April 2020, data regarding the perceptions of COVID-19, psychological impact, protective behaviors, and sociodemographic characteristics were collected and analyzed. A total of 747 eligible respondents were finally included in the analysis. Most of the participants (65.8%) were female and 77.2% had a university degree or higher. Results: : There were no significant differences in knowledge of COVID-19 in participants with or without children aged 16 years or under. Participants with children aged 16 years or under were more likely to perceive themselves as being at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 than those without ( P =0.023). Participants with children aged 16 years and under were also more likely to feel depressed ( P = 0.007) or stressed ( P = 0.010). In addition, parents with children aged 16 years and under were more likely to adopt protective behaviors, for example, washing and sanitizing hands frequently or disinfecting work and living spaces. Conclusions: : For the most part, Chinese immigrants with children aged 16 years and under were more prone to negative emotions, such as stress, anxiety, and fear. These findings may assist key stakeholders with the identification and implementation of policies and interventions to support the needs of parents with young children, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Knowledge, Psychological Impacts, and Protective Behaviors During the First Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic Among Chinese Immigrants with School-Age Children in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Assistive Technology (AT) supports persons with dementia and their carers (family, friends and neighbours), yet little is known about experiences and the impact of AT on carers. We report on an exploratory survey that examined the types, uses, costs and impact of AT on carers as well as their quality of life. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using the Carers Assistive Technology Experience Questionnaire collected data from carers in the UK, who used at least one AT in the previous year and provided more than 10 h of care for a person with dementia, living at home. Carers completed the questionnaire online or on paper and information on AT, socio-demographic details, and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) data were collected. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to report results and draw conclusions. RESULTS: Data from 201 carers was analysed. Smartphones and tablet computers were the most frequently used AT. AT were used predominantly for safety, communication, and reminders. Carers usually make decisions on buying and continued use of AT. Multiple AT devices were used in the care of persons with dementia and number of AT used was associated with perceived satisfaction. Satisfaction with AT was not related to age, living arrangements and relationship of carers. From the SF-12, Mean Physical Component Score was 49.19 (95%CI- 47.75 to 50.63) and Mental Component Score was 45.37 (95%CI- 43.93 to 46.80). Women, carers in the 46C65 age group and carers who were not extremely satisfied with AT had lower MCS scores. Carers who lived with the person with dementia and older carers had lower PCS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Carers report that AT has a beneficial impact. Carers use multiple ATs, perceive AT to be satisfactory and recommend AT use to others. To support carers, we recommend establishment of centrally funded information sources and a loan store for AT. Further research on incremental addition of AT and changes to formal/paid care because of using AT should be undertaken. Practitioners, academics, manufactures and policy makers should consider the experiences of carers in research, development and use of AT to facilitate improved community living of people with dementia.

PURPOSE: The potentially vast supply of unused opioids in Americans homes has long been a public health concern. We conducted a needs assessment of how Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities address and manage disposal of unused opioid medications to identify opportunities for improvement. METHODS: We used rapid qualitative content analysis methods with team consensus to synthesize findings. Data were collected in 2 waves: (1) semistructured interviews with 19 providers in October 2019 and (2) structured questions to 21 providers in March to April of 2020 addressing how coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) changed disposal priorities. RESULTS: While many diverse strategies have been tried in the VA, we found limited standardization of advice on opioid disposal and practices nationally. Providers offered the following recommendations: target specific patient scenarios for enhanced disposal efforts, emphasize mail-back envelopes, keep recommendations to providers and patients consistent and reinforce existing guidance, explore virtual modalities to monitor disposal activity, prioritize access to viable disposal strategies, and transition from pull to push communication. These themes were identified in the fall of 2019 and remained salient in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: A centralized VA national approach could include proactive communication with patients and providers, interventions tailored to specific settings and populations, and facilitated access to disposal options.

METHODS Male athletes (n = 30), 25 years (SD 4.6), training 17 h(.)wk(-1) (SD 5) completed this randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study. At baseline a blood sample was collected, maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC) with electromyography (EMG) recordings were measured, and participants underwent various performance tests including a Wingate test and 250 kJ time trial (TT) followed by repeated MVC and EMG measurement. Participants were then randomly assigned to receive N-3 (5 ml seal oil, 375 mg EPA, 230 mg DPA, 510 mg DHA) or placebo (5 ml olive oil) for 21-days after which baseline testing was repeated. The magnitude-based inference approach was used to estimate the probability that N-3 had a beneficial effect on neuromuscular-function and performance of at least 1%.

Objective: To examine the association of identified SARS-CoV-2 variants, virus clades, and clade groups with disease severity and patient outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, viral genome analysis of clinical specimens obtained from patients at the Cleveland Clinic infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the initial wave of infection (March 11 to April 22, 2020) was performed. Identified variants were matched with clinical outcomes. Data analysis was performed from April to July 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, and laboratory outcomes were matched with SARS-CoV-2 variants. Results: Specimens sent for viral genome sequencing originated from 302 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (median [interquartile range] age, 52.6 [22.8 to 82.5] years), of whom 126 (41.7%) were male, 195 (64.6%) were White, 91 (30.1%) required hospitalization, 35 (11.6%) needed ICU admission, and 17 (5.6%) died. From these specimens, 2531 variants (484 of which were unique) were identified. Six different SARS-CoV-2 clades initially circulated followed by a rapid reduction in clade diversity. Several variants were associated with lower hospitalization rate, and those containing 23403A>G (D614G Spike) were associated with increased survival when the patient was hospitalized (64 of 74 patients [86.5%] vs 10 of 17 patients [58.8%]; &#967;21 = 6.907; P = .009). Hospitalization and ICU admission were similar regardless of clade. Infection with Clade V variants demonstrated higher creatinine levels (median [interquartile range], 2.6 [-0.4 to 5.5] mg/dL vs 1.0 [0.2 to 2.2] mg/dL; mean creatinine difference, 2.9 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.8 to 5.0 mg/dL]; Kruskal-Wallis P = .005) and higher overall mortality rates (3 of 14 patients [21.4%] vs 17 of 302 patients [5.6%]; &#967;21 = 5.640; P = .02) compared with other variants. Infection by strains lacking the 23403A>G variant showed higher mortality in multivariable analysis (odds ratio [OR], 22.4; 95% CI, 0.6 to 5.6; P = .01). Increased variants of open reading frame (ORF) 3a were associated with decreased hospitalization frequency (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.96; P = .04), whereas increased variants of Spike (OR, 0.01; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.3; P = .01) and ORF8 (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.6; P = .03) were associated with increased survival. Conclusions and Relevance: Within weeks of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, a profound shift toward 23403A>G (D614G) specific genotypes occurred. Replaced clades were associated with worse clinical outcomes, including mortality. These findings help explain persistent hospitalization yet decreasing mortality as the pandemic progresses.

Although metabolomics, alone or combined with other omics data, has already demonstrated its relevance for patient stratification in the frame of research projects and clinical studies, much remains to be done to move this approach to the clinical practice. This is especially true in the perspective of being applied to personalized/precision medicine, which aims at stratifying patients according to their risk of developing diseases, and tailoring medical treatments of patients according to individual characteristics in order to improve their efficacy and limit their toxicity. In this review article, we discuss the main challenges linked to analytical chemistry that need to be addressed to foster the implementation of metabolomics in the clinics and the use of the data produced by this approach in personalized medicine. First of all, there are already well-known issues related to untargeted metabolomics workflows at the levels of data production (lack of standardization), metabolite identification (small proportion of annotated features and identified metabolites), and data processing (from automatic detection of features to multi-omic data integration) that hamper the inter-operability and reusability of metabolomics data. Furthermore, the outputs of metabolomics workflows are complex molecular signatures of few tens of metabolites, often with small abundance variations, and obtained with expensive laboratory equipment. It is thus necessary to simplify these molecular signatures so that they can be produced and used in the field. This last point, which is still poorly addressed by the metabolomics community, may be crucial in a near future with the increased availability of molecular signatures of medical relevance and the increased societal demand for participatory medicine.

At present, no plague vaccines are available for use in the United States. One candidate for the development of a subunit vaccine is the Y. pestis virulence (V) antigen, a protein that mediates the function of the Yersinia outer protein virulence factors and suppresses inflammatory responses in the host. On the basis of the knowledge that adenovirus (Ad) gene-transfer vectors act as adjuvants in eliciting host immunity against the transgene they carry, we tested the hypothesis that a single administration of a replication-defective Ad gene-transfer vector encoding the Y. pestis V antigen (AdsecV) could stimulate strong protective immune responses without a requirement for repeat administration. AdsecV elicited specific T cell responses and high IgG titers in serum within 2 weeks after a single intramuscular immunization. Importantly, the mice were protected from a lethal intranasal challenge of Y. pestis CO92 from 4 weeks up to 6 months after immunization with a single intramuscular dose of AdsecV. These observations suggest that an Ad gene-transfer vector expressing V antigen is a candidate for development of an effective anti-plague vaccine","output":"Protective Immunity against Respiratory Tract Challenge with Yersinia pestis in Mice Immunized with an Adenovirus-Based Vaccine Vector Expressing V Antigen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laboratory-acquired infections (LAIs) are defined as infections of laboratory staff by exposure to pathogenic microorganisms during an experimental procedure. For a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory with a high potential of exposure, reducing risks and threats relevant to LAIs has become a critical concern, especially after the recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus causing COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. This study aimed to investigate the spatial-temporal characteristics of bioaerosol dispersion and deposition of two kinds of bioaerosols (Serratia marcescens and phage X174). A combination of laboratory experiment and numerical simulation was adopted to explore bioaerosol removal. Three-dimensional concentration iso-surface mapping in conjunction with flow field analysis was employed to elucidate bioaerosol migration and deposition behavior. The total deposition number and unit area deposition ratio were calculated for different surfaces. The results indicate that bioaerosol concentration remains stable for up to 400 s after release, and that almost 70% of all bioaerosol particles become deposited on the surfaces of walls and equipment. Vortex flow regions and high-concentration regions were determined, and the most severely contaminated surfaces and locations were identified. Our results could provide the scientific basis for controlling the time interval between different experiments and also provide guidelines for a laboratory disinfection routine. Furthermore, future work regarding laboratory layout optimization and high efficiency air distribution for bioaerosol removal in a BSL-3 laboratory should be emphasized.","output":"Experimental and numerical study of potential infection risks from exposure to bioaerosols in one BSL-3 laboratory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective public health communication should take into the consideration how communicated risk perceptions might influence the public. Although many health behavior theories claim that high perceived risk likelihood motivates preventive health behaviors, this general prediction is complicated by different ways of estimating risk likelihood. Our review of 14 previous studies on perceived risk of infectious diseases revealed different measures of risk likelihood and inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between perceived risk likelihood and behavioral intention. Drawn from the review, we examined the predictive power of different types of risk likelihood on intention to prevent infectious diseases. Using two separate data sets, collected during the 2015 outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (N = 557) and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2021 (N = 1,001), we demonstrated that perceived risk likelihood that specifies future inaction on health behaviors (i.e., conditional absolute risk perception) better predicted behavioral intention than did other types of risk perceptions. When the effect of conditional absolute risk perception was controlled, the behavioral intention and unconditional absolute risk perception showed a negative relationship. The findings have theoretical and practical implications that can inform strategic communication during future outbreaks.","output":"Risk-Likelihood Perceptions and Preventive Behaviors Against Infectious Diseases: Testing Different Types of Risk-Likelihood Perceptions in the Context of MERS and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many proteins in their unbound structures lack surface pockets appropriately sized for drug binding.

Novel methods based on molecular dynamics simulations are particularly promising and yield a large number of transient pockets, but it has been shown that only a minority of such sites are generally capable of binding ligands with substantial affinity.

A mixed-methods, anonymous needs assessment was conducted to understand changes in the lives of adults with mental health and substance use disorders since the pandemic onset. A cross-sectional, online survey was completed by 272 adults in April and May 2020, recruited from statewide networks of community programs in New Jersey and New York. Measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 to screen for depressive and anxiety disorders. Also assessed was the pandemic's impact on sleep and dietary patterns, exposure to COVID-19 infection, and access to health care and medications. Finally, respondents were asked to describe in their own words any changes in their lives since the pandemic began. Over one-third (35.1%) screened positive for generalized anxiety disorder and over one-quarter (29.6%) screened positive for major depressive disorder. The majority reported pandemic-related changes in eating and sleeping patterns and exposure to COVID-19 infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis found that many changes attributed to the pandemic were positively and significantly associated with screening positive for anxiety and depressive disorders. Qualitative analysis confirmed these findings and identified participants' resilience stemming from social support, emotion management, and self-care.

A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether very low birth weight infants (VLBWs) can benefit from OC. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched from Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the date of inception until May 2019. RCTs were eligible if they used OC therapy on VLBW infants. The primary outcomes included ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), late-onset sepsis, and death. The secondary outcomes included the time of full enteral feeding and the length of stay. RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 682 patients (OC group: 332; non-OC group: 350) were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggested that OC was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of VAP [odds ratio (OR) = 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17C0.88, P = 0.02] and full enteral feeding days (mean difference = ?2.66, 95% CI: ?4.51 to ?0.80, P = 0.005), a potential significance of NEC (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.26C0.99, P = 0.05), a trend toward downregulating mortality (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.34C1.08, P = 0.09) and proven sepsis (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.40C1.01, P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: OC could significantly reduce the occurrence of VAP, and consequently, its routine use should be considered for VLBWs to prevent infectious diseases. IMPACT: OC significantly reduces the occurrence of VAP and NEC in VLBW infants. OC may reduce the incidence of VAP and NEC by increasing IgA levels.

Participants were purposefully recruited following completion of a national survey about PHC nurses' experiences during the pandemic. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted by two experienced researchers and professionally transcribed. The mean duration of interviews was 38.5 min. Thematic analysis revealed three themes about the impact of COVID-19 on PHC nurses' provision of care. These were: workplace adjustments, changes in healthcare delivery and concerns about long-term health impacts of COVID-19. The sudden disruption and de-stabilisation of care delivery was reported as significantly impacting on initial service provision, although participants reported adapting quickly and finding new ways to deliver care. The impact of the pandemic on high risk communities and mental health support needs of clients created additional challenges, although some participants reported positive outcomes such as increased confidence of some clients to provide self-care. There were concerns about the potential long-term health impact on communities due to reduced levels of cancer screening, disrupted management of chronic conditions and reduced opportunistic health assessments. Findings from this study demonstrated how PHC nurses played an important role in the continued provision of PHC by adapting quickly to changed circumstances, adjusting and modifying clinical activities, and by monitoring for future potential negative outcomes from the pandemic.

Many genes have been identified to be involved in regulating plant development and adaption of abiotic stress. Apart from protein-coding genes, more and more evidence indicates that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including small RNAs and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), can target plant developmental and stress-responsive mRNAs, regulatory genes, DNA regulatory regions, and proteins to regulate the transcription of various genes at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and epigenetic level. Currently, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of sRNAs and lncRNAs controlling plant development and abiotic response are being deeply explored. In this review, we summarize the recent research progress of small RNAs and lncRNAs in plants, focusing on the signal factors, expression characters, targets functions, and interplay network of ncRNAs and their targets in plant development and abiotic stress responses. The complex molecular regulatory pathways among small RNAs, lncRNAs, and targets in plants are also discussed.

In this study, the relation between tinnitus and gray matter volume (GMV) of the (P)FL-complex, GMV of the other cerebellar lobules and GMV of the cerebellar nuclei is investigated in otherwise healthy participants. Data was processed using the SUIT toolbox, which is dedicated to analysis of imaging data of the human cerebellum.

Moreover, no relation was present between tinnitus severity, as measured by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, and (P)FL-complex GMV, tonsil GMV, or total cerebellar cortical GMV. These results suggest that in otherwise healthy participants, in contrast to participants after CPA tumor removal, no relation between the GMV of neither the (P)FL-complex nor other cerebellar lobules and tinnitus presence and severity exists. These findings indicate that a relation only exists when the (P)FL-complex is damaged, for instance by a CPA tumor.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Yes, using a combination of three different models we can predict the impact of delaying access to treatment by 6 and 12 months on the probability of conception leading to live birth in women of different age groups with different categories of infertility WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Increased age and duration of infertility can prejudice the chances of success following IVF, but couples with unexplained infertility have a chance of conceiving naturally without treatment whilst waiting for IVF The worldwide suspension of IVF could lead to worse outcomes in couples awaiting treatment, but it is unclear to what extent this could affect individual couples based on age and cause of infertility STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A population-based cohort study based on national data from all licensed clinics in the UK obtained from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority Register Linked data from 9589 women who underwent their first IVF or ICSI treatment in 2017 and consented to the use of their data for research were used to predict livebirth PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Three prediction models were used to estimate the chances of livebirth associated with immediate treatment versus a delay of 6 and 12 months in couples about to embark on IVF or ICSI MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We estimated that a 6-month delay would reduce IVF livebirths by 0 4%, 2 4%, 5 6%, 9 5% and 11 8% in women aged &lt;30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively, while corresponding values associated with a delay of 12 months were 0 9%, 4 9%, 11 9%, 18 8% and 22 4%, respectively In women with known causes of infertility, worst case (best case) predicted chances of livebirth after a delay of 6 months followed by one complete IVF cycle in women aged &lt;30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years varied between 31 6% (35 0%), 29 0% (31 6%), 23 1% (25 2%), 17 2% (19 4%) and 10 3% (12 3%) for tubal infertility and 34 3% (39 2%), 31 6% (35 3%) 25 2% (28 5%) 18 3% (21 3%) and 11 3% (14 1%) for male factor infertility The corresponding values in those treated immediately were 31 7%, 29 8%, 24 5%, 19 0% and 11 7% for tubal factor and 34 4%, 32 4%, 26 7%, 20 2% and 12 8% in male factor infertility In women with unexplained infertility the predicted chances of livebirth after a delay of 6 months followed by one complete IVF cycle were 41 0%, 36 6%, 29 4%, 22 4% and 15 1% in women aged &lt;30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively, compared to 34 9%, 32 5%, 26 9%, 20 7% and 13 2% in similar groups of women treated without any delay The additional waiting period, which provided more time for spontaneous conception, was predicted to increase the relative number of babies born by 17 5%, 12 6%, 9 1%, 8 4% and 13 8%, in women aged &lt;30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively A 12-month delay showed a similar pattern in all subgroups LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Major sources of uncertainty include the use of prediction models generated in different populations and the need for a number of assumptions Although the models are validated and the bases for the assumptions are robust, it is impossible to eliminate the possibility of imprecision in our predictions Therefore, our predicted live birth rates need to be validated in prospective studies to confirm their accuracy WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A delay in starting IVF reduces success rates in all couples For the first time, we have shown that while this results in fewer babies in older women and those with a known cause of infertility, it has a less detrimental effect on couples with unexplained infertility, some of whom conceive naturally whilst waiting for treatment Post-COVID 19, clinics planning a

Natural scenarios include common, emerging/re-emerging and chronic infectious diseases: they are caused by biological agents, which can be normally present in the communities, as acute or chronic pathologies, or suddenly appear, causing new or uncommon syndromes. In particular, a lot of environmental and human factors can influence emerging and re-emerging diseases: for example, urbanization and people mobility facilitate microorganisms spread, while climate changes are likely to induce a relocation of pathogens vectors. Unintended events are usually due to research and diagnostic activities: laboratories are the places where biological agents are handled and a lack in Biosafety measures or negligence can result in accidental release; the so called Laboratory Acquired Infections represent the main consequence, since they cause pathologies in the laboratory workers, but could be also transmitted in the population. Deliberate use of biological agents is strictly related to terroristic activities: microorganisms are very suitable for this purpose, since they are hidden and can easily spread.

The vast majority of these studies reported on interventions that were delivered at the individual level. The context in which these interventions were delivered varied, primarily ranging from the home setting to residential settings, as well as day or activity centres and schools. The studies described various types of interventions: telehealth interventions, computerized cognitive behavioural therapy, and interventions focused on (social) learning principles targeting challenging behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth provides new opportunities for both therapists and lay-therapists to deliver psychological interventions. Future studies should focus on the effectiveness of psychological eHealth interventions.","output":"Psychological eHealth interventions for people with intellectual disabilities: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious enteropathogenic coronavirus causing severe watery diarrhea and high mortality in piglets. In order to investigate the role of the transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) in regulation of gene expression and replication of PEDV, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene, under control of different TRSs of PEDV, were inserted between the N gene and 3' UTR of the PEDV genome using a reverse genetic system. The EGFP expression from different chimeric PEDVs was analyzed for each TRS. TRSs of all the structural and accessory protein genes of PEDV positively regulate EGFP expression at different levels, and the TRS of M protein gene produced the highest level of EGFP. Moreover, this is the first study to show that exogenous gene could be inserted between N gene and 3' UTR of PEDV, and the EGFP insertion had no effect on PEDV replication.

The dissemination of inaccurate information and the need for social isolation to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have shown a negative impact on the population, causing damage to mental health, with the appearance or worsening of symptoms of stress, fear, anxiety, and depression. Thus, the systematic review study is intended to gather evidence on the impact of information about COVID-19 on the mental health of the population. METHODS: This systematic review protocol is conducted using the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The review aims to include published studies that address the exposure of the general population to information about COVID-19, through observational and experimental studies, which consider the following outcomes: fear, stress, anxiety, and depression. Thus, a comprehensive research strategy will be conducted in the following databases: PubMed / Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Science Direct, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Two independent reviewers will perform all procedures, such as study selection, data collection, and methodological evaluation. Disagreements will be forwarded to a third reviewer. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for data analysis. RESULTS: This systematic review will provide evidence of the influence of access to and consumption of media and scientific information about COVID-19 on the mental health of the population. It will consider information about the characterization of the study and the population studied, clinical and epidemiological information on mental health, and data on access to and consumption of media and scientific information. DISCUSSION: The results should inform about the consequences of communication about the new coronavirus on the emergence or worsening of psychological and psychiatric symptoms, allowing to develop strategies to achieve effective communication of information to promote the mental health of the population.

During sepsis, immune cells are activated by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) through pattern recognizing receptors (PRRs). Regulation of the immune response is essential to preventing or managing sepsis. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin-G (Siglec-G), a CD33 group of Siglec expressed in B-1a cells and other hematopoietic cells, plays an important immunoregulatory role. B-1a cells, a subtype of B lymphocytes, spontaneously produce natural IgM which confers protection against infection. B-1a cells also produce IL-10, GM-CSF, and IL-35 to control inflammation. Sialic acids are present on cell membranes, receptors, and glycoproteins. Siglec-G binds to the sialic acid residues on the B cell receptor (BCR) and controls BCR-mediated signal transduction, thereby maintaining homeostasis of Ca(++) influx and NFATc1 expression. Siglec-G inhibits NF-B activation in B-1a cells and regulates B-1a cell proliferation. In myeloid cells, Siglec-G inhibits DAMP-mediated inflammation by forming a ternary complex with DAMP and CD24. Thus, preserving Siglec-Gs function could be a novel therapeutic approach in sepsis. Here, we review the immunoregulatory functions of Siglec-G in B-1a cells and myeloid cells in sepsis. A clear understanding of Siglec-G is important to developing novel therapeutics in treating sepsis.","output":"The Role of Siglec-G on Immune Cells in Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"John Tingle, Lecturer in Law, Birmingham Law School, University of Birmingham discusses the recently published Cumberlege report on medicines and medical devices safety.","output":"Patient safety reports analysis: post COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Our goal was to evaluate if traffic-light driven personalized care for COVID-19 was associated with improved survival in acute hospital settings. METHODS: Discharge outcomes were evaluated before and after prospective implementation of a real-time dashboard with feedback to ward-based clinicians. Thromboembolism categories were \\"medium-risk\\" (D-dimer >1000ng/mL or CRP >200mg/L); \\"high-risk\\" (D-dimer >3000ng/mL or CRP >250mg/L) or \\"suspected\\" (D-dimer >5000ng/mL). Cytokine storm risk was categorized by ferritin. RESULTS: 939/1039 COVID-19 positive patients (median age 67 years, 563/939 (60%) male) completed hospital encounters to death or discharge by 21st May 2020. Thromboembolism flag criteria were reached by 568/939 (60.5%), including 238/275 (86.6%) of the patients who died, and 330/664 (49.7%) of the patients who survived to discharge, p<0.0001. Cytokine storm flag criteria were reached by 212 (22.6%) of admissions, including 80/275 (29.1%) of the patients who died, and 132/664 (19.9%) of the patients who survived, p<0.0001. The maximum thromboembolism flag discriminated completed encounter mortality (no flag: 37/371 [9.97%] died; medium-risk: 68/239 [28.5%]; high-risk: 105/205 [51.2%]; and suspected thromboembolism: 65/124 [52.4%], p<0.0001). Flag criteria were reached by 535 consecutive COVID-19 positive patients whose hospital encounter completed before traffic-light introduction: 173/535 (32.3% [95% confidence intervals 28.0, 36.0]) died. For the 200 consecutive admissions after implementation of real-time traffic light flags, 46/200 (23.0% [95% confidence intervals 17.1, 28.9]) died, p=0.013. Adjusted for age and sex, the probability of death was 0.33 (95% confidence intervals 0.30, 0.37) before traffic light implementation, 0.22 (0.17, 0.27) after implementation, p<0.001. In subgroup analyses, older patients, males, and patients with hypertension (p&#8804;0.01), and/or diabetes (p=0.05) derived the greatest benefit from admission under the traffic light system. CONCLUSION: Personalized early interventions were associated with a 33% reduction in early mortality. We suggest benefit predominantly resulted from early triggers to review/enhance anticoagulation management, without exposing lower-risk patients to potential risks of full anticoagulation therapy.","output":"Increase in COVID-19 inpatient survival following detection of Thromboembolic and Cytokine storm risk from the point of admission to hospital by a near real time Traffic-light System (TraCe-Tic)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) caused by infection with human SARS-CoV-2 is a global threat to the human population.

We slept more than usual, but the quality was worse. As the pandemic continues, a second period of restrictive measures was initiated, and no data exist about their impact on sleep. The aim of this study was to compare quantity and quality of sleep between the two periods of restrictive measures, due to the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic in Greece. MATERIALS AND METHODS A web-based survey using a short 13-item questionnaire was created and was distributed online. This included information about demographic and professional data, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of sleep, degree of abidance in lockdown measures, and data about COVID-19 infection or close contact with active confirmed cases. RESULTS A total of 1,078 questionnaires were evaluated (first period, n=963; second period, n=115). Sleep duration was shorter during the second lockdown (mean difference -0.51h; 95% confidence interval, (CI), -0.82, -0.19, p=0.002). Compared to usual habits, sleep increased in first wave (mean difference +0.37h; 95% CI, 0.26, 0.47; p<0.001) and decreased in second wave (mean difference -0.35h; 95% CI, -0.60, -0.09; p=0.009). Regarding quality of sleep, less participants reported good quality of sleep during the second wave compared to the first (p=0.006). Finally, compliance to restriction measures was lower and the prevalence of confirmed illness or close contact with COVID-19 cases among participants was higher during the second period than during the first one (p<0.001 and p=0.028, respectively).

Methods We searched the CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for articles published between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2017. We screened studies for eligibility and systematically abstracted and compared study designs and outcomes. Results A total of 43 articles met the inclusion criteria, out of 2,106 articles found in our search. These 43 articles were organized by the primary sub-population(s) whose preferences were reported: 27 report on preferences among racial/ethnic minorities, eight among low-income groups, six among veterans, and two among rural populations. The majority of studies (n=34) focused on preferences related to test modality. No single test modality was overwhelmingly supported by all sub-populations, although veterans seemed to prefer colonoscopy. Test attributes such as accuracy, sensitivity, cost, and convenience were also noted as important features. Furthermore, a preference for shared decision-making between vulnerable patients and providers was found. Conclusion The heterogeneity in study design, populations, and outcomes of the selected studies revealed a wide spectrum of CRC screening preferences within vulnerable populations. More decision aids and discrete choice experiments that focus on vulnerable populations are needed to gain a more nuanced understanding of how vulnerable populations weigh particular features of screening methods.

Patients with SARS were divided into two groups: survivor group (n=13) and non-survivor group (n=12). We compared the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHEII) score, respiratory rate (RR),saturation of oxygen (SpO(2)) and modificative respiratory index (MRI) for the survivors and non-survivors before NIPPV and after NIPPV for twenty-four hours, respectively. RESULTS Although NIPPV administered via full-face masks might be an effective treatment for rapidly improving vital signs and gas exchange and sense of dyspnea in both groups during the initial 24 hours of ventilatory support, the patients in non-survivor group had higher APACHEII score, respiratory rates and lower SpO(2), MRI than the patients in survivor group (P<0.05) at the same intervals after initiation of support. CONCLUSION Noninvasive ventilation should be used as a substitutive tool for endotracheal intubation an alternative treatment for acute respiratory failure related to SARS. Therefore, we should make efforts to avoid missing the time point for NIPPV or intubation, and we should not be restricted to the available indications for NIPPV or IPPV.","output":"[Evaluation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in treatment for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Wuhan, China was the epicenter of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak As a designated hospital, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital has received over 700 COVID-19 p","output":"Prediction of the Clinical Outcome of COVID-19 Patients Using T Lymphocyte Subsets with 340 Cases from Wuhan, China: A Retrospective Cohort Study and a WeVisualization Tool"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neurological and psychological symptoms are increasingly realized in the post-acute phase of COVID-19. PURPOSE: To examine and characterize cognitive and related psychosocial symptoms in adults (21-75 years) who tested positive for or were treated as positive for COVID-19. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data collection included a cognitive testing battery (Trails B; Digit Symbol; Stroop; Immediate and Delayed Verbal Learning) and surveys (demographic/clinical history; self-reported cognitive functioning depressive symptoms, fatigue, anxiety, sleep disturbance, social role performance, and stress). Results were compared with published norms, rates of deficits (more than 1 standard deviation (SD) from the norm) were described, and correlations were explored. RESULTS: We enrolled 52 participants (mean age 37.33 years; 78.85% female) who were, on average, 4 months post illness. The majority had a history of mild or moderate COVID-19 severity. Forty percent of participants demonstrated scores that were 1 SD or more below the population norm on one or more of the cognitive tests. A subset had greater anxiety (21.15%), depressive symptoms (23.07%), and sleep disturbance (19.23%) than population norms. Age differences were identified in Stroop, Digit Symbol, and Trails B scores by quartile (p < .01), with worse performance in those 28-33 years old. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive dysfunction and psychological symptoms may be present in the weeks or months after COVID-19 diagnosis, even in those with mild to moderate illness severity.

The infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with the systemic inflammation associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to the impairment of the blood-brain barrier and triggers a neuroinflammatory response with reactive astrogliosis, and microglial activation. In addition, brain stem cells are damaged, which results in respiratory distress. Apart from typical symptoms of COVID-19 related to the involvement of the respiratory system, neurological manifestations such as headache, dizziness, myalgia, anosmia, ageusia, encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and the Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS A systematic review was conducted of the most relevant English language articles on COVID-19 and surgery published between 15 December 2019 and 30 March 2020. FINDINGS Access to the operating theatre is almost exclusively restricted to emergencies and oncological procedures. The use of laparoscopy in COVID-19 positive patients should be cautiously considered. The main risk lies in the presence of the virus in the pneumoperitoneum: the aerosol released in the operating theatre could contaminate both staff and the environment. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, all efforts should be deployed in order to evaluate the feasibility of postponing surgery until the patient is no longer considered potentially infectious or at risk of perioperative complications. If surgery is deemed necessary, the emergency surgeon must minimise the risk of exposure to the virus by involving a minimal number of healthcare staff and shortening the occupation of the operating theatre. In case of a lack of security measures to enable safe laparoscopy, open surgery should be considered.","output":"Emergency surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: what you need to know for practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the world economy has come to a grinding halt The economic fallout would be enormous in terms of loss in production, income, and employment The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major ruptures in the world system, which has serious implications for global accumulation of capital It, therefore, presents an opportunity to reimagine the global division of labour and the international economic architecture ? 2020 Economic and Political Weekly All rights reserved","output":"World Economy and Nation States post COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 has become a global pandemic infectious respiratory disease with high mortality and infectiousness.

The experimental results indicate that the convection velocity of cough airflow presents the relationship t(?0.7) with time; hence, the distance from the cougher increases by t(0.3) in the range of our measurement domain. Substituting these experimental results into the physical model reveals that small droplets (initial diameter D  100 m) evaporate to droplet nuclei and that large droplets with D  500 m and an initial velocity u(0)  5 m/s travel more than 2 m.

As a vaccination effort, the study provided an empirical evidence on willingness to vaccinate by sociodemographic, clinical and regional differences in Bangladeshi adults. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis from a household survey of 3646 adults aged 18 years or older was conducted in 8 districts of Bangladesh, from December 12, 2020, to January 7, 2021. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic, clinical and healthcare-releated factors on hesitancy and reluctance of vaccination for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 3646 respondents (2212 men [60.7%]; mean [sd] age, 37.4 [13.9] years), 74.6% reported their willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 when a safe and effective vaccine is available without a fee, while 8.5% were reluctant to vaccinate. With a minimum fee, 46.5% of the respondents showed intent to vaccinate. Among the respondents, 16.8% reported adequate adherence to health safety regulations, and 35.5% reported high confidence in the country's healthcare system. The COVID-19 vaccine refusal was significantly high in elderly, rural, semi-urban, and slum communities, farmers, day-laborers, homemakers, low-educated group, and those who had low confidence in the country's healthcare system. Also, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was high in the elderly population, low-educated group, day-laborers, people with chronic diseases, and people with low confidence in the country's healthcare system. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of vaccine refusal and hesitancy was observed in rural people and slum dwellers in Bangladesh. The rural community and slum dwellers had a low literacy level, low adherence to health safety regulations and low confidence in healthcare system. The ongoing app-based registration for vaccination increased hesitancy and reluctancy in low-educated group. For rural, semi-urban, and slum people, outreach centers for vaccination can be established to ensure the vaccine's nearby availability and limit associated travel costs. In rural areas, community health workers, valued community-leaders, and non-governmental organizations can be utilized to motivate and educate people for vaccination against COVID-19. Further, emphasis should be given to the elderly and diseased people with tailored health messages and assurance from healthcare professionals. The media may play a responsible role with the vaccine education program and eliminate the social stigma about the vaccination. Finally, vaccination should be continued without a fee and thus Bangladesh's COVID vaccination program can become a model for other low and middle-income countries.","output":"Willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 among Bangladeshi adults: Understanding the strategies to optimize vaccination coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, a novel coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan, China, causing a potentially lethal respiratory viral infection.

Using quantitative approach, the data is collected through a survey to 745 employees, in June 2020. The results show that all employees have used instant messaging and online meeting applications to communicate during flexible working. Moreover, majority of the employees also have used office e-mail and document sharing tool to correspondence and collaborate remotely. Even though most employees consider that communication and coordination through information and communication technology is easy and clear, it has not been able to replace fully face-to-face meetings. Some recommendations are given to result in more effective computer-mediated communication and collaboration among government employees to support flexible working arrangements.","output":"An Empirical Study: Computer-Mediated Communication and Collaboration among Government Employees during Flexible Working Arrangements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used in patients with respiratory infection, but their safety in coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) patients has not been fully investigated.

Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the weight reduction effects and dose-response relationship of SGLT inhibitors and to assess the relative efficacy of SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitors. METHODS Four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus) were searched on November 21, 2020, for articles published from January 1, 2000, up to November 21, 2020. RESULTS In total, 116 randomized-controlled trials were included, with a combined cohort of 98,497 patients. Overall, patients had a mean weight reduction of -1.79 kg (95% CI: -1.93 to -1.66, p < 0.001) compared with placebo. This effect was observed across diabetes status, duration of follow-up, various comorbidities, and all SGLT drug types.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2018 and May 2019. Sputum was collected from 636 study participants. Part of the sputum was inoculated onto Brain Heart Infusion agar, and fungi were identified following standard microbiological procedures. The remaining part of the sample was used for the investigation of pulmonary tuberculosis. RESULTS: Among 636 sputum samples, 75.9% (483) and 25.6% (163) were positive for potential fungal pathogens and pulmonary tuberculosis, respectively. The prevalence of the association between pulmonary tuberculosis and potential fungal pathogens was 20.0%. Of fungal isolates, 81.4% were yeasts. The remaining 128 (18.6%) isolates were molds. The isolation rate of fungi was higher in males (51.6%) than in females (48.4%). There was no statistically significant association between the prevalence of potential pulmonary fungal pathogens and sex (p = 0.239). Patients in the age group of 35 to 44 and above were slightly more affected than younger age groups. The association between potential fungal pathogens and age was not statistically significant (p = 0.50). CONCLUSION: High prevalence of potential pulmonary fungal pathogens and the association of tuberculosis and potential fungal pathogens recorded in this study will enforce health personnel to pay due attention to these conditions and arise the interest of researchers to conduct further work on the burden of the association between tuberculosis and potential fungal pathogens.

It is suggested that excessive immune response in patients with COVID-19 could mimic this syndrome. Some COVID-19 autopsy studies have revealed the presence of haemophagocytosis images in bone marrow, raising the possibility, along with HScore parameters, of sHLH. AIM: Our objective is to ascertain the existence of sHLH in some patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We report the autopsy histological findings of 16 patients with COVID-19, focusing on the presence of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow, obtained from rib squeeze and integrating these findings with HScore parameters. CD68 immunohistochemical stains were used to highlight histiocytes and haemophagocytic cells. Clinical evolution and laboratory parameters of patients were collected from electronic clinical records. RESULTS: Eleven patients (68.7%) displayed moderate histiocytic hyperplasia with haemophagocytosis (HHH) in bone marrow, three patients (18.7%) displayed severe HHH and the remainder were mild. All HScore parameters were collected in 10 patients (62.5%). Among the patients in which all parameters were evaluable, eight patients (80%) had an HScore >169. sHLH was not clinically suspected in any case. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the recommendation of some authors to use the HScore in patients with severe COVID-19 in order to identify those who could benefit from immunosuppressive therapies. The presence of haemophagocytosis in bone marrow tissue, despite not being a specific finding, has proved to be a very useful tool in our study to identify these patients.","output":"Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in COVID-19: correlation of the autopsy findings of bone marrow haemophagocytosis with HScore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED The pharmacokinetics of the tricarbonyl core radiopharmaceutical (99m)Tc(CO)3-nitrilotriacetic acid ((99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA)) in rats and subjects with normal renal function are comparable to those of (131)I-o-iodohippuran ((131)I-OIH), the radiopharmaceutical gold standard for the measurement of effective renal plasma flow. Our objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of these 2 tracers in subjects with renal failure. METHODS (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) was prepared with commercially available NTA and a commercially available labeling kit and isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Approximately 74 MBq (2.0 mCi) of (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) were coinjected with approximately 11.1 MBq (300 Ci) of (131)I-OIH in 8 subjects with stage 3-4 renal failure; simultaneous images were obtained for 24 min, followed by an anterior image over the gallbladder and abdomen. Plasma clearances were determined from 10 blood samples obtained 3-180 min after injection using the single-injection, 2-compartment model. Plasma protein binding, red cell uptake, and percentage injected dose in the urine at 30 and 180 min were determined. RESULTS There was no difference in the plasma clearances of (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) and (131)I-OIH (177  63 vs. 171  66 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively) (P = 0.41).

Surveillance of resistance is crucial for efficient patient care. This study was aimed to conduct a surveillance in four major Hail Hospitals from September to December 2020. Using a multipoint program, records of 621 non-duplicate Gram-negative cultures were tested across 21 drugs belonging to different categories. Major species were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187, 30%), E. coli (n = 151, 24.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, (n = 84, 13.6%), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 82, 13.3%), and Proteus mirabilis (n = 46, 7%). Based on recent resistance classifications, A. baumanni, P. aeruginosa, and enteric bacteria were defined as pan-resistant, extremely resistant, and multi-drug resistant, respectively. A. baumannii (35%) and K. pneumoniae (23%) dominated among coinfections in SARS-CoV2 patients. The other Gram-negative bacteria (n = 77, 12.5%) from diverse sources showed unique species-specific resistance patterns, while sharing a common Gram-negative resistance profile. Among these, Providencia stuartii was reported for the first time in Hail. In addition, specimen source, age, and gender differences played significant roles in susceptibility. Overall infection rates were 30% in ICU, 17.5% in medical wards, and 13.5% in COVID-19 zones, mostly in male (59%) senior (54%) patients. In ICU, infections were caused by P. mirabilis (52%), A. baumannii (49%), P. aeruginosa (41%), K. pneumoniae (24%), and E. coli (21%), and most of the respiratory infections were caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae and UTI by K. pneumoniae and E. coli. While impressive IC, hospital performances, and alternative treatment options still exist, the spread of resistant Gram-negative bacteria is concerning especially in geriatric patients. The high selective SARS-CoV2 coinfection by A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, unlike the low global rates, warrants further vertical studies.

Of the approximately 10 million animal species predicted to exist on Earth, >99.9% do not have any submitted genome assembly. To enable scRNA-seq for the vast majority of animals on the planet, here we introduce the concept of k-mer homology, combining biochemical synonyms in degenerate protein alphabets with uniform data subsampling via MinHash into a pipeline called Kmermaid. Implementing this pipeline enables direct detection of similar cell types across species from transcriptomic data without the need for a reference genome. Underpinning Kmermaid is the tool Orpheum, a memory-efficient method for extracting high-confidence protein-coding sequences from RNA-seq data. After validating Kmermaid using datasets from human and mouse lung, we applied Kmermaid to the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), where we propagated cellular compartment labels at high fidelity. Our pipeline provides a high-throughput tool that enables analyses of transcriptomic data across divergent species transcriptomes in a genome- and gene annotation-agnostic manner. Thus, the combination of Kmermaid and Orpheum identifies cell type-specific sequences that may be missing from genome annotations and empowers molecular cellular phenotyping for novel model organisms and species.","output":"Single-cell transcriptomics for the 99.9% of species without reference genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate strategies for broad mass isolation during outbreaks of infectious diseases.

Health care workers, as those on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic, are more susceptible to infection. Inadequate related knowledge and preventive behaviors among health care workers might lead to delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection. Therefore, this study evaluated the knowledge of health care workers with regard to COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 10-18, 2020. Participants were general practitioners, specialists, and nurses working at the forefront of the pandemic. Their knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perceptions concerning COVID-19 were evaluated using an online questionnaire created by our medical specialists. The questionnaire consisted of 29, 5, and 4 items about COVID-19 knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perceptions, respectively. A total of 251 health care workers completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 33.888.72 years old, and the sample consisted of 68 males (27.08%) and 183 females (72.91%). While there was no difference between the percentage of correct answers given by female and male participants to knowledge-based questions (p>0.05), the percentage of correct answers to the questions on preventive behaviors was significantly higher in female participants than in males (p<0.001). The overall average percentages of correct responses were 91.66% for knowledge-based questions and 85.96% for preventive behavior questions. The scores for knowledge-based questions were higher for medical specialists, whereas nurses scored higher on preventive behavior questions. Government hospital staff showed a significant difference in preventive behaviors compared to that of university hospitals (p<0.05). In addition, there was a positive correlation between knowledge scores and preventive behaviors.

This and the challenging environment onboard (boat movements, limited space) might influence Basic Life Support (BLS) performance. The primary objective of this study was to assess the impact of the protective gear on single-rescuer BLS-quality. Material and Methods: Sixty-five active KNRM crewmembers who had recently undergone a BLS-refresher course were randomized to wear either their protective gear (n = 32) or their civilian clothes (n = 33; control group) and performed five 2-min sessions of single rescuer BLS on a mannequin on dry land. BLS-quality was assessed according to Dutch and European Resuscitation guidelines. A between group analysis (Mann-Whitney U) and a repeated within group analysis of both groups (Friedman test) were performed. Results: There were no major demographic differences between the groups. The protective gear did not significant impair BLS-quality. It was also not associated with a significant increase in the perceived exertion of BLS (Borg's Rating scale). Compression depth, compression frequency, the percentage of correct compression depth and of not leaning on the thorax, and ventilation volumes in both groups were suboptimal when evaluated according to the BLS-guidelines. Conclusions: The protective gear worn by KNRM lifeboat-crewmembers does not have a significant influence on BLS-quality under controlled study conditions. The impact and significance on outcome in real life situations needs to be studied further.

The survey comprised 32 questions and four sections: Survey 1 (April 20, 2020), Survey 2 (May 27, 2020), Survey 3 (August 31, 2020), and Survey 4 (December 4, 2020). RESULTS: The mean survey response rate was 24.9%, and 502 facilities (59.2%) participated in at least one survey. The proportion of facilities that could perform PCR tests for diagnosis and more than 20 tests per day gradually increased. The percentage capable of managing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or more than five ventilators did not increase over time. The proportion that reported work overload of 150% or more, stress associated with lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), and harassment or stigma in the surrounding community did not sufficiently improve. CONCLUSION: While there was an improvement in expanding the examination system and medical cooperation in the community, there was no indication of enhancement of the critical care management system.

Considering this, the present study was planned to assess Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) breaches and exposures among HCWs working in COVID-19 wards/ screening areas and to evaluate their COVID-19 positivity rates post-exposure concerning the level of exposure, type of PPE breach, and the cadre of HCWs exposed in COVID-19 wards. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study involved the analysis of all instances of PPE breaches which occurred during a period of nine months from June 2020 to February 2021 at a tertiary care level hospital in Central India. The analysis included all exposures involving any cadre of HCWs that occurred while handling the patients or while doffing the contaminated PPE in COVID -19 wards. RESULTS: A total of 347 PPE breaches were analyzed from the available records of the Hospital Infection Control team repository. Amongst the 347 breaches, 268 (77.2%) were classified as low-risk exposures and 79 (22.8%) as high-risk exposures. Cadre wise distribution of high and low-risk exposures revealed that, PPE breaches occurred most commonly in the category of nursing officers (n = 174, 50.1%). Among all of the breaches, 15.2% of high-risk exposures and 2.6% of low-risk exposures resulted in COVID-19 positivity with a cumulative positivity of 5.4%. Collectively, non-mask related breaches accounted for the majority (63.2%) of the positive COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: Appropriate use of PPE by HCWs is vital for their protection. However, breaches in the use of PPE may occur while managing COVID-19 patients due to physical and mental exhaustion among HCWs resulting from work overload. Early identification and appropriate management of HCWs with high-risk exposures can help prevent transmission to other hospital staff and patients, thus preserving resources and workforce.","output":"A retrospective observational insight into COVID-19 exposures resulting from personal protective equipment (PPE) breaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal pulmonary infection caused by a coronavirus (CoV), MERS-CoV.

This paper aims to synthesize the available evidence on the efficacy of APP.Methods: We performed a systematic review of proportional outcomes from observational studies to compare intubation rate in patients treated with APP or with standard care.Results: A total of 46 published and 4 unpublished observational studies that included 2994 patients were included, of which 921 patients were managed with APP, and 870 patients were managed with usual care. APP was associated with significant improvement of oxygenation parameters in 381 cases of 19 studies that reported this outcome. Among the 41 studies assessing intubation rates (870 patients treated with APP, and 852 patients treated with usual care), the intubation rate was 27%(95%CI, 19 to 37%), as compared to 30%(95%CI, 20 to 42%)(p=0.71), even when duration of application, use of adjunctive respiratory assist device (high flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation) and severity of oxygenation deficit were taken into account. There appeared to be a trend toward improved mortality when treated with APP was compared with usual care (11% v.s. 22%), which was not statistically significant.Conclusions: APP was associated with improvement of oxygenation but did not reduce the intubation rate in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. This finding is limited by the high heterogeneity and the observational nature of included studies. Randomized controlled clinical studies are needed to definitively assess whether APP could improve key outcome such as intubation and mortality rate in these patients.","output":"Awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19: A systematic review of proportional outcomes comparing observational studies with and without awake prone positioning in the setting of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes the extent to which remote interaction healthcare interventions supported by digital technology are currently being used, or have recently been newly developed for use, in the care of older people in Australia within the context of the existing Australian aged care system and in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS When performing SPLS, 3 instruments are passed into a narrow space, only 2 patterns of shaft formation can be obtained: a formation in which the 3 instruments rotate clockwise or counterclockwise (rotation formation) or a formation in which 1 instrument passes between the other 2 (cross formation). So motion spaces of the instruments in rotation formation compared with that in cross formation were tested using engineering methods. The range of the forceps' motion was assumed to be the space covered by the forceps till collision occurred between the moving forceps and either the other fixed forceps or the fixed scope. Examination of the range of movement of the scope was conducted in the same manner. The motion space with the area on the x-y horizontal is evaluated, as viewed from the peritoneal umbilicus port entry area.

Although the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto did not reach such a level, it created a unique opportunity to identify the optimal use of the Internet to promote communication with the public and to preserve health services during an epidemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore patients attitudes regarding the health services that might be provided through the Internet to supplement those traditionally available in the event of a future mass emergency situation. METHODS: We conducted mask-to-mask surveys of patients at three major teaching hospitals in Toronto during the second outbreak of SARS. Patients were surveyed at the hospital entrances and selected clinics. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used for the analysis. RESULTS: In total, 1019 of 1130 patients responded to the survey (90% overall response rate). With respect to Internet use, 70% (711/1019) used the Internet by themselves and 57% (578/1019) with the help of a friend or family member. Of the Internet users, 68% (485/711) had already searched the World Wide Web for health information, and 75% (533/711) were interested in communicating with health professionals using the Internet as part of their ongoing care. Internet users expressed interest in using the Web for the following reasons: to learn about their health condition through patient education materials (84%), to obtain information about the status of their clinic appointments (83%), to send feedback to the hospital about how to improve its services (77%), to access screening tools to help determine if they were potentially affected by the infectious agent responsible for the outbreak (77%), to renew prescriptions (75%), to consult with their health professional about nonurgent matters (75%), and to access laboratory test results (75%). Regression results showed that younger age, higher education, and English as a first language were predictors of patients interest in using Internet services in the event of an epidemic. CONCLUSION: Most patients are willing and able to use the Internet as a means to maintain communication with the hospital during an outbreak of an infectious disease such as SARS. Hospitals should explore new ways to interact with the public, to provide relevant health information, and to ensure continuity of care when they are forced to restrict their services.","output":"What Internet Services Would Patients Like From Hospitals During an Epidemic?

We hypothesised that postponements due to the pandemic were associated with higher levels of psychological distress than prepandemic postponements. METHODS: A prospective, observational cohort study was conducted among patients in whom elective cardiac surgery was postponed. Patients who received information regarding a new date of surgery prior to the pandemic were compared with patients postponed during the pandemic without information regarding a new date of surgery. Data were collected from patient records, validated questionnaires and interviews. RESULTS: Out of 55 postponed patients, 21 experienced prepandemic postponement. No significant differences were observed between groups regarding the psychological measures before their rescheduled operation. However, patients in both groups reported high levels of anxiety and depression with > 60% indicative of potentially positive diagnoses. No differences were found in mortality across groups and no patients developed severe complications. Interviews showed that patients in the COVID-19 group felt immediate relief at postponement and engaged in a meaning-making process with respect to their ability to tolerate postponement in order to reassure themselves and their relatives. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were found in psychological distress between the patients of the two groups. However, both groups experienced high levels of psychological distress.

The aims were to identify potential \\"druggable\\" binding pockets in the protein and, if located, to virtual screen pharmaceutical agents currently in use for predicted affinity to these pockets which might be useful to restrict, reduce, or inhibit the infectivity of the virion. RESULTS: Our analyses of this structure have revealed a key potentially druggable pocket where it might be viable to bind pharmaceutical agents to inhibit its ability to infect human cells. This pocket is found at the inter-chain interface that exists between two domains prior to the virion binding to human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. One of these domains is the highly mobile receptor binding domain, which must move into position to interact with ACE2, which is an essential feature for viral entry to the host cell. Virtual screening with a library of purchasable drug molecules has identified pharmaceuticals currently in use as prescription and over the counter medications that, in silico, readily bind into this pocket. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights possible drugs already in use as pharmaceuticals that may act as agents to interfere with the movements of the domains within this protein essential for the infectivity processes and hence might slow, or even halt, the infection of host cells by this new coronavirus. As these are existing pharmaceuticals already approved for use in humans, this knowledge could accelerate their roll-out, through repurposing, for affected individuals and help guide the efforts of other researchers in finding effective treatments for the disease.","output":"Identification of a druggable binding pocket in the spike protein reveals a key site for existing drugs potentially capable of combating Covid-19 infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The systematic removal of death from social life in the West has exposed people living in areas affected by COVID-19 to the risk of being unable to adequately manage the anxiety caused by mortality salience.

The group of participants included 38 students, 30 women and 8 men, with an average age of 25.45 years (SD = 7). At the end of the course, the students could respond on an optional basis to the request to comment on the training experience according to what they experienced during the pandemic. A thematic analysis was subsequently carried out on the texts, which made it possible to identify the most relevant thematic areas for the students. The qualitative analyses permitted recognition of three main forms of discovery: the removal of death in contemporary culture; the importance of community, ritual and funeral, and spirituality; and the significance of death education for future health professionals. The texts have highlighted how the removal of these issues exposes people to the risk of being unable to handle extremely painful events such as those related to dying. The results show the positivity of death education pathways conducted at the University level to help students reflect on these issues and manage the related anguish.","output":"Psychology Students' Perceptions of COVID-19 in a Death Education Course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is threatening billions of people. We described the clinical characteristics and explore virological and immunological factors associated with clinical outcomes. METHODS: 297 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital between January 20 and February 20, 2020 were included. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in respiratory tract, blood samples and digestive tract was detected and lymphocyte subsets were tested periodically. RESULT: Among the 297 patients (median age of 48 years), 154 (51.9 %) were female, 245 (82.5 %) mild/moderate cases, and 52 (17.5 %) severe/critical cases. 270 patients were detected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs and/or blood samples, and the overall positive rate was 23.0 % (62/270), higher in severe/critical cases than in mild/moderate cases (52.0 % vs. 16.4 %, P < 0.001). The CD4/CD8 ratio on admission was significantly higher in severe/critical cases than in mild/moderate cases (1.84 vs. 1.50, P = 0.022). During a median follow-up period of 17 days, 36 (12.1 %) patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), 16 (5.4 %) patients developed respiratory failure and underwent mechanical ventilation, four (1.3 %) patients needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), only one (0.34 %) patients died of multiple organ failure. Detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs and/or blood samples, as well as higher CD4/CD8 ratio were independent risk factors of respiratory failure and ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Most of COVID-19 patients in Guangzhou are mild/moderate, and presence of extrapulmonary virus and higher CD4/CD8 ratio are associated with higher risk of worse outcomes.","output":"Factors associated with clinical outcomes in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Guangzhou, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relevance.

It is necessary to study COVID-19 distribution features among the population of the central Orenburg region administrative districts in JuneCDecember 2020. Materials And Methods. We analyzed the results of the study of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 of the population of the Central Orenburg region for June-December 2020 (72 484 nasopharyngeal smears from 13 districts of the region). The presence of SARS-CoV2 RNA was detected by real-time reverse transcription PCR. The significance of differences in indicators was assessed using the paired Pearson test (p0.05;EPI-INFO, version 7.2.4;CDC). Results. The share of positive findings was 15,5% of the studied material from 12,5% of the population. Registration of COVID 19 cases in the Central Orenburg region began in June 2020. They revealed a significant correlation between the dynamics of the districts population morbidity and the dynamics of examined persons number. The study of morbidity dynamics showed a significant growth with the registration of maximum values in October with a decrease in disease cases in December by 2 times. They identified the highest morbidity rates territories (Aleksandrovsky, Akbulaksky, Sharlyksky, Tyulgansky, Perevolotsky, Sol-Iletsky, Saraktashsky, Belyaevsky dist at the average regional level 2204,90 /0000). The distribution of cases by sex revealed the predominance of women disease cases (56,8%) over the men proportion (43,2%). Women dominated among adults under 65 years of age, while men dominated in the children's and over 65 years of age groups. However, the prevalence analysis for the given period showed the women dominance in all age groups in all the studied territories. They can conclude that there is a great women commitment to medical care. It was not possible to identify significant correlations between the morbidity level and the districts remoteness from Orenburg. It is likely that at modern communication speeds distances of 250C300 km are not a significant barrier to a new infection with a dominant airborne transmission pathway spread. Conclusions. The study showed a mobidity significant growth for 2020. 8 of 13 territories under study became those of increased risk of morbidity. Cases of the disease ratio among men and women responds to the men and women ratio among the population. The age group of 0-18 was least affected. The analysis showed a morbidity reliable growth with increasing age of patients of both sexes and revealed a large inferiority of the female population. ? 2021, Numikom.

Advanced periodontal and peri-implant diseases are most likely associated with bacterial plaques that trigger host immune response and eventually lead to the destruction of the attachment apparatus and bone loss around a tooth or a dental implant. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans had the highest association with peri-implantitis. Resolvin E1 (RvE1) is part of the specialized pro-resolving lipid mediator family biosynthesized from omega-3, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Although RvE1 is an established anti-inflammatory agent, it was found that its application as a treatment or as a preventive drug had an indirect effect on the subgingival microbiota of both rats and rabbits with experimental periodontitis. Aim The aim of this study is to evaluate the direct antimicrobial effect of RvE1 on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans bacteria. Materials and Methods The study comprised three groups that underwent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The first group was tested with the RvE1 working concentration of 5 ug/ml, the second group was tested with ethanol (EtOH), 10% as the working concentration, and the final group was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as the positive control. Optical density (OD600) was used for the comparison of bacterial growth among the tested groups. The experiment was conducted in three biological replicates. Data were analyzed using SPSS, and results were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc Bonferroni using a minimum level of significance (P-value) of 0.05.

The review of data yielded to a total of 79 patients in 20 hospitals who had CSF analysis. METHODS: Outcomes during hospitalization, including hospital length of stay, disease severity, ventilator time, and in-hospital death were recorded. Independent variables collected included patient demographics, diagnoses, laboratory values, and procedures. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients underwent CSF analysis. Of these, antigen testing was performed in 73 patients. Ten patients had CSF analysis for general markers such as total protein, cell count, glucose, clarity, and color. Seven of the 10 cases (70%) had normal total cell count and normal white blood cell count in CSF. Sixty-three percent (5/8) had elevated total protein. Two patients had normal levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 1 patient had significantly elevated (fourfold) neuron-specific enolase (NSE) level in CSF. CONCLUSION: Unlike bacterial infections, viral infections are less likely to cause remarkable changes in CSF glucose, cell count, or protein.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate arrhythmia in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 during the current COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for case control studies that were published between January 1 and July 25, 2020, and that had data on arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19. Random effects model was used with the odds ratio as the effect size. The frequency of arrhythmia was compared between COVID-19 patients with and without the composite endpoint of severity. We also determined the pooled prevalence of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19. Publication bias and heterogeneity were considered by using subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and the trim and fill method. RESULTS: A total of 1553 patients with COVID-19 were included in the 5 articles we obtained. Of these, 349 cases (22.47%) and 1204 cases (77.53%) were severely ill and non-severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively. There were 790 (50.87%) male patients. A total of 105 cases (30.09%) of severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia had arrhythmia complications, and 34 cases (2.82%) of non-severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia had arrhythmia complications. We found arrhythmia to be significantly associated with severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia, with a pooled odds ratio of 17.97 (95% CI (11.30, 28.55), p<0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the incidence of arrhythmia in patients with severe COVID-19 was greater than that of those with non-severe COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a higher risk of arrhythmia complications, which further showed that COVID-19 may be a risk factor for arrhythmia and that the incidence of arrhythmia may increase with the progression of the disease.

We evaluate the predictive power of smell tests for neurodegenerative disease, compare performance to other established screening programs, and discuss ethical and practical considerations and limitations. EXPERT OPINION : Even if disease modifying therapies were available for neurodegenerative disease, smell tests alone are unlikely to have high enough predictive power to be used in a future screening program. However, we believe they could be a valuable component of a short battery of tests or part of a stepwise process that together could more accurately identify early neurodegeneration in large populations.","output":"The potential utility of smell testing to screen for neurodegenerative disorders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By providing liquidity Hausbanks can support business clients to overcome the social shutdown and hence cushion the economic impacts of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Previously published studies paid little attention to Arab countries, which has a population of over 440 million. In this study, we present the results of the first large-scale multinational study that measures vaccine hesitancy among Arab-speaking subjects. METHODS: An online survey in Arabic was conducted from 14 January 2021 to 29 January 2021. It consisted of 17 questions capturing demographic data, acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, attitudes toward the need for COVID-19 vaccination and associated health policies, and reasons for vaccination hesitancy. R software v.4.0.2 was used for data analysis and visualization. RESULTS: The survey recruited 36,220 eligible participants (61.1% males, 38.9% females, mean age 32.6  10.8 years) from all the 23 Arab countries and territories (83.4%) and 122 other countries (16.6%). Our analysis shows a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabs in and outside the Arab region (83% and 81%, respectively). The most cited reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and distrust in health care policies, vaccine expedited production, published studies and vaccine producing companies. We also found that female participants, those who are 30C59 years old, those with no chronic diseases, those with lower level of academic education, and those who do not know the type of vaccine authorized in their countries are more hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination. On the other hand, participants who regularly receive the influenza vaccine, health care workers, and those from countries with higher rates of COVID-19 infections showed more vaccination willingness. Interactive representation of our results is posted on our project website at https://mainapp.shinyapps.io/CVHAA.

We performed an international, multi-center, exploratory online survey study on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and recovery status of non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected adults (Austria: n=1157), and Italy: n= 893). RESULTS. Working age subjects (Austria median: 43 yrs (IQR: 31 - 53), Italy: 45 yrs (IQR: 35 - 55)) and females (65.1% and 68.3%) predominated the study cohorts. Course of acute COVID-19 was characterized by a high symptom burden (median 13 (IQR: 9 - 18) and 13 (7 - 18) out of 44 features queried), a 47.6 - 49.3% rate of symptom persistence beyond 28 days and 20.9 - 31.9% relapse rate. By cluster analysis, two acute symptom phenotypes could be discerned: the non-specific infection phenotype and the multi-organ phenotype (MOP), the latter encompassing multiple neurological, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal and dermatological features. Clustering of long COVID subjects yielded three distinct subgroups, with a subset of 48.7 - 55 % long COVID individuals particularly affected by post-acute MOP symptoms. The number and presence of specific acute MOP symptoms and pre-existing multi-morbidity was linked to elevated risk of long COVID. CONCLUSION.

This population is also at risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is important to understand the impact of coexistent hip fracture and SARS-CoV-2 for informed decision-making at patient and service levels. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies of older (> 60 years) people with fragility hip fractures and outcomes with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was early (30-day or in-hospital) mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay and key clinical characteristics known to be associated with outcomes after hip fracture. RESULTS: A total of 14 cohort and five case series studies were included (692 SARS-CoV-2 positive, 2,585 SARS-CoV-2 negative). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an overall risk ratio (RR) for early mortality of 4.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.42 to 5.82). Early mortality was 34% (95% CI 30% to 38%) and 9% (95% CI 8% to 10%) in the infected and noninfected groups respectively. Length of stay was increased in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (mean difference (MD) 5.2 days (3.2 to 7.2)). Age (MD 1.6 years (0.3 to 2.9)); female sex (RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.05)); admission from home (RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.00)); presence of dementia (RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.43)); and intracapsular fracture (RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.11)) were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The spike glycoprotein (S-protein), anchored onto the virus envelope, is the trimer of S-protein comprised of S1 and S2 domains which interacts with host cell receptors and facilitates virus-cell membrane fusion. The S1 domain comprises of a receptor binding domain (RBD) possessing an N-terminal domain and two subdomains (SD1 and SD2). Certain regions of S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 such as S2 domain and fragment of the RBD remain conserved despite the high selection pressure. These conserved regions of the S-protein are extrapolated as the potential target for developing molecular diagnostic techniques. Further, the S-protein acts as an antigenic target for different serological assay platforms for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Virus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies can be used to detect viral proteins in ELISA and lateral flow immunoassays. The S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 has very high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-1, and the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-1 cross-react with S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and neutralize its activity. Furthermore, in vitro studies have demonstrated that polyclonal antibodies targeted against the RBD of S-protein of SARS-CoV-1 can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 thus inhibiting its infectivity in permissive cell lines. Research on coronaviral S-proteins paves the way for the development of vaccines that may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and alleviate the current global coronavirus pandemic. However, specific neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 are in clinical development. Therefore, neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S-protein are promising specific antiviral therapeutics for pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hereby review the approaches taken by researchers across the world to use spike gene and S-glycoprotein for the development of effective diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics against SARA-CoV-2 infection the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Extrapolation for COVID Diagnosis and Vaccine Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, that emerged in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China and is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly evolved into a pandemic.

It has seriously affected people above the age of 60 years. The International Health Regulations (IHR) revised in 2005 bind governments to disclose vital information regarding the identification and detection of new disease outbreaks regardless of its causative agent. In contrast to the previous SARS epidemic, China timely informed the world about the onset of a new outbreak. It also soon disclosed the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Unfortunately, despite the fast recognition of the Chinese epidemic, the application of the 2005 IHR was not followed by an effective response in every country and most health authorities failed to rapidly perceive the threat posed by COVID-19. To further complicate matters, IHR implementation, which relies primarily on self-reporting data rather than on an external review mechanism, was limited in speed and further hindered by high costs. The response in Italy suffered from several limitations within the health system and services. The action against this threat must instead be quick, firm and at the highest trans-national level. The solution lies in further strengthening countries' preparedness through a clear political commitment, mobilization of proper resources and implementation of a strict surveillance and monitoring process.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic preparedness ... or lack thereof: from China to Italy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Heart failure (HF) is often characterized by an insidious disease course leading to frequent rehospitalizations and a high use of ambulatory care.

SARS-CoV-2 has a potent arsenal of mechanisms used to counter this adaptive immune response through processes, such as T cells depletion and T cell exhaustion. These phenomena are most often observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients, pointing towards a link between T cell function and disease severity.

A total of 137 fecal specimens from patients with severe HFMD were collected. Enterovirus (EV) types were determined using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RT nested PCR, and sequencing. Sequences were analyzed using bioinformatics programs. Of 137 specimens tested, 97 (70.8%), 12 (8.8%), and 10 (7.3%) were positive for EV-A71, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), and CVA16, respectively. Other pathogens detected included CVA2 (2.9%, 4/137), CVA10 (2.9%, 4/137), CVA5 (0.7%, 1/137), echovirus 6 (E6) (0.7%, 1/137) and E18 (0.7%, 1/137). The most frequent complication in patients with proven EV infections was myoclonic jerk, followed by aseptic encephalitis, tachypnea, and vomiting. The frequencies of vomiting and abnormal eye movements were higher in EV-A71-infected patients than that in CVA6-infected or CVA16-infected patients. Molecular phylogeny based on the complete VP1 gene revealed no association between the subgenotype of the virus and disease severity. Nevertheless, 12 significant mutations that were likely to be associated with virulence or the clinical phenotype were observed in the 5UTR, 2A(pro), 2C, 3A, 3D(pol) and 3UTR of CVA6. Eight significant mutations were observed in the 5UTR, 2B, 3A, 3D(pol) and 3UTR of CVA16, and 10 significant mutations were observed in the 5UTR, VP1, 3A and 3C(pro) of CVA10. In conclusion, EV-A71 is still the main pathogen causing severe HFMD, although other EV types can also cause severe complications. Potential virulence or phenotype-associated sites were identified in the genomes of CVA6, CVA16, and CVA10.

The aim of this study was to identify the main predictors of death in hospitalized patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the period from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2021, an observational, retrospective, randomized, case-control study was conducted, which included a sample of 139 patients who died in hospital and another sample of 275 patients who had been discharged in an improved or healed condition. Confirmation of COVID-19 cases was performed by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal exudates. Statistical data were analyzed by logistic regression, Cox regression and a comparison of survival curves by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. RESULTS: The most powerful logistic regression model identified the following independent predictors of death: history of coagulopathy HR = 30.73 [1.94C487.09], p = 0.015; high percentage of neutrophils HR = 1.09 [1.01C1.19], p = 0.027; and decreased blood-oxygenation HR = 53881.97 [1762.24C1647489.44], p < 0.001.

A total of 466 mixed gender commercial piglets from a breed-to-wean sow farm were enrolled. Piglets were alternately assigned by birth order within a litter to four umbilical treatment groups; iodine (2%), Zurex umbilical dip, a dry dip created using an antibacterial peptide (nisin) mixed with talc (formulation concentration = 3.105 g nisin/100 g talc on a wt/wt basis), and no treatment. At birth, stall conditions (wet/dry and clean/dirty) were evaluated on a 3 point scale (3 = most dirty or most wet and 1 = dry or clean). Before treatment, diameter of the umbilical cords were determined using digital calipers. All data were analyzed using mixed model methods. Models included the fixed effects of birth weight, umbilical diameter at birth, gender, stall conditions and treatment. Pre-weaning mortality was significantly affected by umbilical treatment (p < 0.05) and by ratio of umbilical diameter to birth weight (p < 0.001). Piglets treated with 2% iodine had a higher mortality rate than piglets treated with other antiseptics or those that were untreated. Piglets with the lowest umbilical cord diameter to birth weight ratio had the highest survival rate. Stall conditions at birth (p < 0.005) and the ratio of umbilical diameter to birth weight (p < 0.05) affected the incidence of umbilical hernias. Piglets born in wet stall conditions or those with a high umbilical cord to birth weight ratio had a higher incidence of umbilical hernias in the growing phase.

Following withdrawal of the involved bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDv) vaccine, the incidence of this condition rapidly decreased, with no reported cases in the last 5 years. Here, we report a recent immune-mediated pancytopenia in three calves from two different suckler herds, clinically indistinguishable from BNP. CASE PRESENTATION: Three Belgian Blue suckler calves from two different farms, aged around two weeks, showed multiple bleedings disseminated on the skin and petechiae and ecchymoses on the mucosae. Blood examination confirmed anaemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. BVDv infection was excluded. Despite blood transfusion and cortisone therapy, all three animals died. Necropsy and histology confirmed bone marrow depletion. Binding of IgG from the dams on leukocytes of the calves was demonstrated by flow cytometry. Two calves, originating from the same farm, received colostrum from the same dam. None of the calves were given colostrum replacers or colostrum supplements. No link with the BNP causing BVDv vaccine could be evidenced. However, dams had been vaccinated against bovine herpesvirus 1, parainfluenza-3 virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bluetongue virus serotype 8.

A common clinical picture in children with JMML is that it presents as a constitutive hyperinflammatory syndrome, partially reminiscent of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in adults. Thus, a component of JMML is associated with a hyperinflammatory state and abundant innate immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. Recently, we showed that the evolutionarily conserved mouse lncRNA Morrbid is specifically expressed in myeloid cells and uniquely represses the expression of the proapoptotic gene Bim to regulate the lifespan of myeloid cells. However, its role in JMML has not been investigated. In this study, we characterized the role of Morrbid and its target Bim, which are significantly dysregulated in Shp2E76K/+-bearing myeloid cells, in driving JMML. Loss of Morrbid in a mouse model of JMML driven by the Shp2E76K/+ mutation resulted in a significant correction of myeloid and erythroid cell abnormalities associated with JMML, including overall survival. Consistently, patients with JMML who had PTPN11, KRAS, and NRAS mutations and high expression of MORRBID manifested poor overall survival.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 63 patients with COVID- 19 from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, including 32 moderate cases and 31 severe cases. The demographic data, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations and laboratory test results were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that predicted the severity of COVID-19. The receiver- operating characteristic curve (ROC) of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined to estimate the optimal threshold of NLR for predicting severe cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: The patients with moderate and server COVID-19 showed significant differences in the rate of diabetes, NLR, serum amyloid A (SSA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin (ALB) levels (P < 0.05). The co- morbidity of diabetes, NLR, SSA and CRP were found to positively correlate and ALB to inversely correlate with the severity of COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 (OR=1.264, 95% CI: 1.046-1.526, P=0.015) with an AUC of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.730-0.932), an optimal diagnostic threshold of 4.795, a sensitivity of 0.839, and a specificity of 0.750.

This study aims to gain a better understanding of the psychosocial determinants of young peoples physical distancing behavior and the role that direct (i.e., interpersonal) and mediated communication (i.e., mass media, social media) about COVID-19 plays in this. A daily diary study was conducted among 481 Dutch adolescents (secondary school students;age range 10-18 years) and 404 young adults (university students;age range 17-25 years), involving 10 identical daily surveys administered on weekdays during a 2-week period during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020). The hypotheses were tested with preregistered univariate and multivariate linear mixed-effects models. The perceived descriptive norm (i.e., what friends are doing) was the most important determinant of physical distancing behavior among both adolescents and young adults. The perceived injunctive norm, perceived response efficacy, and perceived severity were also positively associated with physical distancing, albeit less strong. Among adolescents, exposure to information about COVID-19 in the mass media increased their perceptions of the descriptive norm, which in turn increased their physical distancing behavior. For those involved in studying and designing COVID-19-related behavioral interventions and campaigns targeting youth, it is important to consider the social norms that they relate to, and to take into account their perceived severity and response efficacy.","output":"Communication and COVID-19 Physical Distancing Behavior Among Dutch Youth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the era of Industry 4.0, the innovative applications of the industrial internet of things continue to deepen, and the trend of digital transformation of the green manufacturing industry continues to expand.

In healthcare systems, nurses are currently leaving their work. To give quality of health, nurses have to stay in their work. The aim of this study was to find the willingness of the nurses to stay in the nursing profession and associated factors. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was employed among nurses in selected hospitals. After checking for completeness, the data were interred into Epi Data version 3 and exported to Stata SE version 14 for analysis. Then, the descriptive statistics were computed. To find association, logistic regression was computed. Covariates from binary logistic regression were a candidate for multivariate logistic regression at p-value ? 0.25. Variables in the final model were selected by the stepwise backward selection procedure. In the end, variables with a p-value ? 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: In this study, 349 nurses have participated with a 100% response rate and more than half of the participants were male 188 (53.87%). The proportion of nurses who have the willingness to stay in the nursing proportion is 54.44% (95% confidence interval = 0.491, 0.59).

The boundary between such classifications has recently been blurred by the discovery of repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation reported in spinocerebellar ataxia type 8, myotonic dystrophy type 1, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome and C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. This noncanonical translation requires no AUG start codon and can initiate in multiple frames of CAG, CGG and GGGGCC repeats of the sense and antisense strands of disease-relevant transcripts. RNA structures formed by the repeats have been suggested as possible triggers; however, the precise mechanism of the translation initiation remains elusive. Templates containing expansions of microsatellites have also been shown to challenge translation elongation, as frameshifting has been recognized across CAG repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and Huntington's disease. Determining the critical requirements for RAN translation and frameshifting is essential to decipher the mechanisms that govern these processes. The contribution of unusual translation products to pathogenesis needs to be better understood.

Moreover, we describe a previously unidentified nucleolar localization signal within ORF57 that is composed of two distinct nuclear localization signals. Intriguingly, point mutations that ablate ORF57 nucleolar localization lead to a failure of ORF57-mediated viral mRNA nuclear export. Furthermore, nucleolar retargeting of the ORF57 mutant was achieved by the incorporation of the HIV-1 Rev nucleolar localization signal, and analysis demonstrated that this modification was sufficient to restore viral mRNA nuclear export.

However, due to coronavirus disease 2019, many mass treatment campaigns for schistosomiasis have been halted, with uncertain implications for the programmes.

RESULTS: For both S. mansoni and S. haematobium in moderate- and some high-prevalence settings, the disruption may delay the goal by up to 2 y. In some high-prevalence settings, EPHP is not achievable with current strategies and so the disruption will not impact this. Here, increasing SAC coverage and treating adults can achieve the goal. The impact of MDA disruption and the appropriate mitigation strategy varies according to the baseline prevalence prior to treatment, the burden of infection in adults and the stage of the programme.

Concerns about childcare were negatively related to willingness to return, whereas organizational strategies for mitigating COVID-19 transmission at work were positively related to willingness to return. COVID-19 infections in an employees network were also negatively related to employees willingness to return. Conclusions: Blanket policies may miss the nuanced needs of different employee groups. Employers and policy makers should adopt flexible approaches to ensure a return to workspaces that addresses employee concerns and needs.","output":"I Dont Want to Go Back: Examining the Return to Physical Workspaces During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the role of job characteristics on an individual's decisions to follow social distancing policies, work, and apply for unemployment insurance in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic We use data that track millions of mobile devices and their daily movements across physical locations to measure whether the devices' owners leave their homes, or work part-time or full-time on a given day, and we also collect data on weekly unemployment insurance claims We find that the presence of jobs with a high work-from-home capacity in a region increases the ability of people to follow social distancing policies and decreases their unemployment risk, whereas the presence of jobs with high physical proximity decreases the incidences of following social distancing policies and unemployment and increases the incidence of work during the pandemic These heterogeneous responses based on local job characteristics persist even conditional on a broad set of demographic and socioeconomic variables","output":"Social Distancing, Labor Market Outcomes, and Job Characteristics in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today's challenges must be addressed as socio-technical systems, including insights from the social sciences and humanities to adequately represent the human components.

This perspective aims to provide a basic understanding of the inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 and its relation to the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The virus enters through the mucous membranes of the orofacial region and reaches the TG, where it resides and takes control of its peptides including Substance P (SP). SP is the main neuropeptide, neuromodulator, and neuro-hormone of TG, associated with nociception and inflammation under noxious stimulus. SP release is triggered and, consequently, affects the immune cells and blood vessels to release the mediators for inflammation. Hence, cytokine storm is initiated and causes respiratory distress, bronchoconstriction, and death in complicated cases. Neurokinin-1 Receptor (NK-1R) is the receptor for SP and its antagonists, along with glucocorticoids, may be used to alleviate the symptoms and treat this infection by blocking this nociceptive pathway. SP seems to be the main culprit involved in the triggering of inflammatory pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection. It may have a direct association with cardio-respiratory rhythm, sleep-wake cycle, nociception, and ventilatory responses and regulates many important physiological and pathological functions. Its over-secretion should be blocked by NK-1R antagonist. However, experimental work leading to clinical trials are mandatory for further confirmation. Here, it is further proposed that there is a possibility of latency in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection if it is acting through TG, which is the main site for other viruses that become latent.","output":"Substance P/ Neurokinin-1 Receptor, Trigeminal Ganglion, Latency, and Coronavirus Infection-Is There Any Link?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pesticide-induced DNA damage is primarily repaired by base excision repair (BER) pathway.

Endotracheal tubes with different cuff shapes may lead to different cuff pressures after positional change. We hypothesized that the intracuff pressure in the TaperGuard? ETT with a tapered-shaped cuff would be higher than that in the conventional ETT with a cylindrical-shaped cuff after a change from the supine to the lateral flank position. METHODS Fifty-eight patients scheduled for open urological procedures in the lateral flank position were randomly allocated to receive either a TaperGuard ETT (group T) or conventional ETT (group C). The ETT cuff pressure was initially set at 20 cm H2O in the supine position and was measured after the change to the lateral flank position. The distance from the ETT tip to the carina was measured in both the supine and the lateral flank positions. RESULTS Two patients, one from each group, were excluded from the data analysis. The mean (SD) ETT cuff pressure was significantly higher in group T (n = 28) than in group C (n = 28) after the change in position [31 (7) cm H2O vs 25 (4) cm H2O, respectively; mean difference, 6 cm; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 3 to 9; P < 0.001].

Like in-person debriefings, faculty seek to facilitate effective reflective discourse. The online learning environment, however, presents challenges to learner engagement that differ considerably from in-person debriefing, yet little research exists in this area. In an effort to identify factors that influence debriefing engagement in the online environment, we conceptualized distance debriefings as complex social interactions and performed a realist review of the literature for evidence in the fields of online learning, healthcare simulation, instructional design, and other teaching and learning fields to see whether we might discern factors that influence engagement in online learning conversations that might inform online distance debriefing best practices. Eighteen articles were found through our search of 5 online databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, Google Scholar). We conducted iterative purposeful searching and continued to do so throughout the review to try to identify any additional studies that would contribute to our understanding. A thematic analysis of the findings of our included articles revealed indicators categorized using the community of inquiry framework, enabling us to understand and explain them in the context of online learning and propose their application to distance debriefing engagement. We also propose a new dimension to the framework: internal and external factors of engagement. Our findings demonstrate that online learning can positively influence engagement of learners if essential factors are implemented. These factors may inform recommendations for best practices toward learner engagement during healthcare simulation distance debriefing.","output":"Factors of Engagement in Synchronous Online Learning Conversations and Distance Debriefing: A Realist Synthesis Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The twin pandemics of COVID-19 and systemic racism during 2020 have forced a conversation across many segments of our society, including the environmental health sciences (EHS) research community. We have seen the proliferation of statements of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and commitments to fight racism and health inequities from academia, nonprofit organizations, governmental agencies, and private corporations. Actions must now arise from these promises. As public health and EHS scientists, we must examine the systems that produce and perpetuate inequities in exposure to environmental pollutants and associated health effects. OBJECTIVES: We outline five recommendations the EHS research community can implement to confront racism and move our science forward for eliminating racial inequities in environmental health. DISCUSSION: Race is best considered a political label that promotes inequality. Thus, we should be wary of equating race with biology. Further, EHS researchers should seriously consider racism as a plausible explanation of racial disparities in health and consider structural racism as a factor in environmental health risk/impact assessments, as well as multiple explanations for racial differences in environmental exposures and health outcomes. Last, the EHS research community should develop metrics to measure racism and a set of guidelines on the use and interpretation of race and ethnicity within the environmental sciences. Numerous guidelines exist in other disciplines that can serve as models. By taking action on each of these recommendations, we can make significant progress toward eliminating racial disparities. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8186.","output":"Confronting Racism in Environmental Health Sciences: Moving the Science Forward for Eliminating Racial Inequities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Near the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, on April 13, 2020, about 50 members of the American Academy of Psychodynamic Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis convened through Zoom to talk about the impact of the pandemic on their practices, their patients, and themselves.* They offer their reflections through oral and written comments.

The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols.

Recent systematic reviews have demonstrated that interpregnancy weight gain increases women's risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in their subsequent pregnancy. Interpregnancy weight change studies exclude nulliparous women. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following MOOSE guidelines and summarizes the evidence of the impact of preconception and interpregnancy weight change on perinatal outcomes for women regardless of parity. Sixty one studies met the inclusion criteria for this review and reported 34 different outcomes. We identified a significantly increased risk of gestational diabetes (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.66, 2.14, I2 = 87.8%), hypertensive disorders (OR 1.46 95% CI 1.12, 1.91, I2 = 94.9%), preeclampsia (OR 1.92 95% CI 1.55, 2.37, I2 = 93.6%), and large-for-gestational-age (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25, 1.49, I2 = 92.2%) with preconception and interpregnancy weight gain.

Accumulating evidence is focused on the roles of gut microbial community in cardiovascular disease, but few studies have unveiled the alterations and further directions of gut microbiota in severe CHF patients. Aimed to investigate this deficiency, fecal samples from 29 CHF patients diagnosed with NYHA Class III-IV and 30 healthy controls were collected and then analyzed using bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. As a result, there were many significant differences between the two groups. Firstly, the phylum Firmicutes was found to be remarkably decreased in severe CHF patients, and the phylum Proteobacteria was the second most abundant phyla in severe CHF patients instead of phylum Bacteroides strangely. Secondly, the  diversity indices such as chao1, PD-whole-tree and Shannon indices were significantly decreased in the severe CHF versus the control group, as well as the notable difference in -diversity between the two groups. Thirdly, our result revealed a remarkable decrease in the abundance of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing bacteria including genera Ruminococcaceae UCG-004, Ruminococcaceae UCG-002, Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group, Dialister and the increased abundance of the genera in Enterococcus and Enterococcaceae with an increased production of lactic acid.

Our study aimed to explore the impact of prenatal melatonin in an inflammatory/infectious context on GABAergic neurons and on oligodendrocytes (OLs), key cells involved in the encephalopathy of prematurity. An inflammatory/infectious agent (LPS, 300 g/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) to pregnant Wistar rats at gestational day 19 and 20. Melatonin (5 mg/kg) was injected i.p. following the same schedule. Immunostainings focusing on GABAergic neurons, OL lineage and myelination were performed on pup brain sections. Melatonin succeeded in preventing the LPS-induced decrease of GABAergic neurons within the retrospenial cortex, and sustainably promoted GABAergic neurons within the dentate gyrus in the inflammatory/infectious context. However, melatonin did not effectively prevent the LPS-induced alterations on OLs and myelination. Therefore, we demonstrated that melatonin partially prevented the deleterious effects of LPS according to the cell type. The timing of exposure related to the cell maturation stage is likely to be critical to achieve an efficient action of melatonin.

However, the advantages and challenges of RDD for CT have not yet been investigated from the perspective of public health professionals (PHPs). Therefore, it remains unclear if, and under what circumstances, PHPs are willing to apply RDD for CT. METHODS: Between March and April 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch PHPs responsible for CT in practice. Questions were derived from the 'diffusion of innovations' theory. Between May and June 2019, we distributed an online questionnaire among 260 Dutch PHPs to quantify the main qualitative findings. Using different hypothetical scenarios, we assessed anticipated advantages and challenges of RDD, and PHPs' intention to apply RDD for CT. RESULTS: Twelve interviews were held, and 70 PHPs completed the online questionnaire. A majority of questionnaire respondents (71%) had a positive intention towards using RDD for CT. Anticipated advantages of RDD were 'accommodating easy and autonomous participation in CT of index cases and contact persons', and 'reaching contact persons more efficiently'. Anticipated challenges were 'limited opportunities for PHPs to support, motivate, and coordinate the execution of CT', 'not being able to adequately convey measures to index cases and contact persons', and 'anticipated unrest among index cases and contact persons'. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD applicable for CT included index cases and contact persons being reluctant to share information directly with PHPs, digitally skilled and literate persons being involved, and large scale CT. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD less applicable for CT included severe consequences of missing information or contact persons for individual or public health, involvement of complex or impactful measures for index cases and contact persons, and a disease being perceived as severe or sensitive by index cases and their contact persons. CONCLUSIONS: PHPs generally perceived RDD as a potentially beneficial method for public health practice, that may help overcome challenges present in traditional CT, and could be used during outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via close contact. The circumstances under which CT is performed, appear to strongly influence PHPs' intention to use RDD for CT.","output":"Online respondent-driven detection for enhanced contact tracing of close-contact infectious diseases: benefits and barriers for public health practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In vitro selection of remdesivir-resistant SARS-CoV-2 revealed the emergence of a V166L substitution, located outside of the polymerase active site of the nsp12 protein, after 9 passages.

OBJECTIVE: For each of the most frequent clinical scenarios, the authors reached a consensus on how should be timing and indications be optimized to reduce risk while maintaining the expected outcomes under the Covid-19 pandemics. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The organization of health care has been changed by the Covid-19 pandemic with a direct impact on Spine Oncology Surgery. Emergency surgery is still a priority, but in case of spinal tumors it should be better defined which conditions require emergency treatment. METHODS: An expert panel with general spine surgeons, oncological spine surgeons, and radiation oncologists was formed to analyze the most frequent scenarios in spinal musculoskeletal oncology during Covid-19 pandemics. RESULTS: Spine metastases can be found incidentally during follow-up or can clinically occur by increasing pain, pathologic fracture, and/or neurological symptoms. Primary spine tumors are much more rare and very rarely present with acute onset. The first step is to suspect this rare condition, to avoid to treat a primary tumor as it were a metastasis. Most complex surgery, like en bloc resection, associated with high morbidity and mortality rate for the treatment of low grade malignancy like chordoma or chondrosarcomas, if intensive care unit availability is reduced, can be best delayed some weeks, as not impacting on prognosis, due to the slow growth rate of these conditions. The currently accepted protocols for Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteogenic sarcoma must be performed for local and systemic disease control. For ES, after the first courses of chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be selected instead of surgery, during Covid-19, to the end of the full course of chemotherapy. In immunocompromised patients, (treated by chemotherapy), it is necessary to avoid contact with affected or exposed people.

During microbial infection, mitochondria serve as signaling hubs to induce immune responses to counteract invading pathogens like viruses. Mitochondrial functions are central to a variety of antiviral responses including apoptosis and type I interferon signaling (IFN-I). While apoptosis and IFN-I mediated by mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) are well-established defenses, new dimensions of mitochondrial biology are emerging as battlefronts during viral infection. Increasingly, it has become apparent that mitochondria serve as reservoirs for distinct cues that trigger immune responses and that alterations in mitochondrial morphology may also tip infection outcomes. Furthermore, new data are foreshadowing pivotal roles for classic, homeostatic facets of this organelle as host-virus interfaces, namely, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) complexes like respiratory supercomplexes. Underscoring the importance of housekeeping mitochondrial activities in viral infection is the growing list of viral-encoded inhibitors including mimics derived from cellular genes that antagonize these functions. For example, virologs for ETC factors and several enzymes from the TCA cycle have been recently identified in DNA virus genomes and serve to pinpoint new vulnerabilities during infection.

We aimed to assess the accuracy of the late\\\\phase prone\\\\position contrast CT (late\\\\pCT) for thrombus detection in patients with persistent or long\\\\standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: Early and late\\\\phase pCT were performed in 300 patients with persistent or long\\\\standing AF. If late\\\\pCT did not show an intracardiac contrast defect (CD), catheter ablation (CA) was performed. Immediately before CA, intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) from the left atrium was performed to confirm thrombus absence and the estimation of the blood velocity of the left atrial appendage (LAA). For patients with CDs on late\\\\pCT, CA performance was delayed, and late\\\\pCT was performed again after several months following oral anticoagulant alterations or dosage increases. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients who exhibited CDs in the early phase of pCT, six showed persistent CDs on late\\\\pCT. In the remaining 294 patients without CDs on late\\\\pCT, the absence of a thrombus was confirmed by ICE during CA. In all six patients with CD\\\\positivity on late\\\\pCT, the CDs vanished under the same CT conditions after subsequent anticoagulation therapy, and CA was successfully performed. Furthermore, the presence of residual contrast medium in the LAA on late\\\\pCT suggested a decreased blood velocity in the LAA (  15 cm/s) (sensitivity = 0.900 and specificity = 0.621).

This posed challenges to many countries, prominent among which is communication with the public to gain their cooperation. Israel faces different challenges from other countries in its management of the COVID-19 crisis because it is in the midst of a deep constitutional crisis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to examine the response of the Israeli public to the governments emergency instructions regarding the pandemic in terms of correlations between overall risk perception and crisis management; overall risk perception and economic threat perception; crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines; and crisis management and economic threat perception. We also made comparisons between crisis management and spokesperson credibility and between crisis management and the credibility of information sources. METHODS: The sample was established using an online survey that enabled rapid and effective distribution of an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 crisis. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants (N=1056) through social network posts asking the general public (aged 18 years) to answer the survey. RESULTS: Participants aged 65 years perceived higher personal risk compared to those aged 18-30 years (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.04-0.61) and those aged 46-64 years (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-0.64). Significant correlations were found between overall risk perception and attitudes toward crisis management (r=0.19, P<.001), overall risk perception and economic threat perception (r=0.22, P<.001), attitudes toward crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines (r=0.15, P<.001), and attitudes toward crisis management and economic threat perception (r=C0.15, P<.001). Participants who perceived that the prime minister was the most credible spokesperson evaluated the crisis management significantly higher than all other groups. The crisis management was evaluated significantly lower by participants who stated that infectious disease specialists were the most credible spokespersons. Participants for whom the Ministry of Health website was the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management higher than all other groups. Participants for whom scientific articles were the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management lower than those who perceived that the WHO/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites or Ministry of Health/hospital websites and health care workers were the most credible. CONCLUSIONS: The higher the public trust and evaluation of crisis management, the greater the compliance of the public with guidelines. It was also found that crisis management and information cannot be approached in the same way for the overall public. Furthermore, unlike other epidemics, the COVID-19 crisis has widespread economic and social consequences; therefore, it is impossible to focus only on health risks without communicating economic and social risks as well.","output":"Analysis of Public Perception of the Israeli Governments Early Emergency Instructions Regarding COVID-19: Online Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an established part of the treatment algorithm for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Our results show that CDC ensemble forecasts are not more accurate than \`\`Euler'' forecasts on short-term forecasting horizons of one week. However, CDC ensemble forecasts show a better performance on longer forecasting horizons. Using the current rate of change in incidences as estimates of future incidence changes is useful for epidemic forecasting on short time horizons.

To determine if SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in sewage during the emergence of COVID-19 in The Netherlands, sewage samples of six cities and the airport were tested using four qRT-PCR assays, three targeting the nucleocapsid gene (N1CN3) and one the envelope gene (E). No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on February 6, 3 weeks before the first Dutch case was reported. On March 4/5, one or more gene fragments were detected in sewage of three sites, in concentrations of 2.6C30 gene copies per mL. In Amersfoort, N3 was detected in sewage 6 days before the first cases were reported. As the prevalence of COVID-19 in these cities increased in March, the RNA signal detected by each qRT-PCR assay increased, for N1CN3 up to 790C2200 gene copies per mL. This increase correlated significantly with the increase in reported COVID-19 prevalence. The detection of the virus RNA in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, and the correlation between concentration in sewage and reported prevalence of COVID-19, indicate that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.","output":"Presence of SARS-Coronavirus-2 RNA in Sewage and Correlation with Reported COVID-19 Prevalence in the Early Stage of the Epidemic in The Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With a 34-percent increase in dermatology residency applications in the past decade, residency programs are increasingly faced with the daunting task of reviewing more applications for a relatively fixed number of residency positions.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many medical schools were forced to adopt remote or blended teaching formats, reducing students' dissection time in the anatomy laboratory. Some have raised concerns about how having limited interaction with body donors in anatomical education may dehumanize medical students' learning experiences and alter their learning outcomes, but there is a paucity of research in this area. To examine how reduced exposure to cadavers during the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the student experience, a pre-pandemic assessment must first be made. Halfway through the first year of medical school, McGill University medical students consider the meaning of their anatomy laboratory experience and how it has contributed to their future career through a written reflective assignment. The present study aimed to describe how students reflected on their laboratory experience and its importance in their training as both individuals and future healthcare professionals, prior to the onset of COVID-19. Reflections written by the McGill University medical class of 2023, whose time in the anatomy laboratory was not limited by the pandemic, were analyzed through the six-step framework to thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke (2006). Three undergraduate research students (BB, MR, IG) inductively coded students' reflections (n = 134) using NVivo software to identify preliminary themes. Themes were reviewed, defined, and named through discussion with the entire research team (all listed authors). Three central themes were identified: (1) philosophical reflections, (2) perceived outcomes of the anatomy laboratory and (3) reflections on the body donor or body donation. Notable sub-themes included: (1.1) reflections on the body and soul, (2.1) reflections on the current medical curriculum and (3.1) the dichotomy of objectification and personification during student-donor interaction. The presence of these themes and example quotes drawn from the reflections confirm that donor-dissection not only teaches students anatomical knowledge but enables them to realize the importance of dissection to the medical curriculum, consider the gift that is body donation, and explore philosophical ideas of life and death. A thematic analysis of the reflections written by McGill University's 2024 medical class, who were subject to a blended learning format during the COVID-19 pandemic, is currently underway to determine the degree to which decreased laboratory exposure influenced the students' reflections on their laboratory experience.","output":"Examining the Impact of Cadaver-Based Anatomy Laboratory Experiences on Medical Students Through a Thematic Analysis of their Written Reflections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Like many countries worldwide, numerous companies and business in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) have closed to stop the spread of COVID-19, resulting in losses of jobs and income.

This study examined the relative magnitude of those increases and their relationship to COVID-19 prevalence. METHODS: EMS (9-1-1 system) medical directors for 50 of the largest U.S. cities agreed to provide the aggregate, de-identified, pre-existing monthly tallies of OHCA among adults (age >18 years) occurring between January and June 2020 within their respective jurisdictions. Identical comparison data were also provided for corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019. Equivalent data were obtained from the largest cities in Italy, United Kingdom and France, as well as Perth, Australia and Auckland, New Zealand. FINDINGS: Significant OHCA escalations generally paralleled local prevalence of COVID-19. During April, most U.S. cities (34/50) had >20% increases in OHCA versus 2018C2019 which reflected high local COVID-19 prevalence. Thirteen observed 15-fold increases in OHCA and three COVID-19 epicenters had >100% increases (25-fold in New York City). Conversely, cities with lesser COVID-19 impact observed unchanged (or even diminished) OHCA numbers. Altogether (n = 50), on average, OHCA cases/city rose 59% during April (p = 003). By June, however, after mitigating COVID-19 spread, cities with the highest OHCA escalations returned to (or approached) pre-COVID OHCA numbers while cities minimally affected by COVID-19 during April (and not experiencing OHCA increases), then had marked OHCA escalations when COVID-19 began to surge locally. European, Australian, and New Zealand cities mirrored the U.S. experience.

The current COVID-19 pandemic is no different. While there have been ample studies describing racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, relatively few have established an empirical link between these disparities and structural racism. Such empirical analyses are critically important to help defuse victim-blaming narratives about why minority communities have been badly hit by COVID-19. In this paper, we explore the empirical link between structural racism and disparities in county-level COVID-19 outcomes by county racial composition. Using negative binomial regression models, we examine how five measures of county-level residential segregation and racial disparities in socioeconomic outcomes as well as incarceration rates are associated with county-level COVID-19 outcomes. We find significant associations between higher levels of measured structural racism and higher rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, even after adjusting for county-level population sociodemographic characteristics, measures of population health, access to healthcare, population density, and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak. One percentage point more Black residents predicted a 1.1% increase in county case rate. This association decreased to 0.4% when structural racism indicators were included in our model. Similarly, one percentage point more Black residents predicted a 1.8% increase in county death rates, which became non-significant after adjustment for structural racism. Our findings lend empirical support to the hypothesis that structural racism is an important driver of racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, and reinforce existing calls for action to address structural racism as a fundamental cause of health disparities.

However, median primary tumor size was significantly larger (p = 0.042) and T stage more advanced for mucosal subsites (p = 0.025) in the COVID-19 group. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest increased tumor burden in patients with HNC presenting during the pandemic, despite a similar time to diagnosis.

The effect of caffeine on preterm neonatal renal regional saturation of oxygen (RrSO2) is unknown. METHODS RrSO2 was recorded continuously in neonates < 32 weeks' gestation until 7 days of age with INVOS? neonatal near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensors. Baseline RrSO2 values were established by averaging the saturations in the 20 min prior to caffeine administration. Subgroup analysis was performed based on pre-caffeine RrSO2 averages. Change in RrSO2 was recorded at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 h after maintenance caffeine administration. RESULTS Of 35 eligible neonates, 31 (median gestational age 28.4 weeks) received 156 caffeine doses (median 8 mg/kg). Analysis of combined doses showed no significant changes in RrSO2 after caffeine administration at any time. However, neonates with baseline 20-29.9% had significant increases from 1 to 12 h (range of increase 5.9-13.9%), and those with baseline 30-39.9 had significant increases at 1 h (8.06%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Maintenance caffeine dosing increased RrSO2 in neonates with low RrSO2 in the first week. Further research is needed to determine the effect of loading doses of caffeine and if increases in RrSO2 correlate with improved clinical kidney outcomes. IMPACT Caffeine administration is associated with increased renal tissue oxygenation in preterm neonates with low baseline values under 40%. The most significant renal tissue oxygenation changes occur in the first 3 h after IV caffeine administration. With recent studies suggesting low RrSO2 values in preterm neonates are associated with AKI, caffeine should be studied as a potential therapeutic for this common and complex morbidity in preterm neonates.","output":"Renal tissue oxygenation after caffeine administration in preterm neonates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The replication of poliovirus, a positive-stranded RNA virus, requires translation of the infecting genome followed by virus-encoded VPg and 3D polymerase-primed synthesis of a negative-stranded template. RNA sequences involved in the latter process are poorly defined. Since many sequences involved in picornavirus replication form RNA structures, we searched the genome, other than the untranslated regions, for predicted local secondary structural elements and identified a 61-nucleotide (nt) stem-loop in the region encoding the 2C protein. Covariance analysis suggested the structure was well conserved in the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae. Site-directed mutagenesis, disrupting the structure without affecting the 2C product, destroyed genome viability and suggested that the structure was required in the positive sense for function. Recovery of revertant viruses suggested that integrity of the structure was critical for function, and analysis of replication demonstrated that nonviable mutants did not synthesize negative strands. Our conclusion, that this RNA secondary structure constitutes a novel poliovirus cis-acting replication element (CRE), is supported by the demonstration that subgenomic replicons bearing lethal mutations in the native structure can be restored to replication competence by the addition of a second copy of the 61-nt wild-type sequence at another location within the genome. This poliovirus CRE functionally resembles an element identified in rhinovirus type 14 (K. L. McKnight and S. M. Lemon, RNA 4:1569-1584, 1998) and the cardioviruses (P. E. Lobert, N. Escriou, J.

Here, we analyzed a large mixed cohort of immunocompromised patients with PcP, with regard to clinical course and treatment, and aimed at identifying predictors of outcome. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective analysis in a tertiary care institution across 17 years. Diagnosis of PcP required typical clinical features and microbiological confirmation of Pneumocystis jirovecii. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were collected from patient records. RESULTS: A total of 52,364 specimens from 7504 patients were sent for microbiological assessment (3653 with clinical suspicion of Pneumocystis pneumonia). PcP was confirmed in 240 patients, about half of them HIV positive (52%). The remaining subjects were either solid organ transplant recipients (16.3%) or suffered from malignancy (15.8%) or autoimmune diseases (11.7%). Of note, 95% of patients with PcP were not receiving chemoprophylaxis. Overall in-hospital mortality was 25.4%, increasing to 58% if ICU admission was required. Multivariable regression identified lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 1.17 (95% CI 1.09C1.27), p < 0.0001). Mortality in LDH quartiles increased from 8% to 49%, and a cutoff value of 495 U/L predicted mortality with sensitivity and specificity of 70%. With regard to treatment, 40% of patients received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at doses that were lower than recommended, and these patients had a higher mortality risk (HR 1.80 (95% CI 1.10C3.44), p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: PcP remains a life-threatening disease among immunocompromised patients. About half of patients with PcP do not have HIV infection. Initial LDH values might serve as a stratifying tool to identify those patients at high risk of death among patients with HIV and without HIV infection.

The developed model was validated by experimentation and by published empirical data. Three stages are identified with respect to time for the variation of the IPE: a first stage dominated by the propagation and decay of the exhaled jet, a particles' redistribution stage, and a particles' removal stage. The inhaled dose is affected by the DV flow rate, cough velocity, particle diameter and distance between the occupants. The DV system with a flow rate of 100 L/s reduced significantly the inhaled dose during particle redistribution and removal stages decreasing the total inhaled dose by 83% compared to a flow rate of 50 L/s. IPE is higher when particle diameter is increased from 1 to 20 m due to the opposition of particle removal by the upward DV. A comparison between steady and transient modeling of the IPE showed that steady modeling captures the physics affecting particle spread due to HMRA but it over-predicts the inhaled dose. It is found that for a DV flow rate of 100 L/s and a cough velocity of 22 m/s during 1 s, and 1 m particles, the minimum required distance between the occupants for a threshold inhaled dose of 10(?5) kg is nearly 0.5 m by transient modeling while it is 2.15 m by steady state modeling.","output":"Transient transport model of particles resulting from high momentum respiratory activities: Inter-personal exposure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To compare corneal densitometry in a consecutive series of 52 endothelial keratoplasties (DMEK/DSAEK) using a Scheimpflug-based device after six months of follow-up. METHODS Corneal densitometry (CD) values of 102 eyes were divided into three main groups: 33 DMEKs, 19 DSAEKs, and 50 healthy eyes without previous ocular surgery. The CD values were then analyzed and compared between the groups. We measured three main layers in depth and four different concentric zones at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS In the DMEK group, total CD significantly decreased from 38.02  10.21 grayscale units (GSU) to 31.13  9.25 GSU (P < 0.01) between the first and the sixth month postoperative. In the DSAEK group, we found significant changes only between the first and three months after surgery (from 42.62  9.31 GSU to 38.71  10.53 GSU (P < 0.01). Regarding the concentric zones, CD in the DMEK group significantly decreased in the central zone from 33.55  12.07 GSU to 30.63  10.15 GSU (P < 0.01) and significantly increased in the periphery from 30.63  10.15 GSU to 36.72  9.37 GSU, (P < 0.01).

The infectious virus-contaminated carriers were subjected to wiping in the Wiperator per the standard. Following the use of negative control (J-Cloth)-, AHP-, or QAC-based wipes, recovery of residual infectious virus was assayed. In the case of the J-Cloth wipes (negative control), although removal of virus from inoculated carriers was extensive i.e., ~99% (1.9C3.5 log(10)) transfer of virus by these wipes to a secondary surface amounted to  2% (~3.8 log(10)) of the initial virus load.

Cellular binding and entry by all RV-C, which trigger these episodes, is mediated by the first extracellular domain (EC1) of cadherin-related protein 3 (CDHR3), a surface cadherin-like protein expressed primarily on the apical surfaces of ciliated airway epithelial cells. Although recombinant EC1 is a potent inhibitor of viral infection, there is no molecular description of this protein or its binding site on RV-C. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (EM) data resolving the EC1 and EC1+2 domains of human CDHR3 complexed with viral isolate C15a. Structure-suggested residues contributing to required interfaces on both EC1 and C15a were probed and identified by mutagenesis studies with four different RV-C genotypes. In contrast to most other rhinoviruses, which bind intercellular adhesion molecule 1 receptors via a capsid protein VP1-specific fivefold canyon feature, the CDHR3 EC1 contacts C15a, and presumably all RV-Cs, in a unique cohesive footprint near the threefold vertex, encompassing residues primarily from viral protein VP3, but also from VP1 and VP2. The EC1+2 footprint on C15a is similar to that of EC1 alone but shows that steric hindrance imposed by EC2 would likely prevent multiprotein binding by the native receptor at any singular threefold vertex.

A single surgeon performed 43 SPA-LAVH (cases) between May 2008 and February 2009, and 43 conventional LAVH between September 2005 and April 2008 (controls). Data of the SPA-LAVH cases were collected prospectively into our data registry and we reviewed the data of controls on chart. RESULTS The demographic parameters, except a history of vaginal delivery, were comparable between the two groups. The SPA group was associated with a history of fewer vaginal deliveries (SPA, 63%; conventional, 84%; p = 0.03). The two groups were comparable with respect to indications for surgery, failed cases from planned procedures, cases requiring additional procedures, and cases needing transfusion. The operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), drop in hemoglobin preoperatively to postoperative day 1, and postoperative hospital stay were comparable between both groups. SPA-LAVH was associated with reduced postoperative pain. The VAS-based pain scores 24 h (SPA, 2.5  0.7; conventional, 3.5  0.8; p < 0.01) and 36 h after surgery (SPA, 1.7  1.2; conventional, 2.9  1.1; p < 0.01) were lower in the SPA group.

Our objective was to evaluate the perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and its repercussions on the emotional well-being of the Colombian population. METHODS: We performed a Twitter metrics and trend analysis. Initially, in the trend analysis, we calculated the average duration in hours of the 20 most popular trending topics of the day in Colombia and we grouped them into trends related to COVID-19 and unrelated trends. Subsequently, we identified dates of events associated with the pandemic relevant to the country, and they were related to the behaviour of the trends studied. Additionally, we did an exploratory analysis of these, selected the tweets with the greatest reach and categorised them in an inductive way to analyse them qualitatively. RESULTS: Issues not related to COVID-19 were more far-reaching than those related to coronavirus. However, a rise in these issues was seen on some dates consistent with important events in Colombia. We found expressions of approval and disapproval, solidarity and accusation. Inductively, we identified categories of informative tweets, humour, fear, stigma and discrimination, politics and entities, citizen complaints, and self-care and optimism.

Eighty-four patients (79%) had at least moderate ARDS, 88 patients (83%) were mechanically ventilated, 35 patients (33%) received vvECMO. Forty-three patients (40%) died during their hospital stay. Twelve patients (11%) showed potentially lethal arrhythmias (six ventricular tachycardia, six significant bradycardia). Atrial fibrillation occurred in 27 patients (25%). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, duration of hospitalization was associated with the occurrence of potentially lethal arrhythmias (p = 0.006). There was no association between possible predictive factors and the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Invasive ventilation, antipsychotics, and the QT(c) interval were independently associated with acute in-hospital mortality, but this was not arrhythmia-driven as there was no association between the occurrence of arrhythmias and mortality.

A gender effect was observed in the score of \\"Perceived Helplessness\\", the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = 0.37, P = 0.003, Spearman's correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.","output":"Immediate psychological distress in quarantined patients with COVID-19 and its association with peripheral inflammation: A mixed-method study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, access to safe Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WaSH) services play an essential role in safeguarding the health and well-being of individuals and communities This study focuses on the assessment of WaSH Practices in Ogun State, Nigeria A survey was carried out with a total of 500 questionnaires administered evenly in 5 selected Local Governments Areas (LGAs) based on population, landmass, spatial location, and distribution The convenience sampling technique was used to select locations within the study areas The evaluation of WaSH practices was based on the availability of treated water, methods of waste disposal, sanitation and hygiene-related facilities, and awareness program in the communities, respectively The result shows that 61 2 % of the respondents have access to treated water Thirty-six percent of the respondents agreed to the use of open dumping system for their waste disposal, 24 6% use collection trucks while the rest bury or burn their wastes Forty-five percent of the respondents are unaware and unexposed to hygienic conditions The WaSH standard attained by these communities implies an average healthy living standard for the people, which complies with the data obtained from health centers showing the rate of compliance associated with WaSH related ailments The results of this study provide useful information on the consequences of poor hygiene practices and sanitation facilities for both residents and authorities The data can serve as a blueprint to government or private organizations working towards upgrading standard of WaSH practices, which would assist in providing appropriate facilities towards enforcing safe hygiene practices at all levels against the spread of the current global pandemic-COVID-19","output":"Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Practices in Ogun State: Impacts and Implications for Post-COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As Canada faces the threat of the new coronavirus spreading within its borders, there are important communication lessons to recall from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, say infectious disease experts Canada recently confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus that has infected thousands in China, spread to other countries, and led to the deaths of more than 100 people There are now more confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in China than there were cases of SARS in 2003 It appears there may still be gaps in communication between public health and front line staff","output":"Communication, transparency key as Canada faces new coronavirus threat: CMAJ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) genome has 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF is translated from the full-length genomic mRNA while the remaining ORFs are translated from eight subgeomic RNAs (sgRNAs). In this study, we designed small interference RNAs (siRNAs) targeting sgRNA 2, 3 and 7 and tested their efficiency and specificity in silencing the protein translated from the targeted sgRNA. Our results demonstrated that siRNA 7 could inhibit sgRNA 7, which showed 19/19 nucleotides (nt) matching, and sgRNA 8, which showed 18/19 nt matching; but, it did not inhibit the full-length genomic mRNA which showed 17/19 nt matching. Overall, each of the siRNAs can inhibit the targeted sgRNA without affecting the full-length genomic mRNA or the other sgRNAs that showed mismatch of two or more nt. Thus, siRNA could be designed so as to knockdown the expression of viral protein(s) from a targeted sgRNA during viral infection, thereby allowing the contribution of individual viral proteins to viral infection to be delineated. When Vero E6 cells expressing siRNA 2, 3 or 7 were infected with SARS-CoV, a significant reduction in the yield of progeny virus was observed. Indirect immunofluorescence assays showed that in the infected cells expressing each of the siRNAs, there was aspecific silencing of S, 3a and 7a, respectively, but the expression of nucleocapsid protein was not affected. Thus, our data suggests that the accessory proteins, i.e. 3a and 7a, could play an important role during the replication cycle of the SARS-CoV.","output":"Inhibition of SARS-CoV replication cycle by small interference RNAs silencing specific SARS proteins, 7a/7b, 3a/3b and S"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: School and daycare closures were enforced as measures to confine the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, based on the assumption that young children may play a key role in severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread. Given the grave consequences of contact restrictions for children, a better understanding of their contribution to the COVID-19 pandemic is of great importance. Objective: To describe the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children aged 1 to 10 years, compared with a corresponding parent of each child, in a population-based sample. Design, Setting, and Participants: This large-scale, multicenter, cross-sectional investigation (the COVID-19 BaW study) enrolled children aged 1 to 10 years and a corresponding parent between April 22 and May 15, 2020, in southwest Germany. Exposures: Potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were infection and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunofluorescence tests. Discordant results were clarified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, a second enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or an in-house Luminex-based assay. Results: This study included 4964 participants: 2482 children (median age, 6 [range, 1-10] years; 1265 boys [51.0%]) and 2482 parents (median age, 40 [range, 23-66] years; 615 men [24.8%]). Two participants (0.04%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was low in parents (1.8% [95% CI, 1.2-2.4%]) and 3-fold lower in children (0.6% [95% CI, 0.3-1.0%]). Among 56 families with at least 1 child or parent with seropositivity, the combination of a parent with seropositivity and a corresponding child with seronegativity was 4.3 (95% CI, 1.19-15.52) times higher than the combination of a parent who was seronegative and a corresponding child with seropositivity. We observed virus-neutralizing activity for 66 of 70 IgG-positive serum samples (94.3%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a period of lockdown in southwest Germany was particularly low in children aged 1 to 10 years. Accordingly, it is unlikely that children have boosted the pandemic. This SARS-CoV-2 prevalence study, which appears to be the largest focusing on children, is instructive for how ad hoc mass testing provides the basis for rational political decision-making in a pandemic.","output":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children and Their Parents in Southwest Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract BACKGROUD & AIMS: Although SARS-CoV-2 infects gastrointestinal tissues, little is known about the roles of gut commensal microbes in susceptibility to and severity of infection. We investigated changes in fecal microbiomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and associations with severity and fecal shedding of virus. METHODS We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses of fecal samples from 15 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, from February 5 through March 17, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 or 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge; disease was categorized as mild (no radiographic evidence of pneumonia), moderate (pneumonia was present), severe (respiratory rate 30/min, or oxygen saturation 93% when breathing ambient air), or critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or organ failure requiring intensive care). We compared microbiome data with those from 6 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 15 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed gut microbiome profiles in association with disease severity and changes in fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in fecal microbiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and depletion of beneficial commensals, at time of hospitalization and at all timepoints during hospitalization. Depleted symbionts and gut dysbiosis persisted even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (determined from throat swabs) and resolution of respiratory symptoms. The baseline abundance of Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum, and Clostridium hathewayi correlated with COVID-19 severity; there was an inverse correlation between abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (an anti-inflammatory bacterium) and disease severity. Over the course of hospitalization, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides massiliensis, and Bacteroides ovatus, which downregulate expression of ACE2 in murine gut, correlated inversely with SARS-CoV-2 load in fecal samples from patients. CONCLUSIONS In a pilot study of 15 patients with COVID-19, we found persistent alterations in the fecal microbiome during the time of hospitalization, compared with controls. Fecal microbiota alterations were associated with fecal levels of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity. Strategies to alter the intestinal microbiota might reduce disease severity.","output":"Alterations in Gut Microbiota of Patients With COVID-19 During Time of Hospitalization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants continues to shape the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. The detection and rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (lineage B.1.1.529) in Botswana and South Africa became a global concern because it contained 15 mutations in the spike protein immunogenic receptor binding domain and was less neutralized by sera derived from vaccinees compared to the previously dominant Delta variant. To investigate if Omicron is more likely than Delta to cause infections in vaccinated persons, we analyzed 37,877 nasal swab PCR tests conducted from 12-26 December 2021 and calculated the test positivity rates for each variant by vaccination status. We found that the positivity rate among unvaccinated persons was higher for Delta (5.2%) than Omicron (4.5%). We found similar results in persons who received a single vaccine dose. Conversely, our results show that Omicron had higher positivity rates than Delta among those who received two doses within five months (Omicron = 4.7% vs. Delta = 2.6%), two doses more than five months ago (4.2% vs. 2.9%), and three vaccine doses (2.2% vs. 0.9%). Our estimates of Omicron positivity rates in persons receiving one or two vaccine doses were not significantly lower than unvaccinated persons but were 49.7% lower after three doses. In comparison, the reduction in Delta positivity rates from unvaccinated to 2 vaccine doses was 45.6-49.6% and to 3 vaccine doses was 83.2%. Despite the higher positivity rates for Omicron in vaccinated persons, we still found that 91.2% of the Omicron infections in our study occurred in persons who were eligible for 1 or more vaccine doses at the time of PCR testing. In conclusion, escape from vaccine-induced immunity likely contributed to the rapid rise in Omicron infections.","output":"Rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is associated with an infection advantage over Delta in vaccinated persons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 is growing worldwide It is necessary to study features of prevalence and clinical signs in pediatric population considering the fact that this disease is rather new The aim of the study is to analyze the features of prevalence and clinical signs of pathologic process of COVID-19 in pediatric patients according to the results of practical experience of primary care medical facility (Childrens City Outpatients Clinic  133) under the conditions of pandemia Methods Pediatricians of Childrens City Outpatients Clinic  133 have examined certain categories of pediatric patients (especially who came from abroad or contacted with infection) for the presence of a new coronaviral infection in February 2020 Doctors have been examining children with catarrhal symptoms and hyperthermia since March 2020 The survey of children in February and March was carried out in accordance with algorithms (uniform for adults and children) approved by the Moscow City Health Department Later, the survey was carried out in accordance with the guidelines for children prepared by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation The throat and nose swabs on SARS-CoV-2 were performed for all patients on the 1st, 11th and 13th day of the disease Results 1,900 children (or 3 1% of total attached pediatric population) have been examined in our outpatients clinic with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method on the presence of the new coronavirus RNA since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia The course of disease was analyzed in first 100 patients with the confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis: 58 (58%) boys and 42 (42%) girls In 81% of cases we revealed the source of infection, in 19% - we did not The disease was asymptomatic in 11 (11%) children examined after the contact with ill relatives;89% had mild COVID-19 disease with light catarrhal signs The most numerous group of patients who had COVID-19 consisted of children over 10 years of age (42%);in 20% of cases it was pupils from 7 to 10 years old Smell disorders were reported in children over the age of 10 in 50% of all cases Conclusion New coronaviral infection COVID-19 in children is taking mild course, without complications, under the ?mask? of common viral infection Thus, it is unknown either those who have undergone COVID-19 asymptomatically remain healthy or they need special rehabilitation The timely development of clear algorithm with step-by-step instructions for various situations for every health professional is crucial during these difficult times ܧѧݧߧ  ާڧ ѧ֧ ڧݧ ݧէ֧, ڧߧڧڧӧѧߧߧ ܧߧѧӧڧ SARS-CoV-2, ӧ٧ӧѧڧ COVID-19 ڧӧѧ  ѧܧ,  ҧݧ֧٧ߧ ߧӧѧ, ߧ֧ҧէڧާ ڧ٧֧ߧڧ ҧ֧ߧߧ֧ ѧѧߧ֧ߧڧ  ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧ ܧѧڧߧ,  ѧߧ  է֧ܧ ݧڧ ֧ݧ - ߧ ߧӧѧߧڧ ֧٧ݧѧ ѧܧڧ֧ܧ ѧҧ ާ֧էڧڧߧܧ ԧѧߧڧ٧ѧڧ ֧ӧڧߧԧ ާ֧էڧܧ-ѧߧڧѧߧԧ ٧ӧ֧ߧ (ݧڧܧݧڧߧڧܧ; ?  133 ?)  ݧӧڧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ڧӧѧ ҧ֧ߧߧ ѧѧߧ֧ߧڧ  ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧ ܧѧڧߧ ѧݧԧڧ֧ܧԧ ֧ COVID-19  ѧڧ֧ߧ է֧ܧԧ ӧ٧ѧ ֧է  ֧ӧѧݧ 2020  ֧էڧѧ  ?  133 ? ҧݧ֧էӧѧݧ ߧ ߧѧݧڧڧ ߧӧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ֧է֧ݧ֧ߧߧ ܧѧ֧ԧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ է֧ܧԧ ӧ٧ѧ,  ڧާ֧ߧߧ ڧ֧ѧӧڧ ڧ-٧ ҧ֧ا, ܧߧѧܧߧ  ҧݧߧ, ֧اէ ӧ֧ԧ  ֧ާ֧ۧߧ ѧԧѧ; ާѧ 2020  ӧѧ ҧݧ֧էӧѧݧ է֧֧  ܧѧѧѧݧߧާ ӧݧ֧ߧڧާ  ԧڧ֧֧ާڧ֧ ҧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ է֧֧  ֧ӧѧݧ  ާѧ ӧէڧݧ  ӧ֧ӧڧ  ӧ֧اէ֧ߧߧާ ֧ѧѧާ֧ߧ ٧էѧӧѧߧ֧ߧڧ ԧէ ܧӧ ѧݧԧڧާѧާ, ֧էڧߧާ էݧ ӧ٧ݧ  է֧֧; ݧ֧է֧ ҧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ֧ӧݧݧ ԧݧѧߧ ާ֧էڧ֧ܧڧ ֧ܧާ֧ߧէѧڧ, էԧӧݧ֧ߧߧ ڧߧڧ֧ӧ ٧էѧӧѧߧ֧ߧڧ ڧۧܧ ֧է֧ѧڧ էݧ է֧֧ ֧ ҧڧާѧ֧ڧѧݧ ߧ SARS-CoV-2 ڧ ٧֧ӧ  ߧ ӧէڧݧ ѧڧ֧ߧѧ  1-, 11-  13- է֧ߧ ҧݧ֧٧ߧ ֧٧ݧѧ  ߧѧѧݧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ COVID-19  ڧ  ߧѧ֧ ݧڧܧݧڧߧڧܧ է 20 ѧ֧ݧ 2020  ާ֧է ݧڧާ֧ѧ٧ߧ ֧ߧ ֧ѧܧڧ () ҧݧ֧էӧѧߧ 1900 է֧֧ (3,1% ӧ֧ԧ ڧܧ֧ݧ֧ߧߧԧ է֧ܧԧ ߧѧ֧ݧ֧ߧڧ) ߧ ߧѧݧڧڧ  ߧӧԧ ܧߧѧӧڧ ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ڧӧѧߧ ֧֧ߧڧ ҧݧ֧٧ߧ  ֧ӧ 100 ѧڧ֧ߧ  էӧ֧اէ֧ߧߧ COVID-19: 58 (58%) ާѧݧڧܧ  42 (42%) է֧ӧܧ  81% է֧֧ ҧ ѧߧӧݧ֧ ڧߧڧ ٧ѧѧا֧ߧڧ,  19% է֧֧ ӧӧڧ ڧߧڧ ٧ѧѧا֧ߧڧ ߧ էѧݧ  11 (11%) է֧֧, ҧݧ֧էӧѧߧߧ  ܧߧѧܧ  ҧݧߧ էӧ֧ߧߧڧܧ, ҧݧ֧٧ߧ ֧ܧѧݧ ҧ֧ڧާާߧ; 89% ާ֧ѧݧ ݧ֧ԧܧ ֧֧ߧڧ COVID-19  ߧ֧٧ߧѧڧ֧ݧߧާ ܧѧѧѧݧߧާ ӧݧ֧ߧڧާ ѧާ ާߧԧڧݧ֧ߧߧ ԧ ѧڧ֧ߧ, ֧֧ߧ֧ڧ COVID-19, ѧӧڧݧ է֧ ѧ 10 ݧ֧ (42%):  20% ݧѧ֧ ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧڧާ ҧݧ ܧݧߧڧܧ  7 է 10 ݧ֧ ѧ֧ߧڧ ҧߧߧڧ,  էѧߧߧ ߧѧҧݧէ֧ߧڧ, ٧ѧ֧ԧڧڧӧѧߧ  է֧֧  ӧ٧ѧ ѧ 10 ݧ֧  50% ݧѧ֧ ѧܧݧ֧ߧڧ ӧѧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧѧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ COVID-19  է֧֧ ֧ܧѧ֧  ݧ֧ԧܧ ާ, ҧ֧ ݧاߧ֧ߧڧ,  ?ާѧܧ? ҧߧ ӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ, էߧѧܧ ߧ ڧ٧ӧ֧ߧ, ѧ ݧ ٧էӧާ , ܧ ֧֧ߧ֧ COVID-19 ҧ֧ڧާާߧ, ڧݧ էݧ ߧڧ ߧاߧ ֧ڧѧݧߧѧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ ڧڧ֧ܧ ӧѧاߧ ӧݧ֧ ӧ֧ӧ֧ާ֧ߧߧѧ ѧ٧ѧҧܧ ֧ܧԧ ѧݧԧڧާ  ѧԧӧ ڧߧܧڧ֧ էݧ ܧѧاէԧ էߧڧܧ  ѧ٧ݧڧߧ ڧѧڧ  ֧ڧ ӧ֧ߧߧ ԧӧߧ","output":"Primary Observational Results on Children Who Have Been Exposed to COVID-19 in Moscow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients are at high risk of severe COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES This study assessed the validity of early capnography as a predictive factor for ROSC and survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims with an underlying nonshockable rhythm. DESIGN Retrospective observational study. SETTING/PATIENTS During a 2-year observational period, data from 2223 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims within the city of Vienna were analysed. The focus was on the following patients: age more than 18 years, an underlying nonshockable rhythm, and advanced airway management within the first 15 min of advanced life support with subsequent capnography. INTERVENTION No specific intervention was set in this observational study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The first measured ETCO2, assessed immediately after placement of an advanced airway, was used for further analysis. The primary outcome was defined as sustained ROSC, and the secondary outcome was 30-day survival. RESULTS A total of 526 patients met the inclusion criteria. These were stratified into three groups according to initial ETCO2 values (<20, 20 to 45, >45 mmHg). Baseline data and resuscitation factors were similar among all groups. The odds of sustained ROSC and survival were significantly higher for patients presenting with higher values of initial ETCO2 (>45 mmHg): 3.59 [95% CI, 2.19 to 5.85] P = 0.001 and 5.02 [95% CI, 2.25 to 11.23] P = 0.001, respectively. On the contrary ETCO2 levels less than 20 mmHg were associated with significantly poorer outcomes. CONCLUSION Patients with a nonshockable out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who presented with higher values of initial ETCO2 had an increased chance of sustained ROSC and survival.

In the field of interventional neuroradiology (INR), virtual clinics are an uncommon practice with minimal literature to support its use. Our objective was to report prospective, single-centre data regarding patient and physician experience with virtual INR clinics for routine follow-up appointments. METHODS We surveyed all patients that participated in a virtual INR clinic follow-up appointment at our hospital over a 3 month period. Information gathered included length of appointment delays (ie, wait times), length of appointment times, overall satisfaction, and perceived safety metrics. A survey was also sent out to all physicians who participated in virtual clinics with similar questions. RESULTS 118/122 patients and 6/6 physicians completed the survey. Wait times before previous in-person appointments were perceived to be much longer than virtual appointments, whereas in-person appointment times were longer. 112/118 (94.9%) patients and 4/6 (67%) physicians reported general satisfaction with their virtual clinic experience. There were 8/118 patients who felt their conditions could not be safely assessed virtually, compared with 1/6 (17%) physicians. Lastly, 72.2% of patients reported that they would prefer virtual or telephone visits in the future for non-urgent follow-up, and 5/6 (83%) of physicians reported the same. CONCLUSION Virtual INR clinics are more efficient and are preferred among patients and physicians for non-urgent follow-up appointments.

The present study aimed to investigate the associated factors of financial concerns and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020 using face-to-face interviews in six disadvantaged neighborhoods (slums) in Dhaka. Individuals were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire consisting of questions assessing socio-demographics, lifestyle, financial well-being relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and PTSD. Results: Four-hundred-and-thirty-five individuals (male = 54.7%; mean age = 45.0  12.0 years; age range = 18C85 years) participated. Most (96.3%) reported that their household income decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors associated with decreased household incomes included female gender, primary education, joblessness, food scarcity and depression. Depression symptoms were linked to female gender, joblessness, divorce, living in a joint family, excessive sleep and smoking. Low incomes, excessive sleep, joblessness and food scarcity were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. In contrast, less sleep appeared protective against PTSD.

The C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) is a novel inflammation-based prognostic score. This study was performed to examine the associations of the preoperative CAR with clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) after curative resection. METHODS We retrospectively assessed the preoperative CAR in 184 patients who underwent curative resection for CRLM from November 2001 to January 2018 at Kumamoto University (Kumamoto, Japan). The optimal cutoff level of the preoperative CAR was determined by survival classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. We compared clinicopathological factors and prognoses between the high-CAR and low-CAR groups. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs), controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS A higher preoperative CAR was associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p < 0.0001) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.003). Applying survival CART analysis, the high-CAR group comprised 33 patients (17.9%). In the multivariate analyses, a high CAR was independently associated with shorter OS (HR, 2.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-4.72; p = 0.0004) and RFS (HR, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.49; p = 0.040). A high CAR was associated with a large tumor size, high serum carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, high intraoperative blood loss, and more postoperative complications. CONCLUSION A high preoperative CAR is associated with shorter OS and RFS and might serve as a prognostic marker for patients with CRLM after curative resection.","output":"Preoperative C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio and clinical outcomes after resection of colorectal liver metastases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pseudomonas fluorescens is an opportunistic, psychotropic pathogen that can live in different environments, such as plant, soil, or water surfaces, and it is associated with food spoilage.

Thirty-two samples were simultaneously tested with the AK-BDMAX PCR and the original AK-PCR from which it was developed. A thermal-shock pretreatment protocol was validated. The analytical parameters were similar to those obtained with the previous in-house AK-PCR method. We then assessed the performance of the AK-BDMAX PCR for routine testing on 40 clinical samples, mostly corneal scrapings. Frozen ready-to-use in-house PCR premixes were stable over eight months. Overall, 34 (85%) of the 40 clinical samples were considered to be true negatives, four (10%) were considered to correspond to probable AK and two (5%) were considered to correspond to possible AK.","output":"Development, optimization, and validation of a multiplex real-time PCR assay on the BDMAX platform for routine diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to highlight SARS-COV-2 mutations which are associated with increased or decreased viral virulence.

We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million.

As Brazil and many parts of the world are marked by regional, cultural, and social inequalities, risk communication and assimilation of protection recommendations by the public may be erratic, hampering the proper measurement of their effectiveness. SCOPE AND APPROACH: Even though transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by foods is unlikely, this work aimed to evaluate the population's adherence to the recommended food hygiene and personal protection measures to prevent COVID-19. An online survey containing questions on food hygiene and personal protection was publicly disseminated via internet and social networks. Data from 3000 respondents were collected and discussed herein. Key findings and conclusions: Most respondents adopted the recommended hygienic and personal protection measures to avoid contamination with SARS-CoV-2. However, some important flaws were detected, such as lack of use of face masks when in public places (6%), improper hand washing and sanitizing (10C12%) and use of incorrect products for food or environment cleaning and sanitization (28%), indicating that adequate risk communication and preventive recommendations must continue in order to avoid contamination with the coronavirus.

METHODS We retrieved data from the national database on SARS-CoV-2 infections. We studied in-family transmission. The level of viral load was categorized as high, moderate, or low based on the cycle threshold values. RESULTS We studied 203 SARS-CoV-2-infected children (median age: 11 years; range: 6 days to 18.4 years); 111 (54.7%) had an asymptomatic infection. Among the 92 children (45.3%) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 24 (26.1%) were hospitalized. Infants <1 year were more likely to develop COVID-19 (19.5% of all COVID-19 cases) (P-value = 0.001). There was no significant difference between viral load and age, sex, underlying condition, fever and hospitalization, as well as between type of SARS-CoV-2 infection and age, sex, underlying condition and viral load. Transmission from a household member accounted for 132 of 178 (74.2%) children for whom the source of infection was identified. An adult member with COVID-19 was the first case in 125 (66.8%) family clusters. Child-to-adult transmission was found in one occasion only. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 infection is mainly asymptomatic or mild during childhood. Adults appear to play a key role in spread of the virus in families. Most children have moderate or high viral loads regardless of age, symptoms or severity of infection. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of children in the ongoing pandemic and particularly in light of schools reopening and the need to prioritize groups for vaccination, when COVID-19 vaccines will be available.","output":"Children and Adolescents With SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Epidemiology, Clinical Course and Viral Loads."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-exos) have been shown to have therapeutic effects in experimental periodontitis, their drawbacks, such as low yield and limited efficacy, have hampered their clinical application. These drawbacks can be largely reduced by replacing the traditional 2D culture system with a 3D system. However, the potential function of MSC-exos produced by 3D culture (3D-exos) in periodontitis remains elusive. This study showed that compared with MSC-exos generated via 2D culture (2D-exos), 3D-exos showed enhanced anti-inflammatory effects in a ligature-induced model of periodontitis by restoring the reactive T helper 17 (Th17) cell/Treg balance in inflamed periodontal tissues. Mechanistically, 3D-exos exhibited greater enrichment of miR-1246, which can suppress the expression of Nfat5, a key factor that mediates Th17 cell polarization in a sequence-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that recovery of the Th17 cell/Treg balance in the inflamed periodontium by the local injection of 3D-exos attenuated experimental colitis. Our study not only showed that by restoring the Th17 cell/Treg balance through the miR-1246/Nfat5 axis, the 3D culture system improved the function of MSC-exos in the treatment of periodontitis, but also it provided a basis for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by restoring immune responses in the inflamed periodontium.","output":"Exosomes derived from 3D-cultured MSCs improve therapeutic effects in periodontitis and experimental colitis and restore the Th17 cell/Treg balance in inflamed periodontium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To evaluate the apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) deposition patterns on the kidneys of children with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and Henoch-Sch?nlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) and to investigate the clinical usefulness of serum and/or urinary AIM levels as biomarkers for the disease activity. METHODS Immunohistochemical study was performed in the kidneys of 37 patients with IgAN and 10 patients with HSPN. Serum and urinary AIM levels in the patients and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results were compared with clinical features. RESULTS In patients with IgAN and HSPN, AIM expression was observed in various areas, including the glomerular mesangial and capillary areas, the proximal and distal tubular epithelial cells, and on infiltrating macrophages in the glomeruli and interstitial areas. Serum and urinary AIM levels were significantly elevated in these patients compared with the HCs. Urinary AIM levels were positively correlated with the histological severity and degree of proteinuria and hematuria as well as urinary 2 microglobulin and urinary N-acetyl--D-glucosaminidase levels.

Using multidetector computed tomography and three-dimensional reconstruction provides meticulous characterization of the anatomy in pediatric patients. We confirmed that her left A4+5 artery arose from her left pulmonary artery medial to A6. Her left pulmonary artery was divided just proximal to the A6 origin before the lobes were separated safely. We took advantage of using a stapler to divide the fissureless thick parenchyma. Perioperative diagnosis was congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.

The aim of this paper is to describe the experience of the first month of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a hospital haemodialysis (HD) unit serving the district of Madrid with the second highest incidence of COVID-19 (almost 1,000 patients in 100,000h). In the form of a diary, we present the actions undertaken, the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and health staff, some clinical characteristics and the results of screening all the patients in the unit. We started with 90 patients on HD: 37 (41.1%) had COVID-19, of whom 17 (45.9%) were diagnosed through symptoms detected in triage or during the session, and 15 (40.5%) through subsequent screening of those who, until that time, had not undergone SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Fever was the most frequent symptom, 50% had lymphopenia and 18.4% <95% O2 saturation. Sixteen (43.2%) patients required hospital admission and 6 (16.2%) died. We found a cluster of infection per shift and also among those using public transport. In terms of staff, of the 44 people involved, 15 (34%) had compatible symptoms, 4 (9%) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 PCR cases by occupational health, 9 (20%) required some period of sick leave, temporary disability to work (ILT), and 5 were considered likely cases. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a high prevalence of COVID-19 with a high percentage detected by screening; hence the need for proactive diagnosis to stop the pandemic.

We combine the IRAC, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and Two Micron All Sky Survey catalogs and our previous results from another outer Galaxy survey and identify a total of 47,338 young stellar objects (YSOs) across the field spanning >180 in Galactic longitude. Using the DBSCAN method on the combined catalog, we identify 618 clusters or aggregations of YSOs having five or more members. We identify 10,476 class I, 29,604 class II, and 7325 anemic class II/class III YSOs. The ratio of YSOs identified as members of clusters was 25,528/47,338, or 54%. We found that 100 of the clusters identified have previously measured distances in the WISE H II survey. We used these distances in our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of the YSOs in these clusters, of which 96 had YSOs with <3&#963; fits.

In vitro translation of synthetic transcripts generated from this plasmid was not accompanied by detectable processing activity of the nascent polypeptide unless the translation was carried out in the presence of microsomal membrane preparations. The processed products so obtained closely resembled in size those expected from cleavage at predicted glutamine-serine (Q/S) dipeptides and included a protein with a size of 35 kDa (p35) that corresponds to the predicted size of 3CLP. Efficient processing was dependent on the presence of membranes during translation; processing was found to occur when microsomes were added posttranslationally, but only after extended periods of incubation. C-terminal deletion analysis of the encoded polyprotein fragment revealed that cleavage activity was dependent on the presence of most but not all of the downstream and adjacent hydrophobic region MP2. Dysfunctional mutagenesis of the putative active-site cysteine residue of 3CLP to either serine or alanine resulted in polypeptides that were impaired for processing, while mutagenesis at the predicted Q/S release sites implicated them in the release of the p35 protein. Processed products of the wild-type protein were active in trans cleavage assays, which were used to demonstrate that the IBV 3CLP is sensitive to inhibition by both serine and cysteine protease class-specific inhibitors.

We assessed temporal changes and geographical differences in risk perceptions and precautionary behaviors in response to H1N1 influenza. METHODS: 1,290 US adults completed an online survey on risk perceptions, interests in pharmaceutical interventions (preventive intervention and curative intervention), and engagement in precautionary activities (information seeking activities and taking quarantine measures) in response to H1N1 influenza between April 28 and May 27 2009. Associations of risk perceptions and precautionary behaviors with respondents' sex, age, and household size were analyzed. Linear and quadratic time trends were assessed by regression analyses. Geographic differences in risk perception and precautionary behaviors were evaluated. Predictors of willingness to take pharmaceutical intervention were analyzed. RESULTS: Respondents from larger households reported stronger interest in taking medications and engaged in more precautionary activities, as would be normatively predicted. Perceived risk increased over time, whereas interest in pharmaceutical preventive interventions and the engagement in some precautionary activities decreased over time. Respondents who live in states with higher H1N1 incidence per population perceived a higher likelihood of influenza infection, but did not express greater interests in pharmaceutical interventions, nor did they engage in a higher degree of precautionary activities. Perceived likelihood of influenza infection, willingness to take medications and engagement in information seeking activities were higher for women than men.

We document that the issuance of HY bonds since February 2020 has been lower by historical standards in the EA than in the US. The Feds measures aimed at the HY segment, mainly the purchase of HY bond exchange traded funds (ETFs), could have reduced credit spreads and improved market liquidity, which in turn could have stimulated debt issuance. Alternatively, HY issuers in the EA may have faced better bank funding conditions due to the ECBs targeted longer term refinancing operations (TLTRO) and to other measures by national fiscal authorities, leading such issuers to substitute bank credit for bond finance.

According to the 2017 report of the European Commission in Mobility and Transport, the performance of all modes for passenger transport (roadways and airways) are reaching record highs. Although the benefits of the increased demand for mobility are substantial and welcome, an effort should be paid such as to ameliorate possible threatening side-effects that may also arise. As World Health Organization (WHO) denotes and as has been evident from the global COVID-19 epidemic outbreak, infectious diseases can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another under common exposure circumstances such as air transportation (especially long-haul airline connections) that may act as the medium for transmitting and spreading infectious diseases. In this paper, analytical and realistic models have been integrated, for providing evidence on the spread dynamics of infectious diseases that may face Europe through the airlines system. In particular, a detailed epidemiological model has been integrated with the airlines' and land transport network, able to simulate the epidemic spread of infectious diseases originated from distant locations. Additionally, a wide set of experiments and simulations have been conducted, providing results from detailed stress-tests covering both mild as well as aggressive cases of epidemic spreading scenarios. The results provide convincing evidence on the effectiveness that the European airports' system offer in controlling the emergence of epidemics, but also on the time and extent that controlling measures should be taken in order to break the chain of infections in realistic cases.","output":"Identification of critical airports for controlling global infectious disease outbreaks: Stress-tests focusing in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies are secreted into human milk of infected or vaccinated lactating women and might provide protection to the breastfed infant against COVID-19.

We analyzed 448 human milk samples of 28 lactating women vaccinated with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 as well as 82 human milk samples of 18 lactating women with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA in human milk were determined over a period of 70 days both after vaccination and infection. The amount of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA in human milk was similar after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection. After infection, the variability in IgA levels was higher than after vaccination. Two participants with detectable IgA prior to vaccination were analyzed separately and showed higher IgA levels following vaccination compared to both groups.

Insight in pathways associated with unfavourable outcome may lead to new treatment strategies. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to general ward or ICU who underwent serial blood sampling. To provide insight in the pathways involved in disease progression, associations were estimated between outcome risk and serial measurements of 64 biomarkers in potential important pathways of COVID-19 infection (inflammation, tissue damage, complement system, coagulation and fibrinolysis) using joint models combining Cox regression and linear mixed-effects models. For patients admitted to the general ward, the primary outcome was admission to the ICU or mortality (unfavourable outcome). For patients admitted to the ICU, the primary outcome was 12-week mortality. FINDINGS: A total of 219 patients were included: 136 (62%) on the ward and 119 patients (54%) on the ICU; 36 patients (26%) were included in both cohorts because they were transferred from general ward to ICU. On the general ward, 54 of 136 patients (40%) had an unfavourable outcome and 31 (23%) patients died. On the ICU, 54 out of 119 patients (45%) died. Unfavourable outcome on the general ward was associated with changes in concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (sRAGE), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and Pentraxin-3. Death on the ICU was associated with changes in IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, sRAGE, VCAM-1, Pentraxin-3, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, IL-1-receptor antagonist, CD14, procalcitonin, tumor necrosis factor alfa, tissue factor, complement component 5a, Growth arrest-specific 6, angiopoietin 2, and lactoferrin. Pathway analysis showed that unfavourable outcome on the ward was mainly driven by chemotaxis and interleukin production, whereas death on ICU was associated with a variety of pathways including chemotaxis, cell-cell adhesion, innate host response mechanisms, including the complement system, viral life cycle regulation, angiogenesis, wound healing and response to corticosteroids. INTERPRETATION: Clinical deterioration in patients with severe COVID-19 involves multiple pathways, including chemotaxis and interleukin production, but also endothelial dysfunction, the complement system, and immunothrombosis. Prognostic markers showed considerable overlap between general ward and ICU patients, but we identified distinct differences between groups that should be considered in the development and timing of interventional therapies in COVID-19.

As of March 2020, EMBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Science Direct/Elsevier, MEDLINE and CNKI were used for systematic literature retrieval to investigate the correlation between -catenin expression and BC. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager and Stata software. Fourteen studies were included, including 865 BC tissues and 106 controls. Combined ORs were identified with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) in a random- or fixed-effects model. We illustrated that there was a significant correlation between -catenin and BC, that there was abnormally high expression of -catenin in BC tissues compared with normal bladder tissues (P<0.05), and that the combined OR was 14.69[5.73, 37.65]. Furthermore, the aberrant expression rates of -catenin in high-grade and invasive bladder neoplasm tissues were greater than those in low-grade and non-muscle-invasive bladder tissues (P<0.05), and the combined ORs were 0.31[0.23, 0.43] and 0.21[0.15, 0.29].

We investigated the impact of public health guidelines and related behavioral changes on self-perceptions of communication abilities and psychosocial factors in this population. Method The Stroke Comeback Center, a community-based center for stroke and other brain trauma survivors with communication impairments, disseminated an online survey to current members to investigate changes in communication, social engagement, and quality of life. Results Participants (N = 50) reported a number of changes in their day-to-day activities that reflect the current social distancing guidelines, such as reduced outings into the community and fewer in-person conversations with those living outside one's home. Overall, feelings of connectedness to others and overall quality of life were reported to be decreased when compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas receptive language abilities and technology skills were reported to have improved. Perhaps most interestingly, certain behavioral changes (including healthy movement activities and participation in virtual programs) had specific relationships with perceived communication abilities and social engagement. Conclusions Changes in daily life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have had a tangible impact on self-perceived psychosocial elements (e.g., quality of life) and communication abilities among stroke and other brain trauma survivors.

The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19. METHODS: This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States. Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 g) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. Moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273 group. Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, including severe disease.

In one large case series, 5.0% of patients required an intensive care unit (ICU) and 1.4% died. Several models have been developed to assess decompensating patients. However, research examining their applicability to COVID-19 patients is limited. An accurate predictive model for patients at risk of decompensation is critical for health systems to optimally triage emergencies, care for patients, and allocate resources. METHODS: An early warning score (EWS) algorithm created within a large academic medical center, with methodology previously described, was applied to COVID-19 patients admitted to this institution. 122 COVID-19 patients were included. A decompensation event was defined as inpatient mortality or an unanticipated transfer to an ICU from an intermediate medical ward. The EWS was calculated at 12-hour and 24-hour intervals. RESULTS: Of 122 patients admitted with COVID-19, 28 had a decompensation event, yielding an event rate of 23.0%. 8 patients died, 13 transferred to the ICU, and 6 both transferred to the ICU and died. Decompensation within 12 and 24 hours were predicted with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.850 and 0.817, respectively. Using a three-tiered risk model, use of the customized EWS score for patients identified as high risk of decompensation had a positive predictive value of 44.4% and 11.1% and specificity of 99.3% and 99.6% and 12- and 24-hour intervals. Amongst medium-risk patients, the score had a specificity of 85.0% and 85.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This EWS allows for prediction of decompensation, defined as transfer to an ICU or death, in COVID-19 patients with excellent specificity and a high positive predictive value. Clinically, implementation of this score can help to identify patients before they decompensate in order to triage at time of presentation and allocate step-down beds, ICU beds, and treatments such as remdesivir.

Community pharmacists remain vital health professionals with unique roles in responding to symptoms, supplying medicines, and providing health promotion in the communities where they serve. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of knowledge and preparedness of community pharmacists in Zambia as frontline workers in curbing COVID-19. Method: This descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted among 300 registered community pharmacists in Zambia. A self-administered online questionnaire was used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 23. Results: From a total of 393 community pharmacists, 300 participated in the study indicating a response rate of 76.3%. 97% of the pharmacists knew the common signs and symptoms of COVID-19, 83% knew the national guidelines for screening criteria, and 93% were aware that a suspected case of COVID-19 presenting to the community pharmacy needed to be alerted to the national response team. Only 59% knew they needed to self-isolate and self-report should they experience symptoms of COVID-19. 85% stated that personal protective equipment was inadequate in the pharmacies they operated from. 60% of the pharmacists were prepared to participate in the frontline fight against COVID-19. Conclusion: Community pharmacists in Zambia are knowledgeable about COVID-19 signs and symptoms, including the technical guidelines on the screening and detection of suspected cases.

Information technology (IT) has been suggested as a solution to overcoming such barriers, though the development of evidence-based IT for dementia care is still developing. This project gathered stakeholder (e.g., providers, caregivers) perspectives on the development of a proposed IT solution to support community asset mapping that would allow families to self-assess their dementia-related service needs, educate them about available services, and link them with services they need in their community. This proposed IT would create a dementia resource database that relies on crowdsourced data from community stakeholders as well as relevant data mined from existing sources (e.g., CMS certified nursing home data). As part of the planning process, this project conducted qualitative interviews with providers and caregivers in four metro areas in Alabama and their surrounding rural communities to learn more about the content and features that stakeholders perceive as being most effective for the proposed technology. Stakeholders also discussed their experience of utilizing IT solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic to promote access and continuum of care when barriers to service intensified. Thematic findings provide detail on: 1) motivating factors among stakeholders to contribute crowdsourced data that support community members affected by dementia; 2) potential barriers to implementing IT for dementia support, based on experiences with IT use during COVID-19; and 3) how stakeholders envision IT to better connect community members with needed services.","output":"Developing Information Technologies to Promote Dementia e-Friendly Communities for COVID-19 and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In May 2020, the Navajo Native American Research Center for Health Partnership (Navajo NARCH) was scheduled to launch two summer programs: a 10 weeks-long Summer Research Enhancement Program (SREP) for undergraduate students to learn and practice health research methods and participate in a practicum experience, and a week-long Indigenous Summer Enhancement Program (ISEP) for high school students that introduces a range of health professions and develops leadership qualities.

Public health measures necessitated a rapid shift from traditional face to face lectures to largely online platforms following campus closures. The aim of this study is to characterize medical student use and perception of online medical education in Egypt as well as exploring the efficacy of different e-learning modalities. Additionally, many barriers and opportunities as perceived by students are reviewed to inform future educational improvements. METHODS: A 29-item online survey was created on google forms and distributed by social media to medical students across 26 Egyptian medical schools. The survey was administered from August 20th, 2021, to September 5th, 2021. The survey consisted of a mixture of questions style. The medical students were asked about their experiences with online medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as medical students anxiety, perceived academic performance, and obstacles related to online education. RESULTS: Of the 4935 responses collected, 43.4% (n = 2140) of respondents were women; 56.6% (n = 2795) were men. Medical students from private medical schools were 13.0% (n = 644), whereas 87.0% (n = 4291) were from public medical schools. 54.6% of students reported that online education is not as effective as face-to-face education. There was a significant rise in hours spent by medical students on online medical education compared to before COVID-19 pandemic. More than half of students (63%) agreed that online recorded video tutorials (e.g., YouTube) were the most effective form of online medical education. CONCLUSION: The shift to online education has significantly impacted medical students in Egypt. Medical students reported various limitations and challenges of online medical education, which must be addressed considering the potential benefits of online platforms over traditional face to face learning. The results of this nationwide study provide a framework for potential areas to implement change to improve the accessibility and structure of online medical education in Egypt.

It has been well established that stress triggers or worsens TMDs. This paper looks to present early research, still unfolding, on the relationship between COVID-19 as a major life stressor and TMDs. The main aims of this study were to: investigate the presence of symptoms related to TMDs and the time of onset and the worsening of painful symptoms in relation to the changes in social life imposed by the coronavirus pandemic; and to evaluate the perception of COVID-19 as a major stressful event in subjects who report worsening of painful TMD symptoms. One hundred and eighty-two subjects answered questionnaires-Axis II of the RDC/TMD, the PSS, and specific items about coronavirus as a stressful event-during the lockdown period for COVID-19 in Italy to evaluate the presence of reported symptoms of TMD and the level of depression, somatization, and stress perceived. The results showed that 40.7% of subjects complained about TMD symptoms in the past month. Regarding the time of onset, 60.8% of them reported that facial pain started in the last three months, while 51.4% of these subjects reported that their symptoms worsened in the last month and were related to the aggravation of pain due to the coronavirus lockdown as a major life event and to the stress experienced.

Most proposed DEA approaches focus on single-period portfolio performance assessment based on aggregated historical data. However, such an evaluation setting may result in the loss of valuable information in past individual time periods, and violate real-world portfolio managers and investors decision making, which generally involves multiple time periods. Furthermore, to our knowledge, all proposed DEA approaches treat the financial assets comprising a portfolio as a black box: thus there is no information about their individual performance. Moreover, ideal portfolio evaluation models should enable the target portfolio to compare with all possible portfolios, i.e., enabling full diversification of portfolios across all financial assets. Hence, this research aims at developing nested dynamic network DEA models, an additive model being nested within a slacks-based measure (SBM) DEA model, that explicitly utilizes the information in each individual time period to fully and simultaneously measure the multi-period efficiency of a portfolio and its comprised financial assets. The proposed nested dynamic network DEA models, referred to as NDN DEA models, are linear programs with conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraints, and infinitely many decision making units (DMUs). In conducting the empirical study, this research applies the NDN DEA models to a real-world case study, in which Markov chain Monte Carlo Bayesian algorithms are used to obtain future performance forecasts in today's highly volatile investment environments.","output":"Nested Dynamic Network Data Envelopment Analysis Models with Infinitely Many Decision Making Units for Portfolio Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to compare time to return of voiding function and associated complications in women undergoing minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy (SCP) versus transvaginal native tissue repair in patients with same-day or early discharge. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary care center. The electronic medical record system was queried for women who underwent native tissue vaginal repair or SCP for apical prolapse between March and December 2020 using CPT codes for sacrocolpopexy (57425), extraperitoneal (57282), and intraperitoneal colpopexy (57283). Voiding success was our primary outcome and was defined by a postvoid residual < 150 ml. Secondary outcomes included catheter days and urinary tract infections. The total number of participants was based on a power calculation using internal institutional rates. Participants were compared based on the surgical approach. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to assess for confounding factors. RESULTS: We included 134 women: 63 SCP and 71 native tissue. The failure rate of the first postoperative voiding trial was 34 vs. 11% (odds ratio: 4.91; 95% CI 1.96C12.3, p < 0.01) in the vaginal and SCP groups, respectively. Both groups had a similar success rate of a second voiding trial (100% in SCP group vs. 95.7% in the vaginal repair group, p = 1). The total number of days (3.108 vs. 1.603 days, p < 0.01) to return of bladder function, postoperative urinary tract infections (23.9 vs. 6.35%, p < 0.01) and emergency department visits (15.5 vs. 1.59%, p < 0.01) were all higher in the vaginal repair group.

During the national lockdown of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, we developed and launched a Web App (Gestioemocional.cat) to promote emotional self-care in the general population and facilitate contact with healthcare professionals. MethodsGestioemocional.cat targeted all individuals aged 18 years or more and was designed by adapting the contents of a mobile App for adjuvant treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (i.e., the PTSD Coach App) to the general population and the pandemic/lockdown scenario. We retrospectively assessed the utilization pattern of the Web App using data systematically retrieved from Google Analytics. Data were grouped into three time periods, defined using a join point analysis of COVID-19 incidence in our area: first wave, between-wave period, and second wave. ResultsThe resulting Web App, maintains the navigation structure of the PTSD Coach App, with three main modules: tools for emotional self-care, a self-assessment test, and professional resources for on-demand contact. The self-assessment test combines the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and offers professional contact in the advent of a high level of depression and anxiety; contact is prioritized according to a screening questionnaire administered at the time of obtaining individual consent to be contacted. The tools for emotional self-care can be accessed either on-demand or symptom-driven. The utilization analysis showed a high number of weekly accesses during the first wave. In this period, press releases regarding critical events of the pandemic progression and government decisions on containment measures were followed by a utilization peak, irrespective of the sense (i.e., positive or negative) of the information. Positive information pieces (e.g., relaxation of containment measures due to a reduction of COVID-19 cases) resulted in a sharp increase in utilization immediately after information release, followed by a successive decline in utilization. The second wave was characterized by a lower and less responsive utilization of the Web App. ConclusionsmHealth tools may help the general population coping with stressful conditions associated with the pandemic scenario.

The national Kidney Allocation System prioritizes patients with Estimated Post-Transplant Survival (EPTS) scores in the top 20% for expedited access to optimal deceased donor kidneys. METHODS We studied adults aged 18 years in the United States Renal Data System with top 20% EPTS scores who had been preemptively waitlisted or initiated dialysis in 2015-2017. We evaluated time to waitlist placement, transplantation, and mortality with unadjusted and multivariable survival models. RESULTS Of 42,445 patients with top 20% EPTS scores (mean age, 38.0 years; 57% male; 59% White patients, and 31% Black patients), 7922 were preemptively waitlisted. Among 34,523 patients initiating dialysis, the 3-year cumulative waitlist placement incidence was 37%. Numerous factors independently associated with waitlisting included race, income, and having noncommercial insurance. For example, waitlisting was less likely for Black versus White patients, and for patients in the lowest-income neighborhoods versus those in the highest-income neighborhoods. Among patients initiating dialysis, 61% lost their top 20% EPTS status within 30 months versus 18% of patients who were preemptively listed. The 3-year incidence of deceased and living donor transplantation was 5% and 6%, respectively, for patients who initiated dialysis and 26% and 44%, respectively, for patients who were preemptively listed. CONCLUSIONS Many patients with ESKDqualifying with top 20% EPTS status are not placed on the transplant waiting list in a timely manner, with significant variation on the basis of demographic and social factors. Patients who are preemptively listed are more likely to receive benefits of top 20% EPTS status.

However, this approach is often criticized, as it is inherently inequitable. Internationalization at home is a newer concept that aims to provide students with international skills and experiences without exchange travel. We report detailed outcomes of an international online program during the COVID-19 pandemic, which aimed to include acquisition of cultural awareness and competencysimilar to what the students would have obtained if they had travelled abroad. METHOD: Sixty-eight students from 12 international universities participated in international small peer group collaborative work, and online networking. Perceived improvement of cultural competency using Likert scale and open-ended questions was used as a measure of success. Furthermore, students definition of cultural competency in the different countries was obtained. RESULTS: Students improved their cultural competency skills. Data analysis supported statistically significant improvement of the above skills after the program, in comparison to the start of the program. DISCUSSION: Internationalization of medical education can be achieved at homevia structured online peer exchangesand can provide students with intercultural skills and networking opportunities that are typically achieved via international in-person travel. The above represents a socially just and equitable way to reach all students and can result in improvement of their cultural competency, preparing them for their work in global health, and thereby resulting in improvement of global health.

We aimed to describe the experiences of women in substance use disorder (SUD) recovery programs by (1) exploring the pandemic's impact on their lives, sobriety, and recovery capital and (2) tracking COVID-19 perceptions and preventative behaviors. METHODS: We conducted monthly semistructured interviews with women in residential and outpatient SUD recovery programs in Kansas City in April, May, and June 2020. Participants described the pandemic's impact on their life and sobriety and completed survey items on factors related to COVID-19 preventative behaviors. We interpreted qualitative themes longitudinally alongside quantitative data. RESULTS: In 64 interviews, participants (n = 24) described reduced access to recovery capital, or resources that support sobriety, such as social relationships, housing, employment, and health care. Most experienced negative impacts on their lives and feelings of stability in March and April but maintained sobriety. Four women described relapse, all attributed to pandemic stressors. Participants described relief related to societal re-opening in May and June, and increased engagement with their communities, despite rising infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: For women recovering from SUDs during COVID-19, securing recovery capital often meant assuming greater COVID-19 risk. As substance use appeared to have increased during the pandemic and COVID-19 transmission continues, public health planning must prioritize adequate and safe access to recovery capital and timely distribution of vaccines to people struggling with SUDs.","output":"Recovering from substance use disorders during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed-methods longitudinal study of women in Kansas City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gastroenteritis is a common illness causing considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite improvements in detection methods, a significant diagnostic gap still remains. Human bocavirus (HBoV)s, which are associated with respiratory infections, have also frequently been detected in stool samples in cases of gastroenteritis, and a tentative association between HBoVs, and in particular type-2 HBoVs, and gastroenteritis has previously been made. The aim of this study was to determine the role of HBoVs in gastroenteritis, using archived DNA samples from the case-control Infectious Intestinal Disease Study (IID). DNA extracted from stool samples from 2,256 cases and 2,124 controls were tested for the presence of HBoV DNA. All samples were screened in a real time PCR pan-HBoV assay, and positive samples were then tested in genotype 1 to 3-specific assays. HBoV was detected in 7.4% but no significantly different prevalence was observed between cases and controls. In the genotype-specific assays 106 of the 324 HBoV-positive samples were genotyped, with HBoV-1 predominantly found in controls whilst HBoV-2 was more frequently associated with cases of gastroenteritis (p<0.01). A significant proportion of HBoV positives could not be typed using the type specific assays, 67% of the total positives, and this was most likely due to low viral loads being present in the samples. However, the distribution of the untyped HBoV strains was no different between cases and controls.

In order to exploit the potential of digital health technologies, Internet-based networking between patients and health care providers is required. However, this networking and access to digital health technologies are less prevalent in sociodemographically deprived cohorts. The paper explores how the use of digital health technologies, which connect patients with health care providers and health insurers has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The data from a German-based cross-sectional online study conducted between April 29 and May 8, 2020, were used for this purpose. A total of 1.570 participants were included in the study. Accordingly, the influence of sociodemographic determinants, subjective perceptions, and personal competencies will affect the use of online booking of medical appointments and medications, video consultations with providers, and the data transmission to health insurers via an app. RESULTS: The highest level of education (OR 1.806) and the presence of a chronic illness (OR 1.706) particularly increased the likelihood of using online booking. With regard to data transmission via an app to a health insurance company, the strongest increase in the probability of use was shown by belonging to the highest subjective social status (OR 1.757) and generation Y (OR 2.303). Furthermore, the results show that the higher the subjectively perceived restriction of the subjects' life situation was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the higher the relative probability of using online booking (OR 1.103) as well as data transmission via an app to a health insurance company (OR 1.113). In addition, higher digital literacy contributes to the use of online booking (OR 1.033) and data transmission via an app to the health insurer (OR 1.034). CONCLUSIONS: Socially determined differences can be identified for the likelihood of using digital technologies in health care, which persist even under restrictive conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the results indicate a digital divide with regard to the technologies investigated in this study.","output":"Patient connectivity with healthcare professionals and health insurer using digital health technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic: a German cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The act of perceiving taste is called gustation The ability to taste is strongly linked to our ability to smell, olfaction Dysfunction of taste and smell are generally low on the list of key clinical symptoms However, the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with loss of sense of smell and taste in up to 15-30% of patients both as the presenting or only symptom in patients with mild disease or as the initial symptom in patients who ultimately progress to more serious respiratory failure due to pneumonia Similar symptoms were reported during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-COV outbreak in 2003 and changes in taste and smell are also common in viral illnesses like the common cold or flu As taste and smell are closely intertwined, it is believed that the vast majority of cases where taste is lost is rooted in damage to olfactory system (smell) The gustatory system (taste) is usually not selectively impacted by viral upper respiratory infections The brain has a dedicated area chiefly responsible for perceiving and distinguishing different tastes called the gustatory cortex Its location in the anterior insula in the temporal lobe and frontal opercular region is the terminal connection serving taste perception The system differentiates the subtleties of salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami (Japanese for savory, monosodium glutamate), the essence of flavor in our food First-order neurons originate as peripheral taste chemoreceptors found in papillae on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, pharynx, and upper aspect of the esophagus Chemoreceptor stimulation, specific for individual tastes, triggers cellular depolarization, ultimately synapsing topographically with primary sensory axons that run in the chorda tympani and greater superior petrosal branches of the facial nerve CN VII (dorsal surface of tongue), the lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve CN IX (soft palate and pharynx) and the vagus nerve CN X(upper part of the esophagus) The central axon of these primary sensory neurons projects from their specific cranial nerve ganglia to the solitary tract in the medulla Axons from the rostral gustatory solitary nucleus project to the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus VPM and ultimately terminate, both crossed and uncrossed, at the neocortex, the gustatory cortex (the anterior insula of the temporal lobe and frontal opercular region) Consciousness perception of flavor and experiencing the pleasurable (hedonic) value of food is subserved by the posterior part of the orbital frontal cortex This area lies in close proximity to the primary olfactory piriform cortex (smell) both anatomically and physiologically positioning olfaction with gustation The gustatory nucleus is a group of neuron cell bodies that serve as an intermediate to relay gustation from the chemoreceptors in the mouth to the gustatory cortex These neuron cell bodies are in the posterolateral portion of the brainstem known as the nucleus of the solitary tract Specifically, the neurons found here are the second-order neurons in the pathway for gustation The gustatory nucleus receives their input from first-order neurons: the afferent cranial nerve fibers from the facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), and vagus (X) nerves These fibers carry gustation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, posterior one-third of the tongue, and the epiglottis, respectively JL Clarke and B Stilling first described the gustatory nuclei in the mid-19th century Their early discoveries and contributions paved the way for what is known about the gustatory nucleus today Due to its complexity, dysfunctions of taste can have clinical significance in fields including but not limited to neurosurgery, neurology, and otolaryngology Therefore, knowledge of the function and structure of this neuroanatomical finding is essential in several practices of medicine [1][2]","output":"Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Gustatory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Rapidly increasing numbers of confirmed cases and deaths during the 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19) resulted in widespread psychological problems in the Chinese population. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sleep quality and changes in sleep patterns before and during the outbreak in the general population in China and to determine factors related to sleep quality. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire from 20 February to 29 February 2020 in China. Socio-demographic data, self-designed COVID-19-related characteristics, sleep patterns, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores were obtained. Single factor analysis and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis were used. RESULTS: A total of 1,897 individuals were included in our study, and 30.0% of participants reported suffering poor sleep quality (PSQI8). Logistic regression analysis found that the factors related to sleep quality included poor physical health (OR=3.382, p<0.001), respiratory disease (OR=1.629, p=0.008), other diseases (OR=2.504, p=0.012), suspected case of COVID-19 in the same community (OR=1.928, p=0.002), confirmed case of COVID-19 in the same community (OR=2.183, p=0.007), worry about being infected (OR=2.336, p<0.001), 1 hour/day spent hearing COVID-19 information (OR=1.960, p<0.001), time difference in midpoint time in bed (OR=1.230, p<0.001), and time difference in time in bed (OR=0.711, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that more than one-fourth of the participants suffered poor sleep quality during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to the poor health status and COVID-19-related anxiety, delayed sleep phase and reduced time in bed impacted sleep quality in the general population in China.","output":"Relationships Between the Changes in Sleep Patterns and Sleep Quality among Chinese People During the 2019 Coronavirus Disease Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivos Investigar os anticorpos irregulares (AI) mais prevalentes em pacientes atendidos na Agncia Transfusional do Hemocentro Regional de Santa Maria (HEMOSM) durante o perodo de pandemia do COVID-19. Material e mtodos Trata-se de um estudo observacional retrospectivo realizado pela coleta de informa??es dos arquivos da Agncia Transfusional e do Laboratrio de Imunohematologia do HEMOSM, durante o perodo de fevereiro/2020 a julho/2021. Resultados Neste perodo foram contabilizados 15 pacientes com o resultado positivo na Pesquisa de Anticorpos Irregulares (PAI) no HEMOSM, sendo 10 mulheres e 5 homens. Dentre os pacientes com PAI positivo, foram detectados 10 anticorpos diferentes. Alguns pacientes apresentaram mais de um anticorpo identificado na pesquisa. Os anticorpos mais prevalentes foram Anti-D (n = 3), Anti-E (n = 3) e Anti-Kell-1 (n = 3), seguidos de Anti-C (n = 2), Anti-c (n = 2), enquanto os demais anticorpos foram identificados somente uma vez, sendo eles Anti-M, Anti-S, Anti-s, Anti-Lea e Anti-Lua. A identifica??o dos anticorpos n?o foi possvel para 4 dos pacientes em raz?o dos ensaios de autocontrole e/ou Coombs direto apresentarem rea??o positiva, situa??es que dificultam a identifica??o de AI. Discuss?o Anticorpos irregulares contra antgenos eritrocitrios s?o produzidos no organismo em raz?o da exposi??o a um antgeno n?o prprio, seja por transfus?o sangunea, gesta??o ou abortos espontaneos. Alguns AI podem ter origem natural, a exemplo do Anti-M e Anti-E, n?o necessariamente tendo sido produzidos por uma das situa??es citadas anteriormente (origem imune). A predominancia dos anticorpos Anti-D, Anti-E e Anti-Kell-1 nos receptores tem liga??o direta com a imunogenicidade e a velocidade de indu??o da forma??o de anticorpos voltados contra esses antgenos. Os anticorpos mais prevalentes neste estudo tambm s?o aqueles de maior importancia clnica em casos incompatibilidade materno fetal e podem causar a eritroblastose fetal (EF) ou a doen?a hemoltica do recm-nascido (DHRN). Destaca-se, neste sentido, que a presen?a de AI foi maior em pacientes do sexo feminino. Nestes casos, em uma primeira gesta??o pode ocorrer a sensibiliza??o da gestante a antgenos que o recm-nascido apresenta em suas hemcias (diferentes dos maternos), podendo n?o haver manifesta??o clnica alguma. Porm, em futuras gesta??es, com novo quadro de incompatibilidade materno fetal se apresentando, anticorpos da classe IgG maternos podem atravessar a barreira placentria e provocar hemlise no feto ou recm-nascido, ou seja, situa??o em que ocorre as manifesta??es clnicas da EF e DHRN. Conclus?o Atravs deste estudo,  possvel compreender a prevalncia dos AI entre os pacientes atendidos e comprovar a importancia da PAI. Apesar de ser um dos testes pr-transfusionais obrigatrios pela legisla??o brasileira,  indispensvel que a PAI seja executada de maneira correta, seguida da identifica??o dos AI, implicando diretamente na preven??o de rea??es transfusionais e em novas ocorrncias de sensibiliza??o, especialmente em pacientes politransfundidos.","output":"IDENTIFICA??O DE ANTICORPOS IRREGULARES EM PACIENTES ATENDIDOS NA AGNCIA TRANSFUSIONAL DO HEMOCENTRO REGIONAL DE SANTA MARIA DURANTE O PERODO DE PANDEMIA DE COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a major problem in many of the world nations including Ethiopia. Moreover, it is a public health emergency of the community concern and poses a mental health problem to health care workers (HCWs). Therefore, this study aimed to assess the level of self-reporting symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers in Ethiopia.MethodsAn institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from June 25, 2020, to July 25, 2020, in Ethiopia. The data were collected using a self-reported Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were cleaned, coded, and entered using Epi info version 7.5.1 and exported for analyzed to the Social Science package software Version 23 Statistical Package. Moreover, multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the associated factors at p-value less than 0.05.ResultsA total of 816 HCWs responded to self-reporting questions. From HCWs who screened positive for depression, anxiety, and stress;60.3%, 78%, and 33.8% of them had scored moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress respectively.

Studies have assessed the ability of different symptoms to identify infection, but few have compared symptoms over time (reflecting variants) and by vaccination status. METHODS: Using the COVID-19 Infection Survey, sampling households across the UK, we compared symptoms in PCR-positives vs. PCR-negatives, evaluating sensitivity of combinations of 12 symptoms (percentage symptomatic PCR-positives reporting specific symptoms) and tests per case (TPC) (PCR-positives or PCR-negatives reporting specific symptoms/ PCR-positives reporting specific symptoms). RESULTS: Between April 2020 and August 2021, 27,869 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive episodes occurred in 27,692 participants (median 42 years), of whom 13,427 (48%) self-reported symptoms (symptomatic PCR-positives). The comparator comprised 3,806,692 test-negative visits (457,215 participants); 130,612 (3%) self-reported symptoms (symptomatic PCR-negatives). Symptom reporting in PCR-positives varied by age, sex, and ethnicity, and over time, reflecting changes in prevalence of viral variants, incidental changes (e.g. seasonal pathogens (with sore throat increasing in PCR-positives and PCR-negatives from April 2021), schools re-opening) and vaccination roll-out. After May-2021 when Delta emerged, headache and fever substantially increased in PCR-positives, but not PCR-negatives. Sensitivity of symptom-based detection increased from 74% using classic symptoms, to 81% adding fatigue/weakness, and 90% including all eight additional symptoms. However, this increased TPC from 4.6 to 5.3 to 8.7. CONCLUSIONS: Expanded symptom combinations may provide modest benefits for sensitivity of PCR-based case detection, but this will vary between settings and over time, and increases tests/case. Large-scale changes to targeted PCR-testing approaches require careful evaluation given substantial resource and infrastructure implications.","output":"Symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the general population in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a significant decline in the stock market worldwide, and hospitality companies are experiencing serious financial problems Protecting and preserving firm value is a critical way of helping hospitality companies survive the crisis The influence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on firm value has been widely investigated However, little is known about the stock price movement following CSR activity adoption during an industrial crisis Using event study and difference-in-difference method, this study reveals that engaging in CSR activities can increase the stock returns and stakeholder attention of hospitality firms during the pandemic Community-related CSR has a stronger and more immediate effect on stock returns than customer- and employee-related CSR Results also indicate that hospitality firms that pursue improved stock market performance during a pandemic can invest in CSR to protect communities, customers, and employees for attracting further stakeholder attention ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Can corporate social responsibility protect firm value during the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation can decrease symptoms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.

After 8 weeks, the results showed that both groups showed a statistically significant decrease in the CCQ (p < 0.05). The multimedia group showed a statistically significant increase in the lower-limb muscle strengthening (p < 0.05), while the control group was not found to show a statistically significant increase in the lower-limb muscle strengthening.
