This study investigated the short-term effect of toothpastes containing antimicrobial properties in patients with COVID-19 to determine if they could reduce the SARS-CoV-2 salivary viral load. METHODS: : Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 83) were instructed to perform tooth brushing with one of three arms: a toothpaste containing 0.96% zinc (zinc oxide, zinc citrate) in a silica base (Test 1); toothpaste containing 0.454% SnF(2) in a silica base (Test 2), and a nonantibacterial toothpaste (control). Saliva was collected before intervention (T0), immediately after intervention (T1), and 30 (T2) and 60 min (T3) after intervention. The SARS-CoV-2 salivary viral load was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays. For Test 1 and Test 2 toothpastes, the fold reductions were normalized to baseline and to the control toothpaste at each time point after brushing. A fold change of 2 is considered clinically effective. RESULTS: : Brushing with the Test 1 toothpaste reduced the SARS-CoV-2 salivary viral load by 4.06-fold at T1, by 2.36-fold at T2, and by 1.42-fold at T3. Similarly, brushing with a Test 2 toothpaste reduced the SARS-CoV-2 salivary viral load by 2.33-fold at T1, by 2.38-fold at T2, and by 0.77-fold at T3.

METHODS: A detailed questionnaire comprising 47 questions designed in both English and Chinese was developed. The survey was conducted via WeChat, a multipurpose messaging, social media, and mobile payment app that is widely used by the Chinese population. In total, 1006 participants responded, and most of them were from different provinces of mainland China. RESULTS: Overall, this comprehensive survey revealed that the general public in China is highly aware of the basic information concerning COVID-19 and its precautions. Interestingly, more respondents (99.3%) were aware of the term severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) than COVID-19 (97.2%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (73.4%).

Syria protracted conflict has strained its health systems and caused fragmentation. In this study, we focus on northwest (NW) Syria, where recent violence has driven almost one million civilians (of the 4.17 million in the area) from their homes between December 2019 and March 2020. The area is challenged by overcrowding, inadequate WASH, shelter and insufficient healthcare services. Internationally promoted measures (social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine, lockdown) are not impossible. We model outcomes, according to three scenarios, should there be a COVD-19 outbreak. We aim to: 1. Predict the numbers of cases, including severe and critical ones, and deaths. 2. Identify critical time points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed due to COVID-19. Methodology: using the WHO COVD-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool (COVID-ESFT) and data from the Health Information System Unit on population and health facility capacity and utilization in northwest Syria, we generate predicted numbers of cases, deaths and health care needs according to three scenarios. Scenario One assumes a medium doubling rate (every 4 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Scenario Two assumes a fast doubling rate (every 3.2 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Camp-population Scenario assumes a very fast doubling rate (every 2.3 days) and a medium clinical attack rate (20% of the population). Scenarios One and Two apply to the total population of 4.17 million and for 8 weeks from the first case while Camp-population Scenario applies only to the 1.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps and tented settlements and for 6 weeks from the first case. For each scenario, we identify critical time-points when the health system capacity is overwhelmed assuming a highly conservative estimate that 50% of regular hospital (ward) and ICU beds can be occupied by COVID-19 patients. Results: Scenario One predicts 16,384 cases (0.4% of the total population), of which 2,458 are severe and 819 are critical, and 978 deaths in the first 8 weeks. Scenario Two predicts 185,364 cases (4.4% of the population), of which 27805 are severe and 9268 are critical, and 11,066 deaths in the first 8 weeks. Camp-population Scenario predicts 240,000 cases (20% of the IDP population) of which 36,000 are severe and 12,000 are critical and 14,328 deaths in the first 6 weeks. With only 2,429 inpatient beds and 240 ICU beds (98 with adult ventilators, 62 with paediatric ventilators) in northwest Syria, ward and ICU bed capacities will be overwhelmed within 4-7 weeks. The Camp-population Scenario will see the earliest critical time-points. Conclusion and recommendations: Should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in NW Syria, projected cases and deaths will be particularly severe among IDPs. Health system capacity will be overwhelmed within a short period after the first case in camp settings. There is need for further research to account for additional variables that can impact projections. However, it is urgent for international community to mobilize efforts and resources to support community-based measures, increase testing, strengthen health system capacity.","output":"THE COVID-19 FORECAST IN NORTHWEST SYRIAThe Imperative of Global Action to Avoid Catastrophe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interest in mindfulness meditation continues to grow as accumulating evidence suggests mindfulness training encourages more positive functioning. However, basic questions about the conditions best suited for realizing mindful states remain unanswered. Prominent among these is whether a group mindfulness practice setting is more effective for novice meditators than a solitary practice setting. Answering this question has assumed new urgency due to the imposition of physical distancing measures designed to stop the spread of COVID-19. In a time of limited social contact, is a simulated group practice setting better than practicing alone? This preliminary study investigated whether environmental setting impacted mindfulness practice experience by examining the effects of three simulated meditation practice environments (1. group practice, 2. nature practice, and 3. solitary practice) on state mindfulness and perceived social connectivity in a sample of novice meditators. Significant differences emerged across the three simulated practice settings. Findings suggest watching others meditate while meditating appears to most effectively induce a state of mindfulness and strengthen feelings of social connectivity. This study supports traditional beliefs about the benefits of group mindfulness practice. These findings also have implications for social workers struggling to stretch limited resources to address growing mental health demands, especially during times of heightened social isolation due to COVID-19. If a simulated group practice confers the same cognitive benefits as solitary practice while also conferring social benefits, simulated group instruction may be preferable for therapeutic and economic reasons.","output":"Effects of Video-Guided Group vs. Solitary Meditation on Mindfulness and Social Connectivity: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Das Pankreas ist sowohl ein exokrines wie auch ein endokrines Organ (Tab. 21.1).

This study examined the epidemiology of pleurisy diagnosed via surgical pleural biopsy in a Japanese nationwide administrative database. METHODS: We evaluated Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination data of 24 173 patients who underwent video\\\\assisted thoracoscopic surgery or open thoracotomy and received a diagnosis of pleurisy between April 2014 and March 2020. In addition to pleurisy diagnoses, the patients' clinical information, including age, sex, smoking status (pack\\\\years), dyspnea grade, length of in\\\\hospital stay, and comorbidities, were extracted from the dataset. RESULTS: This study included data from 1699 patients. The most frequent causes of pleurisy were neoplastic diseases (55.9%; malignant mesothelioma 22.5%, lung cancer 15.7%, lymphoma 2.5%), followed by infectious diseases (24.0%; tuberculosis 16.2%, parapneumonic pleural effusion 3.6%, empyema 3.5%, nontuberculous mycobacteriosis 0.5%), collagen vascular diseases (2.8%; rheumatoid arthritis 1.3%, immunoglobulin G4\\\\related diseases 0.7%, systemic lupus erythematosus 0.3%), and paragonimiasis (0.1%).

We then evaluated the impact of various mitigation strategies upon resuming activities. RESULTS: The delay in achieving the elimination goals is on average similar to the number of years the treatment rounds are missed. Enhanced interventions implemented for as little as 1 y can allow catch-up on the progress lost and, if maintained throughout the programme, can lead to acceleration of up to 3 y. CONCLUSIONS: In general, a short delay in the programme does not cause a major delay in achieving the goals. Impact is strongest in high-endemicity areas. Mitigation strategies such as biannual treatment or increased coverage are key to minimizing the impact of the disruption once the programme resumes and lead to potential acceleration should these enhanced strategies be maintained.","output":"Delays in lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes due to COVID-19, and possible mitigation strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the US air cargo network (USACN) becomes a crucial part of the economy, it is pivotal to understand the structural evolution of the network and how it would be affected by unexpected events.

Eighty-eight consecutive lower respiratory tract samples were analyzed by both standard microbiological methods, as requested by the referring clinician, and by the panel. The agreement with standard methods, empirical treatment coverage and possible impact on isolation practices were assessed by comparing the results from standard diagnostic methods with the panel results in relation to clinical data and information of antimicrobial therapy.Results: Both qualitative and semi-quantitative results from the panel generally displayed good agreement with standard methods and by combining methods, a possible aetiology was detected in 73% of patients. Due to the panel approach, the panel detected viruses more frequently. In 25% of the 60 patients assessed for empirical treatment coverage, a pathogen not covered by current therapy was detected and in 30% of in-house patients the panel results were found to potentially influence clinical decisions related to isolation care.Conclusions: The new diagnostic panel shows promise in improving aetiological diagnostics of lower respiratory tract infections.

The predicted polypeptide shares between 27 and 31% sequence identities with the PB1 polypeptides of influenza A, B, and C viruses. Among the regions most highly conserved are the sequences around the Asp-Asp motif common to many RNA polymerases. In spite of the high level of sequence identity between the Dhori RNA segment 2 gene product and the influenza A, B, and C virus PB1 proteins the amino acid composition of the Dhori protein indicates an acidic charge feature at pH 7.0 in contrast to the basic nature of the PB1 proteins of the influenza viruses.

According to the World Health Organization, measures such as rapid diagnosis, immediate isolation, and precautionary contact tracing are key tools of epidemic control. The method of detection or testing is critical in this epidemiological control, where SARS-CoV-2-positive cases are increasingly growing, leading to community infection. Immunochromatographic test kits have been described for the diagnosis of various infectious diseases because of their rapid scalability, convenient use, and prompt validation. The benefits of the immunochromatographic test kits include evaluation of the sample in approximately 20 minutes, lower cost per sample, and simple directions to use. Such test kits are composed of an uncut sheet structure that is protein conjugated, labeled with markers, and reagents coated in a nitrocellulose membrane. The need for thorough vetting is a major concern for the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Indian Council of Medical Research and other regulators, as more businesses are rushing to produce serologic test kits for SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. Initial reports of 86%?89% sensitivity and 84.2%C98.6% specificity were reported for these kits. Nonetheless, many national reports show variability in test accuracy significantly among various commercial suppliers. The viruss more recent mutated strains (B.1.1.7, B.1.617, and B.1.351) have also raised concerns about their detectability using these test kits. In India, manufacturers are developing rapid test kits to detect SARS-CoV-2 by importing pre-antigen or antibody-coated uncut sheets from vendors and then cutting them into strips. Such sheets also have problems with specificity and are expensive. The possibility of developing kits with an indigenous protein coating and conjugation to detect antigens and antibodies needs to be explored by Indian researchers.

The downstream ORF 1b is expressed by a mechanism involving (?1) ribosomal frameshifting. Translation of mRNA 1, which is thought to be equivalent to the viral genomic RNA, results in the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins contain motifs characteristic of papain-like and 3C-like proteinases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, and metal-binding proteins. In this study, we have produced pp1ab-specific monoclonal antibodies and have used them to detect an intracellular, 105-kDa viral polypeptide that contains the putative RNA polymerase domain. Furthermore, usingtranscleavage assays with bacterially expressed HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase, we have demonstrated that the 105-kDa polypeptide is released from pp1ab by cleavage at the dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/Ala-4996.

In addition, we measured the relative antibody binding towards antigens from variants CoV2 virus variants, strains B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (S. African). Antibody levels against multiple antigens within the SARS CoV2 spike protein were significantly elevated for both vaccinated and infected individuals, while those against the nucleocapsid (N) protein were only elevated for infected individuals. GC-FP was effective for monitoring the IgG-based serological response to vaccination throughout the vaccination sequence, and could also resolve acute (within hours) increases in antibody levels. A significant decrease in antibody binding to antigens from the B.1.351 variant, but not B.1.1.7, was observed for all vaccinated subjects when measured by GC-FP as compared to the 2019 SARS CoV2 antigens.

The objective was to assess the reliability of the estimation of tidal volume (VT) and unintentional leaks in a single tubing bench model which introduces random dynamic leaks during inspiratory or expiratory phases. METHODS The built-in software of four commercial home ventilators and a fifth ventilator-independent ad hoc designed external software tool were tested with two levels of leaks and two different models with excess leaks (inspiration or expiration). The external software analyzed separately the inspiratory and expiratory unintentional leaks. RESULTS In basal condition, all ventilators but one underestimated tidal volume with values ranging between -1.5  3.3% to -8.7%  3.27%. In the model with excess of inspiratory leaks, VT was overestimated by all four commercial software tools, with values ranging from 18.27  7.05% to 35.92  17.7%, whereas the ventilator independent-software gave a smaller difference (3.03  2.6%). Leaks were underestimated by two applications with values of -11.47  6.32 and -5.9  0.52 L/min. With expiratory leaks, VT was overestimated by the software of one ventilator and the ventilator-independent software and significantly underestimated by the other three, with deviations ranging from +10.94  7.1 to -48  23.08%. The four commercial tools tested overestimated unintentional leaks, with values between 2.19  0.85 to 3.08  0.43 L/min.

More recently, qualitatively and quantitatively assessed chest imaging findings, such as emphysema, large and small airways disease, and pulmonary vascular abnormalities have been associated with poor long-term outcomes in COPD patients. Although several blood and sputum biomarkers have been investigated for risk assessment in COPD, most still warrant further validation. Finally, novel remote digital monitoring technologies may be valuable to predict exacerbations but their large-scale performance, ease of implementation, and cost effectiveness remain to be determined. SUMMARY: Given the complex heterogeneity of COPD, any single metric is unlikely to fully capture the risk of poor long-term outcomes. Therefore, clinicians should review all available clinical data, including spirometry, symptom severity, functional status, chest imaging, and bloodwork, to guide personalized preventive care of COPD patients.

Inflammatory indices also declined with IL-6 falling from 231 and 598 pg/ml to 3.32 and 116 pg/ml, respectively. IL-6/IL-10 ratios also decreased from 11.8 and 18 to 0.7 and 0.62, respectively. The two patients were successfully weaned off ECMO after 17 and 16 days of SCD therapy, respectively. The results observed with SCD therapy on these two critically ill COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS and elevated IL-6 is encouraging.

Currently, several quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) assays are being used by clinical, research and public health laboratories. However, it is currently unclear whether results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to make independent evaluations of primer-probe sets used in four common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays. From our comparisons of RT-qPCR analytical efficiency and sensitivity, we show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 at 500 viral RNA copies per reaction. The exception for this is the RdRp-SARSr (Charit) confirmatory primer-probe set which has low sensitivity, probably due to a mismatch to circulating SARS-CoV-2 in the reverse primer. We did not find evidence for background amplification with pre-COVID-19 samples or recent SARS-CoV-2 evolution decreasing sensitivity. Our recommendation for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is to select an assay with high sensitivity and that is regionally used, to ease comparability between outcomes.","output":"Analytical sensitivity and efficiency comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR primer-probe sets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Only few studies have investigated the relationship between the histopathology of retrieved thrombi and clinical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate thrombus composition and its association with clinical, laboratory, and neurointerventional findings in patients treated by mechanical thrombectomy due to acute large vessel occlusion. METHODS At our institution, 79 patients were treated by mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retriever and/or aspiration catheter between August 2015 and August 2016. The retrieved thrombi were quantitatively analyzed to quantify red blood cells, white blood cells, and fibrin by area. We divided the patients into two groups - a fibrin-rich group and an erythrocyte-rich group - based on the predominant composition in the thrombus. The groups were compared for imaging, clinical, and neurointerventional data. RESULTS The retrieved thrombi from 43 patients with acute stroke from internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, or basilar artery occlusion were histologically analyzed. Erythrocyte-rich thrombi were present in 18 cases, while fibrin-rich thrombi were present in 25 cases. A cardioembolic etiology was significantly more prevalent among the patients with fibrin-rich thrombi than among those with erythrocyte-rich thrombi. Attenuation of thrombus density as shown on computed tomography images was greater in patients with erythrocyte-rich thrombi than in those with fibrin-rich thrombi. All other clinical and laboratory characteristics remained the same. Patients with erythrocyte-rich thrombi had a smaller number of recanalization maneuvers, shorter procedure times, a shorter time interval between arrival and recanalization, and a higher percentage of stent retrievers in the final recanalization procedure. The occluded vessels did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS In this study, erythrocyte-rich thrombus was associated with noncardioembolic etiology, higher thrombus density, and reduced procedure time.","output":"Erythrocyte-Rich Thrombus Is Associated with Reduced Number of Maneuvers and Procedure Time in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke Undergoing Mechanical Thrombectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measles virus (MV) enters cells by membrane fusion at the cell surface at neutral pH. Two glycoproteins mediate this process: the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins. The H-protein binds to receptors, while the F-protein mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. H naturally interacts with at least three different receptors. The wild-type virus primarily uses the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM, CD150) expressed on certain lymphatic cells, while the vaccine strain has gained the ability to also use the ubiquitous membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), a regulator of complement activation. Additionally, MV infects polarized epithelial cells through an unidentified receptor (EpR). The footprints of the three receptors on H have been characterized, and the focus of research is shifting to the characterization of receptor-specific conformational changes that occur in the H-protein dimer and how these are transmitted to the F-protein trimer. It was also shown that MV attachment and cell entry can be readily targeted to designated receptors by adding specificity determinants to the H-protein.

The patients were divided into pharyngeal symptoms group (PS, 126 cases) and non-pharyngeal symptoms group (Non-PS, 1 102 cases) according to the presence or absence of pharyngeal symptoms such as pharyngalgia, pharyngeal dryness, pharyngeal itching, and pharyngeal foreign body sensation. The clinical data in terms of age, sex, medical history, duration of symptoms, treatment time, clinical classification, pulmonary imaging findings, whole blood cell count, serum hypersensitivity C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin were statistically analyzed between the two groups. Chi-square, Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. Results: The most common pharyngeal symptoms were pharyngalgia (59.52%, 75/126), followed by foreign body sensation (23.02%, 29/126), pharyngeal dryness (8.73%, 11/126), and itching (8.73%, 11/126). The median age of the patients in the PS group was 51.50 years old, which was less than 57.50 years old in the non-PS group, showing a significant difference (P<0.05). The female cases accounted for 65.08% (82/126), which was higher than 53.72% (592/1 102) of the non-PS group (P<0.05). The incidence of bilateral lung inflammation confirmed by CT images was 73.81% (93/126), which was significantly lower than 83.48% (920/1 102) in the non-PS group (P<0.05).

Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a community-based sample of the American adult population. A multi\\\\item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites to recruit U.S. adults from the general population. A total of 1878 individuals participated in the study where the majority were: females (52%), Whites (74%), non-Hispanic (81%), married (56%), employed full time (68%), and with a bachelors degree or higher (77%). The likelihood of getting a COVID-19 immunization in the study population was: very likely (52%), somewhat likely (27%), not likely (15%), definitely not (7%), with individuals who had lower education, income, or perceived threat of getting infected being more likely to report that they were not likely/definitely not going to get COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., vaccine hesitancy). In unadjusted group comparisons, compared to their counterparts, vaccine hesitancy was higher among African-Americans (34%), Hispanics (29%), those who had children at home (25%), rural dwellers (29%), people in the northeastern U.S. (25%), and those who identified as Republicans (29%). In multiple regression analyses, vaccine hesitancy was predicted significantly by sex, education, employment, income, having children at home, political affiliation, and the perceived threat of getting infected with COVID-19 in the next 1 year.

The accuracy of the microbiome prediction of COVID-19 severity was found to be far superior to that from training similar models using information from comorbidities often adopted to triage patients in the clinic (77% AUC). Additionally, by combining symptoms, comorbidities, and the intestinal microbiota the model reached the highest AUC at 96%. Remarkably the model training on the stool microbiome found enrichment of Enterococcus faecalis, a known pathobiont, as the top predictor of COVID-19 disease severity.

Monopolar electrosurgery compared with other energy sources is associated with unique characteristics and inherent risks and complications caused by inadvertent direct or capacitive coupling or insulation failure of instruments. These dangers become particularly important with the reemergence of single-port laparoscopy, which requires close proximity and crossing of multiple intraabdominal instruments outside the surgeon's field of view. STUDY OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of monopolar electrosurgery on various tissues/organs during simulated single-port laparoscopic surgery in vitro and in vivo. DESIGN Simulation in a dry laboratory with fresh sheep liver, pig bowel and bowel in an anesthetized dog (Canadian Classification II-3). SETTING University-affiliated teaching hospital and animal facilities. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We used Valleylab Force 2 and FX electrosurgical generators at clinically used power outputs of 40 to 60 watts, and both high- and low-voltage (coagulation and cut) waveforms and commercially-available single-port devices. The effect on tissue was recorded by pictures and video camera and graded visually and histologically with hematoxylin and eosin stains. During activation of any standard monopolar laparoscopic instrument (scissors, coagulating electrode, etc), capacitive coupled currents resulting in visible tissue burn (blanching) caused by other adjacent cold instrument (graspers, etc) including metallic suction-irrigation cannulas and the laparoscope itself were noted. Histopathologic study confirmed transmural thermal damage extending to the mucosa of small bowel, even in the presence of mild serosa blanching. With prolonged activation of the electrosurgical generator, the capacitive coupled corona discharge burned the insulation and caused rapid insulation breakdown of the electrode instrument resulting in direct coupling (sparking, arcing) to adjacent cold instruments and more severe burning to the contacted tissue/organ.

The risk of medication errors was clearly established and considered. RESULTS: Despite an increased demand, our hospital has not experienced any disruption in the supply of curare medications. But the risk of curare shortages has led to the registration of new pharmaceutical forms and dosages never used before. We also observed necessary switches between different curares. All of this has contributed to an increased risk of medication errors. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmaceutical management of curare medications has been particularly critical.

Lions on farms often have direct contact with people, such as farm workers and tourists. Such close contact between wild animals and humans creates opportunities for the spread of zoonotic diseases (diseases that can be passed between animals and people). To help understand the health risks associated with lion farms, our study compiled a list of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi) known to affect African lions. We reviewed 148 scientific papers and identified a total of 63 pathogens recorded in both wild and captive lions, most of which were parasites (35, 56%), followed by viruses (17, 27%) and bacteria (11, 17%). This included pathogens that can be passed from lions to other animals and to humans. We also found a total of 83 diseases and clinical symptoms associated with these pathogens. Given that pathogens and their associated infectious diseases can cause harm to both animals and public health, we recommend that the lion farming industry in South Africa takes action to prevent and manage potential disease outbreaks. ABSTRACT: African lions (Panthera leo) are bred in captivity on commercial farms across South Africa and often have close contact with farm staff, tourists, and other industry workers. As transmission of zoonotic diseases occurs through close proximity between wildlife and humans, these commercial captive breeding operations pose a potential risk to thousands of captive lions and to public health. An understanding of pathogens known to affect lions is needed to effectively assess the risk of disease emergence and transmission within the industry. Here, we conduct a systematic search of the academic literature, identifying 148 peer-reviewed studies, to summarize the range of pathogens and parasites known to affect African lions. A total of 63 pathogenic organisms were recorded, belonging to 35 genera across 30 taxonomic families. Over half were parasites (35, 56%), followed by viruses (17, 27%) and bacteria (11, 17%). A number of novel pathogens representing unidentified and undescribed species were also reported. Among the pathogenic inventory are species that can be transmitted from lions to other species, including humans. In addition, 83 clinical symptoms and diseases associated with these pathogens were identified. Given the risks posed by infectious diseases, this research highlights the potential public health risks associated with the captive breeding industry.

There are several factors that, potentially, can contribute to the differentiated impact of COVID-19, and explain the disparities seen among areas. This study aims to contribute to this debate by analysing the role of health system and social trust in lessening the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in French dpartements. METHODS: The data used in this study have been provided by the INSEE and the French Ministry of Health. Database is made up of the 96 dpartements of metropolitan France. We use spatial analysis techniques to identify the groups of areas that are particularly affected, and to test the influence of local socioeconomic factors on the spread of the epidemic. RESULTS: Our exploratory spatial analysis reveals the heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation of the disease. The use of spatial econometric models, then, allows us to highlight the impact of emergency services, and social capital in reducing the exposition to Covid-19. Our results also report on the role of spillover effects between neighbouring areas.

Here, the p26 movement protein from Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) was found to phase separate and partition in nucleoli and G3BP stress granules (SGs) in vivo. Electrostatic interactions drive p26 phase separation as mutation of basic (R/K-G) or acidic (D/E-G) residues either blocked or reduced phase separation, respectively. During infection, p26 must partition inside the nucleolus and interact with fibrillarin (Fib2) as a pre-requisite for systemic trafficking of viral RNAs. Partitioning of p26 in pre-formed Fib2 droplets was dependent on p26 phase separation suggesting that phase separation of viral movement proteins supports nucleolar partitioning and virus movement. Furthermore, viral ribonucleoprotein complexes containing p26, Fib2, and PEMV2 RNA were formed via phase separation in vitro and could provide the basis for self-assembly in planta. Interestingly, both R/K-G and D/E-G p26 mutants failed to support systemic trafficking of a Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) vector in Nicotiana benthamiana suggesting that p26 phase separation, proper nucleolar partitioning, and systemic movement are intertwined. p26 also partitioned in SGs and G3BP over-expression restricted PEMV2 accumulation >20-fold. Expression of phase separation-deficient G3BP only restricted PEMV2 5-fold, demonstrating that G3BP phase separation is critical for maximum antiviral activity. AUTHOR SUMMARY Phase separation of several cellular proteins is associated with forming pathological aggregates and exacerbating neurodegenerative disease progression. In contrast, roles for viral protein phase separation in RNA virus lifecycles are less understood. Here, we demonstrate that the p26 movement protein from Pea enation mosaic virus 2 phase separates and partitions with phase-separated cellular proteins fibrillarin and G3BP. The related orthologue from Groundnut rosette virus has been extensively studied and is known to interact with fibrillarin in the nucleolus as a pre-requisite for virus movement. We determined that basic residues and electrostatic interactions were critical for p26 phase separation. Furthermore, mutation of charged residues prevented the rescue of a movement-deficient Tobacco mosaic virus vector in Nicotiana benthamiana. Stress granules form through phase separation and we found that p26 could partition inside stress granules following heat shock. Phase separation of the stress granule nucleator G3BP was required for maximum antiviral activity and constitutes a host response that is dependent on cellular protein phase separation. Collectively, we demonstrate that phase separation of a plant virus protein facilitates virus-host interactions that are required for virus movement and phase separation of cellular proteins can simultaneously restrict virus replication.","output":"Phase separation of both a plant virus movement protein and cellular factors support virus-host interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy is context specific and varies over time and space.

We argue that vaccination rates during the different phases of COVID-19 vaccination across the districts is likely to be related to vaccine hesitancy. Districts with larger rural population and lower literacy rates had lower vaccination rates. High past child immunization rates were positively correlated with COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Across the four phases of vaccination drive, vaccine hesitancy was the highest during the third phase of the vaccination drive, and therefore the above correlations were strongest during the third and the fourth phase. Measures of family planning indicators too seem to be correlated with vaccine uptakes during the third phase which indicate the regions most susceptible to vaccine hesitancy.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in India: An Exploratory Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Few months after the COVID-19 pandemic burst, many aspects of the human life, including education, dramatically changed. Because of the lockdown measures taken to limit the virus spread in Italy, in-person teaching and learning have been interrupted in all health care disciplines and readapted in virtual formulae. METHODS: As academic ophthalmology departments, we had to maintain the educational needs of medical and orthoptic students, internships, surgical training of residents, as well as to cover the scientific update of health care personnel (HCPs), and the continuation of research and academic activities. To assure these needs we ideated an educational strategy and a team, which was then translated on a multichannel virtual platform created with Microsoft Teams. RESULTS: In this platform there were 21 channels organized in a public view mode, open to all Team members, or in private view mode to separate non-permanent HCPs, internships, residents, and students' tasks, from permanent HCPs tasks. Virtual channels were dedicated to provide theoretical lessons, clinical cases, surgical video, internal meetings and webinar, to offer news from scientific societies, requests of appointments from biomedical companies, links with ophthalmological websites, to move forward research projects, to participate at institutional academic duties, and to obtain feedbacks from users. Residents continued their training on surgery using a surgical simulator, after consulting an agenda uploaded into the dedicated virtual channel. CONCLUSION: These positive initial results should represent a boost to rapidly proceed with the development of even more versatile virtual learning solutions, given that the forecasts for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic are not encouraging.","output":"Virtual learning solutions in COVID-19 era: University Italian Ophthalmology department perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study examined the effects of vision, calling and membership on organizational commitment and performance in the Asian and European context, which according to our knowledge has not been sufficiently employed previously. Firstly, by drawing on the spiritual leadership concept, the differences between leaders spirituality in Poland and Bhutan were examined. Secondly, the relationships between the constructs: vision, calling, membership, organizational commitment and performance of both Polish and Bhutanese managers were studied. METHODS: This study adopted the spiritual leadership scale proposed by Fry. The data used in this study were gathered through a survey of 194 managers. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the path coefficient were applied in the study. RESULTS: By comparing spiritual dimensions of leadership, the study demonstrated positive and significant relationships between the constructs that influence each other in various ways. The study indicates that the strength of the influence of specific dimensions depends on the perception of their significance for managers due to the cultural context. CONCLUSION: The study contributed to the literature by examining the dimensions of spiritual leadership that are endorsed differently by the Polish and the Bhutanese managers.

Recently, DESTINY-Gastric01 demonstrated a survival benefit utilizing the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab deruxtecan in gastric cancer patients that progressed on trastuzumab. AREAS COVERED /The authors give background to gastric cancer/HER2 and discuss prognostic implications of HER2 overexpression. They also describe initial trials of anti-HER2 therapy, resistance mechanisms, and ADC development/optimization. Finally, the authors review DESTINY-Gastric01 and provide future perspectives. EXPERT OPINION While the 2010 ToGA trial demonstrated efficacy of trastuzumab in HER2 positive gastric cancer, subsequent trials of HER2-directed therapy have disappointed. Downregulation of HER2 after trastuzumab may play a role; however, trastuzumab deruxtecan maintains some efficacy in low-level HER2 expressing tumors. The DESTINY-Gastric01 cohort was from South Korea/Japan; authors have reported differences in gastric cancer risk factors/physiology between Eastern and Western populations.

Oxidative stress is attributed to such pathological condition that further contributes to the initiation and progression of liver injury. In the present study, we have investigated if the strong antioxidant power of Nicotinamide (NA), Vitamin B2 (VB2), and Vitamin C (VC) can ameliorate TAA-induced oxidative stress-mediated liver injury in the rats. METHODS: Thirty-six albino rats were divided into six groups: Control group; TAA group (IP injection with TAA at a dosage of 200 mg/Kg three times a week for two months); TAA + NA group (rats administered with NA at a dosage of 200 mg/kg daily besides TAA as in the control); TAA + VB2 group (rats administered with vitamin B2 at a dosage of 30 mg/kg daily besides injection with TAA); TAA + VC group (rats administered with vitamin C at a dosage of 200 mg/kg daily along with injection of TAA). TAA + NA + VB + VC group (rats administered the with the three vitamins daily in TAA pre-injected at the respective doses described above). RESULTS: Treatment of rats with TAA led to a significant elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in the serum samples. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyproline and nitic oxide (NO) were also significantly increased in the TAA-treated rats, while reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly compromised in the hepatic samples. Rats administered with NA, VB2, and VC as individually or in combination ameliorated the deleterious effects of TAA that was confirmed by histopathology. However, the combination of the three vitamins was found more effective as compared to each of the vitamins. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrates that NA, VB2, and VC cross-talk with each other that act as a more potent biochemical chain of antioxidant defense against TAA-induced toxicities in vivo.","output":"Potential effects of the combination of nicotinamide, vitamin B2 and vitamin C on oxidative-mediated hepatotoxicity induced by thioacetamide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study is a synthesizing analysis of international literature on correlations between sustainability, sport, and physical activity.

Results indicated that online participatory violence prevention interventions may on the one hand be undermined by material factors such as access to devices, familiarity with technology, Internet infrastructure, and recruitment strategies. On the other hand, young people's preference for online engagement, the ability to reach those less inclined to take part in in-person interventions, and the potential for continued engagement in cases of participants on the move were raised. Online group-based participatory violence interventions are crucial for situations when in-person meeting may not be possible.

In response, a research and data-sharing collaborativeThe COVID-19 Critical Care Consortiumhas been assembled to harness the cumulative experience of intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. The resulting observational study provides a platform to rapidly disseminate detailed data and insights crucial to improving outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an international, multicentre, observational study of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to ICUs. This is an evolving, open-ended study that commenced on 1 January 2020 and currently includes >350 sites in over 48 countries. The study enrols patients at the time of ICU admission and follows them to the time of death, hospital discharge or 28 days post-ICU admission, whichever occurs last. Key data, collected via an electronic case report form devised in collaboration with the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium/Short Period Incidence Study of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness networks, include: patient demographic data and risk factors, clinical features, severity of illness and respiratory failure, need for non-invasive and/or mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and associated complications, as well as data on adjunctive therapies.

The uses of novel modalities have been elaborately demonstrated in this study as a proof of concept that echocardiography has a place in routine general practice with supportive evidence being as recent as its role in the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. Despite such evidence, many uses remain off-label and unexploited in practice. Generalization of echocardiography at the point of care can become a much-needed turning point in the clinical approach to case management.

We show how public health policies and their effects can be modelled to estimate the probability of elimination of SARS-COV-2 under i) strict physical distancing policies implemented in New Zealand and Australia on the 26th and 28th March, respectively, continuing until such time that elimination is achieved;and ii) the same policy, but with physical distancing decaying over 60 days to 26th and 28th of May. Methods: We developed an agent-based SEIR model that simulated key aspects of both countrys populations, disease, spatial and behavioural dynamics, as well as the mechanism and effect of public health policy responses on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Findings: Under maintained strong physical distancing, we estimated a median elimination date of July 12th for Australia (95% SI: June 5th to August 28th) and June 3rd for New Zealand (95% SI May 4th to June 27th). A 90% probability of elimination is achievable in Australia on August 17th (95% SI: August 8th C August 30th) and on June 14th (95% SI: June 17th C June 29th) in New Zealand. However, under our scenario of decaying adherence to physical distancing from implementation to 60 days post restrictions, a rebound in SARS-CoV-2 infections (i.e., a second wave) was likely in Australia and possibly in New Zealand. At 100 days, the probability of elimination was reduced to 10% in Australia and 68% in New Zealand. Interpretation: The findings suggest that with the effective implementation and maintenance of public health policies limiting physical interaction, it was possible to estimate a pattern the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in both countries. It seems highly likely NZ will have successfully eliminated as of 8 June, but not in Australia;the latter is consistent with our lower probabilities that modelled less stringent restrictions applied in Australia.","output":"Modelling the estimated likelihood of eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Australia and New Zealand under public health policy settings: an agent-based-SEIR approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. OBJECTIVE: To describe the long-term outcome of functional independence and quality of life (QoL) for individuals with traumatic and ischemic SCI beyond the first year after injury. SETTING: A multicenter study in Germany. METHODS: Participants of the European multicenter study about spinal cord injury (EMSCI) of three German SCI centers were included and followed over time by the German spinal cord injury cohort study (GerSCI). Individuals most recent spinal cord independence measure (SCIM) scores assessed by a clinician were followed up by a self-report (SCIM-SR) and correlated to selected items of the WHO short survey of quality of life (WHO-QoL-BREF). RESULTS: Data for 359 individuals were obtained. The average time passed the last clinical SCIM examination was 81.47 (SD 51.70) months. In total, 187 of the 359 received questionnaires contained a completely evaluable SCIM-SR.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is increasingly associated with cardiovascular complications requiring hospitalizations; however, the mechanisms underlying these complications remain unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) are gasotransmitters that regulate key cardiovascular functions. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 68 COVID-19 patients and 33 controls and NO and H(2)S metabolites were assessed. H(2)S and NO levels were compared between cases and controls in the entire study population and subgroups based on race. The availability of gasotransmitters was examined based on severity and outcome of COVID-19 infection. The performance of H(2)S and NO levels in predicting COVID-19 infection was also analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the effects of traditional determinants of gasotransmitters on NO and H(2)S levels in the patients with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Significantly reduced NO and H(2)S levels were observed in both Caucasian and African American COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. COVID-19 patients who died had significantly higher NO and H(2)S levels compared to COVID-19 patients who survived. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis of NO and H(2)S metabolites in the study population showed free sulfide levels to be highly predictive of COVID-19 infection based on reduced availability. Traditional determinants of gasotransmitters, namely age, race, sex, diabetes, and hypertension had no effect on NO and H(2)S levels in COVID-19 patients.

The goal of this review is to employ the novel evidence synthesis technique of a network meta-analysis to assess the comparative effectiveness of surgical technologies in thyroid surgery and contribute to enhanced governance in the field of thyroid surgery. METHODS Articles published between January 2000 and June 2012 were identified from Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, and PubMed databases. Randomized controlled trials of any size comparing the use of ultrasonic coagulation (harmonic scalpel) or Ligasure either head-to-head or against the \\"clamp-and-tie\\" technique were included. Two reviewers independently critically appraised and extracted the data from each study. The number of patients who experienced postoperative events was extracted in dichotomous format or continuous outcomes. Odds ratios were calculated by a Bayesian network meta-analysis, and metaregression was used for pair-wise comparisons. Indirect and direct comparisons were performed and inconsistency was assessed. RESULTS Thirty-five randomized controlled trials with 2856 patients were included. Ultrasonic coagulation ranked first (followed by Ligasure and then clamp-and-tie) with the lowest risk of postoperative hypoparathyroidism (odds ratio 1.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-2.67] and 0.70 [CI 0.43-1.13], ultrasonic coagulation vs. Ligasure and ultrasonic coagulation vs. clamp-and-tie, respectively), least blood loss (-0.25 [CI -0.84 to -0.35] and -1.22 [CI -1.85 to -0.59]), and drain output (0.28 [CI -0.35 to -0.91] and -0.36 [CI -0.70 to -0.03]). From a health technology viewpoint, ultrasonic coagulation was associated with the shortest operative time (-0.66 [CI -1.17 to -0.14] and -1.29 [CI -1.59 to -1.00]) and hospital stay (-0.28 [CI -0.78 to 0.22] and -0.56 [CI -1.28 to 0.15]).

We aimed to investigate possible interactions between adiponectin-related genetic variants and habitual dietary patterns on metabolic health among children with normal weight versus overweight/obesity, and whether these effects in childhood longitudinally contribute to metabolic risk at follow-up. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In total, 3,317 Chinese children aged 6-18 at baseline and 339 participants at 10-year follow-up from the Beijing Child and Adolescent Metabolic Syndrome study cohort were included. Baseline lifestyle factors, plasma adiponectin levels, and six adiponectin-related genetic variants resulting from GWAS in East Asians (loci in/near ADIPOQ, CDH13, WDR11FGF, CMIP, and PEPD) were assessed for their associations with the metabolic disorders. Being metabolically unhealthy was defined by exhibiting any metabolic syndrome component. RESULTS: Among the six loci, ADIPOQ rs6773957 (OR 1.26, 95% CI:1.07-1.47, P = 0.004) and adiponectin receptor CDH13 rs4783244 (0.82, 0.69-0.96, P = 0.017) were correlated with metabolic risks independent of lifestyle factors in normal-weight children, but the associations were less obvious in those with overweight/obesity. A significant interaction between rs6773957 and diet (Pinteraction = 0.004) for metabolic health was observed in normal-weight children.

METHODS This qualitative study included structured interviews and online surveys of key stakeholders: HTF members, surgeons, nurses, patients, hospital administrators, healthcare payers and medical suppliers. Questions included perceptions of recurrence and complication rates, their etiologies, perceived deficits in current hernia care and the most effective and training modalities. RESULTS A total of 841 participants included 665 surgeons, 66 patient care team members, 12 hospital administrators and 14 medical supply providers. Assessment of technical approach revealed that nearly 26 % of surgeons apply the same, limited range of techniques to all patients without evaluation of patient-specific factors. The majority (71 %) of surgeon respondents related hernia recurrence rates nearing 25 % or more. HTF members implicated surgeon factors (deficits in knowledge/technique, etc.) as primary determinants of recurrences, whereas nurses, medical supply providers and hospital administrators implicated patient health factors. Surgeons preferred attending conferences (82 %), reading periodicals/publications (71 %), watching videos (59 %) and communicating with peers (57 %) for learning and skill improvement. Topics of the greatest interest were advanced techniques for hernia repairs (71 %), preoperative and intraoperative decision making (56 %) and patient outcomes (64 %). Eighty-six percent of nurses felt that there was room for improvement in hernia patient safety and teamwork in the OR. Only 24 % believed that the patients had adequate preoperative education. CONCLUSIONS Major reported deficits in hernia care include: lack of standardization in training and care, \\"one size fits all\\" technical approach and inadequate patient follow-up/outcome measures.

Evolving deep learning techniques in medical image analysis results in efficient feedback in quick time. Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a genetic disorder, triggered by the mutation in Guanine Nucleotide binding protein with alpha stimulatory activities in the human bone genesis. It slowly occupies the bone marrow and converts the bone cell into fibrous tissues. It weakens the bone structure and leads to permanent disability. This paper proposes the study of FD bone image analyzing techniques with deep networks. Also, the linear regression model is annotated for predicting the bone abnormality levels with observed coefficients. Modern image processing begins with various image filters.

Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some negative experiences were more common in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, differences between countries and between families with and without a mental health condition were generally small, indicating that many parents across countries reported negative experiences. Some parents also reported positive experiences of homeschooling. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities.

The outcomes assessed were mortality at 28 days, mechanical ventilation, and time to discharge. Results: Eight studies (with 6,311 patients) were included in the analysis. In total, 3,267 patients received tocilizumab, and 3,044 received standard care/placebo. Pooled analysis showed a significantly decreased risk of mortality at 28 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97, p=0.009) and progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.90, p=0.0002) in the tocilizumab arm compared to standard therapy or placebo.

We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism. Importance Virus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control by host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as host factors to facilitate the entry of several human pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus and yellow fever virus.

However, in vivo detection of the status of brain thiamine metabolism is still unavailable and needs to be developed. METHODS A novel PET tracer of 18F-deoxy-thiamine was synthesized using an automated module via a two-step route. The main quality control parameters, such as specific activity and radiochemical purity, were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Radiochemical concentration was determined by radioactivity calibrator. Metabolic kinetics and the level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in brains of mice and marmosets were studied by micro-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). In vivo stability, renal excretion rate, and biodistribution of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in the mice were assayed using HPLC and -counter, respectively. Also, the correlation between the retention of cerebral 18F-deoxy-thiamine in 60 min after injection as represented by the area under the curve (AUC) and blood thiamine levels was investigated. RESULTS The 18F-deoxy-thiamine was stable both in vitro and in vivo. The uptake and clearance of 18F-deoxy-thiamine were quick in the mice. It reached the max standard uptake value (SUVmax) of 4.61  0.53 in the liver within 1 min, 18.67  7.04 in the kidney within half a minute. The SUV dropped to 0.72  0.05 and 0.77  0.35 after 60 min of injection in the liver and kidney, respectively. After injection, kidney, liver, and pancreas exhibited high accumulation level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine, while brain, muscle, fat, and gonad showed low accumulation concentration, consistent with previous reports on thiamine distribution in mice. Within 90 min after injection, the level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in the brain of C57BL/6 mice with thiamine deficiency (TD) was 1.9 times higher than that in control mice, and was 3.1 times higher in ICR mice with TD than that in control mice. The AUC of the tracer in the brain of marmosets within 60 min was 29.33  5.15 and negatively correlated with blood thiamine diphosphate levels (r = - 0.985, p = 0.015).

In 1996, thanks to its distinctive characteristics (specific environmental conditions and production method), Regulation (EC) No. 1107/96 recognized it as a Protected Designation of Origin product. The limited availability of milk and the increased demand for buffalo mozzarella cheese, especially during the spring-summer period (when milk production is lowest), have induced the use of frozen milk or curd for its production. The aim of this research was to provide preliminary results about the effect of freezing on microbial communities of fresh buffalo milk, curd and Buffalo Mozzarella cheese, and on physical properties (whiteness, hardness, and oxidation state) of Buffalo Mozzarella cheese. The preliminary results obtained have allowed us to conclude that the freezing process if properly carried out, does not compromise the microbiological quality of the products but produces only slight changes of some physical properties. ABSTRACT: Buffalo Mozzarella cheese from Campania is one of the most worldwide appreciated Italian dairy products. The increased demand for buffalo dairy products and the limited availability of the finest buffalo milk has prompted the diffusion of illicit practices, such as the use of milk, curd, or other products that are frozen or bought at low cost. The aim of this research was to provide preliminary results about the trend of the microbial communities of buffalo milk, curd and Buffalo Mozzarella cheese, during freezing storage of eleven months. At the same time, the alterations of physical properties and the presence of the molecular marker 4-casein, have been investigated. The results showed that freezing reduced the concentrations of the total bacterial count, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, Escherichia coli and yeasts in fresh milk and, the concentrations of the total bacterial count, coliforms, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in mature curd. In the finished product, no notable decreases were observed, except for lactic acid bacteria. About the 4-casein, no increase was observed in all matrices.

Extension studies, or roll-over studies, are studies that allow for patients participating in a parent clinical trial to roll-over into a subsequent related study to continue to observe and measure long-term safety, tolerability, and/or effectiveness. These designs are not new and are often used as an approach to satisfy regulatory post-approval safety requirements. However, designs using traditional clinical trial infrastructure can be expensive and burdensome to conduct, particularly, when following patients for many years post trial completion. Given the increasing availability and access of real-world data (RWD) sources, direct-to-patient technologies, and novel real-world study designs, there are more cost-efficient approaches to conducting extension studies while assessing important long-term outcomes. Here, we describe various fit-for-purpose design options for extension studies, discuss related methodological considerations, and provide scientific and operational guidance on practices when planning to conduct an extension study using RWD.

Most of the researchers focused on drugs used in other viral infections or malaria. We have not seen such mobilization towards one topic in this century. The whole situation makes clear that progress needs to be made in antiviral drug development. The first step to do it is to characterize the potential antiviral activity of new or already existed drugs on the market. Phenothiazines are antipsychotic agents used previously as antiseptics, anthelminthics, and antimalarials. Up to date, they are tested for a number of other disorders including the broad spectrum of viruses. The goal of this paper was to summarize the current literature on activity toward RNA-viruses of such drugs like chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and thioridazine. We identified 49 papers, where the use of the phenothiazines for 23 viruses from different families were tested. Chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and thioridazine possess anti-viral activity towards different types of viruses. These drugs inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis, cell-cell fusion, infection, replication of the virus, decrease viral invasion as well as suppress entry into the host cells. Additionally, since the drugs display activity at nontoxic concentrations they have therapeutic potential for some viruses, still, further research on animal and human subjects are needed in this field to verify cell base research.","output":"Antiviral activity of chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and thioridazine towards RNA-viruses.

These chemicals are often difficult to test for mutagenicity by the Ames test because of their low production and peculiar odor. Therefore, application of the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach is being considered. We used the StarDrop? Auto-Modeller? to develop a new QSAR model. RESULTS In the first step, we developed a new robust Ames database of 406 food flavor chemicals consisting of existing Ames flavor chemical data and newly acquired Ames test data. Ames results for some existing flavor chemicals have been revised by expert reviews. We also collected 428 Ames test datasets for industrial chemicals from other databases that are structurally similar to flavor chemicals. A total of 834 chemicals' Ames test datasets were used to develop the new QSAR models. We repeated the development and verification of prototypes by selecting appropriate modeling methods and descriptors and developed a local QSAR model. A new QSAR model \\"StarDrop NIHS 834_67\\" showed excellent performance (sensitivity: 79.5%, specificity: 96.4%, accuracy: 94.6%) for predicting Ames mutagenicity of 406 food flavors and was better than other commercial QSAR tools.

Invasion of the red blood cell by Plasmodium merozoites is essential for parasite survival and proliferation, thus representing an attractive target for therapeutic development. Red blood cell invasion requires a co-ordinated series of protein/protein interactions, protease cleavage events, intracellular signals, organelle release and engagement of an actin-myosin motor, which provide many potential targets for drug development. As these steps occur in the bloodstream, they are directly susceptible and exposed to drugs. A number of invasion inhibitors against a diverse range of parasite proteins involved in these different processes of invasion have been identified, with several showing potential to be optimised for improved drug-like properties.

Thus, research for alternate chemical compounds from natural products is necessary to control Aedes larvae. This study explores the analysis of chemical compositions from Areca catechu nut as a potential larvicide for Aedes (Diptera: Culicidae). METHODS: The Areca catechu nut collected from Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia was grounded into powder and used for Soxhlet extraction. The chemical analysis of the extracts and their structures were identified using the GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu) system. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Chemistry WebBook, Standard Reference Database 69 (https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/) and PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the two databases used to retrieve the synonyms, molecular formula, molecular weight, and 2-dimensional (2D) structure of chemical compounds. Next, following WHO procedures for larval bioassays, the extracts were used to asses larvicidal activity against early 4(th) instar larvae of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. RESULTS: The larvicidal activities were observed against early 4(th) stage larvae with different concentrations in the range from 200 mg/L to 1600 mg/L. The LC(50) and LC(95) of Aedes aegypti were 621 mg/L and 2264 mg/L respectively; whereas the LC(50) and LC(95) of Aedes albopictus were 636 mg/L and 2268 mg/L respectively. Mortality was not observed in the non-target organism test. The analysis using gas chromatography and mass spectrometer recovered several chemical compounds such as Arecaidine, Dodecanoic acid, Methyl tetradecanoate, Tetradecanoic acid <n->, and n-Hexadecanoic acid bioactive components. These chemical constituents were used as additive formulations in pesticides, pest control, insect repellent, and insecticidal agents. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed significant outcomes from the extract of Areca catechu nut and it deserves further investigation in relation to chemical components and larvicidal actions between different species of Aedes mosquitoes.

Favorable 12-month safety and ablation precision were previously described. MATERIALS AND METHODS As a mandated safety criterion, TULSA was delivered as near whole-gland ablation, applying 3-mm margins sparing 10% of peripheral prostate tissue. After 12-month biopsy and MRI, biannual follow-up included prostate-specific antigen (PSA), adverse events, and functional quality of life assessment, with repeat systematic biopsy at three years. RESULTS Three-year follow-up was completed by 22 patients. Between one and three years, there were no new serious or severe adverse events. Urinary and bowel function remained stable. Erectile function recovered by one year, stable at three years. PSA decreased 95% to median (IQR) nadir of 0.33 (0.1-0.4)ng/ml, stable to 0.8 (0.4-1.6)ng/ml at three years. Serial biopsies identified clinically significant disease in 10/29 men (34%), any cancer in 17/29 (59%). By three years, seven men had recurrence (four histological, three biochemical) and had undergone salvage therapy without complications (including six prostatectomy). At three years, 3/22 men refused biopsy, and 2/22 (9%) had clinically significant disease (one new, one persistent). Predictors of salvage therapy requirement included less extensive ablation coverage and higher PSA nadir. CONCLUSION With three-year Phase I follow-up, TULSA demonstrates safe and precise ablation for men with localized prostate cancer, providing predictable PSA and biopsy outcomes, without affecting functional abilities or precluding salvage therapy.","output":"MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer: Three Year Outcomes of a Prospective Phase I Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: We seek to provide an understanding of the binding mechanism of Remdesivir, provide structural and conformational implications on SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase upon its binding and identify its crucial pharmacophoric moieties. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected over a million people, with over 65,000 deaths as of the first quarter of 2020. The current limitation of effective treatment options with no approved vaccine or targeted therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 has posed serious global health threats. This has necessitated several drug and vaccine development efforts across the globe. To date, the farthest in the drug development pipeline so far is Remdesivir. OBJECTIVES: We perform molecular dynamics simulation, quantify the energy contributions of binding site residues using per-residue energy decomposition calculations, and subsequently generate a pharmacophore model for the identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors. METHODS: Integrative molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic calculations coupled with advanced postmolecular dynamics analysis techniques were employed. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that the modulatory activity of Remdesivir is characterized by an extensive array of highaffinity and consistent molecular interactions with specific active site residues that anchor Remdemsivir within the binding pocket for efficient binding. These residues are ASP452, THR456, ARG555, THR556, VAL557, ARG624, THR680, SER681, and SER682. Results also showed that Remdesivir binding, induces minimal individual amino acid perturbations, subtly interferes with deviations of C-&#945; atoms and restricts the systematic transition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the \\"buried\\" hydrophobic region to the \\"surface-exposed\\" hydrophilic region. We also mapped a pharmacophore model based on observed high-affinity interactions with SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which showcased the crucial functional moieties of Remdesivir and was subsequently employed for virtual screening. CONCLUSION: The structural insights and the optimized pharmacophoric model provided would augment the design of improved analogs of Remdesivir that could expand treatment options for COVID-19.","output":"The Binding of Remdesivir to SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase May Pave The Way Towards the Design of Potential Drugs for COVID-19 Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan province, China.

Methods and materials Data collection was performed using the symptoms checklist-90 (SCL-90) survey between March and April of 2021. The data collected included demographic data as well as nine domains that include some of the most common psychiatric symptoms. The collected questionnaires were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Non-parametric tests were utilized, as the SCL-90 dimensions and global index scores follow a non-normal distribution. Results The questionnaire yielded 387 responses. Females comprised the majority of the participants. The most prevalent symptom described as extremely common by females was waking up early in the morning. The most commonly described symptom described as not at all by females was hearing words that others do not hear. There was no statistical difference in mental well-being between males and females. Older participants (>40 years old) had better mental well-being in comparison to their younger counterparts.

This article highlights some strategies for the country to fortify its defences to prevent the epsilon variant from spreading before it is too late, and emphasises that while identifying potential immune evasion mechanisms in SARS-COV-2 variants is critical in the fight against COVID-19, it is also critical to develop methods of efficient and cost-effective detection to identify an early outbreak and then vigilantly and systematically plan area lockdowns before any hope of conquering this pandemic is lost.","output":"Impending disaster: rise of the epsilon variant in Pakistan and the way forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a recently identified homologue of ACE that may counterregulate the actions of angiotensin (Ang) II by facilitating its breakdown to Ang 1-7. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis but the role of ACE2 in liver disease is not known. AIMS This study examined the effects of liver injury on ACE2 expression and activity in experimental hepatic fibrosis and human cirrhosis, and the effects of Ang 1-7 on vascular tone in cirrhotic rat aorta. METHODS In sham operated and bile duct ligated (BDL) rats, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to assess hepatic ACE2 mRNA, and western blotting and immunohistochemistry to quantify and localise ACE2 protein. ACE2 activity was quantified by quenched fluorescent substrate assay. Similar studies were performed in normal human liver and in hepatitis C cirrhosis. RESULTS ACE2 mRNA was detectable at low levels in rat liver and increased following BDL (363-fold; p < 0.01). ACE2 protein increased after BDL (23.5-fold; p < 0.05) as did ACE2 activity (fourfold; p < 0.05). In human cirrhotic liver, gene (>30-fold), protein expression (97-fold), and activity of ACE2 (2.4 fold) were increased compared with controls (all p < 0.01). In healthy livers, ACE2 was confined to endothelial cells, occasional bile ducts, and perivenular hepatocytes but in both BDL and human cirrhosis there was widespread parenchymal expression of ACE2 protein. Exposure of cultured human hepatocytes to hypoxia led to increased ACE2 expression. In preconstricted rat aorta, Ang 1-7 alone did not affect vascular tone but it significantly enhanced acetylcholine mediated vasodilatation in cirrhotic vessels. CONCLUSIONS ACE2 expression is significantly increased in liver injury in both humans and rat, possibly in response to increasing hepatocellular hypoxia, and may modulate RAS activity in cirrhosis.","output":"Chronic liver injury in rats and humans upregulates the novel enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme 2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Adolescence is an important life stage for the development of healthy behaviors, which have a long-lasting impact on health across the lifespan. Sleep undergoes significant changes during adolescence and is linked to physical and psychiatric health; however, sleep is rarely assessed in routine health care settings. Wearable sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) devices may represent user-friendly methods for assessing sleep among adolescents, but no studies to date have examined the feasibility and acceptability of sleep EEG wearables in this age group. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of sleep EEG wearable devices among adolescents aged 11 to 17 years. METHODS: A total of 104 adolescents aged 11 to 17 years participated in 7 days of at-home sleep recording using a self-administered wearable sleep EEG device (Zmachine Insight+, General Sleep Corporation) as well as a wristworn actigraph. Feasibility was assessed as the number of full nights of successful recording completed by adolescents, and acceptability was measured by the wearable acceptability survey for sleep. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed separately for the sleep EEG device and wristworn actigraph. RESULTS: A total of 94.2% (98/104) of adolescents successfully recorded at least 1 night of data using the sleep EEG device (mean number of nights 5.42; SD 1.71; median 6, mode 7). A total of 81.6% (84/103) rated the comfort of the device as falling in the comfortable to mildly uncomfortable range while awake. A total of 40.8% (42/103) reported typical sleep while using the device, while 39.8% (41/103) indicated minimal to mild device-related sleep disturbances. A minority (32/104, 30.8%) indicated changes in their sleep position due to device use, and very few (11/103, 10.7%) expressed dissatisfaction with their experience with the device. A similar pattern was observed for the wristworn actigraph device. CONCLUSIONS: Wearable sleep EEG appears to represent a feasible, acceptable method for sleep assessment among adolescents and may have utility for assessing and treating sleep disturbances at a population level. Future studies with adolescents should evaluate strategies for further improving usability of such devices, assess relationships between sleep EEGCderived metrics and health outcomes, and investigate methods for incorporating data from these devices into emerging digital interventions and applications.

Therefore, early identification of COVID-19 patients is the fastest way to restrain the spread of the pandemic. However, as the number of cases grows at an alarming pace, most developing countries are now facing a shortage of medical resources and testing kits. Besides, using testing kits to detect COVID-19 cases is a time-consuming, expensive, and cumbersome procedure. Faced with these obstacles, most physicians, researchers, and engineers have advocated for the advancement of computer-aided deep learning models to assist healthcare professionals in quickly and inexpensively recognize COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images. With this motivation, this paper proposes a CovidMulti-Net architecture based on the transfer learning concept to classify COVID-19 cases from normal and other pneumonia cases using three publicly available datasets that include 1341, 1341, and 446 CXR images from healthy samples and 902, 1564, and 1193 CXR images infected with Viral Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumonia, and COVID-19 diseases. In the proposed framework, features from CXR images are extracted using three well-known pre-trained models, including DenseNet-169, ResNet-50, and VGG-19. The extracted features are then fed into a concatenate layer, making a robust hybrid model. The proposed framework achieved a classification accuracy of 99.4%, 95.2%, and 94.8% for 2-Class, 3-Class, and 4-Class datasets, exceeding all the other state-of-the-art models.

Epidemiologic studies of patients with COVID-19 have shown a high percentage of hospitalized patients requiring intensive care and prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation and high mortality. The cellular mechanisms that underlie prolonged ventilator dependence and high mortality in these patients remain unknown. Previous studies in alveolar epithelial regeneration have identified the presence and a possible pathogenic role of a persistent transitional cell state that cuboidal type 2 cells (AEC2s) adopt during differentiation into squamous type 1 cells (AEC1s). This transitional state has a unique gene expression signature that includes strong expression or keratin 8 (Krt8). We hypothesized that ARDS secondary to COVID-19 was associated with the persistence of the transitional state of alveolar regeneration, perhaps contributing to prolonged ventilator dependence and mortality. Institutional review board approval was obtained for relevant clinical data. Briefly, the patients included in this study developed progressively worsening ARDS despite lung protective ventilation and adjunctive therapies, with progressive diffuse alveolar infiltrates on serial imaging. All patients died within two weeks of hospitalization, and all had persistent hypoxemia despite maximally tolerable ventilator support near the end of life. Lung tissue from autopsy specimens from these patients was utilized for immunofluorescence, hematoxylin and eosin, and trichrome staining. Histology was consistent with diffuse alveolar damage. Staining revealed extensive damage to AEC1s (Figure 1, stained for HTI-56) and AEC2s (not shown) and abundant Krt8hi transitional cells (Figure 1) in lung tissue from COVID-19 patients (Figure 1) without significant fibrosis. Our findings establis h the presence of Krt8hi transitional cells in conjunction with extensive alveolar epithelial damage and failure to regenerate AEC1s. We speculate that prolonged barrier dysfunction from dysregulated alveolar repair, perhaps mediated by a failure of Krt8hi transitional cells to differentiate into mature AEC1s, contributes to ventilator dependent respiratory failure and mortality. Though prior studies have suggested a role of persistent Krt8hi transitional cells in fibrosis, our findings suggest that prevalence of Krt8hi transitional cells alone is not sufficient to cause fibrosis, suggesting that that the extensive epithelial damage observed in COVID-19 ARDS is potentially reversible. We conclude that in severe COVID-19 ARDS, alveolar regeneration is incomplete, characterized by persistence of the Krt8hi transitional state but that differentiation of these cells into mature AEC1s resulting in barrier restoration and clinical recovery may still be possible.","output":"Ineffectual Alveolar Regeneration in COVID-19 ARDS: Persistence of Keratin-8 Positive Transitional Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physics-based multi-scale in silico models offer an excellent opportunity to study the effects of heterogeneous tissue damage on airflow and pressure distributions in COVID-19-afflicted lungs.

Furthermore, we investigated the effect of various levels of inflammation in a meso-scale acinar mechanics model on global lung dynamics. Our simulation results showed that as the severity of damage in the patient's right lower, left lower, and to some extent in the right upper lobe increased, ventilation was redistributed to the least injured right middle and left upper lobes.

However, it is still unknown whether the relative abundance or calculated activity of any LDH isoenzyme is predominately increased in COVID-19 subjects. METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients suffered from moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia were recruited into this study who showed enhanced total LDH activity. The ratio of LDH isoenzyme activities was further investigated using gel electrophoresis (Hydragel?, Sebia) with densitometric evaluation. Calculated activity values of these isoenzymes were correlated with routine laboratory parameters, the degree of lung parenchymal affection based on chest CT and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Total LDH activity was raised in the range of 272-2141 U/L and significantly correlated with calculated LDH-3 and LDH-4 activities (r=0.765, P=0.0001; and r=0.783, P=0.0001, respectively). In contrast, the relative abundance of neither LDH isoenzyme was exclusively abnormal in COVID-19 patients. Calculated activity of LDH-3 and LDH-4 demonstrated a modest but statistically significant association with serum ferritin (r=0.437, P=0.042; r=0.505, P=0.016, respectively). When the relationship between the severity of pulmonary affection by SARS-CoV-2 infection and relative abundance of LDH isoenzymes was studied, a larger ratio of mid-zone fractions was observed in the presence of  50% lung parenchymal involvement. Finally, regardless of LDH isoenzyme pattern, abnormal relative ratio of LDH-4 and higher calculated LDH-3 and LDH-4 activity values were detected in subjects with unfavorable outcome.

METHODS: An international group of researchers interested in children's environmental health was invited to identify knowledge gaps and to develop research questions to close these gaps. DISCUSSION: Key research questions identified include: what are the effects of SAR-Cov-2 infection during pregnancy on the developing fetus and child; what is the impact of age at infection and genetic susceptibility on disease severity; why do some children with COVID-19 infection develop toxic shock and Kawasaki-like symptoms; what are the impacts of toxic environmental exposures including poor air quality, chemical and metal exposures on innate immunity, especially in the respiratory epithelium; what is the possible role of a \\"dirty\\" environment in conveying protection - an example of the \\"hygiene hypothesis\\"; and what are the long term health effects of SARS-Cov-2 infection in early life.

Many regional health-care systems faced at least one wave of overwhelming COVID-19 case surges, and still face the possibility of a new wave of infections on the horizon, potentially in combination with other endemic diseases such as influenza, dengue, tuberculosis, and malaria. In this context, the need for an effective and scientifically informed leadership to sustain and improve global capacity to ensure international health security is starkly apparent. Public health blind spotting, promulgation of pseudoscience, and academic dishonesty emerged as significant threats to population health and stability during the pandemic. The goal of this consensus statement is to provide a focused summary of such blind spots identified during an expert group intense analysis of missed opportunities during the initial wave of the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Blind Spots: A Consensus Statement on the Importance of Competent Political Leadership and the Need for Public Health Cognizance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study investigated the seminal plasma proteome of Holstein bulls with low (LF; n = 6) and high (HF; n = 8) sperm freezability. The percentage of viable frozen-thawed sperm (%ViableSperm) determined by flow cytometry varied from -2.2 in LF to + 7.8 in HF bulls, as compared to the average %ViableSperm (54.7%) measured in an 860-sire population. Seminal proteins were analyzed by label free mass spectrometry, with the support of statistical and bioinformatics analyses. This approach identified 1,445 proteins, associated with protein folding, cell-cell adhesion, NADH dehydrogenase activity, ATP-binding, proteasome complex, among other processes. There were 338 seminal proteins differentially expressed (p < 0.05) in LF and HF bulls. Based on multivariate analysis, BSP5 and seminal ribonuclease defined the HF phenotype, while spermadhesin-1, gelsolin, tubulins, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, calmodulin, ATP synthase, sperm equatorial segment protein 1, peroxiredoxin-5, secretoglobin family 1D and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase characterized the LF phenotype. Regression models indicated that %ViableSperm of bulls was related to seminal plasma peroxiredoxin-5, spermadhesin-1 and the spermadhesin-1  BSP5 interaction (R2 = 0.84 and 0.79; p < 0.05).

The natural host of PRV is the swine, but it can infect most mammals, including cattle, rodents, and dogs. In these nonnatural hosts, PRV always causes a severe acute and lethal neuropathy called the \\"mad itch,\\" which is uncommon in swine. Thus far, the pathophysiological and immunological processes leading to the development of the neuropathic itch and the death of the animal are unclear. Using a footpad inoculation model, we established that mice inoculated with PRV-Becker (virulent strain) develop a severe pruritus in the foot and become moribund at 82 h postinoculation (hpi). We found necrosis and inflammation with a massive neutrophil infiltration only in the footpad and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) by hematoxylin and eosin staining. PRV load was detected in the foot, PNS, and central nervous system tissues by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Infected mice had elevated plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) and chemokines (Gro-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1). Significant IL-6 and G-CSF levels were detected in several tissues at 82 hpi. High plasma levels of C-reactive protein confirmed the acute inflammatory response to PRV-Becker infection. Moreover, mice inoculated with PRV-Bartha (attenuated, live vaccine strain) did not develop pruritus at 82 hpi. PRV-Bartha also replicated in the PNS, and the infection spread further in the brain than PRV-Becker. PRV-Bartha infection did not induce the specific and lethal systemic inflammatory response seen with PRV-Becker. Overall, we demonstrated the importance of inflammation in the clinical outcome of PRV infection in mice and provide new insights into the process of PRV-induced neuroinflammation.IMPORTANCE Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus related to human pathogens such as herpes simplex virus 1 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The natural host of PRV is the swine, but it can infect most mammals. In susceptible animals other than pigs, PRV infection always causes a characteristic lethal pruritus known as the \\"mad itch.\\" The role of the immune response in the clinical outcome of PRV infection is still poorly understood. Here, we show that a systemic host inflammatory response is responsible for the severe pruritus and acute death of mice infected with virulent PRV-Becker but not mice infected with attenuated strain PRV-Bartha. In addition, we identified IL-6 and G-CSF as two main cytokines that play crucial roles in the regulation of this process. Our findings give new insights into neuroinflammatory diseases and strengthen further the similarities between VZV and PRV infections at the level of innate immunity.","output":"Virulent Pseudorabies Virus Infection Induces a Specific and Lethal Systemic Inflammatory Response in Mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article deals with the issues of improving analytical support for risk assessment using the SWOT analysis of internal and external environment factors through the example of Russian-Chinese economic cooperation in the field of trade The analysis of the structural components of the most significant indicators of Russian-Chinese trade flows for the period of 2017-2018, preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, and the dynamics of export-import operations from January 2019 to June 2020 during the introduction of restrictive measures were performed Besides, the additional impact of the simultaneously developing currency crisis in Russia and possible measures to overcome it at the bilateral level were considered Based on the indicators of a very rapid return of Russian-Chinese foreign trade relations to close to pre-crisis ones within a short time, it can be assumed that an integrated approach to assessing, planning, and monitoring internal and external risks in the short and long term gives a positive result Therefore, the traditional analysis of internal factors that are the most predictable and subject to constant control by organisational leadership must be coordinated with a thorough analysis of uncertainty factors, which allows adapting to the rapidly changing business environment as quickly as possible As a result, the effectiveness of strategic planning and strategic analysis is significantly increased ?

STUDY DESIGN: Case series of 9 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment. Peptide plasma: Plasma with angiotensin (1?7) content 8C10 times higher than healthy plasma donors was obtained from suitable donors. Peptide plasma transfusion was applied to 9 patients whose clinical status and/or laboratory profile deteriorated and who needed intensive care for 2 days. RESULTS: In our COVID-19 cases, favipiravir, low molecular weight heparin treatment, which is included in the treatment protocol of the ministry of health, was started. Nine patients with oxygen saturation of 93% and below despite nasal oxygen support, whose clinical and/or laboratory deteriorated, were identified. The youngest of the cases was 36 years old, and the oldest patient was 85 years old. 6 of the 9 cases had male gender. 3 cases had been smoking for more than 10 years. 4 cases had at least one chronic disease. In all of our cases, SARS CoV2 lung involvement was bilateral and peptide plasma therapy was administered in cases when oxygen saturation was 93% and below despite nasal oxygen support of 5 liters/minute and above, and intensive care was required. Although it was not reflected in the laboratory parameters in the early period, 8 patients whose saturations improved with treatment were discharged without the need for intensive care. However, a similar response was not obtained in one case. Oxygen requirement increased gradually and, he died in intensive care process. An increase of the platelet count was observed in all cases following the peptide plasma treatment. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary case series of 9 critically ill patients with COVID-19, administration of plasma containing angiotensin (1?7) was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.","output":"Angiotensin (1?7) peptide replacement therapy with plasma transfusion in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical education has been experiencing a shortage of anatomy educators since as early as the 1960s. Causality for the shortage has been attributed to a variety of factors including lack of new trainees, decreased numbers of training programs, and changes in medical and graduate biomedical education. However, insight into retirement intentions, a key driver of faculty turnover, has yet to be investigated. With the mean age of the anatomy educator population on the rise, knowledge of the retirement intentions of current educators is essential to fully understanding the severity of the anatomy educator shortage. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine the retirement intentions of current anatomy educators and their effects on the anatomy educator workforce. METHODS Surveys were distributed to: 1) chairs/department heads to inquire about job postings on AAA's website from 2018-2020 (Job Posting Survey) and 2) the AAA membership through Anatomy Connected to explore retirement intentions (Retirement Intentions Survey). Survey responses were collected through Qualtrics XM. The Job Posting Survey determined reasons for posting the job and the length of time to fill the vacancy. Respondents of the Retirement Intentions Survey were grouped into 'less than 55 years of age' and '55 years and older' to determine age effects on retirement factors and timelines. The impact of SARS-COVID-19 on retirement intentions was also investigated. RESULTS For the Job Posting Survey, out of 252 unique job listings 42 responses were returned (16.7%). The majority of job postings were to fill an open position due to faculty retirement (36%), followed by faculty relocating/sabbatical/new responsibilities (31%), and a brand-new position (24%). More than half of the open positions were filled within 1-6 months; and 11 positions were left unfiled. One hundred ten anatomy educators completed The Retirement Intentions Survey (5.1%). Of these, 72 were 'less than 55 years of age' and 38 were '55 years and older.' All but two of those '55 years and older' intend to retire in less than 10 years, while 23 intend to retire in 5 years or less. Assuming the data holds for the greater anatomy educator population, extrapolation shows that 198 out of 325 regular AAA members who are '55 years and older' are expected to retire in the next 5 years. Among both age groups, the factors driving retirement intentions were overwhelmingly age and finances, closely followed by job satisfaction and family. Unlike those in the younger age group, those '55 years and older' commonly mentioned a desire to do other things (travel, enjoy family, etc.) and health as strong drivers of retirement. The ongoing SARS-COVID-19 pandemic had minimal to no effect on respondents' retirement intentions. CONCLUSION Anatomy educators are increasingly seeking retirement, particularly within the next 5 years, due to age and financial stability, outside of SARS-COVID-19 impacts. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPLICATION This study reveals that within 5 years, the retirement of anatomy educators will outpace the 22 new PhD graduates per year. Importantly, this does not account for the creation of new positions, further stressing medical education.","output":"Faculty retirements' impacts on the anatomy educator shortage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay considers the relationship between the experience of life shortening chronic illness and the current COVID-19 crisis.

Nursing students are regarded as healthcare workers in training and can also be vehicles of cross-contamination within the hospital. Thus, this study aimed to identify the predictors of hand hygiene practice among Saudi nursing students. A descriptive, cross-sectional, self-reported study was conducted among 198 Saudi nursing students. Knowledge, attitude, and practice of hand hygiene were assessed using the WHO Hand Hygiene Knowledge Questionnaire for Health-Care Workers and its adopted scales. A regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of hand hygiene practice. The respondents demonstrated moderate knowledge of hand hygiene (mean 13.20  2.80). The majority displayed a moderate attitude toward hand hygiene (52.1%), while only a few reported a poor attitude (13.1%). Approximately 68.7%, 29.8%, and 1.5% of the respondents reported moderate, good, and poor practice of hand hygiene, respectively. Having a good attitude toward hand hygiene, being male, being aware that hand hygiene is an effective intervention in preventing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), attendance at hand hygiene trainings and seminars, and being in the lower academic level of nursing education were identified as predictors of better hand hygiene practice. The importance of ensuring a positive attitude toward hand hygiene and improving awareness of hand hygiene is emphasized, as are educational interventions.

Depending on the control group used, cytokines have been found to be higher, similar or even lower in COVID-19 compared to critical illnesses associated with elevated cytokine concentrations. However, most of these studies do not take into account critical illness severity. Hence, we decided to compare cytokine levels in critically-ill COVID-19 patients and critically-ill patients of a general intensive care unit (ICU), who did not have sepsis or septic shock, but had an equal disease severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) were measured on ICU admission in mechanically ventilated, COVID-19 (N=36) and non-COVID-19 (N=30) patients, who had not received dexamethasone, and had equal critical illness severity. Non-COVID-19 patients did not have sepsis or septic shock. RESULTS: In our case control study, circulating IL-6 and IL-10 were lower, while TNF-&#945; and IL-8 levels were higher in critically-ill COVID-19 patients, compared to critically-ill non-COVID-19 patients.

METHOD: A quota survey design and a sampling frame that permitted recruitment of a national sample was employed. Findings for waves 1 (31 March to 9 April 2020), 2 (10 April to 27 April 2020) and 3 (28 April to 11 May 2020) are reported here. A range of mental health factors was assessed: pre-existing mental health problems, suicide attempts and self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, defeat, entrapment, mental well-being and loneliness. RESULTS: A total of 3077 adults in the UK completed the survey at wave 1. Suicidal ideation increased over time. Symptoms of anxiety, and levels of defeat and entrapment decreased across waves whereas levels of depressive symptoms did not change significantly. Positive well-being also increased. Levels of loneliness did not change significantly over waves. Subgroup analyses showed that women, young people (18-29 years), those from more socially disadvantaged backgrounds and those with pre-existing mental health problems have worse mental health outcomes during the pandemic across most factors.

Here we investigated the efficacy of amotosalen and ultraviolet A light (UVA) to inactivate MERS\\\\CoV in fresh\\\\frozen plasma (FFP). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Pooled FFP units were spiked with a recent clinical MERS\\\\CoV isolate. Infectious and genomic viral titers were determined in plasma before and after inactivation with amotosalen/UVA treatment by plaque assay and reverse transcriptionCquantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. In addition, residual replicating or live virus after inactivation was examined by passaging in the permissive Vero E6 cells. RESULTS: The mean MERS\\\\CoV infectious titer in pretreatment samples was 4.67  0.25 log plaque\\\\forming units (pfu)/mL, which was reduced to undetectable levels after inactivation with amotosalen/UVA demonstrating a mean log reduction of more than 4.67  0.25 pfu/mL.

We assessed self-reported public perceptions related to COVID-19 including, beliefs (e.g., severity, concerns, health), knowledge (e.g., transmission, information sources), and behaviors (e.g., physical distancing) to understand perspectives in Canada and to inform future public health initiatives. METHODS: We administered a national online survey aiming to obtain responses from 2000 adults in Canada. Respondent sampling was stratified by age, sex, and region. We used descriptive statistics to summarize responses and tested for regional differences using chi-squared tests, followed by weighted logistic regression. RESULTS: We collected 1,996 eligible questionnaires between April 26(th) and May 1(st), 2020. One-fifth (20%) of respondents knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19, but few had tested positive themselves (0.6%). Negative impacts of pandemic conditions were evidenced in several areas, including concerns about healthcare (e.g. sufficient equipment, 52%), pandemic stress (45%), and worsening social (49%) and mental/emotional (39%) health. Most respondents (88%) felt they had good to excellent knowledge of virus transmission, and predominantly accessed (74%) and trusted (60%) Canadian news television, newspapers/magazines, or non-government news websites for COVID-19 information. We found high compliance with distancing measures (80% reported self-isolating or always physical distancing). We identified associations between region and self-reported beliefs, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: We found that information about COVID-19 is largely acquired through domestic news sources, which may explain high self-reported compliance with prevention measures. The results highlight the broader impact of a pandemic on the general publics overall health and wellbeing, outside of personal infection. The study findings should be used to inform public health communications during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","output":"A national cross-sectional survey of public perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic: Self-reported beliefs, knowledge, and behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Trentino is an Italian province with a tourism-based economy, bordering the regions of Lombardy and Veneto, where the two earliest and largest outbreaks of COVID-19 occurred in Italy.

This study aimed to estimate differences in the proportion and the amount of OOP expenditures among Peruvians during the pre- and post-mandatory lockdown response to COVID-19 in 2020 according to the health insurance coverage status. METHODS: This study utilized repeated cross-sectional data from the National Household Survey on Living and Poverty Conditions (ENAHO) from the first quarter of 2017 until the fourth quarter of 2020. The outcomes were (i) the proportion of individuals who incurred OOP expenditures and (ii) the monetary value of OOP expenditures. An interrupted time series analysis (ITS) and a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference (DID) analysis were performed to examine the outcomes among the control (individuals without health insurance) and treatment groups (individuals with health insurance) after the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: ITS analysis showed that the proportion of individuals reporting OOP expenditures after implementation of mandatory lockdown due to COVID-19 in Peru decreased in both groups, but no difference in the slope trend was found (P=.916). The average quarterly amount of OOP spending increased in both groups, but no difference in the slope trend was found (P=.073). Lastly, the DID analysis showed that the mandatory lockdown was associated with a higher amount of OOP, but there was no evidence to indicate that the higher amount was different between the control and treatment groups.

A high-performance magnetic quantum dot with a triple-QD shell (MagTQD) nanotag was first fabricated and integrated into the LFIA system to provide superior fluorescence signals, enrichment ability, and detectability for S/NP antigen testing. Two detection modes were provided by the proposed MagTQD-LFIA. The direct mode was used for rapid screening or urgent detection of suspected samples within 10 min, and the enrichment mode was used for the highly sensitive and quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in biological samples without the interference of the hook effect. The simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 S/NP antigens was conducted in one LFIA strip, and the detection limits for two antigens under direct and enrichment modes were 1 and 0.5 pg/mL, respectively. The MagTQD-LFIA showed high accuracy, specificity, and stability in saliva and nasal swab samples and is an efficient tool with flexibility to meet the testing requirements for SARS-CoV-2 antigens in various situations.","output":"Ultrasensitive and Simultaneous Detection of Two Specific SARS-CoV-2 Antigens in Human Specimens Using Direct/Enrichment Dual-Mode Fluorescence Lateral Flow Immunoassay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public parks serve an important societal function as recreational spaces for diverse communities of people, with well documented physical and mental health benefits. As such, parks may be crucial for how people have handled effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the increasingly limited recreational opportunities, widespread financial uncertainty, and consequent heightened anxiety. Despite the documented benefits of parks, however, many states have instituted park shutdown orders due to fears that public parks could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we use geotagged social media data from state, county, and local parks throughout New Jersey to examine whether park visitation increased when the COVID-19 pandemic began and whether park shutdown orders were effective at deterring park usage. We compare park usage during four discrete stages of spring 2020: (1) before the pandemic began, (2) during the beginning of the pandemic, (3) during the New Jersey governors state-wide park shutdown order, and (4) following the lifting of the shutdown. We find that park visitation increased by 63.4% with the onset of the pandemic. The subsequent park shutdown order caused visitation in closed parks to decline by 76.1% while parks that remained open continued to experience elevated visitation levels. Visitation then returned to elevated pre-shutdown levels when closed parks were allowed to reopen. Altogether, our results indicate that parks continue to provide crucial services to society, particularly in stressful times when opportunities for recreation are limited. Furthermore, our results suggest that policies targeting human behavior can be effective and are largely reversible. As such, we should continue to invest in public parks and to explore the role of parks in managing public health and psychological well-being.","output":"Public parks and the pandemic: How park usage has been affected by COVID-19 policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mass casualty incidents are increasingly common.

Adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), expressed by a wide range of immune cells, as well as endothelial cells and platelets, exert cAMP-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects that potentially could be highly protective in this regard. The venerable drug pentoxifylline (PTX) exerts both anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects that reflect its ability to boost the responsiveness of A2AR to extracellular adenosine. The platelet-stabilizing drug dipyridamole (DIP) blocks intracellular uptake of extracellularly-generated adenosine, thereby up-regulating A2AR signaling in a way that should be functionally complementary to the impact of PTX in that regard. Moreover, DIP has recently been reported to slow the cellular replication of SARS-CoV-2 in clinically feasible concentrations. Both PTX and DIP are reasonably safe, well-tolerated, widely available, and inexpensive drugs. When COVID-19 patients can be treated within several days of symptom onset, using PTX + DIP in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and an antibiotic - azithromycin (AZM) or doxycycline - might be warranted. HCQ and AZM can suppress SARS-CoV-2 proliferation in vitro and may slow the cell-to-cell spread of the virus; a large case series evaluating this combination in early-stage patients reported an impressively low mortality rate. However, whereas HCQ and AZM can promote QT interval lengthening and may be contraindicated in more advanced COVID-19 entailing cardiac damage, doxycycline has no such effect and exerts a potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory action. In contrast to HCQ, we propose that the combination of PTX + DIP can be used in both early and advanced stages of COVID-19. Concurrent use of certain nutraceuticals - yeast beta-glucan, zinc, vitamin D, spirulina, phase 2 inducers, N-acetylcysteine, glucosamine, quercetin, and magnesium - might also improve therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19.","output":"Harnessing adenosine A2A receptors as a strategy for suppressing the lung inflammation and thrombotic complications of COVID-19: Potential of pentoxifylline and dipyridamole"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deaths attributable to natural heat exposure, although generally considered preventable (1), represent a continuing public health concern in the United States. During 2004-2018, an average of 702 heat-related deaths occurred in the United States annually. To study patterns in heat-related deaths by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and level of urbanization, and to explore comorbid conditions associated with deaths resulting from heat exposure, CDC analyzed nationally comprehensive mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS).* The rate of heat-related mortality tended to be higher among males, persons aged &#8805;65 years, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, and persons living in noncore nonmetropolitan and large central metropolitan counties. Natural heat exposure was a contributing cause of deaths attributed to certain chronic medical conditions and other external causes. Preparedness and response initiatives directed toward extreme heat events, currently underway at local, state, and national levels, can contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality associated with natural heat exposure. Successful public health interventions? to mitigate heat-related deaths include conducting outreach to vulnerable communities to increase awareness of heat-related symptoms and provide guidance for staying cool and hydrated, particularly for susceptible groups at risk such as young athletes and persons who are older or socially isolated (2). Improved coordination across various health care sectors could inform local activities to protect health during periods of high heat. For instance, jurisdictions can monitor weather conditions and syndromic surveillance data to guide timing of risk communication and other measures (e.g., developing and implementing heat response plans, facilitating communication and education activities) to prevent heat-related mortality in the United States. CDC also recommends that federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions open cooling centers or provide access to public locations with air conditioning for persons in need of a safe, cool, environment during hot weather conditions. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, CDC updated its guidance on the use of cooling centers to provide best practices (e.g., potential changes to staffing procedures, separate areas for persons with symptoms of COVID-19, and physical distancing) to reduce the risk for introducing and transmitting SARS COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into cooling centers..","output":"Heat-Related Deaths - United States, 2004-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cross-sectional observational study evaluated the prevalence and predictors of needle-fear among school-going children during mass Measles-Rubella (MR) immunization campaign (year 2017) in the north Indian city of Chandigarh Fear of needle was assessed using a single-item self-report global question, anxiety was assessed using the Likert scale (score 1C5) and the standardized Children Faces Scale where facial responses were graded from 0 to 4 Out of a total sample of 2568 school children, 1225 (47 7%) reported needle fear (95% CI: 45 8%C49 6%) on a global single item assessment On an anxiety related Likert scale, 52 3% did not respond (mainly younger children) and among those who responded, 42 6% (523/1226) showed significant anxiety (score of 3 on Likert scale of 1 to 5) Finally, 17 4% children (95% CI: 15 9%C18 9%) (n = 446/2568) scored 2 or above (indicating significant needle fear) on the Children Faces Scale during the actual vaccination procedure The needle fear were significantly increased among girl students as compared to boys (adjusted OR 2 58;95% CI: 2 05C3 24, p &lt; 0 001) as well as children accompanied by their parents (adjusted OR 2 05;95% CI:1 57C2 69, p &lt; 0 001) On the other hand, needle fear was significantly lowered in children studying in private schools as compared to public school children (adjusted OR 0 45;95% CI: 0 28C0 74, p = 0 002) The needle fear, which was an overriding concern in the minds of girls, children accompanied by their parents, and public-school students, must be proactively addressed for successful mass vaccination campaigns These findings assume further importance with recent international roll out of COVID 19 vaccine [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Child & Adolescent Trauma is the property of Springer Nature and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Needle Fear among Children during Mass Measles Rubella (MR) Injectable Vaccination Campaign in North India: an Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of cerebrovascular disease has advanced considerably in 2015.

Psychological organizations engaged in preventive and mitigation efforts targeted, among others, the general public, local communities, and high-risk groups such as health care providers. They disseminated mental health information to the general public, trained laypersons to provide psychological first aid, and used research to design and evaluate public health responses to the pandemic. In some countries, psychological organizations contributed to the design and implementation of public health policies and practices. The nature of these involvements changed throughout the pandemic and evolved from reactive to proactive, from local to international. Several qualities appear key to the value, impact, and success of these efforts. These include organizational agility and adaptability, the ability to overcome their political inertia and manage conflict, recognizing the need to address cultural differences, and allocating limited resources to high-risk and resource-depleted constituencies where it was needed most. ? 2021, Sociedad Interamericana de Psicologia.

However, specific data for this recommendation are lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate viral shedding into the environment, including HCWs, associated with bedside tracheostomy in the intensive care unit. METHODS: Samples obtained from the medical environment immediately after tracheostomy, including those from 19 surfaces, two air samples at 10 and 50 cm from the surgical site, and from the personal protective equipment (PPE) of the surgeon and assistant, were tested for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in eight cases of bedside tracheostomy. We evaluated the rate of positive tests from the different samples obtained. RESULTS: Positive samples were identified in only one of the eight cases. These were obtained for the air sample at 10 cm and from the bed handrail and urine bag. There were no positive test results from the PPE samples. The patient with positive samples had undergone early tracheostomy, at 9 days after intubation, due to a comorbidity.

Although unstable housing is associated with HIV and HCV infection among people who inject drugs, its contribution to transmission is unknown. We estimated the global and national proportions of incident HIV and HCV infections among people who inject drugs attributed to housing instability from 2020 to 2029. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed country-level models of unstable housing and HIV and HCV transmission among people who inject drugs in 58 countries globally, calibrated to country-specific data on the prevalences of HIV and HCV and unstable housing. Based on a recently published systematic review, unstably housed people who inject drugs were assumed to have a 39% (95% CI 6C84) increased risk of HIV transmission and a 64% (95% CI 43C89%) increased risk of HCV transmission. We used pooled country-level estimates from systematic reviews on HCV and HIV prevalence in people who inject drugs. Our models estimated the transmission population attributable fraction (tPAF) of unstable housing to HIV and HCV transmission among people who inject drugs, defined as the percentage of infections prevented from 2020 to 2029 if the additional risk due to unstable housing was removed. FINDINGS: Our models were produced for 58 countries with sufficient data (accounting for >66% of the global people who inject drugs population). Globally, we project unstable housing contributes 79% (95% credibility interval [CrI] 23C157) of new HIV infections and 112% (77C155) of new HCV infections among people who inject drugs from 2020 to 2029. Country-level tPAFs were strongly associated with the prevalence of unstable housing. tPAFs were greater in high-income countries (HIV 172% [95% CrI 51C300]; HCV 194% [95% CrI 138C260]) than in low-income or middle-income countries (HIV 66% [95% CrI 18C131]; HCV 83% [95% CrI 55C117]). tPAFs for HIV and HCV were highest in Afghanistan, Czech Republic, India, USA, England, and Wales where unstable housing contributed more than 20% of new HIV and HCV infections. INTERPRETATION: Unstable housing is an important modifiable risk factor for HIV and HCV transmission among people who inject drugs in many countries. The study emphasises the importance of implementing initiatives to mitigate these risks and reduce housing instability.

COVID-19 was initially detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, and has now rapidly spread worldwide. Departments of Neurosurgery are required to employ an acute response against this pandemic. In this article, we discuss the important factors that neurosurgeons need to consider when managing their departments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have summarized perspectives of the articles published on COVID-19, as well as the suggestions from neurosurgical societies in highly infected regions. We have proposed a seven-point checklist for neurosurgery departments: (1) networking among medical institutions; (2) coordinating teams within each institution; (3) prevention of infection within the department; (4) perioperative management; (5) triage; (6) changing subspecialty management protocols; and (7) psychological support for medical staff and patients.","output":"Seven-point Checklist: Have You Prepared Sufficiently for the COVID-19 Crisis in Your Neurosurgery Department?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple effective vaccines are currently being deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic (caused by SARS-COV-2), and are viewed as the major factor in marked reductions in disease burden in regions around the world with moderate to high coverage of these vaccines. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programs is, however, significantly threatened by the emergence of new SARS-COV-2 variants that, in addition to being more transmissible and potentially more virulent than the wild (resident) strain, may at least partially evade existing vaccines. A new two-strain (one resident, the other wild) and two-group (vaccinated or otherwise) mechanistic mathematical model is designed and used to assess the impact of the vaccine-induced cross-protective efficacy on the spread the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Analysis of the model, which is fitted using COVID-19 mortality data for the US, shows that vaccine-induced herd immunity can be achieved if 61% of the American population is fully vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Parameter sensitivity analysis suggests three main factors that significantly affect the COVID-19 burden in the US, namely (a) daily vaccination rate, (b) the level of cross-protection the vaccines offer against the variant, and (c) the relative infectiousness of the dominant variant relative to the wild strain. This study further suggests that a new variant can cause a significant disease surge in the US if (i) the vaccine coverage against the wild strain is low (roughly < 50%), (ii) the variant is much more transmissible (e.g., twice more transmissible) than the wild-type strain, or (iii) the level of cross-protection offered by the vaccine is relatively low (e.g., less than 70%). A new variant will not cause such surge in the US if it is only moderately more transmissible (e.g., 1:56 more transmissible) than the wild strain, at least 66% of the population of the US is fully vaccinated, and the three vaccines being deployed in the US (Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson) offer a moderate level of cross-protection against the variant.","output":"Will Vaccine-derived Protective Immunity Curtail COVID-19 Variants in the US?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused untold fear and suffering for older adults across the world According to the World Health Organization, older adults in aged care homes are at a higher risk of the infection living in an enclosed environment with others This article adopts a qualitative approach using Colaizzi?s phenomenological method to explore the lived experiences of older adults during COVID-19 Between December 2019 and June 2020, 10 in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants aged 60 years and above in two aged care homes The lived tension that has penetrated all participants? stories in five themes of the meanings described as ?disconnected in a shrinking world? filled with uncertainties COVID-19 has brought unprecedented challenges and disproportionate threat onto older adults? lives, relationships and well-being The overarching message was that older adults believe that ?this too shall pass? and regain their freedom that was lost during the pandemic","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic: The Lived Experiences of Older Adults in Aged Care Homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The corona virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) imposed new public health constraints that deterred people from coming to the hospital. The outcome of patients who developed appendicitis during mandated COVID-19 quarantine has yet to be examined. The main objective was to establish whether there was an increased rate of perforated appendicitis seen during COVID-19 quarantine. Secondary objectives included observing the type of procedure performed, length of stay, and associated complications. Materials and Methods: This retrospective analysis was designed to look at the rates of appendicitis and perforated appendicitis observed during mandatory \\"safer at home order\\" from March to May 2020. The same time period a year earlier was used for comparative analysis. The study utilized data gathered from a single health care system, which consisted of a large regional referral center with three emergency rooms (ERs). Patients were included in the study if they presented to any ER in our health care system with a chief complaint of acute appendicitis. Perforated appendicitis was determined either radiographically or intraoperatively. Interventions included surgery, percutaneous drainage, or medical management. Results: There were 107 patients who were included. During quarantine, a total of 48 patients presented with acute appendicitis, with 16 perforations, compared with the previous year where 59 patients presented with acute appendicitis, with 10 perforations (33% versus 17% P = .04). Most patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (91%, n = 98), six patients (6%) were managed with intravenous antibiotics and 3 patients (3%) with percutaneous drainage. Patients who perforated had a longer duration of symptoms (2 versus 1, P = .03), white blood cell count (13,190 versus 15,960 cells/mm3, P = .09), and longer operative time (72 versus 89 minutes, P = .01). Patients who perforated had an increased length of stay and rate of complication. Conclusion: There was an overall increased rate of perforated appendicitis seen during quarantine compared with the previous year. Patients with perforated appendicitis had an increased length of stay, longer operative time, and increased rate of complications. Thus, although people were staying home due to public health safety orders, it negatively impacted those who developed appendicitis who may have presented to the hospital otherwise sooner.","output":"A Retrospective Analysis of the Trends in Acute Appendicitis During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of olfactory dysfunction on the course and severity of COVID-19 and its prognostic and predictive significance for COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. SETTING: Ondokuz Mayis University School of Medicine. METHODS: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive patients, patients with COVID-19-related symptoms who had a negative PCR result, and healthy controls were included in the study. Clinicodemographic characteristics, inflammatory markers, and computed tomography stages were recorded. Disease progression and intensive care unit admission were registered. The visual analog scale (0, worst; 10, best) was used to evaluate subjective olfactory, taste, and nasal breathing ability, and the Sniffin' Sticks identification (SS-ID) test was used for psychophysical olfactory assessment. RESULTS: Mean SS-ID scores were significantly lower in the positive group (8.77) than in the negative (10.43) and healthy control (12.17) groups. VAS-smell scores were significantly lower and anosmia was more prevalent in PCR-positive patients (P < .01). SS-ID and VAS-smell scores were significantly correlated (r = 0.681, P < .001). The inflammatory parameters, pulmonary infiltration stage, disease progression, and ICU admission were not associated with SS-ID scores. A cutoff SS-ID score <9 resulted in 55.56% sensitivity in predicting COVID-19 positivity, and a cutoff VAS-smell score <8 yielded 72.22% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Olfactory dysfunction was detected objectively and subjectively in the PCR-positive group, and no difference was found in terms of taste function and nasal breathing. The severity and prognosis of COVID-19 are not exclusively dependent on olfactory dysfunction. The degree of olfactory dysfunction can be useful in predicting PCR positivity.","output":"Clinical, Prognostic, and Predictive Value of Olfactory Dysfunction for COVID-19: A Prospective Controlled Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its outbreak in 2019, the acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-Cov-2 has become a severe global threat to human The lack of effective drugs strongly limits the therapeutic treatment against this pandemic disease Here we employed a computational approach to prioritize potential inhibitors that directly target the core enzyme of SARS-Cov-2, the main protease, which is responsible for processing the viral RNA-translated polyprotein into functional proteins for viral replication Based on a large-scale screening of over 13, 000 drug-like molecules, we have identified the most potential drugs that may suffice drug repurposing for SARS-Cov-2 Importantly, the second tohit is Beclabuvir, a known replication inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is recently reported to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 as well We also noted several neurotransmitter-related ligands among the tocandidates, suggesting a novel molecular similarity between this respiratory syndrome and neural activities Our approach not only provides a comprehensive list of prioritized drug candidates for SARS-Cov-2, but also reveals intriguing molecular patterns that are worth future explorations","output":"Prioritization of Potential Drugs Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large-scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method-referred to as mixture-model approach-for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test's ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals.

Carbon price fluctuations reflect the scarcity of carbon resources, and accurate prediction can improve carbon asset management capabilities. Therefore, in order to clarify the dynamics of carbon markets and assign carbon emissions allocation rationally, we propose a hybrid feature-driven forecasting model with the framework of decomposition-reconstruction-prediction-ensemble. In this paper, the non-stationary, nonlinear and chaotic characteristics of carbon prices in Chinas ETS pilots have been verified, and then the prediction model is built based on the tested features. Firstly, the original carbon price series are decomposed by Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), and then reconstructed by Sample Entropy (SE). Next, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is conducted to predict the subsequences. Lastly, the forecasting series of every subseries are summed to obtain the final results. The empirical results based on carbon prices of Chinas ETS pilots proved that the proposed model performs more efficiently than the current benchmark models. As carbon prices are expected to increase across all ETS during the post-COVID-19 recovery stage, the new prediction model will be useful for improving the guiding principles of the existing government policies including the likely introductions of Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA) in the EU and the US, and governing the large global public companies to deliver their net zero commitments.","output":"Carbon price prediction for China's ETS pilots using variational mode decomposition and optimized extreme learning machine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-EVs) have shown promise in wound healing. Their use in diabetic wounds specifically, however, remains pre-clinical and their efficacy remains uncertain less clear. A systematic review of preclinical studies is needed to determine the efficacy of MSC-EVs in the treatment of diabetic wounds to accelerate the clinical translation of this cell-based therapy. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched (to June 23, 2020). All English-language, full-text, controlled interventional studies comparing MSC-EVs to placebo or a no treatment arm in animal models of diabetic wounds were included. Study outcomes, including wound closure (primary outcome), scar width, blood vessel number and density, and re-epithelialisation were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using the SYRCLE tool for pre-clinical animal studies. RESULTS: A total of 313 unique records were identified from our search, with 10 full text articles satisfying inclusion criteria (n = 136 animals). The administration of MSC-EVs improved closure of diabetic wounds compared to controls with a large observed effect (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) 5.48, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 3.55C8.13). Healing was further enhanced using MSC-EVs enriched in non-coding RNAs or microRNAs compared to controls (SMD 9.89, 95%CI 7.32C12.46). Other outcomes, such as blood vessel density and number, scar width, and re-epithelialisation were improved with the administration of MSC-EVs, with a large effect. ROB across studies was unclear. CONCLUSION: MSC-EVs, particularly following enrichment for specific RNAs, are a promising treatment for diabetic wounds in pre-clinical studies and translation to the clinical domain appears warranted.

In contrast, highly pathogenic human betacoronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV, circa 2002) may evade or antagonize RNA-induced IFN I/III responses. Aim: 1) Compare IFN I/III responses by bronchial AECs from children and adults between infection with SARS CoV2 and HRV-16. 2) Determine if pre-infection of AEC cultures with HRV-16, or pretreatment with IFN- or IFN-, modifies SARS-CoV-2 replication. Methods: Bronchial AECs from children and adults (n=15;ages 8-75 yrs.) were differentiated ex vivo at an air-liquid interface to generate organotypic cultures. In a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility, cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 or HRV-16 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. At 96 hrs. following infection, RNA and protein were isolated. Expression of IFNB1, IFNL2, and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) IFITM1, IFITM3, and OAS1 was measured by qPCR in SARS-CoV-2-infected, HRV-16-infected, and uninfected AEC cultures. In additional experiments AECs were pre-infected with HRV-16 (MOI=0.5), or pre-treated with recombinant IFN-1 (1ng/mL in media) or IFN-2 (10ng/mL), 72 hrs. before SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recombinant IFNs were refreshed with each media change. SARS-CoV-2 replication was assessed by qPCR, and quantified as viral copy number/ng RNA. Results: SARS-CoV-2 induced less robust increases then HRV-16 in expression of IFNB1 (median 1.4-fold increase, 95% CI 1.2-1.7, vs. 3.8-fold, 95% CI 2.3-6.6, p&lt;0.01), IFNL2 (median 11-fold increase, 95% CI 3-17, vs. 23-fold, 95% CI 12-62, p&lt;0.01), IFITM1 (median 3-fold increase, 95% CI 1.8-5.4, vs. 6.8-fold, 95% CI 3.9-16, p=0.001), IFITM3 (median 1.6-fold increase, 95% CI 1.2-2, vs. 2.5-fold, 95% CI 2.2-4, p=0.003), and OAS1 (median 1.9-fold increase, 95% CI 1.4-3.5, vs. 3.8-fold, 95% CI 2.8-7.8, p&lt;0.001). SARS-CoV-2 replication was significantly reduced when AECs were pre-infected with HRV-16 (median 2126 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 204-11,080, vs. 92 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 24-289, p=0.002). SARS-CoV-2 replication was also significantly reduced when AECs were treated with recombinant IFN-1 (median 2126 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 204-11,080, vs. 81 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 3-172, p=0.005) or IFN-2 (median 2126 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 204-11,080, vs. 48 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 26-143, p=0.001).

The SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was also recommended by the international society for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, IBD patients were not recruited in prospective randomized clinical vaccine studies. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in IBD patients, we conducted this systemic review and meta-analysis. METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between Jan 1, 2019, and Sep 9, 2021. Studies written in English reported the efficacy, seroconversion (anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike(S) antibody titer beyond the threshold) rate and adverse events after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in IBD patients. We extracted the author, date, study design, country, types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, number of IBD patients receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, and study outcomes. Published data from the enrolled studies were pooled to determine effect estimates. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021264993). RESULTS We analyzed findings from 27454 IBD patients that received SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The post SARS-CoV-2 vaccination COVID-19 infection rate was comparable between the IBD patients and non-IBD patients (odds ratio (OR), 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.71) and higher in nonvaccinated IBD patients compared with vaccinated IBD patients (OR 8.63, 95% CI 5.44-13.37).

Given the high pressure placed on students throughout COVID-19, it is critical to understand the influence of problematic internet use (PIU), psychological stress, academic burnout, and resilience on perceived learning (PL). A cross-sectional analytical study was chosen to collect data from 350 learners pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate business/management degrees in Karnataka, India. The data were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) and Smart PLS 3. The present study reports a non-significant negative total effect of stress on PL, while there was a significant positive direct effect but a significant indirect negative effect of multiple mediators, namely PIU, burnout, and resilience. In the relationship between stress and PL, burnout has full competitive mediation, and the suppressive effect of burnout and resilience wipes out the beneficial benefit of stress on PL, resulting in reduced PL. As a societal problem, a change in educational policy and prevention strategies for students and organizations (reducing the number of courses, number of exams, and handling parental expectations) would be effective.

The efficiency of the immune system can modulate individual vulnerability with variable outcomes. However, the relationships between disease severity and the titer of antibodies produced against SARS-CoV-2 in non-vaccinated, recently infected subjects need to be fully elucidated. Methods A total of 99 patients admitted to a COVID-unit underwent clinical assessment and measurement of serum levels of anti-spike protein (S1) IgM, and anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG. Patients were stratified according to the clinical outcome (i.e., discharged at home or in-hospital death). Results Following hospitalization, 18 died during the hospital stay. They were older, had lymphopenia, a higher co-morbidity rate, and longer hospital stay than 81 patients who were discharged after healing. Patients in this latter group had, at hospital admittance, 7.9-fold higher serum concentration of IgM, and 2.4-fold higher IgG levels. Multivariate Cox regression models indicated age and anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG concentration at admission as independently associated with the risk of in-hospital death. Conclusions An efficient immunological response during the early phase of COVID-19 protects from mortality, irrespective of age. Advanced age is a critical risk factor for poor outcome in infected subjects. Further studies must explore potential therapeutic strategies able to restore a valid functional humoral immunity in elderly patients with poor antibody response during the early stage of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Reduced COVID-19 mortality linked with early antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the pandemic, there has been an increasing demand and awareness for health insurance policies, particularly by the senior population.

Methods: Six COVID-19 drug candidates were selected from WHO clinical guidelines. Evidence-comment networks (ECNs) were completed of these six drug candidates based on evidence-comment pairs from all PubMed indexed COVID-19 publications with formal published comments. WHO guidelines were utilized to validate the feasibility of comment-derived evidence assertions as a fast decision supporting tool. Results: Out of 6 drug candidates, comment-derived evidence assertions of leading subgraphs of 5 drugs were consistent with WHO guidelines, and the overall comment sentiment of 6 drugs was aligned with WHO clinical guidelines. Additionally, comment topics were in accordance with the concerns of guidelines and evidence appraisal criteria. Furthermore, half of the critical comments emerged 4.5 months earlier than the date guidelines were published. Conclusions: Comment-derived evidence assertions have the potential as an evidence appraisal tool for heuristic decisions based on the accuracy, sensitivity, and efficiency of evidence-comment networks.

Therefore, the influence of stocking density (SD) and administration of curcumin in the diet on broiler performance was explored to clarify the impact of HSD and curcumin on the performance of growth, behavioural patterns, haematological, oxidant/antioxidant parameters, immunity markers, and the growth-related genes expression in broiler chickens. A total of 200 broiler chickens (Cobb 500, 2-weeks old) were allotted into 4 groups; SD (moderate and high) and curcumin (100 and 200 mg/kg diet)-supplemented HSD, respectively. Behavioural observations were performed. After a 28-day experimental period, tissue and blood samples were collected for analysis. Expressions of mRNA for insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), growth hormone receptor (GHR), myostatin (MSTN), and leptin in liver tissues were examined. HSD birds exhibited lower growth performance measurements, haematological parameters, circulating 3,5,3-triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels, antioxidant activities (GSH-Px, catalase, superoxide dismutase), immunoglobulins (A, G, M), and hepatic GHR and IGF-1 expression values. However, HSD birds even had an increment of serum corticosterone, malondialdehyde, pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-a, IL-2, IL-6) levels, hepatic leptin and MSTN expression. Moreover, HSD decreased drinking, feeding, crouching, body care, and increased standing and walking behaviour. The addition of curcumin, particularly at a 200 mg/kg diet, alleviated the effect of HSD through amending growth-related gene expression in the chickens. In conclusion, curcumin can enhance birds' growth performance, behavioural patterns, and immunity by reducing oxidative stress and up-regulating the growth-related gene expressions of broilers under stressful conditions due to a high stocking density.","output":"The Impact of Curcumin on Growth Performance, Growth-Related Gene Expression, Oxidative Stress, and Immunological Biomarkers in Broiler Chickens at Different Stocking Densities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, many countries reacted by relaxing environmental rules and Canada was no exception Environmental regulators across Canada changed rules in unprecedented efforts to balance public health, economic wellbeing and protection of the environment This briefing paper takes stock of and discusses these actions When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, many countries reacted by relaxing environmental rules and Canada was no exception Environmental regulators across Canada changed rules in unprecedented efforts to balance public health, economic wellbeing and protection of the environment This briefing paper takes stock of and discusses these actions Only 41 of the 61 government notices included a specific COVID-related rationale for the rule changes and the explanations lacked detail Reasons included accommodating regulated entities' need to observe public health requirements (88), financial relief for industry (38), responding to government capacity constraints (14) and accommodating public observance of health restrictions (3) More than a third of the changes were indefinite, with no set end date In these cases especially it is critical that government agencies be held accountable for reinstating lost protections in a timely manner Overall, environmental regulators across Canada responded in similar ways to the pandemic Some agencies, however, took extraordinary actions Alberta, for example, was the only jurisdiction to completely suspend reporting requirements and did so across multiple sectors In Ontario, the provincial government indefinitely suspended parts of the province's Environmental Bill of Rights, allowing other regulations to be approved with reduced oversight and public consultation Newfoundland and Labrador was alone in permanently amending environmental assessment timelines British Columbia, on the other hand, was the sole jurisdiction to change a rule to address constraints faced by the public, suspending public appeal filing deadlines to support public participation in project decisions As the virus is brought under control, government should move swiftly to restore suspended environmental protections Agencies must now be held to account for ensuring, at minimum, a timely return to the status quo Where regulators are practicing enforcement discretion, fair and transparent enforcement decision-making is critical Further, agencies have the opportunity to learn and adapt as a result of this experience, leading to smarter, more resilient environmental regulation in Canada An important question warranting further inquiry, especially, is whether regulator actions were justifiable, ex post What were the environmental, social and economic costs and benefits of these rule changes?

Thus, the aim of this study was to confirm aerosol dissemination from patients with coronavirus infection using COVID-19 traps that included different untouched surfaces within them. In a previous study, we evaluated the presence of the virus and its stability in 6 different surfaces placed in the rooms of 6 patients with a positive diagnostic of COVID-19. For that, we performed a case series study with 180 samples collected from the surfaces included into the COVID-19 traps located in the rooms of patients in a COVID-19 ward unit (CWU) at a Spanish referral hospital at 24, 48 and 72 hours. RNA was extracted from the surfaces with a swab and subsequently analyzed with RT-PCR to evaluate the presence of the virus and its stability. Positives were found in almost all the rooms and at all analyzed times. Surfaces could not be touched by patients or health workers, so viral spreading was unequivocally produced by airborne. In addition, ROC curves were performed to corroborate that airborne dissemination was directly associated with patients viral load. Thus, aerosol dissemination and patients viral load were confirmed as key parameters for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

While physical inactivity has long been identified as a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality, increased concerns about the detrimental associations between SB and health has led to the development of many interventions aimed at reducing SB and/or promoting PA. Due to the prominence of sedentary time spent at work, the workplace has been identified as a key setting to implement such interventions. Building an evidence base of effective strategies to reduce SB and/or promote PA at work is needed to help reduce the health risks faced by many employees. Methods and analysis We aim to conduct a review of reviews (RoR) to identify, evaluate and synthesise all systematic reviews (SRs) of workplace interventions aimed at reducing SB and/or promoting PA among adults. Systematic searches for relevant SRs will be conducted in six databases: Cochrane Systematic Review Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature through EBSCOhost, EMBASE, PubMed including MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science. Selection for final inclusion and data extraction will be performed by two independent reviewers. SRs will be included if they assessed interventions aimed at reducing SB or promoting PA in the workplace, and if they report on changes in the respective behavioural outcomes in the occupational domain. Discussion This RoR will be valuable to policy-makers and employers who are looking for strategies to promote health at work.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-associated skin manifestations and explore the relationships among the 6 main cutaneous phenotypes and systemic findings. METHODS: Twenty-one Italian Dermatology Units were asked to collect the demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data of 200 patients with COVID-19-associated skin manifestations. The severity of COVID-19 was classified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS: A chilblain-like acral pattern was significantly associated with a younger age (P < .0001) and, after adjusting for age, significantly associated with less severe COVID-19 (P = .0009). However, the median duration of chilblain-like lesions was significantly longer than that of the other cutaneous manifestations taken together (P < .0001). Patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 were more represented than those with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 among the patients with cutaneous manifestations other than chilblain-like lesions, but only the confluent erythematous/maculo-papular/morbilliform phenotype was significantly associated with more severe COVID-19 (P = .015), and this significance disappeared after adjustment for age. LIMITATIONS: Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was not possible in all cases.

METHODS With the approval of their rheumatologists, patients were interviewed by telephone and were asked about their perceived risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 considering their rheumatic condition and whether medications increased this risk. Patients also completed surveys assessing beliefs about medication and multidimensions of physical/mental well-being. Information about current medications and rheumatologist-initiated changes in medications during the pandemic were reported by patients and verified from medical records. RESULTS One hundred twelve patients (86% women; mean age, 50 years; 81% White, 15% Latino) with diverse diagnoses were enrolled. Fifty-four percent thought they were at \\"very much greater risk\\" of COVID-19 because of their rheumatic condition, and 57% thought medications \\"definitely\\" put them at greater risk. In multivariable analysis, the perception of \\"very much greater risk\\" was associated with greater belief that rheumatic disease medications were necessary, worse physical function, chronic pulmonary comorbidity, and more anxiety. In a separate model, the perception that medications \\"definitely\\" caused greater risk was associated with White race, not taking hydroxychloroquine, rheumatologists initiating change in medications, more anxiety, and taking biologics and corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS Patients' perceived increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 was associated with beliefs about their rheumatic disease, medications, comorbidity, and anxiety. Clinicians should be aware of patients' perceptions and foster self-management practices that will alleviate anxiety, minimize exposure to the virus, and optimize systemic rheumatic disease outcomes.","output":"Variables Associated With Perceived Risk of Contracting SARS-CoV-2 Infection During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Patients With Systemic Rheumatic Diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main entry receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but how SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 influences the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown. Objective: To measure circulating ACE2 and ACE levels in COVID-19 patients and investigate associations with risk factors, outcome and inflammatory markers. Methods and results: Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) and sACE concentrations were measured by ELISA in plasma samples from 114 hospital-treated COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy controls. Follow-up samples after four months were available for 58/114 patients. Von Willebrand factor (VWF), factor VIII (fVIII), D-dimer, interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) had previously been determined. Levels of sACE2 were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls, median 5.0 (interquartile range 2.8-11.8) ng/ml versus 1.4 (1.1-1.6) ng/ml, p < 0.0001. sACE2 was higher in men than women, but were not affected by other risk factors for severe COVID-19. sACE2 decreased to 2.3 (1.6-3.9) ng/ml at follow-up, p < 0.0001, but remained higher than in healthy controls, p=0.012.

MATERIAL: This is hospital based retrospective study on patients who were admitted in Covid wards/ICU at IGGMC. Patients were divided into 3 groups- mild-moderate; severe; and critical based on their clinical presentation on admission. Several biomarkers like WBC, platelets, N/L, CRP, LDH, S. ferritin, d-dimer, CPK-MB, Serum creatinine, BUL, SGOT, SGPT, Serum albumin were analysed before and after treatment. OBSERVATION: 110 patients were enrolled in this study, 36 were classified into mild-moderate, 56 into severe and 18 into critical. As all of mild-moderate patients were discharged and majority of critical patients expired, biomarkers were compared between severe patients who were discharged vs severe patients who died. Out of these biomarkers, CRP was significantly decreased during course of treatment in severe patients who were discharged (p = 0.004) in comparison to severe patients who died where CRP was significantly increased (p = 0.001) (p value of difference being 0.00001). There was also significant change in ferritin levels (p = 0.006), while other biomarkers like WBC (p = 0.07), platelets (p = 0.066), N/L (p = 0.3), LDH (p = 0.06), d-dimer (p = 0.1), CPK-MB (p = 0.49), serum creatinine (p = 0.05), urea (p = 0.06), S. albumin (p= 0.3), SGOT (p =0.07), SGPT (p=0.25) did not show promising results. In addition, various treatment protocols were analysed by comparing CRP before and after treatment. Severe patients were divided into 2 groups, who took injection Remdesivir along with antibiotics, LMWH, systemic steroids vs who didn't, and CRP level were compared, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.06). Pre and post treatment CRP was also compared for Tocilizumab, Fevipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine, Doxycyline, but none of them were able to decrease CRP significantly (p > 0.05) in the severe or critical group but these drugs were effective in reducing CRP significantly (p<0.05) when given in mild-moderate group or if the treatment was started early.

This study aimed to investigate the biological significance and underlying molecular mechanisms of CK18 in inducing EMT phenotype and stemness properties of breast cancer cells. Three breast cancer cell lines (i.e., non-metastatic MCF-7, highly metastatic MDA-MB-231, and mitoxantrone (MX)-selected resistant MCF-7/MX cells) and two CK18-knockdown stable cell clones (MCF-7-shCK18-7D and 3C) were used to determine the association between CK18 and EMT and stemness. CK18 expression was extremely low in highly metastatic, resistant, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-1/tumor necrosis factor (TNF)--treated breast cancer cells with mesenchymal phenotype and increased expression of CSC markers. Depletion of CK18 promoted partial EMT and the acquisition of stemness properties in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Mechanistically, CK18 interference in MCF-7 cells activated the Wnt/-catenin signaling, resulting in the up-regulation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Consistently, the stemness properties and metastasis can be attenuated by further knockdown of EpCAM in CK18-depleted cells. In conclusion, downregulation of CK18 promotes partial EMT and enhances breast cancer stemness by increasing EpCAM expression partly via the Wnt/-catenin pathway.

They lead to severe myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmia, acute congestive heart failure, and a significant rise in death cases. During COVID-19, no specific cardiological treatment is started. As adjuvant therapy, anxiolytics in COVID-19 are widely used, but not in all anxious patients who had been infected with coronavirus. Anxiolytics can be useful to moderate MD and immunosuppressive effect of anxiety.

TMZ promotes glucose-mediated ATP production, which requires less oxygen, which explains its advantageous cardiac effects. Since it lowers serum and myocardial tissue proinflammatory cytokine levels and inhibits myocardial macrophage infiltration, it was suspected that TMZ might represent a novel therapeutic agent to prevent and treat sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction. CoQ(10) plays an important role in cellular ATP production; however, its concentration is decreased in cardiovascular diseases and in influenza patients.

AIM: To describe the clinical course of critical pertussis, and identify predictors of death at the time of presentation for medical care. METHODOLOGY: Retrospective study conducted in childrens hospital Tunisian PICU between 01 January and 31 October 2013. Patients with critical pertussis confirmed by RT-PCR and requiring mechanical ventilation were included. Predictors of death were studied. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients was studied. Median age was 50 days. Mortality was 23%. Predictors risk of mortality were : high PRISM score (Pediatric Risk of Mortality Score) (p=0,007), shock (p=0,002), tachycardia (p=0,005), seizures (p=0,006), altered mental status (p=0,006), elevated WBC count (p=0,003) and hemodynamic support (p=0022). However, the difference did not reach statistical significance in comorbidity, pneumoniae, high pulmonary hypertension or exchange transfusion.

The misconception that HRI is primarily a result of dogs being trapped in hot cars, highlights a lack of awareness of HRI risk factors within the UK companion animal population. AIM: This project aimed to review all species of small animal presentations of HRI to UK veterinary practices participating in the Small Animal Veterinary Surveillance Network (SAVSNET), describe the inciting triggers and seasonality of HRI events, and review the clinical grade of canine patients presenting with HRI. METHODS: Electronic consultation records were submitted by volunteer veterinary practices across the UK to SAVSNET. Cases were defined as animals presented for consultation with strong evidence of current, or recent heat induced illness during the study period (2013C2018). RESULTS: The HRI cases included 146 dogs, 16 cats, 8 guinea pigs, 3 rabbits and 1 ferret. Of the 118 HRI cases with a recorded trigger, exercise was the primary trigger for dogs presenting (73.5%); 7 (6.9%) canine HRI events followed vehicular confinement. Environmental HRI was recorded as a trigger for the remaining dogs (19.6%), and for all cats, guinea pigs, rabbits and the ferret. Brachycephalic breeds comprised 21.2% of canine HRI cases, and all rabbits were brachycephalic breeds. Dogs with HRI were presented between April and October, with 42.5% during July, typically the UKs hottest month of the year. Cats with HRI were presented between May and September, with 75.0% during June and July. The smaller companion speciesferrets, rabbits and guinea pigswere presented during the UKs summer months June to August. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the risk of HRI to all pet animals during the UKs warmer summer months (June to August). The findings support previous claims that exercise is the most common trigger of HRI in dogs, while environmental HRI (a hot ambient temperature) accounted for all HRI events in cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and ferrets. Both brachycephalic dogs and rabbits were overrepresented, adding further evidence that owners of these animals should be particularly vigilant for HRI during hot weather.","output":"Surveillance of heat-related illness in small animals presenting to veterinary practices in the UK between 2013 and 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SESSION TITLE: Chest Infections Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: SARS-CoV2, also known as COVID-19 has altered the course of many aspects of patient care The aim of this study is to determine mental health implications of COVID-19 for hospitalized patients, and their care received METHODS: A single institution survey was given to COVID-19 inpatients at Carle Foundation Hospital The survey was a standardized questionnaire collecting information regarding patient mood, contributing factors to mood and barriers to care during their hospitalization 47 patients were contacted, and a total of 28 responses were collected The timing of the study was during the peak of COVID-19 infection in the United States The survey included open-ended, multiple-choice questions pertaining to mood during their recent hospitalization, and comparisons with previous hospitalizations if applicable Participants were allowed to choose more than one option for each question regarding mood and barriers to care, and a final free response question was included for further clarification RESULTS: Of the 28 patients, 75% expressed distinct mood disturbance during their hospital admission Of patients experiencing mood disturbance, 38% were men and 67% were women 71% of patients with mood disturbance had been hospitalized previously and 59% of previously hospitalized patients experienced increased mental stress during their COVID admission compared to prior medical admission(s) The most commonly identified factors which increased anxiety were uncertainty disease progression (57% of participants), absence of family (50%), and isolation rooms (40%) CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that 75% of COVID inpatients at our institution experienced increased stress Multiple factors play a role in patient attitude including the uncertainty of disease progression, strict restriction of visitation from family members, and inability to develop open connection with health care workers due to use of personal protective equipment CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The pandemics rapid spread, high mortality rate and limited information about the virus was expected to lead to significant mental health ramifications Our study provided data suggestive of increased mental health distress in inpatients during the COVID pandemic Suggestions to improve patient satisfaction include the use of social support systems, clear communication with the health care team and virtual interaction with family It is imperative that we communicate clearly with our patients in order to mitigate anxiety As demonstrated previously, a better grasp on information and greater knowledge of the circumstances leads to lower anxiety during pandemic situations (Mishra) Use of anxiolytics, such as hydroxyzine has shown possible aid in inpatient hospital admissions, however it is a field that needs to be explored further It is our role as health care workers to recognize the negative effects and implement improvement going forward DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Vishesh Paul, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Kelly Roth, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Riddhi Upadhyay, source=Web Response","output":"The Effects of Covid-19 on Mental Health during Inpatient Hospitalization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from the winter of 2002 to the spring of 2003 has caused a serious threat to public health.

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of vedolizumab (VDZ), a gut-selective anti-integrin, on COVID-19 outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS: Using data from the Surveillance of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for IBD (SECURE-IBD), an international registry of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19, we studied the impact of VDZ on COVID-19 hospitalization and severe COVID-19 (intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilation and/or death). RESULTS: Of 3,647 adult patients on any IBD medication in the registry, 457 (12.5%) patients were on VDZ. On multivariable analyses using backward selection of covariates, VDZ use was not associated with hospitalization or severe COVID-19 when comparing to patients on all other medications [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71, 1.1 and aOR 0.95; 95% CI 0.53; 1.73, respectively]. On comparing VDZ monotherapy to anti-TNF monotherapy, the odds for hospitalization, but not severe COVID-19, were higher (aOR CI 1.39; 95% CI 1.001, 1.90 and aOR 2.92; 95% CI 0.98, 8.71, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, VDZ monotherapy, compared to anti-TNF monotherapy, was associated with new-onset GI symptoms at the time of COVID-19, especially among patients whose IBD was in remission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 outcomes among IBD patients on VDZ are comparable to those on all other therapies. Hospitalization, but not severe COVID-19, is more likely with VDZ monotherapy than with anti-TNF monotherapy.

Poor visual function related to cataracts is also a risk factor for falls and traffic accidents, which may lead to hospital admissions and limit independence. Objective To evaluate patients' satisfaction, visual functions and spectacle independence among patients in the Central Region of Ghana who had cataract surgery in one eye. Methods A hospital-based prospective cohort study was carried out on 146 patients booked for cataract surgery: 16 were lost through follow-ups whilst 130 completed the study. Visual functions including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, stereopsis and colour vision were assessed before and after a month of cataract surgery. Objective and subjective refractions were performed to determine the post-surgery refractive status of the participants. Participants completed the NEI-VFQ 25 questionnaire and the scores obtained were used as a construct of their satisfaction. Results The NEI-VFQ 25 questionnaire scores indicated patients' satisfaction was high with an average quality of life score of 77.46. Patients satisfaction was strongly correlated with contrast sensitivity (r=0.653, p<0.001) but moderately correlated with visual acuity (r=-0.554, p<0.001), stereopsis (r=0.490, p<0.001) and colour vision (r=0.466, p<0.001). Contrast sensitivity was a better predictor of patients' satisfaction than visual acuity and stereopsis. Spectacle independence at distance was achieved in only 44.6% of the participants and 5.4% at near. There was a significant (p>0.001) association between spectacle independence and the two types of cataract surgery performed which included Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) and Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE). Among those who were spectacle independent, 53.4% of them were low vision patients. Conclusion Satisfaction of patients after cataract surgery was high but was greatly influenced by visual functions with contrast sensitivity being a better predictor of satisfaction than visual acuity and stereopsis.

Methods: 270 participants without prior COVID-19 were enrolled to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination with a primeCboost interval of 8C9 weeks. Their specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, neutralizing antibody titers (NT50), platelet counts, and D-dimer levels were analyzed before and after vaccination. Results: The seroconversion rates of anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG at day 28 after a boost vaccination (BD28) were 100% and 95.19%, respectively. Anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG levels were highly correlated (r = 0.7891), which were 172.9  170.4 and 179.3  76.88 BAU/mL at BD28, respectively. The geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of NT50 for all participants increased to 132.9 IU/mL (95% CI 120.0C147.1) at BD28 and were highly correlated with anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG levels (r = 0.8248 and 0.7474, respectively). Body weight index was statistically significantly associated with anti-RBD IgG levels (p = 0.035), while female recipients had higher anti-spike IgG levels (p = 0.038).

A Large-scale satellite data was combined with these data with a regression analysis model to explore effects of temperature and relative humidity on COVID-19 spreading, as well as the possible transmission risk by seasonal cycles. The result show that temper-ature and relative humidity are shown to be negatively correlated with COVID-19 transmission throughout the world. Further, the effect of temperature and humidity is almost linear based on our samples, with uncertainty sur-rounding any nonlinear effects. Government intervention (e.g. lockdown policies) and lower population movement contributed to the decrease the new daily case ratio. The conclusions withstand several robustness checks, such as observation scales and maximum/minimum temperature. Weather conditions are not the decisive factor in COVID-19 transmission, in that government intervention as well as public awareness, could contribute to the miti-gation of the spreading of the virus.

Titanium implants degrade over time inside the body, which results in the release of implant wear-off particles. Titanium nanoparticles (TiNPs) favor pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization (M1) and lower tolerogenic activation (M2). GDF-15 regulates immune tolerance and fibrosis and is endocytosed by stabilin-1. How TiNPs affect the healing activities of macrophages and their release of circulating cytokines is an open question in regenerative medicine. In this study for the first time, we identified the transcriptional program induced and suppressed by TiNPs in human pro-inflammatory and healing macrophages. Microarray analysis revealed that TiNPs altered the expression of 5098 genes in M1 (IFN--stimulated) and 4380 genes in M2 (IL-4Cstimulated) macrophages. 1980 genes were differentially regulated in both M1 and M2. Affymetrix analysis, confirmed by RT-PCR, demonstrated that TiNPs upregulate expression of GDF-15 and suppress stabilin-1, scavenger receptor of GDF-15. TiNPs also significantly stimulated GDF-15 protein secretion in inflammatory and healing macrophages. Flow cytometry demonstrated, that scavenging activity of stabilin-1 was significantly suppressed by TiNPs. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that TiNPs impair internalization of stabilin-1 ligand acLDL and its transport to the endocytic pathway. Our data demonstrate that TiNPs have a dual effect on the GDF-15/stabilin-1 interaction in macrophage system, by increasing the production of GDF-15 and suppressing stabilin-1-mediated clearance function. In summary, this process can result in a significant increase of GDF-15 in the extracellular space and in circulation leading to unbalanced pro-fibrotic reactions and implant complications.","output":"Titanium Nanoparticles Enhance Production and Suppress Stabilin-1-Mediated Clearance of GDF-15 in Human Primary Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Namibia is an upper-middle income country in southern Africa, with a population of approximately 2.5 million (1).

The growing use of information and communication technologies (ICT), together with a new approach to work aimed at ensuring the safety of health care professionals and patients alike, has allowed us to maintain the quality of care while ensuring biosecurity. The application of ICT to health care (eHealth) aims to significantly improve the quality, access to, and effectiveness of medical care. In fact, the expanded use of ICT has been recognized as a key, cost-effective priority for health care by the World Health Organisation. The medical speciality of radiation oncology is closely linked to technology and as a consequence of coronavirus disease 2019, ICT has been widely employed by radiation oncologists worldwide, providing new opportunities for interaction among professionals, including telemedicine and e-learning, while also minimizing treatment interruptions. Future research should concentrate on this emerging paradigm, which offers new opportunities, including faster and more diverse exchange of scientific knowledge, organizational improvements, and more efficient workflows. Moreover, these efficiencies will allow professionals to dedicate more time to patient care, with a better work-life balance.

Echocardiography remains the preferred modality for diagnosis and monitoring of pregnant women with cardiovascular disease as it is widely available and does not require radiation. This paper reviews the role of echocardiography along the continuum of pregnancy in at-risk patients, with a focus on key cardiac disease states in pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS: In the preconception stage, risk stratification scores such as CARPREG II, ZAHARA and the modified WHO remain central to counseling and planning. As such, echocardiography serves an important role in assessing the severity of pre-existing structural disease. Among women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease who become pregnantas well as those who develop cardiovascular symptoms during pregnancyechocardiography is a key imaging tool for assessment of hemodynamic and structural changes and is recommended as the first-line imaging modality when appropriate by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, routine screening intervals during pregnancy for various cardiac lesions are not well defined, resulting in clinical heterogeneity in care. SUMMARY: Echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice for defining, risk stratifying, and monitoring cardiovascular changes throughout pregnancy. Once identified, at-risk patients should receive careful individual counseling and follow-up with a multidisciplinary team. Echocardiography serves as a widely available tool for serial monitoring of pregnant women with cardiovascular disease throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period.","output":"Echocardiography for the Pregnant Heart"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Professional quality of life greatly impacts wellbeing and performance of professionals working in the field of caring. The study aims at assessing the components of professional quality of life and their predictors. Design and methods: The cross-sectional study was performed on 167 physicians enrolled by using stratified random sampling from tertiary care hospitals, Ismailia, Egypt. It was conducted by a structured interview questionnaire which included Maslach Burnout Inventory to assess burnout syndrome, and Professional Quality of Life version 5 (Pro QOL- 5) subscale to assess compassion fatigue and satisfaction. Results: Among participants, 78.9% had high burnout, 76% had moderate potential compassion satisfaction and 82% had moderate potential compassion fatigue. The correlation between scales of professional quality of life scores showed significant results (p<0.05). The multiple linear regression analysis showed that marital status, frequency of dealing with critical patients, and compassion fatigue score (B= -6.959, B= 3.573, B= 1.115) were significant predictors of burnout score (p<0.05). Marital status (B= 2.280, p=0.024), and burnout score (B = 0.179, p=0.000) were significant positive predictors of compassion fatigue. While compassion satisfaction score was negative predictor (B= -2.804, p=0.006). The predictors of compassion satisfaction were the marital status (B = 5.039, p=0.000), and compassion fatigue score (B = -0.254, p=0.006).

Administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential treatment option during SARS-CoV-2, initially gained popularity, but later, its safe usage became questionable due to its cardiovascular safety, largely stemming from instances of cardiac arrhythmias in COVID-19. Moreover, in the setting of rheumatic diseases, in which patients are usually on HCQ for their primary disease, there is a need to scale the merits and demerits of HCQ usage for the treatment of COVID-19. In this narrative review, we aim to address the association between usage of HCQ and sudden cardiac death in COVID-19 patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov and SCOPUS databases were used to review articles in English ranging from case reports, case series, letter to editors, systematic reviews, narrative reviews, observational studies and randomized control trials. HCQ is a potential cause of sudden cardiac death in COVID-19 patients. As opposed to the reduction in CVD with HCQ in treatment of systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis, and other rheumatic diseases, safe usage of HCQ in COVID-19 patients is unclear; whereby, it is observed to result in QTc prolongation and Torsades de pointes even in patients with no underlying cardiovascular comorbidity. This is occasionally associated with sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest; hence, its clinical efficacy needs further investigation by large-scale clinical trials.","output":"COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine and sudden cardiac death: implications for clinical practice in patients with rheumatic diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The spread of COVID-19 has challenged the paramedic communitys ability to provide health care, maintain personal safety, and implement evidence informed decisions and programs. The study objective was to examine the published literature related to paramedicine and pandemics. Methods A rapid review of research derived from an existing broad database of literature generated between 2006 and 2019 was used. We conducted a targeted secondary search of this database to identify studies of pandemics in paramedicine contexts and included three levels of screening. We used content analysis to identify broad themes and subthemes, and provide summaries and descriptions of each. Results From 54,638 citations, our search identified 24 citations representing eight countries. The most common method of enquiry was cross-sectional survey (n=10). Five broad themes (and 15 subthemes) were identified: general planning and preparedness (impact to paramedic service operations, roles and responsibilities, communication centre preparedness, paramedic service preparedness, training); workforce (availability of personal protective equipment, safety of family, perception of risk, trust in the organisation); ethics (duty, resource allocation); (triage (needless exposure to infection, transmission of disease); and vaccination (vaccination information, organisational readiness). Conclusion The evidence base describes the importance of pandemic planning and preparedness for emergency medical services and integrating these activities into broader public health and healthcare system plans. Although this rapid review provides a foundation to support response plans and research, it is considered just in time for the evolving pandemic, and further work understanding research in paramedicine and pandemics is recommended.","output":"A rapid review of pandemic studies in paramedicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a complex, which causes cell damage In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of dexmedetomidine on lung in the renal IR model in diabetic rats The concept of tele-education has been present in the background for many years From the idea of making use of your idle time by distant learning through television to use of simulated courses to enhance your clinical skills and judgements, tele-education has stood the test of time by constantly evolving according to the needs of modern era In recent times, owing to the current pandemic, tele-education has finally come to shine in all its glory Whether you want to standardize the learning experience or ensure quality education for everyone in the world, tele-education is the key It is a vital education tool, cost effective as efficient as traditional learning despite few shortcomings","output":"Tele-education in the post-COVID period;a new normal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty leaves older adults vulnerable to adverse health outcomes. Frailty assessment is recommended by multiple COVID\\\\19 guidelines to inform care and resource allocation. We aimed to identify, describe, and synthesize studies reporting the association of frailty with outcomes (informed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Triple Aim [health, resource use, and experience]) in individuals with COVID\\\\19. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta\\\\analysis. SETTING: Studies reporting associations between frailty and outcomes in the setting of COVID\\\\19 diagnosis. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with COVID\\\\19. MEASUREMENTS: Following review of titles, abstracts and full text, we included 52 studies that contained 118,373 participants with COVID\\\\19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic studies tool. Our primary outcome was mortality, secondary outcomes included delirium, intensive care unit admission, need for ventilation and discharge location. Where appropriate, random\\\\effects meta\\\\analysis was used to pool adjusted and unadjusted effect measures by frailty instrument. RESULTS: The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was the most used frailty instrument. Mortality was reported in 37 studies. After confounder adjustment, frailty identified using the CFS was significantly associated with mortality in COVID\\\\19 positive patients (odds ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49C2.14; hazard ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.33C2.61). On an unadjusted basis, frailty identified using the CFS was significantly associated with increased odds of delirium and reduced odds of intensive care unit admission. Results were generally consistent using other frailty instruments. Patient\\\\reported, cost and experience outcomes were rarely reported. CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with a substantial increase in mortality risk in COVID\\\\19 patients, even after adjustment. Delirium risk is also increased. Frailty assessment may help to guide prognosis and individualized care planning, but data relating frailty status to patient\\\\reported outcomes are urgently needed to provide a more comprehensive overview of outcomes relevant to older adults.","output":"Association of frailty with outcomes in individuals with COVID\\\\19: A living review and meta\\\\analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In contrast with adults, children infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (SARS-CoV) develop milder clinical symptoms.

Emergence of new variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron can potentially render the current vaccines ineffective. However, our understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology and molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is very limited. The role of the Hippo signaling pathway, an evolutionarily conserved organogenesis circuitry, in tissue inflammation and innate immune response is beginning to be understood. Given the complexity of COVID-19 associated cell injury and immunopathogenesis processes, we investigated this Hippo pathway dynamic in SARS-CoV-2 infection by utilizing COVID-19 lung samples, transcriptome and human cell models based on pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) and human primary lung air-liquid interface (ALI) culture. The SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in stoppage of cardiomyocyte beating and extensive apoptotic cell death. Especially the infection caused activation of Hippo signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes, as shown by increased level of phosphorylated form of YAP, a downstream transcriptional co-factor involved in tissue growth, mitochondrial biogenesis and innate immunity. Similar activation was noted in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung ALI epithelial cells and COVID-19 lung autopsy samples. The shRNA-mediated partial knockdown and pharmacological inhibitor of YAP/TAZ resulted in significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas inhibition of Hippo pathway upstream LATS1 and MST1 kinases led to enhanced virus replication. These results indicate a direct role of Hippo signaling in SARS-CoV-2 mediated disease pathogenesis and this pathway can be pharmacologically targeted to treat COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and Hippo Signaling Pathway: A Potential Therapeutic Target."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preferential RNA packaging in coronaviruses involves the recognition of viral genomic RNA, a crucial process for viral particle morphogenesis mediated by RNA-specific sequences, known as packaging signals. An essential packaging signal component of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) has been further delimited to the first 598 nucleotides (nt) from the 5' end of its RNA genome, by using recombinant viruses transcribing subgenomic mRNA that included potential packaging signals. The integrity of the entire sequence domain was necessary because deletion of any of the five structural motifs defined within this region abrogated specific packaging of this viral RNA. One of these RNA motifs was the stem-loop SL5, a highly conserved motif in coronaviruses located at nucleotide positions 106 to 136. Partial deletion or point mutations within this motif also abrogated packaging. Using TGEV-derived defective minigenomes replicated in trans by a helper virus, we have shown that TGEV RNA packaging is a replication-independent process. Furthermore, the last 494 nt of the genomic 3' end were not essential for packaging, although this region increased packaging efficiency. TGEV RNA sequences identified as necessary for viral genome packaging were not sufficient to direct packaging of a heterologous sequence derived from the green fluorescent protein gene. These results indicated that TGEV genome packaging is a complex process involving many factors in addition to the identified RNA packaging signal. The identification of well-defined RNA motifs within the TGEV RNA genome that are essential for packaging will be useful for designing packaging-deficient biosafe coronavirus-derived vectors and providing new targets for antiviral therapies.","output":"Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus genome packaging signal is located at the 5' end of the genome and promotes viral RNA incorporation into virions in a replication-independent process."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent data has revealed an association between coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) incidence and seasonally regulated androgen sensitivity. This potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and clock genes, coupled with previously reported effects of night shift work on health leads us to hypothesize that night shift workers may be at an increased physiological risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Shift work, especially night shift work, has long been associated with several chronic health conditions. The mechanisms that drive these associations are not well understood; however, current literature suggests that the disruption of circadian rhythms may cause downstream hormonal and immune effects that render night shift workers more susceptible to disease. First, circadian rhythms may play a role in the mechanism of viral infection, as viral vaccines administered in the morning elicit greater immune responses than those administered in the afternoon. Next, increased exposure to light at night may inhibit melatonin production, which has been observed to enhance DNA repair and shown to upregulate expression of Bmal1, an established as an inhibitor of herpes simplex virus and influenza. Finally, abnormal immune cell and cytokine levels have been observed following night-shift work.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 at a tertiary healthcare system. Cognitive impairment was identified utilizing diagnosis codes (mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, vascular, and other dementias) or cognitive impairment-specific medication use. Propensity score (PS) matched analyses were utilized to report odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for association of cognitive impairment with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 mortality. Results: Between March-3rd and December-11th, 2020, 179,979 adults were tested, of whom 21,607 (12.0%) tested positive. We identified 6,364 individuals with preexisting cognitive impairment (mean age: 78.5 years, 56.8% females), among whom 843 (13.2%) tested positive and 139 (19.5%) of those hospitalized died. In the pre-PS matched cohort, cognitive impairment was significantly associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility (OR, CI: 1.12, 1.04C1.21) and COVID-19 mortality (OR, CI: 2.54, 2.07C3.12). One-to-one matches were identified for 6,192 of 6,364 (97.3%) individuals with prior cognitive impairment and 687 of 712 (96.5%) hospitalized patients with prior cognitive impairment. In the fully balanced post-matched cohort, preexisting cognitive impairment was significantly associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR, CI: 1.51, 1.35C1.70); however, cognitive impairment did not confer higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR, CI: 0.96, 0.73C1.25).

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the illness perceptions of major religious groups (Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist) in Malaysia toward the Covid-19 pandemic, their stress levels, and the relationship between illness perception, stress, and forms of religious expression during the lockdown period. Through an online survey method, 608 Malaysian religious believers were included in this mixed-method empirical study, which adapted standardized instruments [Duke University Religion Index (DUREL), Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)]. Statistical analysis showed that all three groups reported moderate levels of stress in average without any significant difference after controlling for age. Both internal and external forms of religious expression had a significant negative relationship with stress levels. Personal control, comprehension, and emotions domains of illness perception accounted for a significant variance in the stress level. Furthermore, religious expression significantly moderated the relationship between some illness perception domains and stress. Qualitative coding revealed that most participants perceived human behavior and attitudes, sociopolitical, and sociological factors as causal factors to the current pandemic. These findings confirmed the relationship between religious expression, illness belief, and stress regulation during the pandemic lockdown. Incidental findings of age as a potential protective factor for Malaysian believers warrants further study.

COVID-19 is a rapid natural mutual virus that belongs to the coronavirus family. CXR scans are one of the vital tools to early detect COVID-19 to monitor further and control its virus spread. Classification of COVID-19 aims to detect whether a subject is infected or not. In this article, a model is proposed for analyzing and evaluating grayscale CXR images called Chest X-Ray COVID Network (CXRVN) based on three different COVID-19 X-Ray datasets. The proposed CXRVN model is a lightweight architecture that depends on a single fully connected layer representing the essential features and thus reducing the total memory usage and processing time verse pre-trained models and others. The CXRVN adopts two optimizers: mini-batch gradient descent and Adam optimizer, and the model has almost the same performance. Besides, CXRVN accepts CXR images in grayscale that are a perfect image representation for CXR and consume less memory storage and processing time. Hence, CXRVN can analyze the CXR image with high accuracy in a few milliseconds. The consequences of the learning process focus on decision making using a scoring function called SoftMax that leads to high rate true-positive classification. The CXRVN model is trained using three different datasets and compared to the pre-trained models: GoogleNet, ResNet and AlexNet, using the fine-tuning and transfer learning technologies for the evaluation process. To verify the effectiveness of the CXRVN model, it was evaluated in terms of the well-known performance measures such as precision, sensitivity, F1-score and accuracy. The evaluation results based on sensitivity, precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score demonstrated that, after GAN augmentation, the accuracy reached 96.7% in experiment 2 (Dataset-2) for two classes and 93.07% in experiment-3 (Dataset-3) for three classes, while the average accuracy of the proposed CXRVN model is 94.5%.","output":"COVID-19: a new deep learning computer-aided model for classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission continues to impact people globally.

Technology creates more workforces in the Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) field, yet the number of STEM pursuers is declining due to poor command of the English language. There is a gap in English vocabulary for STEM, which needs a novel solution from the perspective of HCI. This study aims to explore the needs of STEM learners in creating an English language competency mobile module. The methodology used is through a qualitative study. Seven STEM learners, 17 years old, participated in semi-structured interviews. The results from the interview are divided into four main themes: (1) the importance of learning English, (2) problems of learners, (3) strategies of English language learning, and (4) learners' readiness in using a mobile app. This study is significant for mobile app designers, English language teachers, and course designers as the input will provide an overview of the STEM learners' needs in the English language. Plus, designing a mobile app from the learners' perspectives gives more effectiveness to HCI, rendering success to second language acquisition.

Guidelines recommend nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding if swallowing impairment persists for 7 days or longer and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement if dysphagia does not recover within 30 days, but, to our knowledge, a systematic prediction method does not exist. Objective To develop and validate a prognostic model predicting swallowing recovery and the need for enteral tube feeding. Design, Setting, and Participants We enrolled participants with consecutive admissions for acute ischemic stroke and initially severe dysphagia in a prospective single-center derivation (2011-2014) and a multicenter validation (July 2015-March 2018) cohort study in 5 tertiary stroke referral centers in Switzerland. Exposures Severely impaired oral intake at admission (Functional Oral Intake Scale score <5). Main Outcomes and Measures Recovery of oral intake (primary end point, Functional Oral Intake Scale 5) or return to prestroke diet (secondary end point) measured 7 (indication for NGT feeding) and 30 (indication for PEG feeding) days after stroke. Results In total, 279 participants (131 women [47.0%]; median age, 77 years [interquartile range, 67-84 years]) were enrolled (153 [54.8%] in the derivation study; 126 [45.2%] in the validation cohort). Overall, 64% (95% CI, 59-71) participants failed to recover functional oral intake within 7 days and 30% (95% CI, 24-37) within 30 days. Prolonged swallowing recovery was independently associated with poor outcomes after stroke. The final prognostic model, the Predictive Swallowing Score, included 5 variables: age, stroke severity on admission, lesion location, initial risk of aspiration, and initial impairment of oral intake. Predictive Swallowing Score prediction estimates ranged from 5% (score, 0) to 96% (score, 10) for a persistent impairment of oral intake on day 7 and from 2% to 62% on day 30. Model performance in the validation cohort showed a discrimination (C statistic) of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91; P < .001) for predicting the recovery of oral intake on day 7 and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.67-0.87; P < .001) on day 30, and a discrimination for a return to prestroke diet of 0.94 (day 7; 95% CI, 0.87-1.00; P < .001) and 0.71 (day 30; 95% CI, 0.61-0.82; P < .001). Calibration plots showed high agreement between the predicted and observed outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance The Predictive Swallowing Score, available as a smartphone application, is an easily applied prognostic instrument that reliably predicts swallowing recovery. It will support decision making for NGT or PEG insertion after ischemic stroke and is a step toward personalized medicine.","output":"Development and Validation of a Prognostic Model of Swallowing Recovery and Enteral Tube Feeding After Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To predict the effects of the 2020 U S CARES Act on con-sumption, we extend a model that matches responses to past consumption stimulus packages The extension allows us to account for two novel features of the coronavirus crisis First, during lockdowns, many types of spending are undesirable or impossible Second, some of the jobs that disappear during the lockdown will not reappear We estimate that, if the lock-down is short-lived (the median point of view as we are writing in April 2020), the combination of expanded unemployment insurance benefits and stimulus payments should be sufficient to allow a swift recovery in consumer spending to pre-crisis levels If the lockdown lasts longer (or there is a second wave), an extension of enhanced unemployment benefits will likely be necessary for consumption spending to recover quickly ? 2021, European Central Bank All rights reserved","output":"Modeling the consumption response to the cares act?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) disrupted the food system motivating discussions about moving from a dependence on long food supply channels toward shorter local supply channels, including urban agriculture.

In this study, the land system (combinations of land cover and land use intensity) evolution trajectories of the Luanhe River Basin (LRB), China, and major challenges that the LRB may face in 2030, were explored by applying the CLUMondo and InVEST models. The results indicate that the LRB is likely to experience agricultural intensification and urban growth under all four scenarios that were explored. The cropland intensity and the urban growth rate were much higher under the historical trend (Trend) scenario compared to those with more planning interventions (Expansion, Sustainability, and Conservation scenarios). Unless the forest area and biodiversity conservation targets are implemented (Conservation scenario), the forest areas are projected to decrease by 2030. The results indicate that water scarcity in the LRB is likely to increase under all scenarios, and the carbon storage will increase under the Conservation scenario but decrease under all other scenarios by 2030. Our methodological framework and findings can guide regional sustainable development in the LRB and other large river basins in China, and will be valuable for policy and planning purposes to the pursuance of SDGs at the sub-national scale.

In turn, mitochondrial function strongly relies on these organelle dynamics once cyclic events of fusion and fission (division) are required for mitochondrial turnover, positioning, content homogenization, metabolic flexibility, interaction with subcellular compartments, etc. Importantly, during oogenesis, mitochondria change their architecture from an \\"orthodox\\" elongated shape characterized by the presence of numerous transversely oriented cristae to a round-to-oval morphology containing arched and concentrically arranged cristae. This, along with evidence showing that mitochondrial function is kept quiescent during most part of oocyte development, suggests an important role of mitochondrial dynamics in oogenesis. To investigate this, recent works have downregulated/upregulated in oocytes the expression of key effectors of mitochondrial dynamics, including mitofusins 1 (MFN1) and 2 (MFN2) and the dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). As a result, both MFN1 and DRP1 were found to be essential to oogenesis and fertility, while MFN2 deletion led to offspring with increased weight gain and glucose intolerance. Curiously, neither MFN1/MFN2 deficiency nor DRP1 overexpression enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation, indicating that mitochondrial size is strictly regulated in oocytes. Therefore, the present work seeks to discuss the role of mitochondria in supporting oogenesis as well as recent findings connecting defective mitochondrial dynamics in oocytes with infertility and transmission of metabolic disorders.","output":"Uncovering the important role of mitochondrial dynamics in oogenesis: impact on fertility and metabolic disorder transmission."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Long-COVID refers to a variety of symptoms affecting different organs reported by people following Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. To date, there have been no robust estimates of the incidence and co-occurrence of long-COVID features, their relationship to age, sex, or severity of infection, and the extent to which they are specific to COVID-19. The aim of this study is to address these issues. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on linked electronic health records (EHRs) data from 81 million patients including 273,618 COVID-19 survivors. The incidence and co-occurrence within 6 months and in the 3 to 6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis were calculated for 9 core features of long-COVID (breathing difficulties/breathlessness, fatigue/malaise, chest/throat pain, headache, abdominal symptoms, myalgia, other pain, cognitive symptoms, and anxiety/depression). Their co-occurrence network was also analyzed. Comparison with a propensity scoreCmatched cohort of patients diagnosed with influenza during the same time period was achieved using KaplanCMeier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model. The incidence of atopic dermatitis was used as a negative control. Among COVID-19 survivors (mean [SD] age: 46.3 [19.8], 55.6% female), 57.00% had one or more long-COVID feature recorded during the whole 6-month period (i.e., including the acute phase), and 36.55% between 3 and 6 months. The incidence of each feature was: abnormal breathing (18.71% in the 1- to 180-day period; 7.94% in the 90- to180-day period), fatigue/malaise (12.82%; 5.87%), chest/throat pain (12.60%; 5.71%), headache (8.67%; 4.63%), other pain (11.60%; 7.19%), abdominal symptoms (15.58%; 8.29%), myalgia (3.24%; 1.54%), cognitive symptoms (7.88%; 3.95%), and anxiety/depression (22.82%; 15.49%). All 9 features were more frequently reported after COVID-19 than after influenza (with an overall excess incidence of 16.60% and hazard ratios between 1.44 and 2.04, all p < 0.001), co-occurred more commonly, and formed a more interconnected network. Significant differences in incidence and co-occurrence were associated with sex, age, and illness severity. Besides the limitations inherent to EHR data, limitations of this study include that (i) the findings do not generalize to patients who have had COVID-19 but were not diagnosed, nor to patients who do not seek or receive medical attention when experiencing symptoms of long-COVID; (ii) the findings say nothing about the persistence of the clinical features; and (iii) the difference between cohorts might be affected by one cohort seeking or receiving more medical attention for their symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Long-COVID clinical features occurred and co-occurred frequently and showed some specificity to COVID-19, though they were also observed after influenza.

Community distributors were observed receiving equipment and delivering SMC. Adherence across six domains was calculated as the proportion of indications in which the community distributor performed the correct action. Focus group discussions were conducted with community distributors to understand their perceptions of the infection prevention and control measures and barriers and facilitators to adherence.ResultsWe observed community distributors in Nigeria (n=259), Burkina Faso (n=252) and Chad (n=266) receiving infection prevention and control equipment and delivering SMC. Adherence to infection prevention and control indications varied. In all three countries, adherence to mask use was the highest (ranging from 73.3% in Nigeria to 86.9% in Burkina Faso). Adherence to hand hygiene for at least 30 seconds was low (ranging from 3.6% in Nigeria to 10.3% in Burkina Faso) but increased substantially when excluding the length of time spent hand washing (ranging from 36.7% in Nigeria to 61.4% in Burkina Faso). Adherence to safe distancing in the compound ranged from 5.4% in Chad to 16.4% in Nigeria. In Burkina Faso and Chad, where disinfection wipes widely available compliance with disinfection of blister packs for SMC was low (17.4% in Burkina Faso and 16.9% in Chad). Community distributors generally found the infection prevention and control measures acceptable, however there were barriers to optimal hand hygiene practices, cultural norms made social distancing difficult to adhere to and caregivers needed assistance to administer the first dose of SMC.ConclusionAdherence to infection prevention and control measures for SMC delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic varied across domains of infection prevention and control, but was largely insufficient, particularly for hand hygiene and safe distancing.

METHODS: The case records of patients with rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis were reviewed. This included 200 patients of which 122 were males and 78 females, with a minimum age of 22 to a maximum of 80 years old. Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images were retrieved from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and analysed. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: All the patients showed sinusitis and ophthalmological symptoms. CT and MR imaging showed predominant involvement of the maxillary (196, 98%) and ethmoid (194, 97%) sinuses. Involvement of the orbit (186, 93%) and face (114, 57%) preceded involvement of the pterygopalatine fossa (90, 45%) and brain (52, 26%). CT showed minimally enhancing hypodense soft tissue thickening as the predominant finding in involved areas, while MRI showed T2 isointense to mildly hypointense soft tissue thickening and heterogeneous post-contrast enhancement as the main finding.

Here, dynamical-nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this fatty acid site is coupled to functionally relevant regions of the spike, some of them far from the fatty acid binding pocket. Removal of a ligand from the fatty acid binding site significantly affects the dynamics of distant, functionally important regions of the spike, including the receptor-binding motif, furin cleavage site and fusion-peptide-adjacent regions. Simulations of the D614G mutant show differences in behaviour between these clinical variants of the spike: the D614G mutant shows a significantly different conformational response for some structural motifs relevant for binding and fusion. The simulations identify structural networks through which changes at the fatty acid binding site are transmitted within the protein. These communication networks significantly involve positions that are prone to mutation, indicating that observed genetic variation in the spike may alter its response to linoleate binding and associated allosteric communication.","output":"The fatty acid site is coupled to functional motifs in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and modulates spike allosteric behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A grounded theory study was employed to identify the conditions contributing to the core phenomenon of Asian American activists (N = 25) mobilizing toward thick solidarity with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in 2020.

Conclusions: Findings suggest the exigent presence of masks could facilitate or inhibit meetings at depth, regulated by what masks represented to therapists/clients at moments of contact. Yet, when both therapist and client appeared mutually disconnected (to masks, not each other), they found moments of relational depth within the disconnection. Masks are suggested as a characteristic that can influence meetings at depth. Opportunities for depth seemed reliant on individual capabilities to offer depth, emphasising therapists' experiential awareness of their interoceptive process. ? 2022 The Authors.

The current scenario presents saliva as a reliable method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, due to the ease of obtaining the samples, the possibility of self-collection, low cost because there is no need to use specific equipment, in addition to reducing the risk of transmission for health professionals.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and saliva as a diagnostic tool: A real possibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined PrEP use, condomless anal sex (CAS), and PrEP adherence among men who have sex with men (MSM) attending sexual health clinics in Wales, UK. In addition, we explored the association between the introduction of measures to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on these outcomes. We conducted an ecological momentary assessment study of individuals in receipt of PrEP in Wales. Participants used an electronic medication cap to record PrEP use and completed weekly sexual behaviour surveys. We defined adherence to daily PrEP as the percentage of CAS episodes covered by daily PrEP (preceded by  3 days of PrEP and followed by  2 days). Sixty participants were recruited between September 2019 and January 2020. PrEP use data prior to the introduction of control measures were available over 5785 person-days (88%) and following their introduction 7537 person-days (80%). Data on CAS episodes were available for 5559 (85%) and 7354 (78%) person-days prior to and following control measures respectively. Prior to the introduction of control measures, PrEP was taken on 3791/5785 (66%) days, there were CAS episodes on 506/5559 (9%) days, and 207/406 (51%) of CAS episodes were covered by an adequate amount of daily PrEP.

The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed. FINDINGS: Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29-34 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days). Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [14%] patient), shortness of breath (one [14%] patient), and diarrhoea (one [14%] patient). All the patients had caesarean section within 3 days of clinical presentation with an average gestational age of 39 weeks plus 2 days. The final date of follow-up was Feb 12, 2020. The outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and one neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h after birth. INTERPRETATION: The maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of patients who were infected in late pregnancy appeared very good, and these outcomes were achieved with intensive, active management that might be the best practice in the absence of more robust data. The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 that have been reported in the literature.

Patients and Methods: In this retrospective study, we collected demographic and clinical data from 33 chronic pain patients who used 10% to 30% phenytoin cream, and in whom blood samples were drawn for phenytoin concentration measurement between January 2017 until September 2020. The instruction was to withdraw blood 1 to 4 hours after the last topical phenytoin application. The primary outcome was the detectability of plasma phenytoin after daily use of topical phenytoin. Results: Blood withdrawal was carried out after on average 14 treatment days with topical phenytoin and on average 2.5 hours after topical phenytoin application. The median daily applied amount of phenytoin cream was 1.2 grams, resulting in a median daily amount of 120 mg phenytoin on the skin. Phenytoin levels were below the limit of detection in all patients and no side effects were reported. Conclusion: Plasma phenytoin levels were below the limit of detection after topical use of phenytoin cream formulations up to 30% on intact skin and mucous membrane for the treatment of chronic pain, without side effects emerging.

Although mitochondria possess a powerful antioxidant system, an excess of ROS cannot be completely neutralized and cumulative oxidative damage may lead to decreasing mitochondrial efficiency in energy production, as well as an increasing ROS excess, which is known to cause a critical imbalance in antioxidant/oxidant mechanisms and a vicious circle in mitochondrial injury. Due to insufficient energy production, chronic exposure to ROS overproduction consequently leads to the oxidative damage of life-important biomolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and amino acids, among others. Different forms of mitochondrial dysfunction (mitochondriopathies) may affect the brain, heart, peripheral nervous and endocrine systems, eyes, ears, gut, and kidney, among other organs. Consequently, mitochondriopathies have been proposed as an attractive diagnostic target to be investigated in any patient with unexplained progressive multisystem disorder.

To date, the pandemic situation in all 55 African Union (AU) Member States has not been comprehensively reviewed. We aimed to evaluate reported COVID-19 epidemiology data to better understand the pandemic's progression in Africa. METHODS We did a cross-sectional analysis between Feb 14 and Dec 31, 2020, using COVID-19 epidemiological, testing, and mitigation strategy data reported by AU Member States to assess trends and identify the response and mitigation efforts at the country, regional, and continent levels. We did descriptive analyses on the variables of interest including cumulative and weekly incidence rates, case fatality ratios (CFRs), tests per case ratios, growth rates, and public health and social measures in place. FINDINGS As of Dec 31, 2020, African countries had reported 2 763 421 COVID-19 cases and 65 602 deaths, accounting for 34% of the 82 312 150 cases and 36% of the 1 798 994 deaths reported globally. Nine of the 55 countries accounted for more than 826% (2 283 613) of reported cases. 18 countries reported CFRs greater than the global CFR (22%). 17 countries reported test per case ratios less than the recommended ten to 30 tests per case ratio range. At the peak of the first wave in Africa in July, 2020, the mean daily number of new cases was 18 273. As of Dec 31, 2020, 40 (73%) countries had experienced or were experiencing their second wave of cases with the continent reporting a mean of 23 790 daily new cases for epidemiological week 53. 48 (96%) of 50 Member States had five or more stringent public health and social measures in place by April 15, 2020, but this number had decreased to 36 (72%) as of Dec 31, 2020, despite an increase in cases in the preceding month. INTERPRETATION Our analysis showed that the African continent had a more severe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic than the first, and highlights the importance of examining multiple epidemiological variables down to the regional and country levels over time. These country-specific and regional results informed the implementation of continent-wide initiatives and supported equitable distribution of supplies and technical assistance.

The lecture was delivered by three authors of this article in a virtual-reality workspace that enables people to meet through VR. The lectures were about combinations of dental surgical procedures and related clinical anatomy. Physically, the attendees could have been located anywhere in the world, so lecturers joined from USA and the attendees were all from Japan. VR environment and its flexibility enabled attendees to join the lecture actively, helping them to gain understanding of the surgical procedure and anatomy more efficiently. The use of VR technology with a live communication tool demonstrated in this study has several advantages over previous education methods, although there are still technical issues or disadvantages that need to be addressed. Development of the technology and app/software is required so that more data can be processed at higher speed. Use of VR technology with a live communication tool could be an alternative teaching method. Its overall advantages are a closer look at the slides/monitor and concurrent observation of the multiple assets in various directions by multiple attendees. These advantages cannot be achieved by any other teaching method without VR assets with the workspace provided by Spatial.

Outcomes from infection with the Omicron remain uncertain. We evaluate whether clinical outcomes and viral loads differ between Delta and Omicron infections during the period when both variants were co-circulating. METHODS: Remnant clinical specimens from patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after standard of care testing between the last week of November and the end of December 2021were used for whole viral genome sequencing. Cycle threshold values (Ct) for viral RNA, the presence of infectious virus, and levels of respiratory IgG were measured, and clinical outcomes were obtained. Differences in each measure were compared between variants stratified by vaccination status. RESULTS: The Omicron variant displaced the Delta during the study period and constituted 95% of the circulating lineages by the end of December 2021. Patients with Omicron infections (N= 1121) were more likely to be vaccinated compared to patients with Delta (N = 910), but were less likely to be admitted, require ICU level care, or succumb to infection regardless of vaccination status. There was no significant difference in Ct values based on the lineage regardless of the vaccination status. Recovery of infectious virus in cell culture was reduced in boosted patients compared to fully vaccinated without a booster and unvaccinated when infected with the Delta lineage. However, in patients with Omicron infections, recovery of infectious virus was not affected by vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Omicron infections of vaccinated individuals are expected, yet admissions are less frequent. Admitted patients might develop severe disease comparable to Delta. Efforts for reducing the Omicron transmission are required as even though the admission risk is lower, the numbers of infections continue to be high.","output":"A Quick Displacement of the SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta with Omicron: Unprecedented Spike in COVID-19 Cases Associated with Fewer Admissions and Comparable Upper Respiratory Viral Loads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) is a promising biomarker of pretreatment risk in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Different segmentation methods can be used which predict prognosis equally well but give different optimal cut-offs for risk stratification. Segmentation can be cumbersome meaning a fast, easy and robust method is needed. Aims were to i) evaluate the best automated MTV workflow in DLBCL ii) determine if uptake time, (non)compliance with standardized recommendations for FDG scanning and subsequent disease progression influenced the success of segmentation iii) assess differences in MTV values and discriminatory power of segmentation methods. Methods: 140 baseline FDG-PET/CT scans were selected from UK and Dutch studies in DLBCL to provide a balance between scans at 60- or 90-minutes uptake, parameters compliant or non-compliant with standardized recommendations for scanning and patients with or without progression. An automated tool was used for segmentation using i) standardized uptake value (SUV) 2.5 ii) SUV 4.0 iii) adaptive thresholding [A50P] iv) 41% of maximum SUV [41%] v) majority vote including voxels detected by 2 methods [MV2] and vi) detected by 3 methods [MV3]. Two independent observers rated the success of the tool to delineate MTV. Scans that required minimal interaction were rated \\"success\\"; scans where > 50% of tumor was missed or required more than 2 editing steps were rated as \\"failure\\". Results: 138 scans were evaluable, with significant differences in success and failure ratings between methods. The best performing was SUV4.0, with higher success and lower failure rates than all other methods except MV2 which also performed well. SUV4.0 gave a good approximation of MTV in 105 (76%) scans, with simple editing for a satisfactory result in additionally 20% of cases. MTV was significantly different for all methods between patients with and without progression. SUV41% performed slightly worse with longer uptake times, otherwise scanning conditions and patient outcome did not influence the tool's performance. The discriminative power of methods was similar, but MTV values were significantly greater using SUV4.0 and MV2 than other thresholds except for SUV2.5. Conclusion: SUV4.0 and MV2 are recommended for further evaluation. Automated estimation of MTV is feasible.","output":"Automated segmentation of baseline metabolic total tumor burden in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: which method is most successful ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic propagation of SARS-CoV-2 led to the adoption of a myriad of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs, e.g., social distancing, mobility restrictions, gathering restrictions) in the Americas.

Data from suspected and laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases during 2020 were analyzed by age groups and sex, clinical signs, and symptoms as well as outcome. The impact of NPIs was quantified using time-varying reproduction numbers (R(t)) estimated as a time-series and by sectors of the city. Findings.

However, the cytokine-storm induced during COVID-19-Pregnancy may cause severe inflammatory damage to the fetus, and if uncontrolled, may later result in autism spectrum-like disorders and brain development abnormalities in neonates. Considering this serious health threat to child growth and development, the prevention of COVID-19 during pregnancy should be considered a high priority. This review summarizes the intricate virulence factors of COVID-19 and elucidate its pathobiological spectrum during pregnancy and postpartum periods with a focus on the putative and complex roles of endogenous and exogenous lactoferrin in conferring immunological advantage to the host.","output":"COVID-19 during Pregnancy and Postpartum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 infection is considered a multi-system disease with neurological, digestive, and cardiovascular symptoms and complications. It can trigger acute and diffuse endothelial dysfunction, resulting in a cytokine storm, most likely induced by the interleukin-6 (IL-6) amplifier. The peripheral and central neurological complications may explain some clinical manifestations such as vagus nerve palsy. The known main CT chest findings of COVID-19 pneumonia include ground glass patches, pulmonary consolidations, inter-lobar septal thickening, crazy paving appearance, and others. We presented our experience in the incidental discovery of phrenic nerve paralysis as atypical chest finding in patients with a known history of COVID-19-associated pneumonia, proved by RT-PCR and coming for evaluation of the lung changes. Patients with evidence of diaphragmatic paralysis underwent close follow-up with a re-evaluation of the phrenic nerve palsy at their routine follow-up for COVID-19 pneumonia. The association of the phrenic nerve palsy was correlated with the CT chest severity score. RESULTS: Among 1527 scanned patients with known COVID-19 pneumonia, we had recognized 23 patients (1.5%) with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, accidentally discovered during CT chest examination. Twenty-one patients had shown complete recovery of the associated diaphragmatic paralysis during their follow-up CT chest with regression or the near-total resolution of the pulmonary changes of COVID-19- pneumonia. No significant correlation between the incidence of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and CT severity score with p value = 0.28. CONCLUSION: Phrenic paralysis is considered a serious but rare neurological complication of COVID-19 pneumonia. No significant correlation between the CT severity score and the incidental discovery of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. The majority of the cases show spontaneous recovery together with the improvement of the pulmonary changes of COVID-19 pneumonia. The association of phrenic paralysis with anosmia and dysgeusia could suggest a direct viral attack on the nerve cells.","output":"Recognition of phrenic paralysis as atypical presentation during CT chest examination of COVID-19 infection and its correlation with CT severity scoring: a local experience during pandemic era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of SARS-CoV-2 GI infection on clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: For this retrospective cohort study, 104 patients with COVID-19 were classified into a SARS-CoV-2 GI infection group and a non-infection group. The primary endpoint was the time of negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory tract samples. The secondary outcome was the time of hospitalization for COVID-19. Results: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 GI infection had a longer duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory tract samples (median 12.0 days [95% CI: 10.0C13.2] vs. 9.0 days [95% CI: 7.5C10.5]; HR 0.575 [95% CI: 0.386C0.857]; P = 0.003) and hospitalization (median 28.0 days [95% CI: 23.2C32.8] vs. 15.0 days [95% CI: 13.6C16.4]; HR 0.149 [95% CI: 0.087C0.252]; P < 0.001) than patients without SARS-CoV-2 GI infection. Subgroup analyses for sex, age, epidemiological history, clinical classification and antiviral treatment showed consistent results. Conclusion: Our study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 GI infection prolongs the duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding and hospitalization in the patients with COVID-19. More attention should be paid to SARS-CoV-2 GI infection of COVID-19 and fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA test should be completed in time.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Gastrointestinal Infection Prolongs the Time to Recover From COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While some biomolecules have been explored to identify potential biomarkers for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients, there is no reliable prognostic indicator of the disease progression and severity.

Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) could be an efficient and informative way to assess RA DA, which is highlighted by the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, as most consultations are remote rather than face-to-face. We aimed to assess all PROMs for RA DA against the internationally recognised COSMIN guidelines to provide evidence\\\\based recommendations to select the most suitable PROMs. METHODS: Review registered on PROSPERO as CRD42020176176. The search strategy was based on a previous similar systematic review and expanded to include all articles up to January 2019. All identified articles were rated by two independent assessors following the COSMIN guidelines. RESULTS: 668 abstracts were identified, with 10 articles included. A further 21 were identified from a previous review. Ten PROMs were identified. There was insufficient evidence to place any of the identified PROMs into recommendation for use category A due to lack of evidence for content validity, as stipulated by the COSMIN guidelines. CONCLUSION: Lack of evidence of content validity limits suitable PROM selection, therefore none can be recommended for use.

As contexts of crisis increase in frequency, the ability of organizations to adapt and effectively respond to crises has become a key necessity for organizational survival and continuity. The purpose of this paper is to explore how the repercussions of crises may be curtailed through a multidimensional crisis management approach. Design/methodology/approach This paper applies a narrative literature review and concept mapping to synthesize and establish relationships between the literature in the domains of leadership, knowledge management, learning and contexts of crisis. The output of this methodological orientation is the Integrated Crisis Management Framework, presenting a conceptualized overview of the symbiotic and intertwined manner through which leadership, knowledge management and learning contribute towards effective crisis management. Findings According to the analysis and the conceptual underpinnings of this paper, in contexts of crisis, leadership is generally responsible for aggregating crisis management strategies and establishing employee motivation. Knowledge management, on the other hand, provides the infrastructure necessary for calculated yet rapid decision-making. Similarly, in times of crisis, learning is a prerequisite for the development of a \\"learningful\\" organization, which contributes towards crisis management by serving as the organization's \\"memory\\" - where lessons learned from previous crises suffice to guide future crisis response. Originality/value The literature in crisis management reveals that existing crisis management models and frameworks generally consider crisis from a unidimensional perspective, neglecting to account for the multifaceted nature of crises, and the numerous attributes necessary to overcome contexts of crisis. To address this gap in the literature, this paper proposes a multidimensional conceptualization of crisis management through combining three core elements, including leadership, learning and knowledge management. The novelty of this paper is an Integrated Crisis Management Framework, and eight empirical propositions, which act as an impetus for future research.","output":"Synergistic triad of crisis management: leadership, knowledge management and organizational learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of December 2019, a new coronavirus denominated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China Less than three months later, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) to be a global pandemic Growing numbers of clinical, histopathological, and molecular findings were subsequently reported, among which a particular interest in skin manifestations during the course of the disease was evinced Today, about one year after the development of the first major infectious foci in Italy, various large case series of patients with COVID-19-related skin manifestations have focused on skin specimens However, few are supported by histopathological, immunohistochemical, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data on skin specimens Here, we present nine cases of COVID-positive patients, confirmed by histological, immunophenotypical, and PCR findings, who underwent skin biopsy A review of the literature in Italian cases with COVID-related skin manifestations is then provided","output":"Skin Manifestation of SARS-CoV-2: The Italian Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although different studies have evaluated the positive impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on reducing noise pollution and traffic levels and improving air quality, how populations have perceived such changes in the natural environment has not been adequately evaluated.

Our goal was to combine estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 household secondary attack rate (SAR) and explore variation in estimates of the household SAR. RESULTS: The overall pooled random-effects estimate of the household SAR was 17.1% (95% CI: 13.7-21.2%). In study-level, random-effects meta-regressions stratified by testing frequency (1 test, 2 tests, >2 tests), SAR estimates were 9.2% (95% CI: 6.7-12.3%), 17.5% (95% CI: 13.9-21.8%), and 21.3% (95% CI: 13.8-31.3%), respectively.

The patients ages ranged from 59 to 81, including three males and one female. Each patient had at least one underlying disease, including immunocompromised status (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and renal transplantation) or other conditions (cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes). Time from disease onset to death ranged from 15 to 52 days. All patients had elevated white blood cell counts, with significant rise toward the end, and all had lymphocytopenia except for the patient with leukemia.

Africa was projected to be devastated by COVID-19. There is currently limited data regarding regional predictors of mortality among patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the independent risk factors associated with mortality among patients with COVID-19 in Africa. METHODS: A total of 1028 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Africa with definite survival outcomes were identified retrospectively from an open-access individual-level worldwide COVID-19 database. The live version of the dataset is available at https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019 . Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine the risk factors that independently predict mortality among patients with COVID-19 in Africa. RESULTS: Of the 1028 cases included in study, 432 (42.0%) were females with a median (interquartile range, IQR) age of 50 (24) years. Older age (adjusted odds ratio {aOR} 1.06; [95% confidence intervals {95% CI}, 1.04-1.08]), presence of chronic disease (aOR 9.63; [95% CI, 3.84-24.15]), travel history (aOR 2.44; [95% CI, 1.26-4.72]), as well as locations of Central Africa (aOR 0.14; [95% CI, 0.03-0.72]) and West Africa (aOR 0.12; [95% CI, 0.04-0.32]) were identified as the independent risk factors significantly associated with increased mortality among the patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving gradually in Africa. Among patients with COVID-19 in Africa, older age, presence of chronic disease, travel history, and the locations of Central Africa and West Africa were associated with increased mortality.

However, little is known about how racial hate spreads during a pandemic and the role of counterhate speech in mitigating the spread. Here we study the evolution and spread of anti-Asian hate speech through the lens of Twitter. We create COVID-HATE, the largest dataset of anti-Asian hate and counterhate spanning three months, containing over 30 million tweets, and a social network with over 87 million nodes. By creating a novel hand-labeled dataset of 2,400 tweets, we train a text classifier to identify hate and counterhate tweets that achieves an average AUROC of 0.852. We identify 891,204 hate and 200,198 counterhate tweets in COVID-HATE. Using this data to conduct longitudinal analysis, we find that while hateful users are less engaged in the COVID-19 discussions prior to their first anti-Asian tweet, they become more vocal and engaged afterwards compared to counterhate users. We find that bots comprise 10.4% of hateful users and are more vocal and hateful compared to non-bot users. Comparing bot accounts, we show that hateful bots are more successful in attracting followers compared to counterhate bots. Analysis of the social network reveals that hateful and counterhate users interact and engage extensively with one another, instead of living in isolated polarized communities. Furthermore, we find that hate is contagious and nodes are highly likely to become hateful after being exposed to hateful content. Importantly, our analysis reveals that counterhate messages can discourage users from turning hateful in the first place.

Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying in near-real time the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility. METHODS: Here we explore patterns of change in densities, domestic and international flows and co-location of Facebook users in the UK from March 2020 to March 2021. RESULTS: We find substantial heterogeneities across time and region, with large changes observed compared to pre-pademic patterns. The impacts of periods of lockdown on distances travelled and flow volumes are evident, with each showing variations, but some significant reductions in co-location rates. Clear differences in multiple metrics of mobility are seen in central London compared to the rest of the UK, with each of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland showing significant deviations from England at times. Moreover, the impacts of rapid changes in rules on international travel to and from the UK are seen in substantial fluctuations in traveller volumes by destination. CONCLUSIONS: While questions remain about the representativeness of the Facebook data, previous studies have shown strong correspondence with census-based data and alternative mobility measures, suggesting that findings here are valuable for guiding strategies.

Knowledge about people's lived experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination can enhance vaccine promotion and increase uptake. AIM: To use COVID-19 vaccine trial participants' experiences to identify key themes in the lived experience of vaccination early in the vaccine approval and distribution process. METHODS: We interviewed 31 participants in the Iowa City, Iowa US site of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial. While trial participation differs from clinical receipt of an approved vaccine in key ways, it offers the first view of people's lived experiences of potentially receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial context is also useful since decision-making about vaccination and medical research participation often involve similar hopes and concerns, and because the public appears to view even approved COVID-19 vaccines as experimental given their novelty. Semi-structured interviews addressed subjects' experiences, including decision-making and telling others about their trial participation. We analyzed verbatim transcripts of these interviews thematically and identified common themes relevant for vaccination decision-making. RESULTS: Participants across demographic groups, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation, described largely similar experiences. Key motivations for participation included ending the pandemic/restoring normalcy, protecting oneself and others, doing one's duty, promoting/modeling vaccination, and expressing aspects of identity like being a helper, career-related motivations, and support of science/vaccines. Participants often felt uniquely qualified to help via trial participation due to personal attributes like health, sex/gender or race/ethnicity. They reported hearing concerns about side effects and the speed and politicization of vaccine development. Participants responded by normalizing and contextualizing side effects, de-politicizing vaccine development, and explaining how the rapid development process was nevertheless safe. CONCLUSION: These findings regarding participants' reported motivations for trial participation and interactions with concerned others can be incorporated into COVID-19 vaccine promotion messaging aimed at similar populations.","output":"The social experience of participation in a COVID-19 vaccine trial: Subjects' motivations, others' concerns, and insights for vaccine promotion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Given that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mainly spreads through the respiratory system and is associated with severe pulmonary complications, lung cancer patients may have worse outcomes than those with other tumors. There is no confirmed evidence about the mortality comparison between COVID-19 patients with lung cancer and other tumors. We performed a systematic review and pooled analysis to provide precise estimates of the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with lung cancer and other tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study systemically included and reviewed 13 studies on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients with lung cancer published up to November 1, 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. We also compared the all-cause mortality rates in China and other regions as a secondary endpoint. The mortality rate was assessed with a fixed-effects model, which was used to derive the pooled mortality and 95% con?dence interval (CI). RESULTS: Thirteen studies from different countries, involving 1,229 patients with both COVID-19 and cancer, were selected for the pooled analysis. A total of 343 deaths were recorded in this population: 86 for lung cancers and 257 for other tumors. The mortality rate varies from 18% to 60% for patients with lung cancer and COVID-19 and 10% to 41% for other tumor patients with COVID-19. The overall meta-analysis did not show a significant mortality difference for the lung cancer and other tumor subgroups (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 0.98-2.20, p = 0.06, I(2) = 23%). Nevertheless, in regions other than China, the pooled mortality of lung cancer patients with COVID-19 was 42%, which was significantly higher than that of other tumors (24%) (OR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.54-4.86, p = 0.0006, I(2) = 16%).

Effective communication regarding technical issues between disaster experts and the residents is key to averting such secondary impacts. However, misconceptions about scientific issues and mistrust in experts frequently occur even with intensive and sincere communications. This miscommunication is usually attributed to residents' conflicts with illiteracy, emotion, value depositions and ideologies. However, considering that communication is an interactive process, there are likely to be additional factors attributable to experts. This article aims to summarize the gaps in rationality between experts and residents observed after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster to describe how residents perceived experts. There were discrepancies in the perception of 'facts', the perception of probability, the interpretation of risk comparison, what were included as risk trade-offs, the view of the disaster, whose behavior would be changed by the communication and whether risk should be considered a science. These findings suggest that there was a non-scientific rationality among residents, which often exercised a potent influence on everyday decision-making. It might not be residents but experts who need to change their behavior. The discrepancies described in this article are likely to apply to communications following any CBRNE disasters that affect people's lives, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, our experiences in Fukushima may provide clues to averting mutual mistrust between experts and achieving better public health outcomes during and after a crisis.","output":"'Life communication' after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster: what experts need to learn from residential non-scientific rationality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Empathy teaching in medical school has a chequered history.

The purpose of this study was to provide a review of the pandemic and physical disaster management literature to summarize physical therapyCspecific operational considerations to assist hospital-based leadership teams in planning and response efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A rapid review was conducted over a 4-week time frame (AprilCMay 2020). The review team included 3 physical therapist clinician researchers, a health librarian, and a member of the physical therapy leadership team. The initial search strategy identified 303 articles, 80 of which were retained for full-text screening. Twenty articles were included in the review. RESULTS: Five main categories of operational considerations for physical therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic were identified: (1) organizational actions, (2) staffing considerations, (3) physical therapist roles, (4) physical resources, and (5) other considerations.

To be prepared for future pandemics, public health policy makers should put effort into fully understanding any complex psychological tensions that inherently arise between opposing human factors such as free enjoyment versus self-restriction. As the COVID-19 crisis is an unusual and complex problem, combinations of diverse factors such as health risk perception, knowledge, norms and beliefs, attitudes and behaviors are closely associated with individuals intention to enjoy the experience economy but also their concerns that the experience economy will trigger further spread of the infectious diseases. Our aim is to try identifying what factors are associated with their concerns about the spread of the infectious disease caused by the local experience economy. Hence, we have chosen a data-driven explanatory approach, Probabilistic Structural Equational Modeling, based on the principle of Bayesian networks to analyze data collected from the following four countries with indicated sample sizes: Denmark (1,005), Italy (1,005), China (1,013), and Japan (1,091). Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the contextual differences in relations between the target variable and factors such as personal value priority and knowledge. These factors affect the target variable differently depending on the local severity-level of the infections. Relations between pleasure-seeking via the experience economy and individuals anxiety-level about an infectious hotspot seem to differ between East Asians and Europeans who are known to prioritize so-called interpersonal- and independent self-schemes, respectively. Our study also indicates the heterogeneity in the populations, i.e., these relations differ within the respective populations. Another finding shows that the Japanese population is particularly concerned about their local community potentially becoming an infectious hotspot and hence expecting others to comply with their particular social norms. Summarizing, the obtained insights imply the importance of considering both cultural- and individual contexts when policy makers are going to develop measures to address pandemic dilemmas such as maintaining public health awareness and accelerating the recovery of the local experience economy.","output":"Cross-Cultural Bayesian Network Analysis of Factors Affecting Residents Concerns About the Spread of an Infectious Disease Caused by Tourism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This protocol describes an integrated approach for analyzing site-specific N- and O-linked glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by mass spectrometry.

Several digital interventions have been deployed to reduce the catastrophic impact of the pandemic and observe preventive measures. However, the adoption and utilisation of these technologies by the affected populace has been a daunting task. Therefore, this study carried out exploratory investigation of the factors influencing the behavioural intention (BI) of people to accept COVID-19 digital tackling technologies (CDTT) using the UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) framework. The study applied principal components analysis and multiple regression analysis for hypotheses testing. The study revealed that performance expectancy (PE), facilitating conditions (FC) and social influence (SI) are the best predictors of people's BI to accept CDTT. Also, organizational influence and benefit (OIB) and government expectancy and benefits (GEB) influence the people's BI. However, variables such as age, gender and voluntariness to use CDTT have no significance to influence BI because the CDTT is still nascent and not easily accessible. The results show that the decision-makers and regulators should consider inciting variables such as PE, FC, SI, OIB and GEB, that motivate the acceptance and use of CDTT. Furthermore, the populace must be sensitized to the availability and use of CDTT in all communities. Also, the path diagram and hypothesis testing results for CDTT acceptance and use, will help government and private organizations in planning and responding to the digitalization of COVID-19 protective measures and hence revise the COVID-19 health protection regulation.","output":"A Modified UTAUT Model for the Acceptance and Use of Digital Technology for Tackling COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we consider the influence of combined general anesthesia on the results of electrically-involved stapedial reflex threshold (esrt) registration.

METHODS This prospective, multicenter clinical trial enrolled 220 consecutive participants between November 29, 2006, and January 14, 2008, followed by a second cohort of 102 participants between January 14 and June 18, 2008. Enrolled participants had carotid stenosis (symptomatic >50% or asymptomatic >80%). The first 220 subjects underwent distal EPD placement with a new large-diameter filter, and the second cohort of 102 underwent placement of an older EPD that is no longer manufactured. All 322 participants were to be treated with a dedicated carotid stent with a tapered, small, closed-cell design (Xact; Abbott Vascular) and were to be included in the long-term evaluation. Independent neurologic assessment was performed before CAS and at 1 day, 30 days, and annually after CAS. All primary end point events were independently adjudicated by a central committee. RESULTS The periprocedural composite end point of DSMI (95% confidence interval) in the first 220 participants was 2.3% (0.74%, 5.22%), with a combined death and stroke rate of 1.8% (0.50%, 4.59%) and a rate of death and major stroke of 0.5% (0.01%, 2.51%). As of January 3, 2011, the median follow-up for the entire 322-subject cohort for the long-term evaluation was 2.8 years. Freedom from the periprocedural composite of DSMI plus ipsilateral stroke thereafter was 95.4%, with an annualized ipsilateral stroke rate of 0.4%. CONCLUSIONS CAS outcomes in patients at high risk for CEA have improved from earlier carotid stent trials.

Understanding viral transmissibility among asymptomatic individuals is critical for successful control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present study aimed to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility among young asymptomatic individuals and to assess whether symptomatology was associated with transmission of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic infections. METHODS: We analyzed one of the first-identified clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infections with multiple chains of transmission that occurred among university students in March 2020 in Kyoto prefecture, Japan, using discrete and two-type branching process models. Assuming that the number of secondary cases resulting from either primary symptomatic or asymptomatic cases independently followed negative binomial distributions, we estimated the relative reproduction numbers of an asymptomatic case compared with a symptomatic case. To explore the potential association between symptomatology and transmission of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic incident infections, we also estimated the proportion of secondary symptomatic cases produced by primary symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. RESULTS: The reproduction number for a symptomatic primary case was estimated at 1.14 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61C2.09). The relative reproduction number for asymptomatic cases was estimated at 0.19 (95% CI: 0.03C0.66), indicating that asymptomatic primary cases did not result in sufficient numbers of secondary infections to maintain chains of transmission. There was no apparent tendency for symptomatic primary cases to preferentially produce symptomatic secondary cases. CONCLUSIONS: Using data from a transmission network during the early epidemic in Japan, we successfully estimated the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection at 0.22.

The volume of Google searches related to COVID-19 and face masks was regarded as an indicator of public epidemic awareness in the study. A time-series analysis was used to explore the relationships among public epidemic awareness and other COVID-19 relevant variables, which were collected based on big data analysis. Additionally, the content analysis was adopted to analyze the transmission of different types of fear information related to COVID-19 and their effects on the public. Our results indicate that public epidemic awareness was significantly correlated with the number of confirmed cases in Taiwan and the number of news reports on COVID-19 (correlation coefficient: .33C.56). Additionally, the findings from the content analysis suggested that the fear of the loss of control best explains why panic behavior occurs among the public. When confronting the highly infectious COVID-19, public epidemic awareness is vital. While fear is an inevitable result when an emerging infectious disease occurs, the government can convert resistance into assistance by understanding why fear arises and which fear factors cause excessive public panic.

Generalized additive mixture models were used to characterize trajectories of cortical development. Results revealed widespread linear puberty-related changes across much of the cortex. Many of these changes, particularly within the frontal and parietal cortices, were independent of age-related development. Males exhibiting faster pubertal tempo demonstrated greater thinning in the precuneus and frontal cortices than same-aged and -sex peers.

It is possible that cost of health care, doctor-patient relationships, and the clinical reasoning skills could be seriously impacted by ongoing decrease in bedside skills and the teaching of these skills. Careful history taking and hypothesis-driven physical examination still form the backbone of clinical reasoning and lead to parsimonious investigations.

For establishing some preliminary views on decontamination and disinfection, surrogate CoVs have commonly been assessed. This review serves to examine the existing science in regards to CoV containment generically and then to translate these findings into timely applications for COVID-19. There is widespread dissemination of CoVs in the immediate patient environment, and CoVs can potentially be spread via respiratory secretions, urine, and stool. Interpretations of the spread however must consider whether studies examine for viral RNA, virus viability by culture, or both. Pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and post-fourteen day virus excretion from patients may complicate the epidemiology. Whereas droplet spread is accepted, there continues to be controversy over the extent of possible airborne spread and especially now for SARS-CoV-2. CoVs are stable in body secretions and sewage at reduced temperatures. In addition to temperature, dryness or relative humidity, initial viral burden, concomitant presence of bioburden, and the type of surface can all affect stability. Generalizing, CoVs can be susceptible to radiation, temperature extremes, pH extremes, peroxides, halogens, aldehydes, many solvents, and several alcohols. Whereas detergent surfactants can have some direct activity, these agents are better used as complements to a complex disinfectant solution. Disinfectants with multiple agents and adverse pH are more likely to be best active at higher water temperatures. Real-life assessments should be encouraged with working dilutions. The use of decontamination and disinfection should be balanced with considerations of patient and caregiver safety. Processes should also be balanced with considerations for other potential pathogens that must be targeted.

This study is a part of TAHES, a population-based prospective cohort study in Benin and aims to establish normal reference values for echocardiographic diameters of the proximal aorta in Africans. METHODS Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examinations were performed by four cardiologists following pre-defined protocols, and analyzed off-line by a single observer. Aortic root diameters were measured during diastole for sinuses of Vasalva (SV), sinotubular junction (STJ) and proximal ascending aorta (AA), and during systole for annulus. Upper limits were defined as the 95th percentiles. RESULTS We included 513 normotensive, non-diabetic, and cardiovascular disease-free individuals (206 men, 307 women, age 40  14 years). The diameters of the proximal aorta were significantly greater in men. The inner-edge-to-inner-edge non-indexed upper values for the annulus, SV, STJ and AA were respectively 25, 34, 28.5, 32 mm in men and 22, 30, 26, 30 mm in women. The leading-edge-to-leading-edge upper values were respectively 38, 35, 36 for men and 34, 33, 32 mm for women. No significant differences between sexes were recorded for body surface area (BSA)-indexed diameters of the annulus, STJ and AA. BSA-indexed SV dimension was greater in men than women were. SV, STJ, AA indexed-diameters correlated with age in both sexes but not for annulus indexed-diameter. CONCLUSION Normal values from a general population in West Africa could to differ from those established in Caucasian populations.

Anesthesiologists and operating room (OR) nurses are at high risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and developing COVID-19. We conducted a single-center survey to investigate the psychological status and perceived social support among operation room (OR) medical staffs during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A total of 197 OR medical staffs were enrolled in the survey. The authors performed a cohort study during the period of Wuhan lockdown and then conducted a longitudinal follow-up after lifting of lockdown. The Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess for depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety. The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) was used to assess perceived social support. We compared the psychological status of OR medical staffs before and after lifting of Wuhan lockdown. Results: During the period of city lockdown, 177 (89.8%) had close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in OR medical staffs was 41.6 and 43.1% under Wuhan lockdown, while 13.2 and 15.7% after lifting of lockdown (P = 0.002, P = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female, living in suburb areas, shortage of protective equipment and close contact with COVID-19 patients were associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety. Perceived social support was negatively correlated with depression and anxiety severity in the OR medical staffs (P < 0.05). Conclusions: OR medical staffs exhibited high incidence of anxiety and depression faced with the high risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients. More social support and social recognition for anesthesiologists and OR nurses might potentially help them relieve their psychological pressure.","output":"Psychological Status Among Anesthesiologists and Operating Room Nurses During the Outbreak Period of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of multimedia courseware developed to assist teaching and learning activities has increased tremendously, following the declaration of schools closure during COVID-19 pandemic.

Several reports have been published regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the residency programs; however, all studies were performed in developed countries or did not comprehensively analyze what residents think about the COVID-19 impact on their residency program. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pediatric surgery residency program in our institution as an important part of hospital medical services. METHODS: We developed and distributed a questionnaire to pediatric surgery residents in our institution who were registered from January 2015CJuly 2020. The questionnaire was consisting of 24 questions: a) the perspectives of residents about COVID-19 infection during their residency program; b) the learning process; c) academic evaluations; and d) residents' suggestions to improve the quality of their residency program during the outbreak. RESULTS: Most (82.6%) pediatric surgery residents agreed that elective surgeries should be postponed during the pandemic. Before the outbreak, almost all (82.6%) residents used textbooks and journals as their primary sources of learning, while during the outbreak, 69.5% of residents shifted to use online lectures either from the school or Association of Pediatric Surgeons. Interestingly, 91.3% of participants agreed that they had more time to complete their academic assignments during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had a significant impact on the development of pediatric surgery residency programs.

The results suggest that participating as an Annex I party has a significant positive impact on CO(2) emission reductions, but a negative impact on the GDP of the participants in the long run. The predicted marginal benefit of the Protocol based on the marginal damage cost of carbon emissions shows that the marginal benefit of emission reductions mitigates a limited portion of the GDP loss.

With inbreeding nearly complete, we estimated the extinction rate among CC lines at a remarkable 95%, which is substantially higher than in the derivation of other mouse recombinant inbred populations. Here, we report genome-wide allele frequencies in 347 extinct CC lines. Contrary to expectations, autosomes had equal allelic contributions from the eight founders, but chromosome X had significantly lower allelic contributions from the two inbred founders with underrepresented subspecific origins (PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ). By comparing extinct CC lines to living CC strains, we conclude that a complex genetic architecture is driving extinction, and selection pressures are different on the autosomes and chromosome X Male infertility played a large role in extinction as 47% of extinct lines had males that were infertile. Males from extinct lines had high variability in reproductive organ size, low sperm counts, low sperm motility, and a high rate of vacuolization of seminiferous tubules. We performed QTL mapping and identified nine genomic regions associated with male fertility and reproductive phenotypes. Many of the allelic effects in the QTL were driven by the two founders with underrepresented subspecific origins, including a QTL on chromosome X for infertility that was driven by the PWK/PhJ haplotype. We also performed the first example of cross validation using complementary CC resources to verify the effect of sperm curvilinear velocity from the PWK/PhJ haplotype on chromosome 2 in an independent population across multiple generations. While selection typically constrains the examination of reproductive traits toward the more fertile alleles, the CC extinct lines provided a unique opportunity to study the genetic architecture of fertility in a widely genetically variable population. We hypothesize that incompatibilities between alleles with different subspecific origins is a key driver of infertility. These results help clarify the factors that drove strain extinction in the CC, reveal the genetic regions associated with poor fertility in the CC, and serve as a resource to further study mammalian infertility.","output":"Male Infertility Is Responsible for Nearly Half of the Extinction Observed in the Mouse Collaborative Cross."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on cancer screening in Manitoba, Canada using an interrupted time series (ITS) design and data from Manitoba's population-based, organized cancer screening programs from April 2020 to August 2021.

The aim of this study was to see whether or not this may affect overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). METHOD: A systematic review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020189158). Medline, EMBASE and Scopus were interrogated. Patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer who received elective surgery as their primary treatment were included. Delay to elective surgery was defined as the period between CRC diagnosis and the day of surgery. Meta-analysis of the outcomes OS and DFS were conducted. Forest plots, funnel plots and tests of heterogeneity were produced. An estimated number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated for statistically significant pooled hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Of 3753 articles identified, seven met the inclusion criteria. Encompassing 314 560 patients, three of the seven studies showed that a delay to elective resection is associated with poorer OS or DFS. OS was assessed at a 1 month delay, the HR for six datasets was 1.13 (95% CI 1.02-1.26, p = 0.020) and at 3 months the pooled HR for three datasets was 1.57 (95% CI 1.16-2.12, p = 0.004). The estimated NNH for a delay at 1 month and 3 months was 35 and 10 respectively. Delay was nonsignificantly negatively associated with DFS on meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This review recommends that elective surgery for CRC patients is not postponed longer than 4 weeks, as available evidence suggests extended delays from diagnosis are associated with poorer outcomes.

However, the precise mechanism underlying the regulation of VGLL1 activation remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?)-mediated activation of VGLL1 and the VGLL1-TEAD4 interaction in gastric cancer cells. We showed that TGF-? enhanced VGLL1 phosphorylation and that this phosphorylated VGLL1 functioned as a transcription cofactor of TEAD4 in NUGC3 cells. TGF-? also increased the phosphorylation of ERK and ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) in NUGC3 cells, thereby triggering the translocation of phosphorylated RSK2 to the nucleus. Site-directed mutagenesis and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that RSK2 phosphorylated VGLL1 at S84 in the presence of TGF-?. Mutation of VGLL1 at S84 suppressed VGLL1-TEAD4 binding and the subsequent transcriptional activation of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9). Moreover, VGLL1 peptide containing S84 suppressed the TGF-?-induced MMP9 expression and reduced the invasion and proliferation of gastric cancer cells, whereas VGLL1 peptide containing S84A did not. Furthermore, suppression of expression or activation of VGLL1 enhances the therapeutic effects of lapatinib. Collectively, these results indicate that VGLL1 phosphorylation via TGF-?/ERK/RSK2 signaling plays a crucial role in MMP9-mediated malignancy of gastric cancer.

Considering the toxicity of these drugs, alternative interventions are needed for long-term treatment. The anti-CD20 antibody rituximab has shown promising steroid-sparing properties, with conflicting results in complicated forms of SD-INS. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) resulted effective in maintaining free-steroid remission, however, studies are limited to few uncontrolled trials with reported different dose of MMF.

Immune response dysfunction in the brain contributes to the occurrence and development of PD. This study aimed to uncover the potential diagnostic genes for PD and characterize the immune cell infiltrates. METHODS We downloaded the microarray data of patients with PD samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the modules linked to PD in the GSE20163 dataset. Meanwhile, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the healthy control samples and PD samples were also identified. Then the PD-related genes were integrated based on the genes in the key module and DEGs. Functional enrichment analysis was used to explore the molecular mechanisms of these PD-related genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis were used to further screen candidate genes for PD. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied to explore the biological functions of these candidate genes. The infiltration of immune cells was detected by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm in the GSE20163 dataset, and Pearson analysis was used to investigate the correlation of candidate genes with immune cells and immune checkpoint proteins. The expression of candidate genes in clinical samples was verified by qPCR. RESULTS Altogether, we found a unique gene module related to PD, where 109 DEGs were identified in the GSE20163 dataset. Following these results, we screened 68 genes associated with PD. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses suggested that these genes were markedly enriched in the pathway of synthesis and transport of neurons. Three candidate genes (SLC18A2, CALB1, and SYNGR3) were further identified in PD patients through PPI network and LASSO analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated that the three candidate genes had a good performance in distinguishing the PD samples from healthy control samples. The proportions of the aDC, DC, NK CD56dim cells, and follicular helper T cells (TFH) were obviously different between the healthy control and PD samples. Moreover, CTLA4, LAG3, CEACAM1, and CD27 were highly expressed in the PD group. GSEA analysis for candidate genes revealed that they were all closely related to the neurogenic disease. Additionally, the three candidate genes were all strongly correlated with the above immune cells and immune checkpoint proteins. The qPCR results validated the expression differences of SLC18A2 and SYNGR3 in the clinical PD and control samples. CONCLUSION The three candidate genes may be a useful tool for diagnosing PD patients. These findings provide a reference for exploring new therapeutic targets and strategies for PD treatment.","output":"Identifying the hub gene and immune infiltration of Parkinson's disease using bioinformatical methods."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the application value of artificial liver support system in the clinical treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with cytokine storm.

The levels of inflammation-related indicators including white blood cell, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, and the proportions of patients with these abnormal indicators were both significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The level of neutrophil was not effectively reduced before and after the treatment, but the proportion was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). However, the abnormality of lymphocyte in the patients was not improved. There was no significant difference in immune-related indicators, AST and ALT before and after the treatment (p > 0.05). CT imaging showed that the artificial liver support treatment contributed to absorption of pulmonary lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The artificial liver support system had a great clinical effect in the treatment of cytokine storm and inflammation in COVID-19 patients, and it could promote the absorption of infected lesions.","output":"Application value of artificial liver support system in the treatment of cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the food crisis threat due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Indonesian Government initiates a national food supply enhancement program recognized as food estate which was then established as a part of National Strategic Programs. To maintain its implementation, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry through PermenLHK 24/2020 allows the legalization of forest land utilization, including the protected forest land for the food estate program. This study aims to analyze emerging conflict norms related to the utilization of the protected forest in Indonesias food estate program. The method used is normative legal research conducted by reviewing various forestry-related legal instruments and principles in Indonesia. The main findings reveal that the legalization of the utilization of protected forests for food estate projects by PermenLHK 24/2020 does not meet legal certainty and contradicts the norms incorporated in the hierarchical higher related regulations. In connection to climate change, the legalization of utilizing protected forests for the food estate program will open up opportunities for deforestation and encourage degradation of the protected function of these forests. The forestry sector has become one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Indonesia, with deforestation and land degradation as the root of the problem. The implication of food estate becomes a regressive action for the realization of Indonesias commitment to reduce GHG emissions from the forestry sector up to 17.2% with unconditional mitigation scenario (CM 1) and 23% with conditional mitigation scenario (CM 2) by 2030.","output":"Detrimental impact of Indonesian food estate policy: Conflict of norms, destruction of protected forest, and its implication to the climate change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The elaboration of a general formalism on quantum spin entanglement in curved spaceCtime is presented by a system of two particles described by wave packets moving in a gravitational field (GF).

Infectious Diseases OBJECTIVE: Unusual or unexpected effect of treatment BACKGROUND: Icosapent ethyl, a form of eicosapentaenoic acid with anti-inflammatory activity, has been approved as an adjunctive treatment with statins in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Icosapent ethyl is currently undergoing clinical trials to determine its anti-inflammatory effects in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This report describes 3 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with icosapent ethyl as part of their supportive care who had favorable outcomes. CASE REPORTS: Case 1 was a 75-year-old man with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Case 2 was a 23-year old man with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Case 3 was a 24-year old man with a history of autism. All cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were confirmed from a nasopharyngeal swab using the Becton Dickinson nasopharyngeal reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. All patients in these cases were treated with a course of 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice a day by nasogastric tube. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 cases describes the use of icosapent ethyl as a component of supportive treatments in ICU patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. However, as of yet there are no evidence-based treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection from controlled clinical trials. The outcomes of ongoing clinical trials are awaited to determine whether icosapent ethyl has anti-inflammatory effects in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and which patients might benefit from the use of this adjunctive treatment.","output":"Three Cases of COVID-19 Pneumonia That Responded to Icosapent Ethyl Supportive Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article was updated was to correct the spelling of Dave Hamm's name: it is correct as displayed here.","output":"Correction to: COVID-19 and people who use drugs: a call for action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Black communities have been affected disproportionately by the negative conditions associated with COVID-19, such as higher levels of morbidity and mortality, unemployment, underemployment, food insecurity, homelessness, grief and loss, and the pandemics of intersectionality. This adversity is often associated with greater vulnerabilities in the areas of psychological functioning and wellness. Black communities have historically had negative experiences with the medical establishment. Despite recent increases, Black Americans still tend to underutilize mental health services due to many barriers, such as stigma, attitudes of mistrust, geographical inaccessibility, lack of affordable options, the availability of culturally humble mental health providers, myths of Black invincibility, and challenges navigating complex systems of care. Due to the physical and psychological impacts of the polypandemic, Black populations are in even greater need of mental health care. Additionally, there is increased risk to the mental health of Black children in relation to trauma and the suicide crisis. This article will focus on our responsibility as a clinical community to reduce and eliminate the obstacles to service utilization among Black populations using the following strategies: understanding historic cultural mistrust;enhancing the pipeline of Black psychologists;integrating cultural adaptations into therapy;acknowledgment of the suicidal crisis and impact of adverse childhood experiences among Black children and youth;affirming the importance of religious/spiritual worldview and practices;and prioritizing self-care for psychologists.

However, robust and accurate screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays is still a globally recognized challenge because of two bottlenecks: 1) imaging features of COVID-19 share some similarities with other pneumonia on chest X-rays, and 2) the misdiagnosis rate of COVID-19 is very high, and the misdiagnosis cost is expensive. While a few pioneering works have made much progress, they underestimate both crucial bottlenecks. In this paper, we report our solution, discriminative cost-sensitive learning (DCSL), which should be the choice if the clinical needs the assisted screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays. DCSL combines both advantages from fine-grained classification and cost-sensitive learning. Firstly, DCSL develops a conditional center loss that learns deep discriminative representation. Secondly, DCSL establishes score-level cost-sensitive learning that can adaptively enlarge the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 examples into other classes. DCSL is so flexible that it can apply in any deep neural network. We collected a large-scale multi-class dataset comprised of 2,239 chest X-ray examples: 239 examples from confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1,000 examples with confirmed bacterial or viral pneumonia cases, and 1,000 examples of healthy people. Extensive experiments on the three-class classification show that our algorithm remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. It achieves an accuracy of 97.01%, a precision of 97%, a sensitivity of 97.09%, and an F1-score of 96.98%.

Current drugs target viral proteins, resulting in a critical need for RNA-targeted nanomedicines. To address this, a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants was performed. Several highly conserved sites were identified, of which the most noteworthy is a partial homopurine palindrome site with >99% conservation within the coding region. This sequence was compared among recently emerged, highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants. Conservation of the site was maintained among these emerging variants, further contributing to its potential as a regulatory target site for SARS-CoV-2. RNAfold was used to predict the structures of the highly conserved sites, with some resulting structures being common among coronaviridae. An RNA-level regulatory map of the conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 was produced based on the predicted structures, with each representing potential target sites for antisense oligonucleotides, triplex-forming oligomers, and aptamers. Additionally, homopurine/homopyrimidine sequences within the viral genome were identified. These sequences also demonstrate appropriate target sites for antisense oligonucleotides and triplex-forming oligonucleotides.

Case Presentation: A 23 year old female Gravida 1 Para 0 at 36 weeks and 5 days of amenorrhea presented at Mal Super Specialty Hospital as a referral in a semi-conscious state after a severe attack of tonic-clonic seizures. Detailed history from the husband was insignificant except for a persistent cough for the last 7 days. She had denied any visual changes, headaches or vaginal discharge. Physical examination revealed a tachycardia (150 bpm), elevated blood pressure (187/111 mmHg), a tachypnea (36 breaths/minute) and SPO 2 of 94% at room air. Routine COVID-19 Rapid test turned positive, and the urine dipstick was +3. Additional tests revealed a leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes. Chest radiograph revealed prominent interstitial markings and a bedside transabdominal ultrasonography showed a live single intrauterine fetus in cephalic presentation with normal cardiac activity and movements. A diagnosis of a prime gravida with eclampsia and COVID-19 was made. She was managed with intravenous labetalol, she had already received a loading dose of IV Magnesium sulphate and we administered two maintenance doses during monitoring. Within an hour of admission, she had a spontaneous rupture of the amniotic membranes, with meconium stained liquor (grade 2), and the fetal heart rate (148 beats per minute) was reassuring. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery of a live male newborn. Shortly after delivery, she developed slight respiratory distress and significant fluid overload that was managed with furosemide.

DUBs have been implicated as attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of viral diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The lack of selective chemical tools for the exploration of these enzymes significantly impairs the determination of their roles in both normal and pathological states. Commercially available fluorogenic substrates are based on the C-terminal Ub motif or contain Ub coupled to a fluorophore (Z-LRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC); therefore, these substrates suffer from lack of selectivity. By using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) and a defined P2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two DUBsMERS PLpro and human UCH-L3. Based on these results, we designed and synthesized Ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (ABPs) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the C-terminal Ub motif. Biochemical analysis and cell lysate experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered Ub-based substrates and probes. Using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes Ub and Ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.","output":"Engineered unnatural ubiquitin for optimal detection of deubiquitinating enzymes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurologic manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection, have been frequently reported in the adult population but remain relatively rare in pediatric patients, specifically in regard to cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs).

Here, the demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings of patients diagnosed with CCHF during the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were examined, and differential diagnosis was stressed. Methods: This study comprised 12 patients over the age of 18 who were admitted to our clinic after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020 and whose CCHF diagnosis was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with viral-RNA or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with immunoglobulin M antibodies. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings as well as treatment and prognosis of the patients were investigated. Results: Of the 12 cases, 10 (83.3%) were men and 2 (16.7%) were women. The median (interquartile range) age was 51 (27-64) years. Eleven (91.7%) patients lived in rural regions, and seven (58.3%) had a history of tick contact. Five patients were hospitalized in an external center with a preliminary diagnosis of COVID-19 and transferred to our center due to clinical and laboratory deterioration. Loss of appetite, headache, fever, weakness, and muscle-joint pain were the most common complaints of the patients.

In an attempt to address these educational gaps, researchers, school districts, and government officials have been working to provide resources for those in communities with low economic opportunities, with low levels of educational attainment, and overall defined as being marginalized. This article asks: How can parents and students be more effectively connected with the resources available to them? Then once they are effectively connected, the question remains: To what degree does this access improve students' and families' lives? It is of critical importance to go beyond offering resources, connecting families directly to the resources and documenting the changes that happen. Therefore, the authors implemented an innovative way to do so by incorporating community health and education workers (CHEWs) who can serve as liaisons between families, resources, and schools, providing health and educational outreach and advocacy. Informed by Maslow's hierarchy of need, they believe that what happens outside of the classroom directly impacts a child in the classroom;thus, helping parents and students to connect to resources more effectively ultimately prepares the child for success in the classroom. The article begins by describing who the community health and education workers (CHEWs) are. It goes on to describe how the authors worked with a low-income minority school district in Southern California with over 53,000 students placing CHEWs at schools in hopes of ultimately impacting education by reducing chronic absenteeism, increasing parental engagement, and increasing use of school district resources.","output":"Bridging the Gap between Resources and Marginalized Families"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development and innovation of laparoscopic vision platform has promoted the innovation of surgical concept and technology from laparotomy to minimally invasive surgery From the initial use of reflector device with candlelight to observe the interior of the human body cavity, to the high-definition and ultra-high-definition laparoscopic vision system, from laparoscopic cholecystectomy, to the popularization and promotion of various laparoscopic surgery for malignant tumor, surgery has undergone great changes due to minimally invasive technology In the new era, the application of three-dimensional and 4K laparoscope brings a new perspective to minimally invasive surgery, so as to promote the development of surgery in the direction of accurate anatomy and functional protection In the future, stimulated by concept renovation in post-epidemic era of COVID-19, virtual reality technology and robotic surgery supported by the fifth generation wireless systems, as well as tele-surgery and distance training and teaching based on it, will become a new perspective for the development of minimally invasive surgery Copyright ? 2020 by the Chinese Medical Association","output":"Concept renovation: a new perspective of minimally invasive surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: A key component of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 included an expansion of the Child Tax Credit with advance payments beginning in July 2021, a child allowance that was projected to dramatically reduce child poverty. Food insufficiency has increased markedly during the economic crisis spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, with disparities among marginalized populations, and may be associated with substantial health care and social costs. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the introduction of advance payments for the Child Tax Credit in mid-July 2021 was associated with changes in food insufficiency in US households with children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data from several phases of the Household Pulse Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau from January 6 to August 2, 2021. The survey had 585 170 responses, representing a weighted population size of 77 165 153 households. EXPOSURE: The first advance Child Tax Credit payment, received on July 15, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Household food insufficiency. RESULTS: The weighted sample of 585 170 respondents was mostly female (51.5%) and non-Hispanic White (62.5%), with a plurality aged 25 to 44 years (48.1%), having a 4-year degree or more (34.7%) and a 2019 household income of $75 000 to $149 999 (23.1%). In the weeks after the first advance payment of the Child Tax Credit was made (July 21 to August 2, 2021), 62.4% of households with children reported receiving it compared with 1.1% of households without children present (P < .001). There was a 3.7Cpercentage point reduction (95% CI, C0.055 to C0.019 percentage points; P < .001) in household food insufficiency for households with children present in the survey wave after the first advance payment of the Child Tax Credit, corresponding to a 25.9% reduction, using an event study specification. Difference-in-differences (?16.4%) and modified Poisson (?20.8%) models also yielded large estimates for reductions in household food insufficiency associated with the first advance payment of the expanded Child Tax Credit. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that the Child Tax Credit advance payment increased household income and may have acted as a buffer against food insufficiency. However, its expansion and advance payment are only a temporary measure for 2021. Congress must consider whether to extend these changes or make them permanent and improve implementation to reduce barriers to receipt for low-income families.","output":"Association of the Implementation of Child Tax Credit Advance Payments With Food Insufficiency in US Households"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted higher education institutions in the United States (US). Given the dangers of close social interaction in spreading COVID-19, colleges and universities closed their campuses to minimize and often restrict face-to-face instruction of any kind, including supplemental skill development training and experiential learning. In exchange, higher education institutions implemented online learning strategies to continue education for students, including in-person experiential field experiences. This paper describes the adaptation of an in-person experiential field experience into an eight-day virtual workshop as a result of COVID-19 restrictions along with results from participant surveys evaluating pre-and post-test changes in knowledge and their overall assessment of the virtual workshop. This workshop, the Public Health and Cancer Research Workshop (PHCRW), was tailored for students from health-related graduate programs with the primary goal of introducing students to the causes and impacts of cancer disparities in the US/Mexico border region and research related to mitigating those disparities. The course facilitators added a professional development curriculum necessary for student success and the pursuit of advanced degrees such as academic/job interviewing skills and scientific and grant writing. The objectives were for students to (1) understand introductory and intermediate curriculum on public health, cancer, and cancer research; (2) examine the interrelationships among factors impacting public health problems; (3) describe the components of the research process; (4) describe various components of scientific writing; and (5) demonstrate professional strategies associated with school admission and employment. Students completed pre-and post- self-assessments that indicated gains in knowledge about cancer topics, particularly cancer prevention strategies (M(pre) = 3.43; M(post) = 4.43), social determinants associated with cancer (M(pre) = 3.29; M(post) = 4.43), and cancer rates by characteristics (M(pre) = 3.43; M(post) = 4.43). Additionally, students overwhelmingly stated that they appreciated the opportunity to supplement their educational experience in a virtual format. Though the virtual format proved challenging in some respects, students expressed high satisfaction with the workshop. In addition to achieving the goals, the workshop successfully increased students' skills, knowledge, and self-confidence. Despite the last-minute adaptation of the PHCRW, students' satisfaction indicated that this program was an overall success.","output":"Teaching Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Tailoring Virtual Learning for Public Health and Cancer Health Disparities Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary: Natural killer (NK) cells are large granular lymphocytes of the innate immune system that participate in the early control of microbial infections and cancer.

Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are immunocompromised due to defects in humoral and cellular immunity as well as immunosuppressive therapies. The efficacy after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in MM patients is currently unknown. Here, we report the case of a MM patient who developed a fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection after full vaccination while in remission after B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T treatment. We show that the patient failed to generate antibodies or SARS-CoV-2-specific B and T cell responses, highlighting the continued risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in vaccine non-responders. In the largest cohort of vaccinated MM patients to date, we demonstrate that 15.9% lack SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody response more than 10 days after the second mRNA vaccine dose. The patients actively receiving MM treatment, especially on regimens containing anti-CD38 and anti-BCMA, have lower antibody responses compared to healthy controls. Thus, it is of critical importance to monitor this patient population for serological responses.

This method combines a linear scaling divide and conquer semiempirical algorithm with the PB equation in a QM/MM framework, allowing only a specified region's charges to be polarized by the solvent while using fixed charges from a MM force field for the remaining system. This can save time over a full QM implementation, only requiring self-consistency to be achieved in a small QM region, while giving comparable results. The solvation free energy of pentapeptides capped with an acetyl group (ACE) at the N-terminus and an N-methylamine group at the C-terminus (NME) was used to study the accuracy of this method as well as several small protein systems. The solvation free energies for the QM/MM implementation compare well with a full QM treatment of the same system, giving reasonable representations for the solvation free energy of the entire system independent of the QM region's size. In the case of the pentapeptides, the average error was only 4.9 kcal/mol with the smallest QM region. This mixed method will allow an accurate description of solvation effects in an area of interest, such as an active site, using mixed QM/MM Hamiltonians.

However, given the temporary closure of UK stop smoking services and vape shops, smokers attempting to quit may instead seek out mobile health support, such as smartphone apps. OBJECTIVE: We examined, using an interrupted time series approach, whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a step change or increasing trend in UK downloads of an otherwise popular smoking cessation app, Smoke Free. METHODS: Data were from daily and nondaily adult smokers in the United Kingdom who had downloaded the Smoke Free app between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020 (secondary analysis). The outcome variable was the number of downloads aggregated at the 12-hourly (primary analysis) or daily level (secondary analysis). The explanatory variable was the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, operationalized as March 1, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 15, 2020 (secondary analysis). Generalized additive mixed models adjusted for relevant covariates were fitted. RESULTS: Data were collected on 45,105 (primary analysis) and 119,881 (secondary analysis) users. In both analyses, there was no evidence for a step change or increasing trend in downloads attributable to the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Calculation of Bayes factors (BFs) indicated that the data for the primary analysis favored the null hypothesis compared with large associations (for level, BF=0.25; for slope, BF=0.26) but were insensitive to the detection of small associations (for level, BF=0.78; for slope, BF=1.35). CONCLUSIONS: In the United Kingdom, between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020, and between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, there was no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a large step change or increasing trend in downloads of a popular smoking cessation app. Findings on the association of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with a small step change or increasing trend were inconclusive.","output":"Influence of the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak on the Uptake of a Popular Smoking Cessation App in UK Smokers: Interrupted Time Series Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The infectious disease from corona virus, or COVID-19, has quickly spread world-wide since 2019.

Management of personal protective equipment (PPE) and its potential limited availability have created concerns about the increased risks for healthcare professionals at hospitals and nursing homes. Ozone is a powerful oxidant agent. The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of ozone treatment on PPE contaminated with SARS-CoV-2, and to explore whether relative humidity could modify those effects. METHODS: PPE contaminated by heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 were treated with different ozone concentrations, exposure times, and relative humidity conditions. SARS-CoV-2 gene amplification was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: There was no amplification of SARS-CoV-2 in PPE after the following ozone exposures: 30 s at 10,000 ppm (20 g/m3), 5 min at 4000 ppm, and 10 min at 2000 ppm. At lower ozone concentrations, 4-12 ppm (0.008-0.024 g/m3), the effects were highly dependent on the relative humidity conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress induced by ozone exposure eliminated heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in different PPE components under appropriate exposure times, ozone concentrations, and relative humidity conditions. These findings could have implications in decreasing the risk of contamination associated with personal protective equipment management and in increasing its availability.

All patients were on active follow-up and lived in Lombardy, one of the most affected areas. PATIENTS: We enrolled 279 patients with primary and secondary AI and 112 controls (patients with benign pituitary lesions without hormonal alterations). All AI patients had been previously trained to modify their replacement therapy on stress doses. INTERVENTION: By administering a standardized questionnaire by phone, we collected data on COVID-19 suggestive symptoms and consequences. RESULTS: In February-April 2020, the prevalence of symptomatic patients (complaining at least one symptom of viral infection) was similar between the two groups (24% in AI and 22.3% in controls, p 0.79). Highly suggestive COVID-19 symptoms (at least two including fever and/or cough) also occurred equally in AI and controls (12.5% in both groups).

These results suggest that amino acid residues at position 479 and 487 of the S protein are important determinants for SARS-CoV tropism and animal-to-human transmission.","output":"Identification of Two Critical Amino Acid Residues of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Spike Protein for Its Variation in Zoonotic Tropism Transition via a Double Substitution Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Our institution performed an educational initiative targeting previously identified barriers to pediatric sepsis recognition and treatment. We hypothesized that provider knowledge, attitude, and behavior would be improved 1 year after implementation. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study of a multi-faceted quality initiative introduced to providers in the Emergency Department, inpatient wards, and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary care childrens hospital. Educational platforms consisted of quarterly electronic sepsis newsletters, brightly colored posters highlighting protocol and screening strategies displayed throughout the hospital, and low-fidelity simulation sessions (drills) led by trained staff and incorporated into daily workflows. The content was driven by feedback from a baseline needs assessment of sepsis education. One year after implementation, the needs assessment was repeated. RESULTS: Over 3 months, facilitators conducted 197 drills and captured a majority of nurses (89%), pediatrics residents (96%), and respiratory therapists (62%). By 6 months, 241 sessions had been completed. Approximately 55.4% of the 442 eligible staff participated in our post-intervention survey. Overall, knowledge of diagnostic criteria for pediatric sepsis and septic shock increased from pre-intervention levels (P = 0.015). Among post-implementation respondents, drill participants outperformed their colleagues (P = 0.001). A greater percentage of post-intervention respondents indicated comfort with sepsis recognition (P < 0.001), and fewer reported hesitating to bring sepsis concerns to their care team (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a multidisciplinary curriculum balancing active educationthrough brief, targeted simulationand general awarenessthrough electronic resources and a poster campaigncan improve sepsis-related knowledge, attitude, and behavior among pediatric practitioners.","output":"Impact of a Multidisciplinary Sepsis Initiative on Knowledge and Behavior in a Pediatric Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines whether the investment of Korean business group (chaebol) affiliated firms behaved differently from that of non-chaebol firms in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

BackgroundLow dose of dexamethasone reduced mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who required respiratory support. Less is known about the efficacy of other corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to determine if longer and earlier corticoid therapy in severe COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced mortality and/or reduced rate of ICU admission for worsening of respiratory state. MethodsWe performed a retrospective study with patients aged [] 18 years, with epidemiological and/or radiological suspected COVID-19, hospitalized in a regional hospital GHRMSA Mulhouse, France. Twenty-three patients received methylprednisolone (MP) as compassionate use, 1 mg/kg/day for seven days followed by prednisolone at a gradually reduced dosage, for 4 to 6 weeks. MP was started one week after COVID-19 symptoms first appeared. The primary composite outcome was mortality and/or ICU admission during hospitalisation. ResultsBetween March 14th to June 5th 2020, 255 patients were screened, 181 were included, and 92 were analysed, 23 patients treated with MP and 69 received standard care. SARS-CoV2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 82.3%. The overall composite outcome was higher in the control group: 42/69 patients (60.9%) versus 8/23 (34.8%) in the interventional group (p= 0.018). The correction of lymphopenia between days 1 to 7 was associated with better outcome (p=0.006).

Post-lockdown, comparison with the prediction of a corresponding counterfactual model with no fomite transmission suggests fomites, through enhancing the overall transmission rate, may have contributed to as much as 25% of the deaths following lockdown.

The objective of this study was to determine morbidity, hospital course and mortality of neurosurgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in a multi-center health care system. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was conducted to identify all hospitalized neurosurgical patients positive for COVID-19 from 3/11/20 to 11/02/20 at Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Clinic Health System. RESULTS: Eleven hospitalized neurosurgical patients (0.68%) were positive for COVID-19. Four patients (36.6%) were men and 7 (63.3%) were women. The mean age was 65.7 years (range: 35-81 years). All patients had comorbidities. The mean length of stay was 13.4 days (range: 4-30 days). Seven patients had a central nervous system malignancy (4 metastases, 1 meningioma, 1 glioblastoma, and 1 schwannoma). Three patients presented cerebrovascular complications including two spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhages and 1 ischemic large vessel stroke. One patient presented with an unstable traumatic spinal burst fracture. Four patients underwent neurosurgical/neuroendovascular interventions. Discharge disposition was to home in 5, rehabilitation facility in 3 and hospice in 3 patients.

COVID-19 infection is commonly associated with symptoms like coughing, fever, and shortness of breath, besides, the reports of muscle pain, anosmia, hyposmia, and loss of taste are becoming evident. Recent reports suggest the pathogenic invasion of the SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS, that could thereby result in devastating long term complications, primarily because some of these complications may go unnoticed for a long time. Evidence suggest that the virus could enter the CNS through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, neuronal transport, haematogenous route, and nasal route via olfactory bulb, cribriform plate, and propagates through trans-synaptic signalling, and shows retrograde movement into the CNS along nerve fiber. COVID-19 induces CNS inflammation and neurological degenerative damage through a diverse mechanism which includes ACE-2 receptor damage, cytokine-associated injury or cytokine storm syndrome, secondary hypoxia, demyelination, blood-brain barrier disruption, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Viral invasion into the CNS has been reported to show association with complications like Parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disorder, meningitis, encephalopathy, anosmia, hyposmia, anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, seizures, stroke, etc. This review provides a detailed discussion of the CNS pathogenesis of COVID-19. Authors conclude that the COVID-19 cannot just be considered as a disorder of the pulmonary or peripheral system, rather it has a significant CNS involvement.

CHRFAM7A, a uniquely human fusion gene, is a negative regulator of 7 nAChR and was unaccounted for in preclinical models. METHODS Molecular methods: Function of CHRFAM7A alleles was studied in vitro in two disease relevant phenotypic readouts: electrophysiology and A uptake. Genome edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were used as a model system with the human context. Double blind pharmacogenetic study: We performed double-blind pharmacogenetic analysis on the effect of AChEI therapy based on CHRFAM7A carrier status in two paradigms: response to drug initiation and DMT effect. Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used as outcome measure. Change in MMSE score from baseline was compared by 2-tailed T-test. Longitudinal analysis of clinical outcome (MMSE) was performed using a fitted general linear model, based on an assumed autoregressive covariance structure. Model independent variables included age, sex, and medication regimen at the time of the first utilized outcome measure (AChEI alone or AChEI plus memantine), APOE4 carrier status (0, 1 or 2 alleles as categorical variables) and CHRFAM7A genotype. FINDINGS The direct and inverted alleles have distinct phenotypes. Functional CHRFAM7A allele classifies the population as 25% non-carriers and 75% carriers.

Intolerance of uncertainty has a direct predictive effect on test anxiety, and perceived social support and coping style play a chain mediator role between intolerance of uncertainty and test anxiety. By constructing the mediating effect model, we can, to some extent, reveal the mechanism of the influence of intolerance of uncertainty on test anxiety. This study has a certain reference value for the prevention of test anxiety in student athletes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The Impact of Intolerance of Uncertainty on Test Anxiety: Student Athletes During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The search for fossil fuels substitutes forces the use of new propulsion technologies applied to means of transportation. Already widespread, hybrid vehicles are beginning to share the market with hydrogen-powered propulsion systems. These systems are fuel cells or internal combustion engines powered by hydrogen fuel. In this context, road tests of a hydrogen fuel cell drive were conducted under typical traffic conditions according to the requirements of the RDE test. As a result of the carried-out work, energy flow conditions were presented for three driving phases (urban, rural and motorway). The different contributions to the vehicle propulsion of the hydrogen system and the electric system in each phase of the driving route are indicated. The characteristic interaction of power train components during varying driving conditions was presented. A wide variation in the contribution of the fuel cell and the battery to the vehicles propulsion was identified. In urban conditions, the share of the fuel cell in the vehicles propulsion is more than three times that contributed by the battery, suburban7 times, highway28 times. In the entire test, the ratio of FC/BATT use was more than seven, while the energy consumption was more than 22 kWh/100 km.

Given the most likely modes of transmission through droplets, aerosols, and fomite contact, airway procedures such as endotracheal intubation place air medical crews and other health care providers at high risk for exposure. This, together with data that suggest that a large cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 patients have better outcomes if we can avoid intubating them, creates a need for a safe method of NIV or high-flow oxygen delivery during transport. Commonly used and successful in-hospital regimens for these patients are high-flow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure. In some studies, helmet NIV has been shown to be a viable, if not superior, alternative to these therapies for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Furthermore, because it is a sealed and closed space that completely isolates the patient's airway and breathing, it provides a very high degree of protection from exposure to pathogens transmitted through droplets or aerosols.

The resulting humanitarian crisis has placed women, particularly displaced women, at greater risk of gender-based violence (GBV). In Ukraine, reports of GBV were higher following the start of the conflict (22.4% in 2014 vs. 18.3% in 2007), with displaced women suffering from GBV nearly three times more than non-displaced residents (15.2% vs. 5.3%). Many GBV incidents in Ukraine have been reported along the \\"contact line,\\" the border separating government from non-government-controlled areas. This study compares types of GBV experienced by displaced and local (non-displaced) women receiving psychosocial support in order to identify the gaps in services during a time of conflict. Data was collected by mental healthcare providers from 11,826 women (25.5% displaced; 74.5% local) aged 15 to 69 receiving psychosocial services in five conflict-affected regions from February 2016 to June 2017. Group differences were assessed using Pearson's chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables. Overall, almost half of the women experienced intimate partner violence and psychological abuse. Compared to residents, displaced women were more likely to report non-domestic GBV incidents involving sexual and economic violence. Almost 8% of violent incidents against displaced women occurred at checkpoints or at reception centers for internally displaced persons (IDP) and 20% were perpetrated by armed men. Consistent with the literature, this study suggests that displaced women are more vulnerable to attacks by persons outside the home and by armed groups. Our findings underscore the need to expand violence prevention programs to address the unique vulnerabilities of displaced women before, during, and after displacement. Programs should be tailored to prevent violence within and outside the home. Increased prevention efforts are needed in areas with high concentrations of armed men, along the contact line, and at IDP reception centers to protect displaced women. This is particularly urgent in the context of increased GBV due to COVID-19.","output":"Patterns of Gender-Based Violence in Conflict-Affected Ukraine: A Descriptive Analysis of Internally Displaced and Local Women Receiving Psychosocial Services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in social isolation, which has a potential negative impact on the educational routines (eg, the suspension of face-to-face appointments) and mental health of medical students. The Mario Pinotti II (MPII) study is a 24-week observational study that conducted scheduled telephone calls every 2 weeks to verify the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy (from March 29, 2020, to September 30, 2020). The effects of voluntarily participating in a research project (ie, one that involves interactions via telephone contact with patients, professors, rheumatologists, and colleagues) on the daily lives and mental health of medical students requires evaluation. Objective: As medical students are professionals in training and have a high level of responsibility in terms of handling the emotional and physical aspects of several diseases, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and participation in the MPII study on the educational routines and mental health of medical students. Methods: A web-based survey was carried out to perform a cross-sectional comparative assessment of medical students who participated in the MPII study and their colleagues who were not involved in the MPII study. Participants from both groups were matched based on sex, age, and medical school. The web questionnaire was developed by a panel composed of graduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor. The questionnaire included details on demographic and life habits data and evaluated participants' impressions of the MPII study and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their educational routines and medical training. In addition, depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated using the Brazilian version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)-21, and currently, the DASS-21 scores are grouped as those that indicate a low, moderate, or high risk of mental distress. This project was approved by the Federal University of S?o Paulo Ethics Committee (CAAE: 34034620.0.0000.5505). Results: Data were collected from both medical student groups from July 20 to August 31, 2020. Data extraction was completed in September 2020. The data analysis is ongoing. We expect the results to be published in the first semester of 2021. Conclusions: This study will provide insight into the effects of participating in a research project on depression, anxiety, and stress, which will be determined by applying the DASS-21 to a large sample of Brazilian undergraduate medical students. We will also evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students educational routines and medical training.

The two heuristics share many similarities and yet there have been no or few attempts to ascertain their causal impact on risk judgments. We present an experiment (N = 143) where we varied availability-by-recall (thinking of less or more occurrences of someone from one's social network dying) and the affective impact of certain risks (using images). We found that availability-by-recall had a stronger impact in constructing risk judgments. Asking people to think of more occurrences led to higher judgments of mortality and higher values placed on a single life, irrespective of changes in affect, risk media coverage, and retrieval time. Affect, however, was not disregarded. Our data suggest a causal mechanism where the retrieval of occurrences leads to changes in affect, which in turn, impact risk judgments. These findings increase understanding of how risk judgments are constructed with the potential to impact risk communication through direct manipulations of availability and affect.

We describe the current literature in terms of clinical trials, observational and retrospective studies, as well as immune reconstitution following transplantation, with a focus on the conditioning regimens used for transplantation. The evidence base predominantly consists of non-randomised, uncontrolled clinical trials or data from retrospective or observational cohorts, i.e. very few randomised or controlled trials. Most often, intermediate-intensity conditioning regimens are used, with promising results from both myeloablative and lymphoablative strategies, as well as from regimens that are low and high intensity. Efficacy of transplantation, which is likely secondary to immune reconstitution and restored immune tolerance, is, therefore, not clearly dependent on the intensity of the conditioning regimen. However, the conditioning regimen may well influence the immune response to transplantation. Heterogeneity of conditioning regimens among studies hinders synthesis of the articles assessing post-aHSCT immune system changes. Factors associated with better outcomes were lower Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale, relapsingCremitting MS, younger age, and shorter disease duration at baseline, which supports the guidance for patient selection proposed by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. Interestingly, promising outcomes were described for patients with secondary progressive MS by some studies, which may be worth taking into account when considering treatment options for patients with active, progressive disease.

We conducted qualitative interviews to gain a greater understanding into these concerns and to identify what might address them. Twelve qualitative interviews were conducted with participants identifying as hesitant for COVID-19 vaccination and reporting concern about the speed of vaccine development. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used. Concerns about speed comprised the linked themes of i) difficulty understanding the pace, and, ii) worry about the implications for vaccine safety. Uncertainties concerning the pandemic led to a notable desire for credible and understandable information regarding the vaccines, which many participants felt was not available. Four routes to resolving uncertainty about whether to be vaccinated were identified. First, waiting for more information about the vaccines, such as about their contents and impact on transmission. Second, a growing perception that the vaccines must be safe given the large numbers already vaccinated. Third, viewing the vaccines as necessary C even if unappealing C for ending the pandemic. Finally, a feeling that there would be no choice but to have a vaccine. Examples of what might reduce hesitancy were given, including interviews with vaccine developers and knowing others of similar age having safely been vaccinated. The pace of development broke expectations set earlier in the pandemic. This was interpreted negatively due to a perceived lack of credible information.

Despite the progress in practical application and morphological characterization, information about their biomechanical properties is still scarce. The presence of non-membrane particles called exomeres with similar functions has recently been reported. We applied the atomic force microscopy technique to study the biomechanical properties of both types of particles in air and in liquid. We found a correlation between the biomechanical properties of the vesicles, their size, structure, and function. Our data provide useful information for a better understanding of the biomechanical characteristics of extracellular vesicles and non-membrane extracellular particles and their AFM detection. ABSTRACT: While extracellular vesicles (EVs) are extensively studied by various practical applications in biomedicine, there is still little information on their biomechanical properties due to their nanoscale size. We identified isolated blood plasma vesicles that carried on biomarkers associated with exosomes and exomeres and applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study them at single particle level in air and in liquid. Air measurements of exosomes revealed a mechanically indented internal cavity in which highly adhesive sites were located. In contrast, the highly adhesive sites of exomeres were located at the periphery and the observed diameter of the particles was ~35 nm. In liquid, the reversible deformation of the internal cavity of exosomes was observed and a slightly deformed lipid bi-layer was identified. In contrast, exomeres were not deformed and their observed diameter was ~16 nm. The difference in diameters might be associated with a higher sorption of water film in air. The parameters we revealed correlated with the well-known structure and function for exosomes and were observed for exomeres for the first time. Our data provide a new insight into the biomechanical properties of nanoparticles and positioned AFM as an exclusive source of in situ information about their biophysical characteristics.","output":"Biomechanical Properties of Blood Plasma Extracellular Vesicles Revealed by Atomic Force Microscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Right-sided lesions caused by staphylococci are the most common clinical entity of infectious endocarditis (IE) among iv drug abusers.

METHODS Twenty outpatients (6 male, 14 female, mean age 42.1y) with major depressive disorder were included. The main outcome was drop-out rate and satisfaction with the treatment; secondary outcomes were changes in metacognitive beliefs assessed with the metacognitive questionnaire 30 (MCQ-30), and symptom reduction measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-2 sum score (BDI-2). RESULTS No drop-outs during the treatment and the follow-up phase were observed. Patients and therapists were highly satisfied with MCT treatment. The MCQ-30 significantly declined over the treatment course, paralleled by a significant reduction of the BDI-2 sum scores (from 29  8.6 at T0 to 8.4  9.6 at the end of treatment).

Results: A total of 1,058 HCWs completed the survey; 66.5% were female, 59.0% were nurses. 9.0% indicated they had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19. Regarding the B.1.1.7 lineage, almost all (97.3%) were aware of its emergence, 73.8% were aware that it is more infectious, 78.0% thought it causes more severe disease, and only 50.0% knew that current COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing it.

Mapping of worldwide data illustrated that high Twitter activity was related to high numbers of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 deaths, with tweets inversely weighted with number of publications. Poisson regression models of worldwide data showed a positive correlation between the national deaths per number of population and tweets when holding the country's number of publications constant (coefficient 0.0285, S.E. 0.0003, p<0.001). Conversely, this relationship was negatively correlated in USA states (coefficient -0.0013, S.E. 0.0001, p<0.001). Conclusions: This study shows that Twitter can play a crucial role in the rapid research response during the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, especially to spread research with prompt public scrutiny. Governments are urged to pause censorship of social media platforms during these unprecedented times to support the scientific community's fight against COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2.","output":"A call for governments to pause Twitter censorship: a cross-sectional study using Twitter data as social-spatial sensors of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 research diffusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The British Childrens Play Survey was conducted in April 2020 with a nationally representative sample of 1919 parents/caregivers with a child aged 5C11 years.

The results show that, averaged across the year, children play for around 3 h per day, with around half of childrens play happening outdoors. Away from home, the most common places for children to play are playgrounds and green spaces. The most adventurous places for play were green spaces and indoor play centres. A significant difference was found between the age that children were reported to be allowed out alone (10.74 years; SD = 2.20 years) and the age that their parents/caregivers reported they had been allowed out alone (8.91 years; SD = 2.31 years). A range of socio-demographic factors were associated with childrens play. There was little evidence that geographical location predicted childrens play, but it was more important for independent mobility. Further, when parents/caregivers had more positive attitudes around childrens risk-taking in play, children spent more time playing and were allowed to be out of the house independently at a younger age.","output":"Childrens Play and Independent Mobility in 2020: Results from the British Childrens Play Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, intravitreal injections are performed with patients wearing masks. The risk of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection is reported to increase due to an influx of exhaled air containing oral bacteria from the upper part of the mask onto the ocular surface. We retrospectively investigated the incidence of endophthalmitis when intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections were performed using the same infection control measures before and during the pandemic. Vitreoretinal specialists performed intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents in the outpatient room of a university hospital. Infection control measures before and during the pandemic included covering the patients eye with adhesive face drape and irrigating the ocular surface with 0.25% povidone-iodine before draping, and immediately before and after injection. Before the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2016 to December 2019), one case of endophthalmitis occurred among 31,173 injections performed (0.0032%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.000008C0.017872%).

There is a growing number of sensory deficits associated with COVID-19 and molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits are incompletely understood. METHODS: We report a series of ten COVID-19 patients with audiovestibular symptoms such as hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction and tinnitus. To investigate the causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and audiovestibular dysfunction, we examine human inner ear tissue, human inner ear in vitro cellular models, and mouse inner ear tissue. RESULTS: We demonstrate that adult human inner ear tissue co-expresses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and FURIN cofactors required for virus entry. Furthermore, hair cells and Schwann cells in explanted human vestibular tissue can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy. We establish three human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived in vitro models of the inner ear for infection: two-dimensional otic prosensory cells (OPCs) and Schwann cell precursors (SCPs), and three-dimensional inner ear organoids. Both OPCs and SCPs express ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN, with lower ACE2 and FURIN expression in SCPs. OPCs are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection; lower infection rates exist in isogenic SCPs. The inner ear organoids show that hair cells express ACE2 and are targets for SARS-CoV-2.

In the case of Chile, 2019 became the scene of a social outbreak, the effects of which on tourism caused a sharp reduction in the number of international tourist arrivals and generated an overall sense of insecurity for internal travelers. In this context, the authorities and entrepreneurs in the tourism sector were preparing to take on the challenge. Their idea was to promote an intense advertising campaign aimed at recovering demand. The objective of this article is to analyze the scenario facing the tourism sector in Chile based on the situation generated by the coronavirus and to identify some key challenges that the sector will have to face to overcome it by taking into account the factors that triggered the social conflict in the first place. To analyze the evolution of the Chilean situation, firstly, a descriptive methodology is applied to clearly identify the evolution of the situation during the first months of 2020 in Chile. Secondly, the epa (Events Protest Analysis) method is applied to analyze press publications. Regarding the visible impact of the pandemic, there is a 99,7% drop in tourist arrivals compared to August 2019 and a 45,2% drop in the employment of accommodation and food service personnel (Deputy Secretary of Tourism, 2020). Likewise, collective protest actions, unprecedented in the country, were observed in which negative attitudes toward visiting tourists were displayed by the local communities in towns that had registered few cases of coronavirus.

The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has attracted global attention. In the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including (1) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, (2) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), (3) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes zero, and (4) the time when the number of patients treated in hospital is zero, which indicates the end of the epidemic. Intuitively, the former two can be regarded as two important turning points which indicate the alleviation of epidemic to some extent, while the latter two as two \`\`zero\\" points, respectively. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at a early stage of the outbreak. Method. To address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. Specially, we first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread, yielding four periods of the whole process corresponding to the four meaningful milepost moments: two turning points and two \`\`zero\\" points. Then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumption. Finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the COVID-19 using the public available data for mainland China beyond Hubei Province from the China Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during the period of Jan 29th, 2020, to Feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.

The first prediction results on Jan 29th reveal that the first and second milepost moments for mainland China beyond Hubei Province would appear on Jan 31st and Feb 14th respectively, which are only one day and three days behind the real world situations. Forecasting results indicate that the number of newly confirmed cases will become zero in the mid-late March, and the number of patients treated in the hospital will become zero between mid-March and mid-April in mainland China beyond Hubei Province. The framework proposed in this paper can help people get a general understanding of the epidemic trends in counties where COVID-19 are raging as well as any other outbreaks of new and unknown infectious diseases in the future.","output":"Tracking and forecasting milepost moments of the epidemic in the early-outbreak: framework and applications to the COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spain is one of the most heavily affected countries by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay showed sensitivity of 94 % and specificity of 100 %, demonstrating high analytical performances allowing convenient management of suspected on-going and past-infections. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity rates were compared in COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 free areas from our hospital. Thus, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG was around 10-fold higher in COVID-19 areas than COVID-19 free areas (75 % versus 8%; P < 0.001). Interestingly, several inpatients hospitalized in COVID-19 free areas suffering from a wide range of unexplained clinical features including cardiac, vascular, renal, metabolic and infectious disorders, were unexpectedly found seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by systematic routine serology, suggesting possible causal involvement of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Two months later, monthly migraine days decreased from 20 to 5. On the third month, the patient developed mild COVID-19 symptoms, experiencing extreme fatigue, hyposmia, and attention deficit, resulting positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. A significant increase in migraine attacks frequency was reported. Brain MRI and EEG were normal. Erenumab was increased to 140 mg/month, and attacks decreased to 3 monthly migraine days and remained stable. All the headaches experienced by our patient during the infection fulfilled the criteria of the migraine attacks, without tensive-like features. CONCLUSION: We report the first case showing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient with chronic migraine and medication-overuse headache treated with erenumab. Our case description suggests that inflammatory processes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase the frequency of migraine attacks, probably through an activation of the trigeminovascular system.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert here after) for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB (PTB) from stool specimen in children. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among consecutively recruited children (less than 15 years old) with presumptive PTB at Jimma Medical Center, Ethiopia. One pulmonary specimen (expectorated sputum or gastric aspirate) was collected from each participant and tested for TB by Xpert and Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture. In addition, one stool specimen per child was collected and tested by Xpert after a single step, centrifuge-free stool processing method adapted from KNCV TB Foundation. Diagnostic performance of Xpert was calculated with reference to LJ culture and to a composite reference standards (CRS) comprising of confirmed TB (positive by Xpert and/or culture) and unconfirmed TB (clinical diagnosis with improvement after anti-TB treatment). RESULTS: A total of 178 children were enrolled; 152 of whom had complete microbiological results. Overall, TB was diagnosed in 13.2% (20/152) of the children with presumptive TB. Of these, only ten had microbiologically confirmed TB (positive Xpert and/or culture) and the remaining ten were clinically diagnosed with positive response to anti-TB treatment and were classified as unconfirmed TB. Stool Xpert had sensitivity of 100% (95%CI: 66.4C100) and specificity of 99.3% (95%CI: 96.2C100) compared to culture; however, the sensitivity was decreased to 50% (95%CI: 27.2C72.8) when compared to CRS. The Xpert on gastric aspirate had sensitivity of 77.8% (95%CI: 40C97.2) compared to culture and 40% (95%CI: 19.1C64) compared to CRS. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of Xpert for stool sample is comparable to that for gastric aspirate.

From the action-entropy concept, the specificity of the infodemic-pandemic systems is that each project forms a certain contribution to the formation and dynamics of action entropy. According to this concept, infodemic-pandemic is considered as a system that exchanges biological resources, action and information with the environment, which determines the presence of informational (structural) entropy and action entropy. Moreover, the latter is the result of the existing order in the organization which is determined by the structure and implementation of business processes. The action-entropy concept operates with such categories as action, entropy, free action, dissipation and allows using action-entropy to assess the state and dynamics of the infodemic-pandemic systems. This study presents the universal formalization of action entropy for various organizations and its expression for project-oriented organizations. The action entropy of organizations is determined by information entropy, total action and the ratio of the achieved level of action efficiency to the ideal level. The relationship between action entropy and informational (structural) entropy of project-oriented organizations is established. It is determined that when adding a new project to the current totality, the organization must ensure a balance between the growth of uncertainty (information entropy) and action efficiency. The method of decomposition of the total action entropy of the infodemic-pandemic systems is presented in the form of the sum of local action entropy for projects and programs. The effect of adding a new project to the structure of the infodemic-pandemic systems on its integrated action entropy is investigated. The presented results form a new look at the qualitative assessment of both an individual project and the entire set of projects of the infodemi-cpandemic systems. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"'Infodemia vs. Pandemia, COVID 2019' management projects with critical thinking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visuo-spatial attention prioritizes the processing of relevant inputs via different types of signals, including current goals and stimulus salience. Complex mixtures of these signals engage in everyday life situations, but little is known about how these signals jointly modulate distributed patterns of activity across the occipital regions that represent visual space. Here, we measured spatio-topic, quadrant-specific occipital activity during the processing of visual displays containing both task-relevant targets and salient color-singletons. We computed spatial bias vectors indexing the effect of attention in 2D space, as coded by distributed activity in the occipital cortex. We found that goal-directed spatial attention biased activity towards the target and that salience further modulated this endogenous effect: salient distractors decreased the spatial bias, while salient targets increased it. Analyses of effective connectivity revealed that the processing of salient distractors relied on the modulation of the bidirectional connectivity between the occipital and the posterior parietal cortex, as well as the modulation of the lateral interactions within the occipital cortex. These findings demonstrate that goal-directed attention and salience jointly contribute to shaping processing priorities in the occipital cortex and highlight that multiple functional paths determine how spatial information about these signals is distributed across occipital regions.","output":"Dynamic causal interactions between occipital and parietal cortex explain how endogenous spatial attention and stimulus-driven salience jointly shape the distribution of processing priorities in 2D visual space"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Influenza causes a significant annual disease burden, with characterization of the infecting virus important in clinical and public health settings. Rapid immunoassays are fast but insensitive, whereas real-time RT-PCR is sensitive but susceptible to genetic mutations and often requires multiple serial assays. The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay provides type and subtype/lineage identification of influenza A and B, including non-seasonal A viruses, in a single microarray-based assay with same day turnaround time. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate key analytical performance characteristics of the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay. STUDY DESIGN: Analytical sensitivity, cross-reactivity, and multi-site reproducibility were evaluated. RESULTS: The limit of detection (LOD) for the FluChip-8G influenza A+B Assay ranged from 5.8  10(2)C1.5  10(5) genome copies/mL, with most samples 2  10(3) genome copies/mL (160 genome copies/reaction). Fifty two (52) additional strains were correctly identified near the LOD, demonstrating robust reactivity. Two variant viruses (H1N1v and H3N2v) resulted in dual identification as both non-seasonal influenza A and A/H1N1pdm09. No reproducible cross-reactivity was observed for the 34 organisms tested, however, challenges with internal control inhibition due to crude growth matrix were observed. Lastly, samples tested near the LOD showed high reproducibility (97.0% (95% CI 94.7C98.7)) regardless of operator, site, reagent lot, or testing day. CONCLUSION: The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay is an effective new method for detecting and identifying both seasonal and non-seasonal influenza viruses, as revealed by good sensitivity and robust reactivity to 52 unique strains of influenza virus. In addition, the lack of cross-reactivity to non-influenza pathogens and high lab-to-lab reproducibility highlight the analytical performance of the assay as an alternative to real-time RT-PCR and sequencing-based assays.

AIM: We examined the association of the COVID-19 outbreak and the mental, physical and sexual health of the female Polish population. METHODS: Data were collected in an online survey distributed on social media from April 22, 2020 through to May 7, 2020. The data collection began one month after the start of lockdown in Poland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Women were asked to complete the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaires. RESULTS: Overall, 1644 women (median age 23 years) took part in the survey. They reported a lower frequency of sexual activity (P < .001) and a lower libido level (P < .001) during the pandemic then before it. 57.5% of the study group (n = 944) strongly agreed or agreed that fear of the health condition of loved ones was a source of stress and depressed mood. The average BDI-II total score was 11 (range 0-51; IQR 5-18), which corresponds to minimal depression. The average FSFI total score was 27.01  7.61 (range 2-36). The FSFI and BDI scores were significantly correlated (P < .001). The FSFI score was significantly correlated with the presence of any comorbid chronic disease, the intensity of the fear of infection and fear of health conditions, perceived loneliness, and the being up to date with media news. The BDI score was significantly correlated with age, the intensity of the fear of infection and fear of health conditions, perceived loneliness, being up to date with media news, and the more frequent use of stimulants.

We conducted the analysis of subtyped CIC-based profiling in ESCC using epithelium-macrophage-leukocyte (EML) multiplex staining and examined the prognostic value of CIC structure profiling through Kaplan-Meier plotting and Cox regression model. Totally, five CIC structure subtypes were identified in ESCC tissue and the majority of them was homotypic CIC (hoCIC) with tumor cells inside tumor cells (TiT). By univariate and multivariate analyses, TiT was shown to be an independent prognostic factor for resectable ESCC, and patients with higher density of TiT tended to have longer post-operational survival time. Furthermore, in subpopulation analysis stratified by TNM stage, high TiT density was associated with longer overall survival (OS) in patients of TNM stages III and IV as compared with patients with low TiT density (mean OS: 51 vs 15 months, P = 0.04) and T3 stage (mean OS: 57 vs 17 months, P=0.024).

Extensive numerical simulations on synthetic and empirical networks demonstrate that, in the general setting where the structures of the two network layers are asymmetric, intense hopping can lead to simultaneous epidemic outbreak in both layers. In general, the impacts of hopping on the spreading dynamics in the two layers can be quite distinct. As the inter-layer coupling strength is increased, the epidemic threshold of the denser layer increases monotonically, while for the sparser layer, a surprising non-monotonic behavior of the threshold with a minimize value arises.

Due to its high transmission and infection rate, it has spread around the world and has transformed into a ravaging global pandemic with enormously unprecedented impacts globally on human, social, and economic health. Just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there is no specific antiviral drug for its treatment. The only available therapeutics are supportive and symptom-based. Thus, scientists are harnessing various strategies to expedite drug development. One such approach is drug repurposing through computational screening of phytocompounds, which leverages proteins that are essential for the entry, replication, pathogenesis, assembly, and release of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review the available literature on molecular docking of phytoligands against SARS-CoV-2 integral proteins, in a bid to update our current knowledge and identify the most promising molecules. The overwhelming majority of the promising lead compounds are either phenolics or terpenoids. Furthermore, of the elucidated SARS-CoV-2 targets, the main protease (3CL(pro)) appears as one of the most attractive druggable targets. Notably, compounds such as rutin, quercetin, luteolin, neoandrographolide, curcumin, and others with evident anti-inflammatory benefits, in addition to their predicted anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties, deserve further studies to validate their activity.","output":"A review on molecular docking analysis of phytocompounds against SARS-CoV-2 druggable targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social science research suggests that in our current affluent societies, individuals are accustomed to frequently replacing their household goods.

Analyzing interviews conducted with 60 individuals seeking to make their objects last, this biographical approach allows identifying some factors that explain people's propensity to make objects last. This paper shows that the tendency to keep objects for a long time can come from the familial milieu, just as it can happen later, in connection with personal eventsadvancement in the life cycle, bifurcations in the personal course, or interactions with public discourses and objects breakdowns.

The aim of this study was to survey to better understand in children's dental health and dietary habits and to learn about parents' attitudes toward dental treatment and clinical factors associated with their QoL using the Turkish version of KIDSCREEN-10 during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general public. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-part questionnaire, namely Part 1 addressed topics regarding changes in general and dental health, dietary habits of children under quarantine, and sociodemographic characteristics of the family and Part 2 impact of QoL was assessed by the KIDSCREEN-10 scale with 10 questions. The questionnaire was sent online using WhatsApp to a convenience sample of mothers with children between the age group of 8 and 18 years, who lived in Istanbul. Variables were statistically analyzed using the Student's t-test for independent samples and Univariate F-test, ANOVA according to the characteristics of variables which were analyzed. RESULTS: This study included 328 from 557 mothers with 58% respondent rate. The consumption of fast food, packaged food, and carbonated beverages decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak. Half of the mothers of children reported that they were anxious or fearful about their children visiting dentists during the pandemic and 64.2% of the children missed routine dental visits. The KIDSCREEN-10 scores for 13 years old or older children were influenced more by the COVID-19 pandemic than those for the 8C12 years old, who had a better QoL (P = 0.008).

The widespread damage of SARS-CoV2, the comorbidities in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and the symptoms of post-COVID-19 patients show striking similarities with conditions that are related to depletion of nitric oxide (NO) in the human body. Many of the symptoms of the disease may be caused by acute depletion of NO by the immune system. Patients with the highest COVID-19 burden often have comorbidities that are related to chronic depletion of NO. Post-COVID-19 health problems may be caused by earlier depletion of NO. Successful therapy requires sufficient NO levels. Supplementation with NO will increase immunity, help prevent thrombosis, and improve breathing, kidney functions, blood flow and oxygenation in patients, elderly patients and patients with comorbidities in particular. Furthermore, NO helps to prevent SARS-CoV2 from entering the human cell and to suppress viral RNA production. NO is not easy to supplement. A few SARS patients have been treated with inhaled NO with positive results, but inhaled NO can only deliver small quantities of NO. A new therapy has been developed to more effectively supplement NO. It combines the ingestion of nitrates (as NO donor), N-acetylcysteine and vitamin C (promoting NO metabolism) with electrostimulation of the muscles (to trigger the release of NO). It is expected that this therapy can ease the most serious symptoms of (post) COVID-19, especially for elderly and people with comorbidities.

They have been designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against Spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2, and hence they are less effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutated Spike than the original virus. It is possible that novel variants with abilities of enhanced transmissibility and/or immunoevasion will appear in the near future and perfectly escape from vaccine-elicited immunity. Therefore, the current vaccines may need to be improved to compensate for the viral evolution. For this purpose, it may be beneficial to take advantage of CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Several lines of evidence suggest the contribution of CTLs on the viral control in COVID-19, and CTLs target a wide range of proteins involving comparatively conserved nonstructural proteins. Here, we identified 22 HLA-A*24:02-restricted CTL candidate epitopes derived from the nonstructural polyprotein 1a (pp1a) of SARS-CoV-2 using computational algorithms, HLA-A*24:02 transgenic mice and the peptide-encapsulated liposomes. We focused on pp1a and HLA-A*24:02 because pp1a is relatively conserved and HLA-A*24:02 is predominant in East Asians such as Japanese. The conservation analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences of 7 out of the 22 epitopes were hardly affected by a number of mutations in the Sequence Read Archive database of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The information of such conserved epitopes might be useful for designing the next-generation COVID-19 vaccine that is universally effective against any SARS-CoV-2 variants by the induction of both anti-Spike neutralizing antibodies and CTLs specific for conserved epitopes.

Studies have evaluated workers views of financial confidence and advancement, but there has been limited focus on the dental industry. Methods To extend investigations to dentistry, published scales and pretested questions were used to determine workforce confidence and workflow changes among dentists. Data were evaluated using descriptive and bivariate statistics. In the wake of the pandemic, surveys were distributed to the American Dental Association (ADA) and American Association of Orthodontics (AAO) membership (N=656). Results Dentists top concern is increased cost of providing treatment (57.4% [Confidence Interval (CI): 53.5, 61.3]), associated with widely adopted workflow changes including reduced patient volumes (66.0% [CI: 62.4, 69.6]) and increased safety protocols and equipment (health screening, 75.5% [CI: 72.2, 78.8]), KN/N95 masks, 76.7% [CI: 73.5, 80.0]). However, the majority of respondents do not expect their personal or practice finances to be negatively affected after the pandemic, as only 18.5% ([CI: 15.4, 21.7]) predict their practices gross revenue to decrease. Conclusions Dentists are optimistic in the wake of vaccinations and lifting restrictions. Most expect their finances and practice performance to remain the same or grow in the short-term and expect long-term improvements post-pandemic.

Metabolic syndrome is a significant risk factor for several common cancers (e.g., liver, colorectal, breast, pancreas). Pharmacologic treatments used for the components of the metabolic syndrome appear to be insufficient to control cancer development in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Murine models showed that cancer has the slowest progression when there is no food consumption during the daily activity phase. Intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset is a form of fasting practiced during human activity hours. To test the anticancer effect of intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset in metabolic syndrome, we conducted a pilot study in 14 subjects with metabolic syndrome who fasted (no eating or drinking) from dawn to sunset for more than 14 h daily for four consecutive weeks. We collected serum samples before 4-week intermittent fasting, at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting and 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting. We performed serum proteomic analysis using nano ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We found a significant fold increase in the levels of several tumor suppressor and DNA repair gene protein products (GP)s at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting (CALU, INTS6, KIT, CROCC, PIGR), and 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting (CALU, CALR, IGFBP4, SEMA4B) compared with the levels before 4-week intermittent fasting. We also found a significant reduction in the levels of tumor promoter GPs at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting (POLK, CD109, CAMP, NIFK, SRGN), and 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting (CAMP, PLAC1) compared with the levels before 4-week intermittent fasting. Fasting from dawn to sunset for four weeks also induced an anti-diabetes proteome response by upregulating the key regulatory proteins of insulin signaling at the end of 4th week during 4-week intermittent fasting (VPS8, POLRMT, IGFBP-5) and 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting (PRKCSH), and an anti-aging proteome response by upregulating H2B histone proteins 1 week after 4-week intermittent fasting. Subjects had a significant reduction in body mass index, waist circumference, and improvement in blood pressure that co-occurred with the anticancer, anti-diabetes, and anti-aging serum proteome response. These findings suggest that intermittent fasting from dawn to sunset actively modulates the respective genes and can be an adjunct treatment in metabolic syndrome.

We aimed to provide robust estimates of incidence rates and relative risks of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses in patients in the 6 months following a COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study and time-to-event analysis, we used data obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (with over 81 million patients). Our primary cohort comprised patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis; one matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with influenza, and the other matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with any respiratory tract infection including influenza in the same period. Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from the control cohorts. All cohorts included patients older than 10 years who had an index event on or after Jan 20, 2020, and who were still alive on Dec 13, 2020. We estimated the incidence of 14 neurological and psychiatric outcomes in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; parkinsonism; Guillain-Barr syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders; myoneural junction and muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders (grouped and separately); substance use disorder; and insomnia. Using a Cox model, we compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory tract infections. We investigated how these estimates were affected by COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalisation, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission, and encephalopathy (delirium and related disorders). We assessed the robustness of the differences in outcomes between cohorts by repeating the analysis in different scenarios. To provide benchmarking for the incidence and risk of neurological and psychiatric sequelae, we compared our primary cohort with four cohorts of patients diagnosed in the same period with additional index events: skin infection, urolithiasis, fracture of a large bone, and pulmonary embolism. FINDINGS: Among 236 379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following 6 months was 3362% (95% CI 3317-3407), with 1284% (1236-1333) receiving their first such diagnosis. For patients who had been admitted to an ITU, the estimated incidence of a diagnosis was 4642% (4478-4809) and for a first diagnosis was 2579% (2350-2825). Regarding individual diagnoses of the study outcomes, the whole COVID-19 cohort had estimated incidences of 056% (050-063) for intracranial haemorrhage, 210% (197-223) for ischaemic stroke, 011% (008-014) for parkinsonism, 067% (059-075) for dementia, 1739% (1704-1774) for anxiety disorder, and 140% (130-151) for psychotic disorder, among others. In the group with ITU admission, estimated incidences were 266% (224-316) for intracranial haemorrhage, 692% (617-776) for ischaemic stroke, 026% (015-045) for parkinsonism, 174% (131-230) for dementia, 1915% (1790-2048) for anxiety disorder, and 277% (231-333) for psychotic disorder. Most diagnostic categories were more common in patients who had COVID-19 than in those who had influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 144, 95% CI 140-147, for any diagnosis; 178, 168-189, for any first diagnosis) and those who had other respiratory tract infections (116, 114-117, for any diagnosis; 132, 127-136, for any first diagnosis). As with incidences, HRs were higher in patients who had more severe COVID-19 (eg, those admitted to ITU compared with those who were not: 158, 150-167, for any diagnosis; 287, 245-335, for any first diagnosis). Results were robust to various sensitivity analyses and benchmarking against the four additional index health events. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides evidence for substantial neurological and psychiatric morbidity in the 6 months after COVID-19 infection. Risks were greatest in, but not limited to, patients who had severe COVID-19. This information could help in service planning and identification of research priorities. Complementary study designs, including prospective cohorts, are needed to corroborate and explain these findings.

Ensuring realistic conditions for music performance, however, constitutes a significant engineering challenge due to extremely strict requirements in terms of audio quality and, most importantly, network delay. To minimize the end-to-end delay experienced by the musicians, typical implementations of NMP applications use un-compressed, bidirectional audio streams and leverage UDP as transport protocol. Being connection less and unreliable,audio packets transmitted via UDP which become lost in transit are not re-transmitted and thus cause glitches in the receiver audio playout.

Objective: To describe international hospitalization trends and key epidemiological and clinical features of children and youth with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included pediatric patients hospitalized between February 2 and October 10, 2020. Patient-level electronic health record (EHR) data were collected across 27 hospitals in France, Germany, Spain, Singapore, the UK, and the US. Patients younger than 21 years who tested positive for COVID-19 and were hospitalized at an institution participating in the Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR were included in the study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient characteristics, clinical features, and medication use. Results: There were 347 males (52%; 95% CI, 48.5-55.3) and 324 females (48%; 95% CI, 44.4-51.3) in this study's cohort. There was a bimodal age distribution, with the greatest proportion of patients in the 0- to 2-year (199 patients [30%]) and 12- to 17-year (170 patients [25%]) age range. Trends in hospitalizations for 671 children and youth found discrete surges with variable timing across 6 countries. Data from this cohort mirrored national-level pediatric hospitalization trends for most countries with available data, with peaks in hospitalizations during the initial spring surge occurring within 23 days in the national-level and 4CE data. A total of 27a?364 laboratory values for 16 laboratory tests were analyzed, with mean values indicating elevations in markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, 83 mg/L; 95% CI, 53-112 mg/L; ferritin, 417 ng/mL; 95% CI, 228-607 ng/mL; and procalcitonin, 1.45 ng/mL; 95% CI, 0.13-2.77 ng/mL). Abnormalities in coagulation were also evident (D-dimer, 0.78 ug/mL; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21 ug/mL; and fibrinogen, 477 mg/dL; 95% CI, 385-569 mg/dL). Cardiac troponin, when checked (n = 59), was elevated (0.032 ng/mL; 95% CI, 0.000-0.080 ng/mL). Common complications included cardiac arrhythmias (15.0%; 95% CI, 8.1%-21.7%), viral pneumonia (13.3%; 95% CI, 6.5%-20.1%), and respiratory failure (10.5%; 95% CI, 5.8%-15.3%). Few children were treated with COVID-19-directed medications. Conclusions and Relevance: This study of EHRs of children and youth hospitalized for COVID-19 in 6 countries demonstrated variability in hospitalization trends across countries and identified common complications and laboratory abnormalities in children and youth with COVID-19 infection. Large-scale informatics-based approaches to integrate and analyze data across health care systems complement methods of disease surveillance and advance understanding of epidemiological and clinical features associated with COVID-19 in children and youth.","output":"International Analysis of Electronic Health Records of Children and Youth Hospitalized With COVID-19 Infection in 6 Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the odontogenic and tonsillar origins of deep neck infection (DNI) as a negative prognostic factor for developing complications. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 544 patients with tonsillar and odontogenic origins of DNI treated between 2006 and 2015 at 6 ENT Departments and Departments of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Complications from DNI (descending mediastinitis, sepsis, thrombosis of the internal jugular vein, pneumonia, and pleuritis) were evaluated in both groups and compared. Associated comorbidities (cardiovascular involvement, hepatopathy, diabetes mellitus respiratory involvement, gastroduodenal involvement) were reviewed. Results: Five hundred and forty-four patients were analyzed; 350/544 males (64.3%) and 19/544 females (35.7%). There were 505/544 cases (92.8%) with an odontogenic origin and 39/544 cases (7.2%) with a tonsillar origin of DNI. Complications occurred more frequently in the group with tonsillar origin of DNI (P < 0.001). There was no difference in diabetes mellitus between the two groups. Conclusions: Currently, the tonsillar origin of DNI occurs much less frequently; nevertheless, it carries a much higher risk of developing complications than cases with an odontogenic origin. We recommend that these potentially high-risk patients with a tonsillar origin of deep neck infections should be more closely monitored.","output":"Tonsillar origin of deep neck infection as a negative prognostic factor for developing complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which first appeared in China in December 2019, has pervaded throughout the world. Because the epidemic started later in Turkey than other European countries, it has the least number of deaths according to the current data. Outbreak management in COVID-19 is of great importance for public safety and public health. For this reason, prediction models can decide the precautionary warning to control the spread of the disease. Therefore, this study aims to develop a forecasting model, considering statistical data for Turkey. Box-Jenkins Methods (ARIMA), Brown's Exponential Smoothing model and RNN-LSTM are employed. ARIMA was selected with the lowest AIC values (12.0342, -2.51411, 12.0253, 3.67729, -4.24405, and 3.66077) as the best fit for the number of total case, the growth rate of total cases, the number of new cases, the number of total death, the growth rate of total deaths and the number of new deaths, respectively. The forecast values of the number of each indicator are stable over time. In the near future, it will not show an increasing trend in the number of cases for Turkey. In addition, the pandemic will become a steady state and an increase in mortality rates will not be expected between 17-31 May. ARIMA models can be used in fresh outbreak situations to ensure health and safety. It is vital to make quick and accurate decisions on the precautions for epidemic preparedness and management, so corrective and preventive actions can be updated considering obtained values.","output":"Forecasting Outbreak of COVID-19 in Turkey; Comparison of Box-Jenkins, Brown's Exponential Smoothing and Long Short-Term Memory Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regulatory frameworks associated to building design are usually complex, representing extensive sets of requirements.

Although small-scale farms constitute most of the livestock production in low and middle-income countries, knowledge and use of antibiotics among these populations is sparse. We conducted 201 questionnaires to estimate the use and knowledge of antibiotics by small-scale farmers located in the coastal area of the Lima region of Peru. Our results show that farmers had a small number of livestock (e.g. average of 11 cows, 7 pigs and 19 chickens per farm) and 80 % earned less than minimum wage. More than half of farmers reported at least one episode of respiratory disease, diarrhea, mastitis, skin lesion or post-parturition infection in their animals during the previous year, and 40 % of these episodes were treated with antibiotics. Farmers reported using 14 different antibiotics, most commonly oxytetracycline (31 % of episodes treated with antibiotics), penicillin (21 %), gentamicin (19 %) and trimethoprim-sulfamethazine (18 %). The third-generation cephalosporin ceftiofur was occasionally used to treat mastitis. Most farmers relied on veterinarians to prescribe (95 % of respondents) and administer (59 %) antibiotics. Only half of farmers knew what micro-organisms can be treated with antibiotics and the degree of knowledge of antibiotics (based on a 5-question metric) was positively correlated with respondents educational level, monthly income, knowledge of the animal health authority, farm area, number of cows and knowledge of an antiparasitic drug. In contrast, knowledge of antibiotics was not correlated with respondents age, gender, main occupation, knowledge of a veterinarian or household size. Potential misuse of antibiotics was reported, including 21 % of framers reporting stopping the treatment when clinical signs disappear and infrequent use of antibiotics to treat parasites or animals not eating. Our study highlights poor knowledge and potential misuse of antibiotics among small-scale farmers in coastal Peru, but high reliance on veterinarians for prescription and administration.

Knowledge about medical students exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. Thus, we measured the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a cohort of Danish medical students. METHODS: We invited all medical students at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) to participate. Students underwent venous blood sampling and a questionnaire about work-life behaviors possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. Samples were analyzed for total immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and seropositive samples were screened for IgG, immunoglobulin M, and immunoglobulin A antibodies. We determined associations between seropositivity and clinical and social activities and self-reported symptoms. RESULTS: Between October 19 and 26, 1120 students participated in the questionnaire and 1096 were included. Of all included, 379 (34.58%) were seropositive. Seropositivity was associated with attendance at 2 parties at UCPH, on February 29 and March 6, 2020 (odds ratio [OR], 5.96; 95% CI, 4.34C8.24; P < .001). Four hundred sixty-one students (42.06%) worked with COVID-19 patients, which was significantly associated with seropositivity (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.03C1.85; P = .033).

Due to the high complexity of this immunological syndrome development of novel therapeutic strategies is urgent. Promising drug targets or biomarkers may depict aquaporins (AQPs) as they regulate crucial key mechanisms of sepsis. MAIN BODY: Here we report on base of the current literature that several AQPs are involved in different physiological processes of sepsis. In immune system mainly AQPs 3, 5 and 9 seem to be important, as they regulate the migration of different immune cells. Several studies showed that AQP3 is essential for T cell function and macrophage migration and that AQP5 and AQP9 regulate neutrophil cell migration and impact sepsis survival. Additionally, to the function in immune system AQPs 1 and 5 play a role in sepsis induced lung injury and their downregulation after inflammatory stimuli impair lung injury. By contrast, AQP4 expression is up-regulated during brain inflammation and aggravates brain edema in sepsis. In kidney AQP2 expression is downregulated during sepsis and can cause renal failure. Some studies also suggest a role of AQP1 in cardiac function. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, AQPs are involved in many physiological dysfunctions in sepsis and their expressions are differently regulated.

This paper introduces a novel two-phase approach for classifying chest X-ray images. Deep Learning (DL) methods fail to cover these aspects since training and fine-tuning the model's parameters consume much time. In this approach, the first phase comes to train a deep CNN working as a feature extractor, and the second phase comes to use Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) for real-time detection. The main drawback of ELMs is to meet the need of a large number of hidden-layer nodes to gain a reliable and accurate detector in applying image processing since the detective performance remarkably depends on the setting of initial weights and biases. Therefore, this paper uses Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA) to improve results and increase the reliability of the network while maintaining real-time capability. The designed detector is to be benchmarked on the COVID-Xray-5k and COVIDetectioNet datasets, and the results are verified by comparing it with the classic DCNN, Genetic Algorithm optimized ELM (GA-ELM), Cuckoo Search optimized ELM (CS-ELM), and Whale Optimization Algorithm optimized ELM (WOA-ELM).

Subsequently COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world. To contain the ensuing pandemic, numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, partial travel restrictions, entry or exit screening, and quarantine of travellers. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease and screening-related outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the CDC COVID-19 Research Database on 26 June 2020. We also conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across national borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also included studies concerned with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as indirect evidence. Primary outcomes were cases avoided, cases detected and a shift in epidemic development due to the measures. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One review author screened titles and abstracts; all excluded abstracts were screened in duplicate. Two review authors independently screened full texts. One review author extracted data, assessed risk of bias and appraised study quality. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of all data reported in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, quality appraisal and data synthesis. For assessing the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, ROBINS-I for observational ecological studies and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, and the review author team discussed ratings. MAIN RESULTS We included 40 records reporting on 36 unique studies. We found 17 modelling studies, 7 observational screening studies and one observational ecological study on COVID-19, four modelling and six observational studies on SARS, and one modelling study on SARS and MERS, covering a variety of settings and epidemic stages. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the intervention measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of travel restrictions, or a combination of measures. There were concerns with the quality of many modelling studies and the risk of bias of observational studies. Many modelling studies used potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Concerns with observational screening studies commonly related to the reference test and the flow of the screening process. Studies on COVID-19 Travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel Eleven studies employed models to simulate a reduction in travel volume; one observational ecological study assessed travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Very low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests that when implemented at the beginning of the outbreak, cross-border travel restrictions may lead to a reduction in the number of new cases of between 26% to 90% (4 studies), the number of deaths (1 study), the time to outbreak of between 2 and 26 days (2 studies), the risk of outbreak of between 1% to 37% (2 studies), and the effective reproduction number (1 modelling and 1 observational ecological study). Low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests a reduction in the number of imported or exported cases of between 70% to 81% (5 studies), and in the growth acceleration of epidemic progression (1 study). Screening at borders with or without quarantine Evidence from three modelling studies of entry and exit symptom screening without quarantine suggests delays in the time to outbreak of between 1 to 183 days (very low-certainty evidence) and a detection rate of infected travellers of between 10% to 53% (low-certainty evidence). Six observational studies of entry and exit screening were conducted in specific settings such as evacuation flights and cruise ship outbreaks. Screening approaches varied but followed a similar structure, involving symptom screening of all individuals at departure or upon arrival, followed by quarantine, and different procedures for observation and PCR testing over a period of at least 14 days. The proportion of cases detected ranged from 0% to 91% (depending on the screening approach), and the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). The outcomes, however, should be interpreted in relation to both the screening approach used and the prevalence of infection among the travellers screened; for example, symptom-based screening alone generally performed worse than a combination of symptom-based and PCR screening with subsequent observation during quarantine. Quarantine of travellers Evidence from one modelling study simulating a 14-day quarantine suggests a reduction in the number of cases seeded by imported cases; larger reductions were seen with increasing levels of quarantine compliance ranging from 277 to 19 cases with rates of compliance modelled between 70% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS With much of the evidence deriving from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-life' evidence for many of these measures. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures is very low and the true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Nevertheless, some travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective in detecting a meaningful proportion of cases to prevent seeding new cases within the protected region; combined with subsequent quarantine, observation and PCR testing, the effectiveness is likely to improve. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of travel-related quarantine on its own. Some of the included studies suggest that effects are likely to depend on factors such as the stage of the epidemic, the interconnectedness of countries, local measures undertaken to contain community transmission, and the extent of implementation and adherence.","output":"Travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"͹״׷ڼ,ɹѪΪٴѪѪҺϵλ,øȾعʮֱҪ ϲɹѪص,ʵص㽨ơء,ȫ潨ȫȾعϵ,ѪҺ밲ȫ","output":"The Characteristics and Countermeasures of Infection Prevention and Control in Blood Collection and Supply Institutions during COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) resembles a severe form of community-acquired pneumonia initially reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

METHODS: We administered three questionnaires on-line to a convenience sample of the general population from different regions of mainland China from February 1 to February 4, 2020. We used the Mandarin versions of the six-item Kessler psychological distress scale (K6), the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). We also collected demographic data and other information related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing psychological distress. RESULTS: Of 1607 respondents, 1588 returned valid questionnaires and were included in the analysis. Nearly one quarter (22.8%) had high levels of psychological distress (K6 score &#8805; 13). Individuals with higher psychological distress were more likely to be unmarried, spend more than 6 h per day searching for information about COVID-19, more frequently adopt a passive coping style, and report less social support than those with lower psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak in China has a great impact on the mental health status of the general population. Active coping strategies and increased social support are significantly correlated with decreased psychological distress, and may serve as the basis for psychological interventions.","output":"Coping style, social support and psychological distress in the general Chinese population in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Studies on the duration of immune response in subjects with COVID-19 could facilitate understanding of how immunity develops and persists during the natural course of infection, as well as providing epidemiological information useful in public health decisions on the use of vaccines. The study aims to analyse antibody response in a cohort of subjects with high-risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to the long-term care facility environment. Methods We recruited 657 subjects between guests and healthcare workers from Piedmontese nursing homes. IgG directed against the S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were assayed on serum. We used EUROIMMUN kit, which exploits ELISA method. Reference values are (RU/mL): positive  11;borderline 8  value < 11;negative < 8. Results Among the 657 subjects, we examined 494 health workers and 163 guests. The average age was 56.2. In relation to COVID-19, 402 subjects had a previous infection, 255 had not. About serology: positive 369;negative 261;borderline 27. The mean of the IgG values was 35.68 RU/mL. Swabs/serology: 77.36% with previous infection were positive to serology, 18.66% negative;of all subjects who were always negative to swabs, 72.94% were negative, 22.74% positive. Moreover, the mean time elapsed from positive swab to serology test was 144.08 days. Conclusions Preliminary results show that the antibody response is present and persistent in the study population, even a long time after the infection. According to literature, antibody persistence has great variability in our population, as no statistically significant correlations were found between antibody titer and other variables such as time elapsed since infection. The examined sample, belonging to high-risk category (long-term care facilities), is most likely to present repeated exposure to SARS-CoV-2, highlighted by the seropositivity of never infected subjects. These findings might help policy makers better address resources regarding vaccines.

Also, interference with channel function is linked to reduced cancer cell progression, making these channels potential targets for anti-cancer drug development. Therefore, inhibitors need to be evaluated for both their binding selectivity and their potential to interfere with cancer progression. Here, we investigated the inhibitor Synta66 and determined its site of binding via both patch clamp recordings and computational approaches and evaluated its potency as anti-cancer agent in glioblastoma multiforme cells. Our findings show that Synta66 is a highly selective ligand to the Orai1 pore and efficiently blocks store operated calcium entry in glioblastoma cells. Still, in the tested cell lines, Synta66 did not reduce cell viability. We therefore suggest Synta66 as a precise tool to observe interference of store-operated Orai1 channel function in vitro and of resulting downstream effects. ABSTRACT: The Ca(2+) sensor STIM1 and the Ca(2+) channel Orai1 that form the store-operated Ca(2+) (SOC) channel complex are key targets for drug development. Selective SOC inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical evaluation for the treatment of auto-immune and inflammatory responses and are also deemed promising anti-neoplastic agents since SOC channels are linked with enhanced cancer cell progression. Here, we describe an investigation of the site of binding of the selective inhibitor Synta66 to the SOC channel Orai1 using docking and molecular dynamics simulations, and live cell recordings. Synta66 binding was localized to the extracellular site close to the transmembrane (TM)1 and TM3 helices and the extracellular loop segments, which, importantly, are adjacent to the Orai1-selectivity filter. Synta66-sensitivity of the Orai1 pore was, in fact, diminished by both Orai1 mutations affecting Ca(2+) selectivity and permeation of Na(+) in the absence of Ca(2+). Synta66 also efficiently blocked SOC in three glioblastoma cell lines but failed to interfere with cell viability, division and migration. These experiments provide new structural and functional insights into selective drug inhibition of the Orai1 Ca(2+) channel by a high-affinity pore blocker.","output":"Blockage of Store-Operated Ca(2+) Influx by Synta66 is Mediated by Direct Inhibition of the Ca(2+) Selective Orai1 Pore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to detect changes in health-oriented welfare indicators of shelter cats housed in a shelter by means of long-term monitoring of health indicators of welfare in a population of group-housed cats in a private, no-kill shelter in the Czech Republic. The cat population housed in a large group was monitored for 1 year. The data recording took place at 2-week intervals. A total of 220 cats were evaluated using a protocol containing eight health-oriented welfare indicators: body condition, third eye visibility, eye discharge, eye irritation, nose discharge, the presence of pathologically induced respiratory sounds, coat condition, and lameness and abnormal posture. The assessment was performed based on the observation by two trained evaluators. The cats' condition was rated on a 5-point scale for each indicator, where the optimal condition was represented by the score of 1 and a severe deterioration by the score of 5 for the given indicator, except for the body condition indicator, where the optimal condition was represented by the score of 3. A deterioration in the score in at least one of the indicators during the stay in the shelter was recorded in 52 (41.6%) of 125 cats that were assessed at least twice. The effect of the LOS, sex and age on the scores for each health indicator was examined via a linear mixed model analysis, as this method allows for handling of dependencies in the data of repeated measurements. The effect of predictors on the third eye visibility scores was not found. The age of cats predicted the coat condition and body condition scores. The LOS predicted scores of the abnormal posture and lameness indicator and scores of a composite index composed of indicators related to upper respiratory tract disease. The results suggest that despite the fact that some improvement of health was documented during the cats' stay in the shelter, there were a non-negligible number of animals experiencing a permanent or long-term deterioration in health. Efforts to minimize the undesirable factors contributing to the deterioration of well-being of cats during their stay in a shelter should be made.","output":"Changes in Health Indicators of Welfare in Group-Housed Shelter Cats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. South Sudan, a low-income and humanitarian response setting, reported its first case of COVID-19 on April 5, 2020. We describe the socio-demographic and epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 cases in this setting. METHODS: we conducted a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of data for 1,330 confirmed COVID-19 cases from the first 60 days of the outbreak. RESULTS: among the 1,330 confirmed cases, the mean age was 37.1 years, 77% were male, 17% were symptomatic with 95% categorized as mild, and the case fatality rate was 1.1%. Only 24.7% of cases were detected through alerts and sentinel site surveillance, with 95% of the cases reported from the capital, Juba. Epidemic doubling time averaged 9.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.7 - 13.4), with an attack rate of 11.5 per 100,000 population. Test positivity rate was 18.2%, with test rate per 100,000 population of 53 and mean test turn-around time of 9 days. The case to contact ratio was 1: 2.2. CONCLUSION: this 2-month initial period of COVID-19 in South Sudan demonstrated mostly young adults and men affected, with most cases reported as asymptomatic. Systems limitations highlighted included a small proportion of cases detected through surveillance, low testing rates, low contact elicitation, and long collection to test turn-around times limiting the countrys ability to effectively respond to the outbreak.

Vagal manoeuvres are internationally recommended therapy in stable patients. The head down deep breathing (HDDB) technique was previously described as an acceptable vagal manoeuvre, but there are no studies comparing its efficacy to other vagal manoeuvres. Our objective in this study was to compare the rates of successful cardioversion with HDDB and the commonly practiced, modified Valsalva manoeuvre (VM). METHODS: We conducted a randomised controlled trial at an acute hospital ED. Patients presenting with SVT were randomly assigned to HDDB or modified VM in a 1:1 ratio. A block randomisation sequence was prepared by an independent biostatistician, and then serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes were opened just before the intervention. Patients and caregivers were not blinded. Primary outcome was cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Secondary outcome(s) included adverse effects/complications of each technique. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were randomised between 1 August, 2018C1 February, 2020 (20 HDDB and 21 modified VM). Amongst the 41 patients, three spontaneously cardioverted to sinus rhythm before receiving the allocated treatment and were excluded. Cardioversion was achieved in six patients (31.6%) and seven patients (36.8%) with HDDB and modified VM, respectively (odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval, 0.33, 4.84, P = 0.733). Seventeen (89.5%) patients in the HDDB group and 14 (73.7%) from the modified VM group did not encounter any adverse effects. No major adverse cardiovascular events were recorded.

Home health professionals face unique challenges related to preventing and controlling infections, which are likely to amplify during an infectious disease outbreak (e.g. SARS-CoV-2). Little is known about the current state of infection prevention and control-related policies and outbreak preparedness at U.S. home health agencies. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we conducted a national survey to assess infection prevention and control-related policies, infrastructure, and procedures prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Using a stratified random sample of 1506 U.S. home health agencies, we conducted a 61-item survey (paper and online) from November 9, 2018 to December 31, 2019. METHODS: Survey data were linked to publicly-available data on the quality of patient care, patient satisfaction, and other agency characteristics. Probability weights were developed to account for sample design and nonresponse; Pearson's 2, Fisher's exact, t-tests or linear regression were used to compare the universe of agencies/respondents and urban/rural agencies. RESULTS: 35.6% of agencies responded (n = 536). Most home health personnel in charge of infection prevention and control have other responsibilities; one-third have no formal infection prevention and control training. Rural agencies are more likely to not have anyone in charge of infection prevention and control compared to those in urban areas. About 22% of agencies implement recommended guidelines when administering antibiotics. Less than a third (26.4%) report that their staff vaccination rates were higher than 95% during the last flu season. Only 48.1% of agencies accept patients requiring ventilation, and of those, 40.9% located in rural areas do not have specific infection prevention and control policies for ventilated patients, compared to 20.8% in urban areas (p < 0.001). Only 39.7% of agencies provide N95 respirators to their clinical staff; rural agencies are significantly more likely to provide those supplies than urban agencies (50.7% vs. 37.7%, p = 0.004). Lastly, agencies report their greatest challenges with infection prevention and control are collecting/reporting infection data and adherence to/monitoring of nursing bag technique. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we found that infection prevention and control was suboptimal among U.S. home health care agencies. Consequently, most agencies have limited capacity to respond to infectious disease outbreaks.

Residual misalignments are frequently reduced by using dedicated reduction devices. The forces exerted by these devices, however, are uncontrolled and may lead to excessive reaction forces. As a consequence, screw pullout might be provoked and surrounding tissue may experience unfavorable biomechanical loads. The corresponding loads and induced tissue deformations are however not well identified. Additionally, whether the forced reduction alters the biomechanical behavior of the lumbar spine during physiological movements postoperatively, remains unexplored. PURPOSE To predict whether the reduction of misaligned posterior instrumentation might result in clinical complications directly after reduction and during a subsequent physiological flexion movement STUDY DESIGN: Finite element analysis METHODS: A patient-specific, total lumbar (L1-S1) spine finite element model was available from previous research. The model consists of poro-elastic intervertebral discs with Pfirrmann grade-dependent material parameters, with linear elastic bone tissue with stiffness values related to the local bone density, and with the seven major ligaments per spinal motion segment described as nonlinear materials. Titanium instrumentation was implemented in this model to simulate a L4, L5, and S1 posterolateral fusion. Next, coronal and sagittal misalignments of 6 millimeters each were introduced between the rod and the screw head at L4. These misalignments were computationally reduced and a physiological flexion movement of 15 was prescribed. Non-instrumented and well-aligned instrumented models were used as control groups. RESULTS Pulling forces up to 1.0 kN were required to correct the induced misalignments of 6 millimeters. These forces affected the posture of the total lumbar spine, as motion segments were predicted to rotate up to 3 degrees and rotations propagated proximally to and even affect the L1-2 level. The facet contact pressures in the corrected misaligned models were asymmetrical suggesting non-physiological joint loading in the misaligned models. In addition, the discs and vertebrae experienced abnormally high forces as a result of the correction procedure. These effects were more pronounced after a 15 flexion movement following forced reduction. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate that the correction of misaligned posterior instrumentation can result in high forces at the screws consistent with those reported to cause screw pullout, and may cause high tissue strains in adjacent and downstream spinal segments. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Proper alignment of spinal posterior instrumentation may reduce clinical complications secondary to unfavorable biomechanics.","output":"Misaligned spinal rods can induce high internal forces consistent with those observed to cause screw pullout and disc degeneration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With Covid-19 having caused significant disruption to the global education system, researchers are beginning to become concerned with the impact that this has had on student learning progress and, in particular, whether learning loss has been experienced. To evaluate this, the authors conducted a thorough analysis of recorded learning loss evidence documented between March 2020 and March 2021. This systematic review aims to consolidate available data and to document what has been reported in the literature. Given the novelty of the subject, eight studies were identified; seven of these found evidence of student learning loss among at least some of the participants while one of the seven also found instances of learning gains in a particular subgroup. The remaining study found increased learning gains in their participants. Additionally, four of the studies observed increases in inequality where certain demographics of students experienced learning losses more significant than others.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide is set to increase from its present level of 150 million, to 225 million by the end of the decade and to as many as 300 million by 2025. Shocking as they are, these figures represent only clinically diagnosed diabetes, and many more cases of diabetes remain undiagnosed and untreated. In addition, up to one-quarter of western populations have impaired glucose tolerance or the dysmetabolic syndrome, which are considered to represent pre-diabetic states. Type 2 diabetes is appearing increasingly in children and adolescents, and the frequency of diagnosis of paediatric type 2 diabetes is outstripping that of type 1 diabetes in some areas. The long-term complications associated with type 2 diabetes carries a crushing burden of morbidity and mortality, and most type 2 diabetic patients die prematurely from a cardiovascular event. Diabetic patients are more than twice as costly to manage as non-diabetic patients, due mainly to the high costs associated with management of diabetic complications. Indeed, diabetes care already accounts for about 2-7% of the total national health care budgets of western European countries. Controlling the type 2 diabetes epidemic will require changes to the structure of healthcare delivery. Well-resourced interventions will be required, with effective co-ordination between all levels of government, health care agencies, multidisciplinary health care teams, professional organisations, and patient advocacy groups.

Empirical antibiotic therapy may prevent bacterial superinfections, but may also lead to overuse, adverse effects and development of resistant pathogens. Knowledge about the incidence of superinfections in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. METHODS: We will conduct a nationwide cohort study comparing the incidence of superinfections in patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU compared with ICU patients with influenza A/B in Denmark. We will include approximately 1000 patients in each group from the time period of October 1st , 2014 to April 30th , 2019 and from March 10th , 2020 to March 1st , 2021 for patients with influenza and COVID-19, respectively. The primary outcome is any superinfection within 90 days of admission to the ICU. We will use logistic regression analysis comparing COVID-19 with influenza A/B after adjustment for relevant predefined confounders. Secondarily, we will use unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses to assess six potential risk factors (sex, age, cancer (including haematological), immunosuppression, use of life support on day 1 in the ICU) for superinfections, and compare outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with/without superinfections, and present descriptive data regarding the superinfections.

METHODS: We conducted an exploratory, mixed data collection telephone survey in languages spoken in the community (Spanish, Cape Verdean (CV) Creole/Portuguese, and English). Participants were asked about their COVID-19 vaccination status, as well as vaccine concerns and acceptability via 9 closed-ended and 2 open-ended questions. Chi squared and multivariate analysis was used to compare concerns and acceptability across languages. Coding and immersion/crystallization techniques were used to identify qualitative data themes. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 58%. Side effects were cited as the most frequent (66%) concern among all language groups. Concern about the speed of vaccine development, vaccine ingredients, and being in a research trial varied significantly by language. Qualitative findings included concerns about chronic medical conditions and generalized fear of vaccine safety. English speakers were the most likely to report concerns and CV Creole/Portuguese speakers were the least likely to report concerns about the vaccine.

This biomarker is found in respiratory samples which need to be liquefied prior to analysis. Traditional liquefying methods use reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT). However, DTT impairs immunodetection and does not liquefy highly viscous samples. We propose an enzymatic method that liquefies samples by means of generating O2 bubbles with endogenous catalase. Low respiratory tract specimens from 48 mechanically ventilated patients (38 with SARS-CoV-2 infection) were treated with DTT or with the enzymatic method. We used turbidimetry to compare the liquefaction degree and IL-6 was quantified with ELISA. Finally, we used AUC-ROC, time-to-event and principal component analysis to evaluate the association between respiratory compromise or local inflammation and IL-6 determined with both methods. Enzymatically treated samples were better liquefied than those reduced by DTT, which resulted in higher ELISA signals. Lung IL-6 levels obtained with the enzymatic procedure were negatively correlated with the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) and the time of mechanical ventilation. The proposed enzymatic liquefaction method improves the sensitivity for lung IL-6 detection in respiratory samples, which increases its predictive power as a biomarker for evaluating respiratory compliance.","output":"Optimized detection of lung IL-6 via enzymatic liquefaction of low respiratory tract samples: application for managing ventilated patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The internet has become an important medium for learning and communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for university students. Nevertheless, an increase in internet usage could predispose people to internet addiction (IA) and internet gaming (IG).

The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of IA and IG, and their associations with anxiety among medical students during the pandemic. Data were collected during the second wave of the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) in Malaysia between 12 November and 10 December 2020. A total of 237 students participated through proportionate stratified random sampling in this cross-sectional study. They completed a set of online questionnaires which consisted of a sociodemographic profile, the Malay version of the internet addiction test (MVIAT), the Malay version of the internet gaming disorder-short form (IGDS9-SF) and the Malay version of the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). The prevalence of IA and internet gaming disorder (IGD) were 83.5% and 2.5%, respectively.

Next, DDX5 was shown to interact with viral Nsp9 in the co-transfected HEK293 cells with the DDX5- and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, and the interaction between endogenous DDX5 and Nsp9 was also confirmed in MARC-145 cells infected with the Nsp9-expressing lentiviruses. Then, the interacting domains between DDX5 and Nsp9 were determined to be the DEXDc and HELICc domains in DDX5 and the RdRp domain in Nsp9, respectively. Moreover, in the HEK293 cells, MARC-145 cells and PAM cell lines co-transfected with the DDX5- and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, Nsp9 was shown to co-localize with DDX5 in the cytoplasm with a perinuclear pattern, and meanwhile in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and PAMs, endogenous DDX5 was also found to co-localize with Nsp9. Finally, silencing the DDX5 gene in MARC-145 cells significantly impacted the replication of PRRSV, and while the over-expression of DDX5 could slightly enhance viral replication.

PURPOSE Gabapentin is a widely prescribed analgesic with increased popularity over recent years. Previous studies have characterized use of gabapentin in the outpatient setting, but minimal data exist for its initiation in the inpatient setting. The objective of this study was to characterize the prescribing patterns of gabapentin when it was initiated in the inpatient setting. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of a random sample of adult patients who received new-start gabapentin during hospital admission. Patients for whom gabapentin was prescribed as a home medication, with one-time, on-call, or as-needed orders, or who died during hospital admission were excluded. The primary outcome was characterization of the gabapentin indication; secondary outcomes included the starting and discharge doses, the number of dose titrations, the rate of concomitant opioid prescribing, and pain clinic follow-up. Patients were stratified by surgical vs nonsurgical status. RESULTS A total of 464 patients were included, 283 (61.0%) of whom were surgical and 181 (39.0%) of whom were nonsurgical. The cohort was 60% male with a mean (SD) age of 56 (18) years; surgical patients were younger and included more women. The most common indications for surgical patients were multimodal analgesia (161; 56.9%), postoperative pain (53; 18.7%), and neuropathic pain (26; 9.2%), while those for nonsurgical patients were neuropathic pain (72; 39.8%) and multimodal analgesia (53; 29.3%). The mean starting dose was similar between the subgroups (613 mg for surgical patients vs 560 mg for nonsurgical patients; P = 0.196). A total of 51.6% vs 81.8% of patients received gabapentin at discharge (P < 0.0001), while referral/follow-up to a pain clinic was minimal and similar between the subgroups (1.1% vs 3.9%; P = 0.210).

Understanding how these properties relate to each other and vary across epitopes would aid the development of therapeutic antibodies and guide vaccine design. Here we comprehensively characterize escape, breadth and potency across a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Despite a trade-off between in vitro neutralization potency and breadth of sarbecovirus binding, we identify neutralizing antibodies with exceptional sarbecovirus breadth and a corresponding resistance to SARS-CoV-2 escape. One of these antibodies, S2H97, binds with high affinity across all sarbecovirus clades to a cryptic epitope and prophylactically protects hamsters from viral challenge. Antibodies that target the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-binding motif (RBM) typically have poor breadth and are readily escaped by mutations despite high neutralization potency. Nevertheless, we also characterize a potent RBM antibody (S2E128) with breadth across sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and a high barrier to viral escape. These data highlight principles underlying variation in escape, breadth and potency among antibodies that target the RBD, and identify epitopes and features to prioritize for therapeutic development against the current and potential future pandemics.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies that maximize breadth and resistance to escape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We evaluate the impact of COVID-epidemic in colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis during Spain's state of emergency.

The impact of surgical training has been described as severe by most ophthalmology residents worldwide due to their duties in COVID-19 wards, disruption of outpatient and camp services. METHODS: Ophthalmic surgery demands utmost accuracy and meticulousness. Fine motor proficiencies, stereoscopic skills and handCeye coordination required can only be achieved by practice. So, a multileveled structured wet-lab teaching schedule was prepared for the residents and implemented to bridge this gap between theory and practice at our tertiary care institute. A semester-wise training schedule was made with the proper distribution of wet-lab and simulator training. Surgeries like phacoemulsification, scleral buckling, pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy, trabeculectomy and intravitreal injections were practised by the residents on the goat eyes. Simulator training was provided for phacoemulsification and vitrectomy to increase the handCeye coordination of the residents. RESULTS: Residents noticed improvement in their surgical skills and ambidexterity post wet-lab and simulator training . It also increased their confidence and provided essential surgical skills required to be used in the operation theater later.

Moreover, in experimental models, xenon was found to be neuroprotective and devoid of developmental neurotoxicity. These properties could render xenon attractive for the anesthesia in neonates and infants with congenital heart disease. However, experience with xenon anesthesia in children is scarce. AIMS We hypothesized that in children undergoing cardiac catheterization, general anesthesia with a combination of sevoflurane with xenon results in superior hemodynamic stability, compared to sevoflurane alone. METHODS In this prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial, children with a median age of 12 [IQR 3-36] months undergoing diagnostic/interventional cardiac catheterization were randomized to either general anesthesia with 50-65vol% xenon plus sevoflurane or sevoflurane alone. The primary outcome was the incidence of intraprocedural hemodynamic instability, defined as the occurrence of: (i) a heart rate change >20% from baseline; or (ii) a change in mean arterial blood pressure >20% from baseline; or (iii) the requirement of vasopressors, inotropes, chronotropes, or fluid boluses. Secondary endpoints included recovery characteristics, feasibility criteria, and safety (incidence of emergence agitation and postoperative vomiting. RESULTS After inclusion of 40 children, the trial was stopped as an a priori planned blinded interim analysis revealed that the overall rate of hemodynamic instability did not differ between groups [100% in both the xenon-sevoflurane and the sevoflurane group. However, the adjuvant administration of xenon decreased vasopressor requirements, preserved better cerebral oxygen saturation, and resulted in a faster recovery. Xenon anesthesia was feasible (with no differences in the need for rescue anesthetics in both groups). CONCLUSION Our observations suggest that combining xenon with sevoflurane in preschool children is safe, feasible, and facilitates hemodynamic management. Larger and adequately powered clinical trials are warranted to investigate the impact of xenon on short- and long-term outcomes in pediatric anesthesia.","output":"Xenon as an adjuvant to sevoflurane anesthesia in children younger than 4 years of age, undergoing interventional or diagnostic cardiac catheterization: A randomized controlled clinical trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here the hypothesis is advanced that maladaptive mechanisms that prevent recovery in some intensive care unit (ICU) patients may also underlie Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

METHODS: From 1 March to 10 May 2020, we retrospectively analyzed data from stroke patients in need of urgent neurointerventional treatment. Clinical presentation, demographics, and clinical history were collected along with procedural variables (door-to-needle time, needle-to-mTiCi time). Each patient underwent a nasal swab (polymerase chain reaction test), clinical screening, and chest CT scan to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Technical success, procedural safety (including staff SARS-CoV-2 infection), and clinical outcome at discharge were retrieved. A comparison was made with the same patient population treated between 1 March and 10 May 2019 to highlight possible differences in the characteristics or outcomes of the patients. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six ischemic stroke patients were admitted to our facility from 1 March to 10 May 2020. Of these, 12 patients (9%) were classified as \\"high risk\\" for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Radiological suspicion of COVID-19 was confirmed in all cases by pharyngeal swab. Five SARS-CoV-2 patients (42%) needed endovascular therapy. None of the staff members tested positive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2.

While greatly emphasizing protection, most guiding documents have neglected to support and protect the psychosocial needs of frontline health care workers and patients and their families during provision of palliative and end-of-life care. Consequently, the stage has been set for increased anxiety, moral distress, and moral injury and extreme moral hazard. A family-centered approach to care has been unilaterally relinquished to a secondary and nonessential role during the current crisis. This phenomenon violates a foundational public health principle, namely, to apply the least restrictive means to achieve good for the many. Instead, there has been widespread adoption of utilitarian and paternalistic approaches. In many cases the foundational principles of palliative care have also been neglected. No circumstance, even a global public health emergency, should ever cause health care providers to deny their ethical obligations and human commitment to compassion. The lack of responsive protocols for family visitation, particularly at the end of life, is an important gap in the current recommendations for pandemic triage and contingency planning. A stepwise approach to hospital visitation using a tiered, standardized process for responding to emerging clinical circumstances and individual patients' needs should be considered, following the principle of proportionality.

METHODS: All inpatient fracture cases performed over a 5-month period were identified and retrospective chart review performed. Patients were divided into pre- and COVID-era groups based on when surgery was performed relative to March 16, 2020 (the date elective operations were ceased), and groups were statistically compared. Patients with a COVID test result were further sub-divided into COVID negative and positive groups, and statistically compared. Statistical analysis was performed using independent t-test for continuous variables and chi-square analysis for categorical variables. RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen patients were identified, 38% females with average age of 58 years. Average length of stay was 7 days with average time from injury to surgery of 3 days and average time from admission to surgery of 1.3 days. Overall in-hospital complication rate was 29.4%, and 30-day mortality and readmission rates were 2.5% and 5%, respectively. Sixty-nine patients comprised the pre-COVID group, and 50 in the COVID-era group. There was no significant difference with respect to length of stay, time from injury to surgery, time from admission to surgery, need for post-operative ICU stay, in-hospital complication rate, 30-day mortality rate and 30-day readmission rate. Thirty-four patients had COVID testing, with 24 negative and 10 positive. COVID-positive patients had longer time from injury to surgery (8.5 days vs. 2 days, p = 0.003) and longer time from admission to surgery (2.7 days vs. 1.2 days, p = 0.034). While more COVID-positive patients required ICU admission post-operatively (60% vs. 21%, p = 0.036), there was no difference in overall complication rate.

This is the third acute infectious disease caused by coronavirus infection in this century, after sudden acute respirator syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. The damage mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. It is possible that protein S binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and invades alveolar epithelial cells, causing direct toxic effects and an excessive immune response. This stimulates a systemic inflammatory response, thus forming a cytokine storm, which leads to lung tissue injury. In severe cases, the disease can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a relatively high mortality rate. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Most patients need to be admitted to the intensive care unit for intensive monitoring and supportive organ function treatments.

The aims of this study were to evaluate mental health outcomes among patients with COVID-19 treated in the Fangcang shelter hospitals and analyze potential risk factors associated with these symptoms, including PTSS, symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress. METHOD: This cross-sectional study used an online survey to assess mental health problems of 461 confirmed COVID-19 patients in a Jianghan Fangcang shelter from February 15 to 22, 2020. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to explore potential risk factors. RESULTS: Overall, 25.2%, 50.1%, 54.4%, 10.2%, and 39.7% of all patients reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female sex was associated with all investigated outcomes except insomnia. Patients with lower education level were more likely to endorse anxiety, depression, and higher perceived stress, while patients' family members with other diseases were more likely to endorse severe insomnia. Patients with illness onset to admission less than 7 days were associated with higher perceived stress. DISCUSSION: In this survey study, patients reported high rates of symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and perceived stress. Combining with the special environment of the shelter hospitals and patient's psychological needs, the health care workers should give more effective interventions to relieve the patients' stress and improve their mental symptoms.","output":"Factors associated with mental health outcomes among patients with COVID-19 treated in the Fangcang shelter hospital in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Barely 15 years after the 2008 financial crisis and in a context of rising nationalism, regional organizations are facing multiple challenges.

Methanol poisoning is characterized by a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and can have a variety of central nervous system manifestations ranging from inebriation to coma and seizures, with afferent pupillary defect a sign of advanced methanol poisoning. Early recognition and treatment are key. Here we present a case of severe methanol toxicity secondary to hand sanitizer ingestion early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Case: A 54-year-old man with a history of alcohol use disorder presented to the Emergency Department after being found down and unresponsive near the front door of his home. Earlier that day he was acting strange according to his girlfriend. She left their home to get help, and upon her return found him in the front yard unresponsive and having seizure activity. Upon arrival to the Emergency Department he was afebrile, hypotensive, and tachycardic. He was unresponsive so he was emergently intubated. Physical exam was significant for asymmetric, dilated, and fixed pupils. Labs were significant for a bicarbonate of 5, potassium of 7.2, an anion gap of 28, and an osmolar gap of 177. His methanol level was 396. Despite dialysis he progressed to multi organ failure and his family decided to transition to comfort care, soon after which he expired. After further questioning it was discovered that he had been drinking hand sanitizer in an effort to get intoxicated as they were out of alcohol in the house. The bottle found in the home was reported to the FDA. Upon their review it was removed from store shelves due to methanol contamination and potential risk to others. It is believed that this brand of hand sanitizer was a new brand sold during the COVID-19 pandemic shortage and had a false ingredient label. Discussion: This patient had many of the characteristic signs and symptoms of methanol poisoning and was an unfortunate example of how devastating the outcome can be. However, it also highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic has had many unintentional medical consequences as a result of socioeconomic health disparities, the challenge of treating substance abuse disorder, and poorly regulated consumer products.","output":"Methanol toxicity: An unintended consequence of the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Letter to the editor.","output":"Need to promote healthy lifestyle as primary prevention to the COVID-19 and to improve the immune response to vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To characterize the volume and variation in orthopedic consults and surgeries that took place during a period of social distancing and pandemic.

The aim of this paper was to perform a critical study of this potentiality, coupling quantum chemical calculations to experimental evidence. METHODS Computational methods: Within the density functional theory calculations, the 6-31+G basis set (C, H, O, N atoms) and the LANL2DZ basis set (Tc,Re) were used. Stability calculations of the [RCNM(CO)(3)](+)) (M=Tc,Re) complexes were performed with the Gaussian 03 suite of programs, while for the evaluation of relative stability substitution reactions were used. Radiochemistry: Vitamin B(12), 4-hydroxy-benzylcyanide and 4-methoxy-benzonitrile were labeled at 100 degrees C during 30 min. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis was performed using radioactive and UV detection. RESULTS Computational methods: The influence of different ligands on the stability yielded a sequence: imidazole>tBuCN>NH(3) approximately CH(3)CN>HCN (mimicking the best CoCN)>H(2)O. The transmetalation reaction indicates that all ligands prefer Re to Tc. The preference for the nitrogen atom of imidazole to the cyanide nitrogen atom for complex formation with [Tc(CO)(3)(H(2)O)(3)](+) is interpreted in terms of the hard and soft acid and base properties principle. Radiochemistry: 4-Hydroxy-benzylcyanide and 4-methoxy-benzonitrile did not show any labeling. An excess of acetonitrile did not inhibit the labeling of vitamin B(12) as expected if the CN group should be involved, indicating that the labeling occurs on a stronger complexing group present like benzimidazole.

Moreover, not all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population are detected (laboratory diagnosed). Here, we examine the relation between detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. the percent of detected COVID-19 cases among all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population) and levels of mortality for COVID-19 for the 85 different regions (federal subjects) of the Russian Federation. Methods: Lower case-fatality ratio (i.e. the ratio between the number of reported COVID-19 deaths and the number of diagnosed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population) corresponds to higher detectability of the SARS-COV-2 infection. We used data from the Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor) on the number of detected COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the 85 different regions of the Russian Federation to examine the correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation. Results: The correlation between case-fatality ratios for cases/deaths reported by Sep. 17, 2020 and rates of mortality for COVID-19 per 100,000 for deaths reported by Sep. 17, 2020 in different regions of the Russian Federation is 0.68 (0.55,0.78), with the region with both the highest COVID-19 mortality rate per 100,000 and the highest case-fatality ratio being the city of St. Petersburg. Conclusions: Detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the factors that affects the levels of mortality for COVID-19 in Russia.

Graphs of this type are usually large-scale but only a small subset of vertices are related in downstream tasks. Current methods are too expensive to this setting as the complexity is at best linear-dependent on both the number of nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose a new method, namely Dynamic Personalized PageRank Embedding (\\\\textsc{DynamicPPE}) for learning a target subset of node representations over large-scale dynamic networks. Based on recent advances in local node embedding and a novel computation of dynamic personalized PageRank vector (PPV), \\\\textsc{DynamicPPE} has two key ingredients: 1) the per-PPV complexity is $\\\\mathcal{O}(m \\\\bar{d} / \\\\epsilon)$ where $m,\\\\bar{d}$, and $\\\\epsilon$ are the number of edges received, average degree, global precision error respectively. Thus, the per-edge event update of a single node is only dependent on $\\\\bar{d}$ in average; and 2) by using these high quality PPVs and hash kernels, the learned embeddings have properties of both locality and global consistency. These two make it possible to capture the evolution of graph structure effectively.

The first such instance was apparently the encephalitis lethargica pandemic which arose around the time of the First World War, moving in the shadow of a repiratory virus pandemic. The epidemic of encephalitis lethargica (EL), or Von Economo's Disease, in the years 1917-27 was the first pandemic involving the central nervous system. It moved in some places in parallel with the Great Flu Pandemic but does not seem to have been caused by it. Unlike the coronavirus, pandemic EL affected children heavily, leading often to bizarre changes in character and personality. It often left sequelae lasting for decades in the form of postencephalitic Parkinsonism (PEP). Unlike the coronavirus, it had a high mortality of around 20 percent. Although encephalitis lethargica involved a number of systems, psychiatric morbidity was most prominent and entailed severe depression, mania, catatonia and psychosis. It ended without therapeutic or public-health measures; today, sporadic cases of EL continue to be reported. The hypothesis is that we can derive from the EL psychiatric pandemic certain lessons that might be useful in studying tardive COVID symptoms today.","output":"The first psychiatric pandemic: Encephalitis lethargica, 1917-27."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forecasting of COVID-19 daily confirmed cases has been one of the several challenges posed on the governments and health sectors on a global scale.

METHODS Twenty patients with metastatic nonseminomatous testicular germ-cell tumor underwent extraperitoneal laparoscopic RPLND after chemotherapy. The procedure was not indicated for patients with a pre-chemotherapy mass larger than 5 cm. Morbidity and oncological outcome were reviewed retrospectively. Surgical complications were graded according to the Clavien classification system. RESULTS Laparoscopic RPLND was completed in all patients, and there was no conversion to open surgery. The median operating time was 223 min (range, 137-399 min). The median blood loss was 20 ml (range, 10-520 ml). There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, 4 patients (20 %) had prolonged lymphorrhea (grade I) and 9 (45 %) had chyle leakage (grade I). Histological examination of the residual mass revealed necrosis in 16 (80 %) and the presence of teratoma with/without viable tumor in 4 (20 %). With a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 24-112), no patient has had disease recurrence. Normal antegrade ejaculation was preserved in all of the 14 patients studied. CONCLUSIONS Extraperitoneal laparoscopic RPLND can be performed with acceptable morbidity and excellent cancer control in select patients.

This study analyzed the clinical manifestation of 13 severe COVID-19 cases at a single institution and compared the data to previously reported characteristics of severe COVID-19 in China. Methods: : This retrospective case study included patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the isolation ward of the Shandong Chest Hospital from January 2020 to February 2020. The clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory examination results, imaging features, treatment strategies, and patient prognoses were summarized. A database search was then conducted for studies published through December 2020 documenting characteristics of severe COVID-19 cases in China. The pooled results for severe COVID-19 patients in China were calculated by using the random-effects model. Results: : A total of 4 severe and 9 critical patients were included from Shandong Chest Hospital. The average patient age was 55.3 (range 23-88) years, and 61.5% of patients were male. Chest computed tomography for all patients showed multiple lesions as ground-glass shadows in both lungs. All patients presented bacterial infection and various degrees of liver and myocardial injury. The treatment strategies for patients included antibiotics, immunoglobulin, and glucocorticoids, and mechanical ventilation was used in all patients for respiratory failure. Two patients died, and 11 recovered. In the pooled data for severe COVID-19 patients, the most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease. The common signs in these patients were fever, cough, fatigue, chest tightness, and a leukocyte count > 10. Conclusions: : Older males with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Patients should be assessed for concomitant bacterial infections.

Secondary objectives were to compare fellows' and program leaders' perceptions of fellow POCUS competency and training barriers. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey of U.S. PEM fellows and fellowship program leaders of the 78 fellowship programs using two online group-specific surveys exploring five domains: program demographics; training strategies and requirements; perceived competency; barriers, strengths, and weaknesses of POCUS training; and POCUS satisfaction. Results Eighty-three percent (65/78) of programs and 53% (298/558) of fellows responded. All participating PEM fellowship programs included POCUS training in their curriculum. Among the 65 programs, 97% of programs and 92% of programs utilized didactics and supervised scanning shifts as educational techniques, respectively. Sixty percent of programs integrated numerical benchmarks and 49% of programs incorporated real-time, hands-on demonstration as training requirements. Of the 19 POCUS applications deemed in the literature as core requirements for fellows, at least 75% of the 298 fellows reported training in 13 of those applications. Although less than half of fellows endorsed competency for identifying intussusception, ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis, and transvaginal pregnancy evaluation, a higher proportion of leaders reported fellows as competent for these applications (40% vs. 68%, p  0.001; 21% vs. 39%, p = 0.003; and 21% vs. 43%, p  0.001). Forty-six percent of fellows endorsed a lack of PEM POCUS evidence as a training barrier compared to 31% of leaders (p = 0.02), and 39% of leaders endorsed a lack of local financial support as a training barrier compared to 23% of fellows (p = 0.01). Conclusions Although most PEM fellowship programs provide POCUS training, there is variation in content and requirements.

In addressing emergencies or special cases, each medical institution in a metropolitan area typically has a siloed process for capturing emergency patient records. These approaches vary in technical capabilities and may include use of an electronic medical record system (EMR) or a hybrid paper/EMR process. Given the projected volume of patients for the COVID-19 pandemic and the proposed multi-institutional team approach needed in case of significant provider illness, IEMS sought a simple, efficient, consolidated EMR solution to support planning for the potential capacity gap. IEMS approached Regenstrief Institute (RI), an established partner with experience in supporting OpenMRS, a global good EMR platform that had been deployed in multiple settings globally. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project was to determine if OpenMRS, a global good, could be used to quickly stand up a system that would meet the needs for health emergency data collection and reporting. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION METHODS: The team used an \\"all hands on deck\\" approach, bringing together technical and subject matter experts, and a human-centered and iterative process to ensure the system met the key needs of IEMS. The OpenMRS Reference Application was adapted to the specific need and deployed as Docker containers to servers within the Indiana Health Information Exchange. PROJECT OUTCOMES AND LESSONS LEARNED: In less than two weeks, the Regenstrief team was able to install, configure and set up a working version of OpenMRS to support the desired electronic record requirements for the IEMS disaster field clinics. Using a human-centered approach, the RI team developed, tested, and released a user-friendly, installation-ready solution complete with an end user manual and a base support plan. IEMS and RI are sharing this approach to demonstrate how a global good can quickly generate a solution for COVID-19 and other disaster responses.

While everyday social life becomes difficult for citizens with economic and cultural capital, it becomes even worse for vulnerable groups such as persons with mental health and substance use disorders, who are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion. The aim of this study is to investigate how the first COVID-19 lockdown affected the everyday life and health of persons with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders. METHODS: This qualitative study reports data from 17 individual interviews and one focus group of five participants, all with a self-reported mental health and substance use disorder. Interviews were conducted based on a semi-structured interview guide in September and October 2020 in a medium-sized local authority in Norway. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. A reference group of people with varied knowledge and experiences of the phenomenon were involved in study design, recruitment, data generation and analysis. RESULTS: The analysis identified four interrelated main themes, describing how the first lockdown affected the everyday life and health of persons suffering from a mental health and substance use disorder: (1) The COVID-19 outbreak as a perceived challenge, (2) A decline in mental health and well-being, (3) Increased substance use challenges, and (4) Diverse experiences with health and social services. The results show that people with a co-occurring disorder have challenges with digital tools and/or do not have the appropriate equipment. Further, participants were not concerned about becoming infected themselves, but infecting others. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with a mental health and substance use disorder face major challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to maintain continuous low-threshold services especially directed towards persons with co-occurring disorders during the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of race and ethnicity with treatment decisions and intensity for patients hospitalized for COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of manually abstracted electronic medical records. PATIENTS: 7,997 patients (62% non-Hispanic White, 16% non-Black Hispanic, and 23% Black) hospitalized for COVID-19 at 135 community hospitals between March and June 2020 MAIN MEASURES: Advance care planning (ACP), do not resuscitate (DNR) orders, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (MV), and in-hospital mortality. Among decedents, we classified the mode of death based on treatment intensity and code status as treatment limitation (no MV/DNR), treatment withdrawal (MV/DNR), maximal life support (MV/no DNR), or other (no MV/no DNR). KEY RESULTS: Adjusted in-hospital mortality was similar between White (8%) and Black patients (9%, OR=1.1, 95% CI=0.9C1.4, p=0.254), and lower among Hispanic patients (6%, OR=0.7, 95% CI=0.6C1.0, p=0.032). Black and Hispanic patients were significantly more likely to be treated in the ICU (White 23%, Hispanic 27%, Black 28%) and to receive mechanical ventilation (White 12%, Hispanic 17%, Black 16%). The groups had similar rates of ACP (White 12%, Hispanic 12%, Black 11%), but Black and Hispanic patients were less likely to have a DNR order (White 13%, Hispanic 8%, Black 7%). Among decedents, there were significant differences in mode of death by race/ethnicity (treatment limitation: White 39%, Hispanic 17% (p=0.001), Black 18% (p<0.0001); treatment withdrawal: White 26%, Hispanic 43% (p=0.002), Black 28% (p=0.542); and maximal life support: White 21%, Hispanic 26% (p=0.308), Black 36% (p<0.0001)).

In total, 44 of these patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing. No abnormalities were detected in the pulmonary function tests in 23 (50%) of the patients. Abnormalities of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC and TL,CO were detected in seven (15%), 12 (26%), one (2%) and 18 (39%) patients, respectively. All of these abnormalities were mild except in one case. In 18 patients (41%), the maximum aerobic capacity was below the lower limit of the normal range. Breathing reserve was low in four patients and significant oxygen desaturation was detected in a further four patients. Comparison of the measured exercise capacity with resting pulmonary function tests showed many cases of discordance in impairment. In conclusion, pulmonary function defects were detected in half of the recovered severe acute respiratory syndrome patients 3 months after hospital discharge, but the impairment was mild in almost all cases.

Differences in social and moral cognitive skills may significantly impact individual attitudes and responses to the pandemic. Here, we aimed to assess the extent to which factors associated with prosociality (including empathy, theory of mind (ToM), and moral judgments) predict the perception of SARS-CoV-2 impacts and responses. Participants (N = 413) from Colombia answered factors associated with prosociality measures and judgments about SARS-CoV-2 risk, impact, and acceptance of quarantine guidelines. Results revealed that affective empathy (personal distress and empathic concern) and moral tendencies (deontological trends) predicted greater acceptance of quarantine but in turn yielded an increased perception of risks and individual impacts of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, age (older) and gender (female) also increased the risk perception and impact estimation.

We find that oil exporters adopt a balanced approach to the risks associated with export volume growth and pricing, which is different from some major oil importers that prioritize either the physical supply or price stability. Simulation scenarios of increasing oil exports to China would have a significant impact mainly on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but not on the others, while scenarios of reduced oil exports to the United States would impact mainly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

METHODS AND MATERIAL: Ahmedabad Model for control of COVID-19 based on Ct threshold has been put forth which stresses upon the fact that higher viral load (super-spreaders) could be an important determinant in spreading infections in the community. RESULTS: The cycle threshold (Ct)-based segregation of laboratory-confirmed positive cases along with contact tracing of all of them of previous 5 days has been found to be effective strategy and needs to be adopted for further management. The Ahmedabad model of COVID-19 control was practiced during 3rd week of June 2020 onwards. Following implementation, cases started declining in Ahmedabad district whereas it showed an increasing trend in rest of Gujarat where it was not implemented.

A rapid sequencing-based genotyping protocol was developed and tested on SARS-CoV-2-positive RNA samples by next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: We describe 11 major mutations which defined five major clades (G614, S84, V251, I378 and D392) of globally circulating viral populations. The clades can specifically identify using an 11-nucleotide genetic barcode. An analysis of amino acid variation in SARS-CoV-2 proteins provided evidence of substitution events in the viral proteins involved in both host entry and genome replication. CONCLUSION: Globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes could be classified into 5 major clades based on mutational profiles defined by an 11-nucleotide barcode. We have successfully developed a multiplexed sequencing-based, rapid genotyping protocol for high-throughput classification of major clade types of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples.

They are particularly numerous in the field of health, contributing to the movement called ehealth. What is the potential role of these devices as prevention supports? The purpose of this article is to provide an exploratory analysis of the use, efficacy and contribution to conventional prevention strategies. METHODS To address this issue, we conducted a scoping-review on the basis of 105 publications from the fields of medicine and human sciences. RESULTS Three dimensions of the use of smart devices in the field of health were identified: 1/a quantification tool allowing the users to measure their activities; 2/a tool of self-positioning in the community; 3/an interface between the medical world and the population, modifying the hierarchy of knowledge. However, few published studies have investigated the determinants of the efficacy of these devices and their impact on individual behaviours and professional health practices. CONCLUSION Based on the hypothesis of possible integration of these devices in prevention policies, it would be interesting to investigate two research issues: how and under what psycho-socio-environmental conditions can smart devices contribute to the adoption of positive health behaviours? To what degree does the use of smart devices modify the health care professional-patient relationship? Finding answers to these questions could help to define the real place of these devices in prevention strategies by determining their complementarity with respect to other prevention strategies, and the conditions of their efficacy on behaviours and inequalities.","output":"Exploratory study of the implications of research on the use of smart connected devices for prevention: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains one of the major public health issues worldwide. Developing a rapid, sensitive, specific, easy-to-operate, and cost-saving approach for the diagnosis of HBV is essential for its therapy and prevention. Here, we first devised a novel approach, termed loop-mediated isothermal amplification integrated with a nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (LAMP-LFB), for the detection of HBV in clinical application. The results indicated that a set of LAMP primers based on the S gene were valid for the establishment of HBV-LAMP-LFB. The optimal HBV-LAMP can be carried out at a constant temperature of 65C for 40 min. The whole detection process, including HBV genomic DNA preparation (10 min), LAMP (40 min), and LFB reading (within 2 min), can be accomplished within 60 min. The limit of detection of the HBV-LAMP-LFB assay was 7.5 IU per test. The specificity of this assay was one hundred percent, and there was no cross-reactivity with other pathogens. Hence, these results indicated that the HBV-LAMP-LFB assay established in the current study is a sensitive, rapid, specific, visual, simple, and cost-saving method for the screening of HBV agents. More importantly, the HBV-LAMP-LFB has remarkable potential to develop a point-of-care testing in clinical application, especially in resource-scarce regions.","output":"Nanoparticle-Based Lateral Flow Biosensors Integrated With Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification for the Rapid and Visual Diagnosis of Hepatitis B Virus in Clinical Application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To determine whether the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is linked to the risk of COVID-19 among patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs). METHODS: We performed a disproportionality analysis of the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database between January 1, 2020, and June 10, 2020. The frequency of COVID-19 reports for all DMARD classes identified was compared with that for all other reports for all other drugs and quoted as the reporting odds ratio (ROR) (95% confidence interval [CI]). RESULTS: Among 980,446 individual case-safety reports voluntarily recorded in the database, 398 identified COVID-19 in DMARD-treated patients with IRDs. There were 177 (44.5%) patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 120 (30.1%) with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 93 (23.4%) with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 8 (2.0%) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Most of the cases of COVID-19 occurred in patients taking anti-TNF agents (84.2%), resulting in a significant disproportionality signal (ROR [95% CI]: 8.31 [7.48-9.23]) - particularly in patients with RA, AS or PsA. A significant inverse disproportionality was found for the anti-IL-6 agent tocilizumab (ROR [95% CI]: 0.12 [0.02-0.88]) and JAK inhibitors (ROR [95% CI]: 0.33 [0.19-0.58]) in patients with RA - suggesting that these two drug classes are safer in the context of RA. CONCLUSION: Our results are in line with the literature on a potentially better safety profile for anti-IL-6 agents and JAK inhibitors.

METHODS: A total of 62 subjects were included in our study (n=38 patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactionCconfirmed COVID-19 and n=24 nonCCOVID-19 controls). We performed histopathologic assessment of autopsy cases, surface markerCbased phenotyping of neutrophils and platelets, and functional assays for platelet, neutrophil functions, and coagulation tests, as well. RESULTS: We provide evidence that organ involvement and prothrombotic features in COVID-19 are linked by immunothrombosis. We show that, in COVID-19, inflammatory microvascular thrombi are present in the lung, kidney, and heart, containing neutrophil extracellular traps associated with platelets and fibrin. Patients with COVID-19 also present with neutrophil-platelet aggregates and a distinct neutrophil and platelet activation pattern in blood, which changes with disease severity.

What set this project apart from earlier efforts is the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) that enabled to explore alterations beyond the coding DNA, into cancers non-coding genome. WGS of the entire cohort allowed to tease apart driving mutations that initiate and support carcinogenesis from passenger mutations that do not play an overt role in the disease.

Accurate prediction of likely efficacy in the clinic requires that these models are reliable and consistent. We assessed this by examining the reporting of experimental conditions and sensitivity to temozolomide in glioma cells lines. METHODS We searched Medline and Embase (Jan 1994-Jan 2021) for studies evaluating the effect of temozolomide monotherapy on cell viability of at least one malignant glioma cell line. Key data items included type of cell lines, temozolomide exposure duration in hours (hr), and cell viability measure (IC50). RESULTS We included 212 studies from 2789 non-duplicate records that reported 248 distinct cell lines. The commonest cell line was U87 (60.4%). Only 10.4% studies used a patient-derived cell line. The proportion of studies not reporting each experimental condition ranged from 8.0-27.4%, including base medium (8.0%), serum supplementation (9.9%) and number of replicates (27.4%). In studies reporting IC50, the median value for U87 at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h was 123.9 M (IQR 75.3-277.7 M), 223.1 M (IQR 92.0-590.1 M) and 230.0 M (IQR 34.1-650.0 M), respectively. The median IC50 at 72 h for patient-derived cell lines was 220 M (IQR 81.1-800.0 M). CONCLUSION Temozolomide sensitivity reported in comparable studies was not consistent between or within malignant glioma cell lines. Drug discovery science performed on these models cannot reliably inform clinical translation. A consensus model of reporting can maximise reproducibility and consistency among in vitro studies.","output":"Temozolomide sensitivity of malignant glioma cell lines - a systematic review assessing consistencies between in vitro studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health Assessors undertaking court ordered assessments are granted access to material related to the alleged They do not have access to defendant's confidential health records.

To this end, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases until November 4, 2020. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the rate with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Predictors were identified to be associated with vaccination intention based on the health belief model framework. Thirty-eight articles, with 81,173 individuals, were included. The pooled COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate was 73.31% (95%CI: 70.52, 76.01). Studies using representative samples reported a rate of 73.16%. The pooled acceptance rate among the general population (81.65%) was higher than that among healthcare workers (65.65%). Gender, educational level, influenza vaccination history, and trust in the government were strong predictors of COVID-19 vaccination willingness. People who received an influenza vaccination in the last year were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccination (odds ratio: 3.165; 95%CI: 1.842, 5.464). Protecting oneself or others was the main reason for willingness, and concerns about side effects and safety were the main reasons for unwillingness.

These measures, along with the public concerns of getting COVID-19, led to a decline in the utilization of regular health services including immunization. METHODS: we reviewed the administrative routine immunization data from 15 African countries for the period from January 2018 to June 2020 to analyze the trends in the monthly number of children vaccinated with specific antigens, and compare the changes in the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: thirteen of the 15 countries showed a decline in the monthly average number of vaccine doses provided, with 6 countries having more than 10% decline. Nine countries had a lower monthly mean of recipients of first dose measles vaccination in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter. Guinea, Nigeria, Ghana, Angola, Gabon, and South Sudan experienced a drop in the monthly number of children vaccinated for DPT3 and/or MCV1 of greater than 2 standard deviations at some point in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the mean for the months January-June of 2018 and 2019. CONCLUSION: countries with lower immunization coverage in the pre-COVID period experienced larger declines in the number of children vaccinated immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. Prolonged and significant reduction in the number of children vaccinated poses a serious risk for outbreaks such as measles. Countries should monitor coverage trends at national and subnational levels, and undertake catch-up vaccination activities to ensure that children who have missed scheduled vaccines receive them at the earliest possible time.","output":"The performance of routine immunization in selected African countries during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the Deloitte Millennial Survey30, millennials associate their job satisfaction with a high level of cross-team collaboration, a culture of mutual support and tolerance, open and free communication, a strong commitment to equality and the active promotion of ideas amongst all employees.

Here we review our experience using SARS-CoV-2 culture to determine infectivity and safe de-isolation of COVID-19 patients. Methods 195 patients with diverse severity of COVID-19 were tested (outpatients [n=178]), inpatients [n=12] and ICU [n=5]). SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive samples were cultured in Vero C1008 cells and inspected daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE was confirmed by PCR of culture supernatant. Where no CPE was documented, PCR was performed on day four to confirm absence of virus replication. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of the day four PCR (Ctculture) and the PCR of the original clinical sample (Ctsample) were compared, and positive cultures were defined as a Ctsample - Ctculture value of greater than or equal to 3.

However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has revealed many weaknesses in the capacity of countries to design and execute sustainable vaccination programs. An influenza pandemic remains a global threat and yet there is no global monitoring system for assessing progress towards influenza vaccination coverage targets. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) Influenza Vaccine Supply International Task Force (IVS) developed a survey method in 2008 to estimate seasonal influenza vaccination coverage rates, which in turn serves as a crude estimate of pandemic preparedness. It provides evidence to guide expanded efforts for pandemic preparedness, specifically for increasing COVID-19 vaccine immunization levels. Furthermore, the results presented herein serve as a proxy for assessing the state of pandemic preparedness at a global and regional level.

However, considerable regional inequities in access to vaccine persist. Three regions, Africa, the Middle-east, and Southeast Asia together account for 50% of the global population but only 6% of distributed seasonal influenza vaccine doses. This is an important finding in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as distribution of influenza vaccine doses in many ways reflects access to COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, improving seasonal vaccine uptake rates is critical for optimizing the annual benefits by reducing the huge annual influenza-associated societal burdens and by providing protection to vulnerable individuals against serious complications from seasonal influenza infections.","output":"Vaccine complacency and dose distribution inequities limit the benefits of seasonal influenza vaccination, despite a positive trend in use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outbreaks of COVID-19 among nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care facilities in the United States have had devastating effects on residents.

However, the expression of Toll-like receptors, MYD88, RNF36, IRF3, and TBK1 and inhibitors of the NF-kappaB gene was not altered. A. phagocytophilum infection also altered the apoptotic program of NB4 cells and resulted in increased transcription of antiapoptotic genes (MCL1 and BFL1). The transcription and translation of iron-metabolism genes (light polypeptide ferritin chain, transferrin, and the transferrin receptor) were significantly altered, suggesting a possible link between A. phagocytophilum infection and iron metabolism. Our study clearly demonstrates multifactorial effects of A. phagocytophilum infection on NB4 promyelocytic leukemic cell machinery.","output":"Modulation of NB4 promyelocytic leukemic cell machinery by Anaplasma phagocytophilum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019; it rapidly spread around the world and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The palliative care program at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada, provides comprehensive care to patients with advanced cancer and their families, through services including an acute palliative care unit, an inpatient consultation service, and an ambulatory palliative care clinic. In the face of a global pandemic, palliative care teams are uniquely placed to support patients with cancer who also have COVID-19. This may include managing severe symptoms such as dyspnea and agitation, as well as guiding advance care planning and goals of care conversations. In tandem, there is a need for palliative care teams to continue to provide care to patients with advanced cancer who are COVID-negative but who are at higher risk of infection and adverse outcomes related to COVID-19.

PURPOSE: Although pharmacist-provided diabetes services have been shown to be effective, the effectiveness of telepharmacy (TP) in diabetes management has not been clearly established. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of diabetes TP services. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched (from inception through September 2021) to identify published studies that evaluated the effect of TP services in patients with diabetes mellitus and reported either glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or fasting blood glucose (FBG) outcomes. Mean difference (MD), weighted mean difference (WMD), relative risk (RR), and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. RESULTS: 36 studies involving 13,773 patients were included in the systematic review, and 23 studies were included in the meta-analysis. TP was associated with a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c (MD, -1.26%; 95% CI, -1.69 to -0.84) from baseline. FBG was not significantly affected (MD, -25.32 mg/dL; 95% CI, -57.62 to 6.98). Compared to non-TP service, TP was associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.76). In a subset of studies that compared TP to face-to-face (FTF) pharmacy services, no significant difference in HbA1c lowering was seen between the 2 groups (WMD, -0.09%; 95% CI, -1.07 to 0.90). CONCLUSION: Use of TP was associated with reduction of HbA1c and the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus. High-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to validate the effectiveness of diabetes TP services relative to FTF services.","output":"Effectiveness of telepharmacy diabetes services: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES International medical graduates (IMGs) who pursue additional training in another country may encounter unique challenges that compromise their learning experience. This paper describes the development of an Online Bridging Program in the Division of Palliative Care at the University Health Network Toronto and examines its effectiveness in improving IMGs' readiness for Canadian fellowship training. METHODS The annual Online Bridging Program was developed to help new IMGs transitioning to Canadian palliative fellowship using Kern's framework for curriculum development. Following a needs assessment, eight online modules with weekly live sessions were developed and underwent external content validation and usability tests. After each iteration, the programme was improved based on participant feedback. Evaluation was conducted first through an online survey immediately on completion of the programme and then through qualitative interviews 6 months into the fellowship. The interviews were analysed using Braun and Clarke's model for thematic analysis. RESULTS Nine IMGs participated in the Online Bridging Program from 2018 to 2020. All nine participated in the survey and eight in the interviews. Responses to the online survey were almost unanimously positive, suggesting its effectiveness in assisting the IMGs' transitions into fellowship. The interviews revealed four major themes: the importance of combining online modules and live sessions, reducing the fellows' anxiety and easing the transition into their new role, an improved overall learning experience and recognising online format limitations.

Predictions that the LMR would be overwhelmed by a coming COVID-19 tsunami were felt well before the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had been declared. And yet, the LMR, excepting Myanmar, has proved surprisingly resilient in keeping COVID-19 contained to mostly sporadic cases. Cumulative case rates (per one million population) for the LMR, including or excluding Myanmar, from January 1 to October 31 2020, are 1,184 and 237, respectively. More telling are the cumulative rates of COVID-19-attributable deaths for the same period of time, 28 per million with and six without Myanmar. Graphics demonstrate a flattening of pandemic curves in the LMR, minus Myanmar, after managing temporally and spatially isolated spikes in case counts, with negligible follow-on community spread. The comparable success of the LMR in averting pandemic disaster can likely be attributed to years of preparedness investments, triggered by avian influenza A (H5N1). Capacity building initiatives applied to COVID-19 containment included virological (influenza-driven) surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, field epidemiology training, and vaccine preparation. The notable achievement of the LMR in averting COVID-19 disaster through to October 31, 2020 can likely be credited to these preparedness measures.","output":"The Impact of Preparedness in Defying COVID-19 Pandemic Expectations in the Lower Mekong Region: A Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Several countries have controlled the spread of COVID-19 through varying combinations of border restrictions, case finding, contact tracing and careful calibration on the resumption of domestic activities. However, evaluating the effectiveness of these measures based on observed cases alone is challenging as it does not reflect the transmission dynamics of missed infections. Methods Combining data on notified local COVID-19 cases with known and unknown sources of infections (i.e. linked and unlinked cases) in Singapore in 2020 with a transmission model, we reconstructed the incidence of missed infections and estimated the relative effectiveness of different types of outbreak control. We also examined implications for estimation of key real-time metrics -- the reproduction number and ratio of unlinked to linked cases, using observed data only as compared to accounting for missed infections. Findings Prior to the partial lockdown in Singapore, initiated in April 2020, we estimated 89% (95%CI 75-99%) of the infections caused by notified cases were contact traced, but only 12.5% (95%CI 2-69%) of the infections caused by missed infectors were identified. We estimated that the reproduction number was 1.23 (95%CI 0.98-1.54) after accounting for missed infections but was 0.90 (95%CI 0.79-1.1) based on notified cases alone. At the height of the outbreak, the ratio of missed to notified infections was 34.1 (95%CI 26.0-46.6) but the ratio of unlinked to linked infections was 0.81 (95%CI 0.59-1.36). Our results suggest that when case finding and contact tracing identifies at least 50% and 20% of the infections caused by missed and notified cases respectively, the reproduction number could be reduced by more than 14%, rising to 20% when contact tracing is 80% effective. Interpretation Depending on the relative effectiveness of border restrictions, case finding and contact tracing, unobserved outbreak dynamics can vary greatly. Commonly used metrics to evaluate outbreak control -- typically based on notified data -- could therefore misrepresent the true underlying outbreak.

The correspondence analysis (CA), the effective number of codons versus GC3(NC-plot), and the relationship between GC12 versus GC3 show that a low codon usage bias exists in SARS-CoV-2. Both mutation and natural selection pressure have contributed to this low codon usage bias, with the former being the main determining factor.

Patch monitors may simplify the evaluation, providing accurate arrhythmia evaluation and QT assessment. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients referred for evaluation of an inherited arrhythmia syndrome underwent standard investigations, including 12-lead ECG, 24-hour Holter monitoring, ETT, along with supplemental monitoring using a 7-day ECG patch monitor. Heart rates (HR), corrected QT intervals (QTc), and ectopic burden were compared across monitoring modalities. Among 35 patients that wore the patch monitor, the median age was 39 years (54% male). There was intermediate correlation between resting HR across modalities (r=0.58-0.66) and poor correlation of peak HR (r=0.27-0.39). There was intermediate correlation between resting QTc intervals across modalities (r=0.72-0.77) but negligible correlation between QTc intervals at peak HR across modalities (r=-0.01 to -0.06). There was good correlation in PAC and PVC ectopic burden across the Holter and patch monitor. CONCLUSION Patch monitors may simplify the evaluation of patients for an inherited arrhythmia syndrome and provide resting QT assessment over time. However, QTc interval comparison at peak heart rates remains variable, and may be limited by the single-lead ECG vector when using the patch monitor. Apart from QTc intervals at peak HR, patch monitors demonstrated good correlation with the ECG and Holter monitor for other parameters. This article is protected by copyright.

Higher COVID-19 mortality rates among Indigenous populations are often attributed to a higher comorbidity burden, although examinations of these associations are scarce, and none were believed to have included individuals hospitalized in Mississippi. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether racial mortality differences among adults hospitalized with COVID-19 are associated with differential comorbidity experiences. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The described cross-sectional study used retrospective hospital discharge data from the Mississippi Inpatient Outpatient Data System. All adult (aged 18 years) Mississippians of a known racial identity and who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 1 to December 31, 2020, in any of the states 103 nonfederal hospitals were included. Data were abstracted on June 17, 2021. EXPOSURE: Racial identity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital mortality as indicated by discharge status. RESULTS: A total of 18 731 adults hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis and known racial identity were included (median age, 66 [IQR, 53-76] years; 10 109 [54.0%] female; 225 [1.2%] American Indian and Alaska Native; 9191 [49.1%] Black; and 9121 [48.7%] White). Pooling across comorbidity risk groups, odds of in-hospital mortality among Black patients were 75% lower than among American Indian and Alaska Native patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.25 [95% CI, 0.18-0.34]); odds of in-hospital death among White patients were 77% lower (OR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.16-0.31]). Within comorbidity risk group analyses, Indigenous patients with the lowest risk (Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score 0) had an adjusted probability of in-hospital death of 0.10 compared with 0.03 for Black patients (OR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.10-0.82]) and 0.04 for White patients (OR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.13-1.07]). Probability of in-hospital death at the highest comorbidity risk levels (Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score 16) was 0.69 for American Indian and Alaska Native patients compared with 0.28 for Black patients (OR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.08-0.32]) and 0.25 for White patients (OR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.07-0.27]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study of US adults hospitalized with COVID-19 found that American Indian and Alaska Native patients had lower comorbidity risk scores than those observed among Black or White patients. Despite empirical associations between reduced comorbidity risk scores and reduced odds of inpatient mortality, American Indian and Alaska Native patients were significantly more likely to die in the hospital of COVID-19 than Black or White patients at every level of comorbidity risk.

Many healthcare workers became ill during the pandemic and some among them died. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and compare level of stress against COVID\\\\19 pandemic among doctors from Turkey and Italy. METHODS: This research is a cross\\\\sectional study in which Perceived Stress Scale (PSS\\\\10) and Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) are administered online via social networks. All data collection tools were delivered to individuals between 1 and 15 June 2020 and filled in online with Google Forms application. In total, 618 individuals were included in this study and all of them were medical doctors. RESULTS: Higher PS and STS levels were found related to female gender, being married, working in pandemic hospital and older ages. Stress levels were found statistically higher in Turkish doctors when compared to Italian doctors for both stress scales (Turkish/Italian PSS:20.18  7.90/ 19.35  6.71, STSS: 44.19  13.29/ 38.83  13.74). CONCLUSION: The number of doctors per 1000 of population is lower and per capita visits to a physician are higher in Turkey when compared to Italy. Besides pandemic, these heavier working conditions, increased weekly working hours can cause stress for Turkish doctors.

Oxygen concentration near the ventilator, oxygen concentration at the mask, and blood gases were measured. RESULTS Overall, oxygen concentration at the mask (29  5%) was lower than oxygen concentration at the ventilator (34  4%), with a mean difference of 5.1% (95% CI 4.2-5.9%, P < .001)%. With the leak port circuit, oxygen concentration at the mask decreased by 3.2% (95% CI 2.6 to 3.9%, P < .001), compared to the active valve circuit.

NAVA has been increasingly used for critically ill patients, but it has not been evaluated during spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). We designed a pilot trial to assess the feasibility of using NAVA during SBTs, and to compare the breathing pattern and patient-ventilator asynchrony of NAVA with Pressure Support (PSV) during SBTs. METHODS We conducted a crossover trial in the ICU of a university hospital in Brazil and included mechanically ventilated patients considered ready to undergo an SBT on the day of the study. Patients underwent two SBTs in randomized order: 30 min in PSV of 5 cmH2O or NAVA titrated to generate equivalent peak airway pressure (Paw), with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. The ICU team, blinded to ventilatory mode, evaluated whether patients passed each SBT. We captured flow, Paw and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) from the ventilator and used it to calculate respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT), and EAdi. Detection of asynchrony events used waveform analysis and we calculated the asynchrony index as the number of asynchrony events divided by the number of neural cycles. RESULTS We included 20 patients in the study. All patients passed the SBT in PSV, and three failed the SBT in NAVA. Five patients were reintubated and the extubation failure rate was 25% (95% CI 9-49%). Respiratory parameters were similar in the two modes: VT = 6.1 (5.5-6.5) mL/Kg in NAVA vs. 5.5 (4.8-6.1) mL/Kg in PSV (p = 0.076) and RR = 27 (17-30) rpm in NAVA vs. 26 (20-30) rpm in PSV, p = 0.55.

We report here the case of a young patient requiring inpatient care due to severe decompensated liver disease (MELD 24), justifying her referral from her local hospital to our high-volume LT unit, despite the unfavourable COVID-19 epidemiology in our Region. She was quickly listed for liver transplant (MELD 26), but 5 days later she was incidentally diagnosed with COVID-19 in the setting of our surveillance program for very sick patients and, despite her underlying condition, had an indolent course of the viral disease.

It was observed that; SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) caused a hyperinflammation and hyperimmune state and these conditions can result in a hypercoagulation and eventually thrombotic events might occur. METHODS: Here we presented two covid-19 positive patients with rare aortic thrombotic events. RESULTS: Two patients underwent emergent diagnostic tests including computerized tomographic angiography. Total aortic thrombosis just below the renal arising point was evaluated in one patient, and aortic floating thrombus was evaluated in other patient. But despite initial medical therapies, the clinical conditions of the cases worsened and both patients died while on medical therapy before planned surgical intervention applied.

Apart from these visible threats, this situation has an ongoing devastating impact on the mental health and psychological well-being of people. The word of the law enforces care and support for children with disadvantages, disabilities and vulnerabilities on caregivers, Managers and Staff, managing Alternative Care programmes, but the spirit of such child protection laws also underlines the importance of caring for caregivers, especially in childcare institutions (CCIs). The well-being of the caregivers is the cornerstone of every well-functioning childcare institution and other residential care spaces. This article is designed to document the mental health status of caregivers (residential staff staying with children), in residential care spaces in the COVID times and to determine how the new stresses impacted them and the coping patterns they acquired in current situation;across different countries of South Asia, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.This exploratory rapid assessment project aimed to reach out to the registered childcare homes/ institutions, across the South Asian region, with the help of different NGOs, as well as Government mechanisms. The data was collected through purposive sampling and analysed quantitatively where the sample included the selected caregivers of participating CCIs across these nations. This study aimed to synthesize the responses of caregivers across the region;develop an analysis, which may help authorities to rethink, reform and strengthen the current practices, in order to develop approach-centred strategies for improving the well-being of caregivers as this has a direct bearing on the well-being of children in their care. Since the start of the COVID pandemic, for the residential caregivers, the access to external resources, including physical support from professional staff, has become restricted to bare minimum, due to lockdown and quarantine measures.

METHODS: Data came from an online survey of United States pregnant women (n = 715), conducted in May 2020. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale were used to assess depressive symptoms, thoughts of self-harm, and moderate or severe anxiety. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the associations of COVID-19 experiences with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Participants were racially diverse. The prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes was 36% for probable depression, 20% for thoughts of self-harm, and 22% for anxiety. Women who reported family members dying from COVID-19 had four times higher odds of having thoughts of self-harm than women who did not experience family death. Depression was more prevalent among women who canceled or reduced medical appointments. Women were more likely to have worse mental health outcomes if they expressed worry about getting financial or emotional/social support, about their pregnancy, or about family or friends. Strict social distancing was positively associated with depression. A higher proportion of adults working from home was inversely associated with depression and thoughts of self-harm. CONCLUSION: High percentages of pregnant women had symptoms of depression or anxiety, suggesting an urgent need to screen and treat mental health conditions among pregnant women during the pandemic.

However, adoption of energy efficiency is generally low, as demonstrated by the energy efficiency gap. To understand that gap, this paper analyses the factors that affect how the energy efficiency attribute is rated in investment in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the hotel industry in Spain. A survey conducted on two hundred owners of hotels, hostels and holiday cottages (referred to jointly here for the sake of convenience as the hotel industry) shows that the value placed on energy efficiency is influenced not just by climate conditions, environmental concern and type of hotel but also by other attributes of the HVAC system such as brand reliability, price and performance. The hotel industry may also be identifying EE as a proxy for quality rather than savings. Designing the right energy-efficiency policy entails accounting for potential responses by agents, and this analysis helps identify those drivers to which they may or may not respond.","output":"Factors affecting energy-efficiency investment in the hotel industry: survey results from Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This short overview focuses on the causation and treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Some alternative approaches to T2D management are considered. Insulin is no longer considered as the first choice for type 2 diabetes, and an expanding range of new therapeutic possibilities is emerging. While these may lack the potency of insulin, at a minimum, they allow a major reduction in the intensity of insulin use.

While this access technique was first described in 2007 for colorectal resective procedures, large series are lacking. METHODS Between January 2009 and October 2010, all patients undergoing single port colorectal surgery performed by a single surgeon were prospectively entered into an IRB-approved database and studied with regard to perioperative events, morbidity, and mortality. RESULTS One hundred and two consecutive patients underwent a single port colorectal procedure. Mean age was 47 years (9-93 years), and average body mass index was 26 kg/m(2) (15-39 kg/m(2)). Primary diagnoses included ulcerative colitis (51), neoplasia (23), Crohn's disease (14), diverticulitis (11), familial adenomatous polyposis (1), and other (2). Procedures included 23 total colectomies, 40 segmental colectomies, and 19 other procedures. There was 1 conversion to an open operation, and 18 (18%) patients required placement of additional ports (1 port: N = 13; 2 ports: N = 2; 3 ports: N = 3). Average operating room time was 99 min (13-245), mean length of incision was 3.7 cm (1.2-7.8 cm), and average estimated blood loss was 140 ml (0-750 ml). There was one postoperative death, and 39 (38%) patients experienced minor postoperative complications. Mean lymph node harvest for oncologic resections was 44 (14-142). The average length of hospital stay was 5.9 days (2-24 days). CONCLUSIONS With proper patient selection and laparoscopic experience, single port colorectal surgery can be performed for even the most complex colorectal procedures. Further studies are needed to assess the benefits that single port colorectal surgery has over a conventional laparoscopic approach.","output":"Single incision laparoscopic colorectal surgery: a single surgeon experience of 102 consecutive cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Recent research has shown that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation on people's mental health are quite extensive, but there are limited studies on the effects of the pandemic on patients with mental health disorders. OBJECTIVE The objective of the present study was to assess the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals who have previously sought treatment for a mental health disorder. METHODS The current study uses the newly developed Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII) survey. This tool was designed to assess tangible impacts of epidemics and pandemics across personal and social life domains. From November 9th, 2020 to February 18th, 2021, a total of 245 adults (recruited from a mental health clinic) completed the consent form and responded to the survey link from the Siyan Clinical Corporation and Siyan Clinical Research practices located in Santa Rosa, California, USA. RESULTS We found that the least affected age group was 75 years or older individuals. This was followed closely by the 65- to 75-year-old age group. People with children under the age of 18 also reported both more negative indicators associated with the pandemic and more positive indicators compared to those without children at home. Gender queer, non-conforming, and transgender individuals may also be at risk for more negative impacts associated with the pandemic. When respondents were assessed with regard to their mental health diagnosis no differences were notes. Substance use also increased during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the data collected here may serve as foundational research in the prevention, care and treatment of mental health disorders during pandemics such as COVID-19. Populations such as those with previously diagnosed mental health disorders are particularly at risk for negative effects of pandemic-related stressors such as social isolation, especially if they have children in the household, are of a younger age group, or have substance use disorder. Gender may also be a factor. Further, the EPII survey may prove to be a useful tool in understanding these effects. Overall, these data may be a critical step towards understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations with a mental health diagnosis, which may aid mental health practitioners in understanding the consequences of pandemics on their patients' overall well-being.

Considering that individuals with mild or even asymptomatic COVID-19 can significantly increase the transmission in the society, early diagnosis is crucial in the fight against the pandemic. Although RT-PCR is the first method of choice for diagnosis, when the studies are reviewed, imaging methods that provide faster results in diagnosis come to the fore, especially in clinically severe cases, since RT-PCR and lung imaging do not have a clear advantage over each other and even they help in diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review article is to provide a summary of the diagnosis and management of MIS-C with a focus on management in the acute care setting. DISCUSSION: MIS-C is an inflammatory syndrome which can affect nearly any organ system. The most common symptoms are fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, though neurologic and dermatologic findings are also well-described. The diagnosis includes a combination of clinical and laboratory testing. Patients with MIS-C will often have elevated inflammatory markers and may have an abnormal electrocardiogram or echocardiogram. Initial treatment involves resuscitation with careful assessment for cardiac versus vasodilatory shock using point-of-care ultrasound. Treatment should include intravenous immunoglobulin, anticoagulation, and consideration of corticosteroids. Interleukin-1 and/or interleukin-6 blockade may be considered for refractory cases. Aspirin is recommended if there is thrombocytosis or Kawasaki disease-like features on echocardiogram. Patients will generally require admission to an intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: MIS-C is a condition associated with morbidity and mortality that is increasingly recognized as a potential complication in pediatric patients with COVID-19.

Our findings suggest that without the application of protection social measures, 56.1% of the Spanish population would contract the disease with a mortality of 0.4%. Assuming that 20% of the population was protected by vaccination by the end of the summer of 2021, it would be expected that 45% of the population would contract the disease and 0.3% of the population would die. However, both of these percentages are significantly lower when social measures were adopted, being the best results when social measures are in place and 40% of contacts traced. Our model shows that if 40% of the population can be vaccinated, even without social control measures, the percentage of people who die or recover from infection would fall from 0.41% and 56.1% to 0.16% and 33.5%, respectively compared with an unvaccinated population. When social control measures were applied in concert with vaccination the percentage of people who die or recover from infection diminishes until 0.10% and 14.5%, after vaccinating 40% of the population.

In this study, we investigated the importance of the G1-lineage H9N2 A/chicken/Israel/1163/2011 virus as a primary pathogen in layers, analyzing its tropism and binding affinity for the oviduct tissues, and investigating the long-term impact on egg production. Besides causing a mild respiratory infection, the virus replicated in the oviduct of 60% of the hens causing different degrees of salpingitis throughout the organ, in particular at the level of the infundibulum, where the detection of the virus was associated with severe heterophilic infiltrate, and necrosis of the epithelium. Binding affinity assays confirmed that the infundibulum was the most receptive region of the oviduct. The drop in egg production was at its peek at 2 weeks post-infection (pi) (60% decrease) and continued up to 80 days pi (35% decrease). On day 80 pi, non-laying birds showed egg yolk peritonitis, and histopathological analyses described profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture, duct ectasia and thinning of the epithelium, while the rest of the oviduct and ovary appeared normal. Our results show that this H9N2 virus is a primary pathogen in layer hens, and that its replication in the infundibulum is responsible for acute and chronic lesions that limits the effective functionality of the oviduct, compromising the commercial life of birds.

Our study sought to assess factors contributing to HCW infection and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. DESIGN: We conducted a cross sectional survey of HCWs (physicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), non-clinical staff) during May 2020. Participants completed a 42-item survey assessing disease transmission risk (clinical role, work environment, availability of personal protective equipment) and mental health (anxiety, depression and burn-out). SETTING: The questionnaire was disseminated over various social media platforms. 3083 respondents from 48 states, the District of Columbia and US territories accessed the survey. PARTICIPANTS: Using a convenience sample of HCWs who worked during the pandemic, 3083 respondents accessed the survey and 2040 participants completed at least 80% of the survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 infection, in addition to burn-out, depression and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Participants were largely from the Northeast and Southern USA, with attending physicians (31.12%), nurses (26.80%), EMTs (13.04%) with emergency medicine department (38.30%) being the most common department and specialty represented. Twenty-nine per cent of respondents met the criteria for being a probable case due to reported COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test. HCWs in the emergency department (31.64%) were more likely to contract COVID-19 compared with HCWs in the ICU (23.17%) and inpatient settings (25.53%). HCWs that contracted COVID-19 also reported higher levels of depressive symptoms (mean diff.=0.31; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.47), anxiety symptoms (mean diff.=0.34; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.52) and burn-out (mean diff.=0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.71).

Currently, there is no standard method for predicting successful weaning from NIV. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether a weaning index can predict NIV outcomes of patients with AECOPD. METHODS: This study was conducted at a single academic public hospital in northern Taiwan from February 2019 to January 2021. Patients with AECOPD admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure who were treated with NIV were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of successful weaning from NIV. Receiver operating characteristic curve methodology was used to assess the predictive capacity. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were enrolled, 65.9% of whom were successfully weaned from NIV. The patients had a mean age of 75.8 years and were mostly men (89.4%). The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) (P < 0.001), maximum inspiratory pressure (P = 0.014), and maximum expiratory pressure (P = 0.004) of the successful group were significant while preparing to wean. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the RSBI was 0.804, which was considered excellent discrimination. CONCLUSION: The RSBI predicted successful weaning from NIV in patients with AECOPD with hypercapnic respiratory failure.

However, interpreting estimates based on sero-surveillance requires an understanding of the duration of elevated antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the large number of people with pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Methods: We examined >30,000 serology assays for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM assays acquired longitudinally in 11,468 adults between April and November 2020 in the COVID-19 Community Research Partnership. Findings: Among participants with serologic evidence for infection but few or no symptoms or clinical disease, roughly 50% sero-reverted in 30 days of their initial positive test. Sero-reversion occurred more quickly for IgM than IgG and for antibodies targeting nucleocapsid protein compared with spike proteins, but was not associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, or healthcare worker status. Interpretation: The short duration of antibody response suggests that the true population prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly higher than presumed based on earlier sero-surveillance studies.

To identify these, it would be helpful to better understand how the infecting dose of SARS-CoV-2 and its route of infection and influence clinical outcome, immunological protection and likelihood of onward transmission. Proposal We suggest that carefully controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies involving intranasal and oral administration of progressively increasing doses of SARS-CoV-2, starting with low levels, to healthy young adult volunteers may be the most expeditious and definitive way to answer these questions. Such studies would differ in objective from CHIM proposals designed to expedite vaccine development, although the latter might be adapted to address some of the questions raised here. Implications Results from the studies proposed here could help elucidate the relationship of infection to COVID-19 and thereby provide a scientific basis for more targeted and sustainable application of public health control measures, and inform the design of improved immunotherapeutics and more targeted vaccine development.","output":"Low dose and oral exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may help us understand and prevent severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to medical education systems and medical students.

The students' willingness to be a doctor before and after the COVID-19 pandemic and changed willingness to specialize in respiratory medicine and infectious diseases were investigated. Multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression was used to explore factors that were associated with changes of willingness. A total of 1,837 medical students, including 1,227 females (66.8%), with a median age of 21.0 years, were recruited. Of the participants, 10.6% and 6.9% showed increased and decreased willingness to be a doctor after the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. Moreover, 11.7% showed increased willingness and 9.5% showed decreased willingness to major in respiratory medicine and infectious diseases. Students with younger age, lower household income, fewer depressive symptoms, less exposure to negative pandemic information and more satisfaction with their own major after the pandemic were associated with increased willingness to be a doctor. Students who engaged in regular exercise, were males and undergraduate level, were interested in medicine, paid more attention to positive information, were satisfied with their majors, and had increased willingness to be a doctor after the pandemic were more likely to choose to specialize in respiratory medicine and infectious disease. However, the severity of anxiety symptoms was associated with decreased willingness to work in the specialties of respiratory medicine and infectious diseases.

This study aims to examine the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related traumatic event (CTE) exposure and suicidal ideation among hospital workers, and identify mediating roles of sleep disturbances in this relationship. METHODS: Workers in seven designated hospitals in Wuhan, China, were invited to participate in an online survey from May 27, 2020, to July 31, 2020. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire to evaluate demographic characteristics, level of CTE exposures, nightmare frequency, insomnia severity, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and suicidal ideation. A series of correlation analyses were performed, and a mediation model was generated to examine correlations between CTE exposure, sleep disturbances, and suicidal ideation. RESULTS: : A total of 16,220 hospital workers were included in the final analysis, 13.3% of them reported suicidal ideation in the past month. CTE exposure was significantly associated with insomnia severity, nightmare frequency, and suicidal ideation. After controlling potential confounders, nightmares but not insomnia, depression, or anxiety were shown to be independent risk factors for suicidal ideation. Pathway analyses showed that the relationship between CTE exposure and suicidal ideation was fully mediated by nightmares (proportion mediated 66.4%) after adjusting for demographic characteristics and psychological confounders. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional design precluded the investigation of causal relationships.

At the time of this study, the number of daily new cases in the United States was greater than that in any other country, and the trend was increasing in most states. Google Trends provides data regarding public interest in various topics during different periods. Analyzing these trends using data mining methods may provide useful insights and observations regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to consider the predictive ability of different search terms not directly related to COVID-19 with regard to the increase of daily cases in the United States. In particular, we are concerned with searches related to dine-in restaurants and bars. Data were obtained from the Google Trends application programming interface and the COVID-19 Tracking Project. METHODS: To test the causation of one time series on another, we used the Granger causality test. We considered the causation of two different search query trends related to dine-in restaurants and bars on daily positive cases in the US states and territories with the 10 highest and 10 lowest numbers of daily new cases of COVID-19. In addition, we used Pearson correlations to measure the linear relationships between different trends. RESULTS: Our results showed that for states and territories with higher numbers of daily cases, the historical trends in search queries related to bars and restaurants, which mainly occurred after reopening, significantly affected the number of daily new cases on average. California, for example, showed the most searches for restaurants on June 7, 2020; this affected the number of new cases within two weeks after the peak, with a P value of .004 for the Granger causality test. CONCLUSIONS: Although a limited number of search queries were considered, Google search trends for restaurants and bars showed a significant effect on daily new cases in US states and territories with higher numbers of daily new cases. We showed that these influential search trends can be used to provide additional information for prediction tasks regarding new cases in each region.

In many cases, this coronavirus leads to the development of the COVID-19 disease. Lung damage in the course of this disease often leads to acute hypoxic respiratory failure and may eventually lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Respiratory failure as a result of COVID-19 can develop very quickly and a small percent of those infected will die because of it. There is currently no treatment for COVID-19, therefore the key therapeutic intervention centers around the symptomatic treatment of respiratory failure. The main therapeutic goal is to main-tain gas exchange, mainly oxygenation, at an appropriate level and prevent the intensification of changes in the lung parenchyma. Depending on the severity of hypoxemia different techniques can be used to improve oxygenation. Medical staff dealing with COVID-19 patients should be familiar with both, methods used to treat respiratory failure and the epidemiological risks arising from their use. In some patients, conventional (passive) oxygen therapy alone is sufficient. In patients with worsening respiratory failure high flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNOT) may be effective. The continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) methods can be used to a limited extent. With further disease progression, invasive ventilation must be used and in special situations, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can also be administered.

Our drug discovery framework encompassed three methodologies and was applied to the 13 common diseases targeted by GBMI (N mean = 1,329,242). First, we evaluated the overlap enrichment between disease risk genes and the drug-target genes of the disease-relevant medication categories. An omnibus approach integrating the four gene prioritization tools yielded twice the enrichment in the disease-relevant medication categories compared with any single tool, and identified drugs with approved indications for asthma, gout, and venous thromboembolism. Second, we performed an endophenotype Mendelian randomization analysis using protein quantitative trait loci as instrumental variables. After the application of quality controls, including a colocalization analysis, significant causal relationships were estimated for 18 protein-disease pairs, including MAP2K inhibitors for heart failure. Third, we conducted an in silico screening for negative correlations between genetically determined disease case-control gene expression profiles and compound-regulated ones. Significant negative correlations were observed for 31 compound-disease pairs, including a histone deacetylase inhibitor for asthma.

In obstetrics, companionship during childbirth has been suspended and prenatal exercises, antenatal talks, hospital tours, and postnatal classes have been cancelled. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of these restrictive measures on delivery plans and risks of postpartum depression. METHODS We compared pregnancy data and the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) scores of women who delivered between the pre-alert period (1 Jan 2019 to 4 Jan 2020) and post-alert period (5 Jan 2020 to 30 Apr 2020) in a tertiary university public hospital in Hong Kong. Screening for postpartum depression was performed routinely using the EPDS questionnaire 1 day and within 1 week after delivery. RESULTS There was a 13.1% reduction in the number of deliveries between 1 January and 30 April from 1144 in 2019 to 994 in 2020. The EPDS scores were available for 4357 out of 4531 deliveries (96.2%). A significantly higher proportion of women had EPDS scores of 10 1 day after delivery in the post-alert group than the pre-alert group (14.4% vs 11.9%; P<0.05). More women used pethidine (6.2% vs 4.6%) and fewer used a birthing ball (8.5% vs 12.4%) for pain relief during labour in the post-alert group. CONCLUSIONS Pregnant women reported more depressive symptoms in the postpartum period following the alert announcement regarding coronavirus infection in Hong Kong. This was coupled with a drop in the delivery rate at our public hospital. Suspension of childbirth companionship might have altered the methods of intrapartum pain relief and the overall pregnancy experience.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 on delivery plans and postnatal depression scores of pregnant women."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: although the main manifestations of COVID-19 are respiratory, several neurological symptoms and complications have also been reported. The pandemic seems to have some epidemiological specificities in sub-Saharan Africa, and this may be reflected in the type and frequency of neurological symptoms. This study aimed to report neurological manifestations associated with symptomatic COVID-19 in a sub-Saharan African setting. METHODS: we conducted a retrospective review of symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to the Bafoussam Regional Hospital between March and September 2020. Patients files were reviewed at discharge by a consultant neurologist. Socio-demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, symptoms on admission, neurological symptoms during hospitalization, management, and in-hospital outcome were recorded. Comparisons between patients with and without neurological symptoms were performed using Fishers exact and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: we enrolled 177 symptomatic patients (68% men). Mean age was 54.6  17.8 years (range 2-99 years). Co-morbidities were present in 57.6% of patients, including hypertension (27.1%) and diabetes mellitus (25.4%). Neurological symptoms were found in 113 (63.8%) patients. The most frequent were headache (39.0%), myalgia (35.6%), anosmia (11.9%), impaired consciousness (10.7%) and delirium (5.6%). Regarding the presenting symptoms, fever was more frequent in patients with neurological symptoms than in those without (81.4% versus 50.0%, p< 0.001), while digestive symptoms were less frequent in patients with neurological symptoms (0.9% versus 9.4%, p= 0.004). CONCLUSION: neurological manifestations are frequent and heterogeneous in patients with symptomatic COVID-19.

We studied 37 asymptomatic individuals in the Wanzhou District who were diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections but without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 d and during hospitalization. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated Wanzhou People's Hospital for centralized isolation in accordance with policy1. The median duration of viral shedding in the asymptomatic group was 19 d (interquartile range (IQR), 15-26 d). The asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than the symptomatic group (log-rank P = 0.028). The virus-specific IgG levels in the asymptomatic group (median S/CO, 3.4; IQR, 1.6-10.7) were significantly lower (P = 0.005) relative to the symptomatic group (median S/CO, 20.5; IQR, 5.8-38.2) in the acute phase. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3% (28/30) and 81.1% (30/37) had reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively, during the early convalescent phase, as compared to 96.8% (30/31) and 62.2% (23/37) of symptomatic patients. Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative and 12.9% of the symptomatic group became negative for IgG in the early convalescent phase. In addition, asymptomatic individuals exhibited lower levels of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

We developed a novel SARS-CoV-2 MCDA assay and compared its speed and sensitivity to loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and rt-PCR. Two MCDA assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 N gene and ORF1ab were designed. The fastest time to detection and sensitivity of MCDA was compared to LAMP and rt-PCR using DNA standards and transcribed RNA. For the N gene, MCDA was faster than LAMP and rt-PCR by 10 and 20 min, respectively with fastest time to detection at 5.2 min. rt-PCR had the highest sensitivity with the limit of detection at 10 copies/l compared with MCDA (100 copies/l) and LAMP (500 copies/l). For ORF1ab, MCDA and LAMP had similar speed with fastest time to detection at 9.7 and 8.4 min, respectively. LAMP was more sensitive for ORF1ab detection with 50 copies/l compared to MCDA (500 copies/l). In conclusion, different nucleic acid amplification methods provide different advantages.

In this study, the color conversion of inner-leaves from green to yellow in the new wucai (Brassica campestris L.) cultivar W7-2 was detected under low temperature. The W7-2 displayed a normal green leaf phenotype at the seedling stage, but the inner leaves gradually turned yellow when the temperature was decreased to 10 C/2 C (day/night), This study facilitates us to understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying leaf color changes in response to low temperature. RESULTS: A comparative leaf transcriptome analysis of W7-2 under low temperature treatment was performed on three stages (before, during and after leaf color change) with leaves that did not change color under normal temperature at the same period as a control. A total of 67,826 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in porphyrin and Chl metabolism, carotenoids metabolism, photosynthesis, and circadian rhythm. In the porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolic pathways, the expression of several genes was reduced [i.e. magnesium chelatase subunit H (CHLH)] under low temperature. Almost all genes [i.e. phytoene synthase (PSY)] in the carotenoids (Car) biosynthesis pathway were downregulated under low temperature. The genes associated with photosynthesis [i.e. photosystem II oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1 (PsbO)] were also downregulated under LT. Our study also showed that elongated hypocotyl5 (HY5), which participates in circadian rhythm, and the metabolism of Chl and Car, is responsible for the regulation of leaf color change and cold tolerance in W7-2. CONCLUSIONS: The color of inner-leaves was changed from green to yellow under low temperature in temperature-sensitive mutant W7-2. Physiological, biochemical and transcriptomic studies showed that HY5 transcription factor and the downstream genes such as CHLH and PSY, which regulate the accumulation of different pigments, are required for the modulation of leaf color change in wucai under low temperature.","output":"Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals that chlorophyll metabolism contributes to leaf color changes in wucai (Brassica campestris L.) in response to cold"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Ebola virus (EBOV) hijacks normal physiological processes by apoptotic mimicry in order to be taken up by the cell it infects. The initial adhesion of the virus to the cell is based on the interaction between T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein, TIM, on the cell-surface and phosphatidylserine (PS) on the viral outer surface. Therefore, it is important to understand the interaction between EBOV/PS and TIM, with selective blocking of the interaction as a potential therapy. Recent experimental studies have shown that for TIM-dependent EBOV entry, a Mucin-like Domain (MLD) with a length of at least 120 amino acids is required, possibly due to the increase of area of the PS-coated surface sampled. We examine this hypothesis by modeling the process of TIM-PS adhesion using a coarse-grained molecular model. We find that the strength of bound PS?TIM pairs is essentially independent of TIM length. TIMs with longer MLDs have higher average binding strengths because of an increase in the probability of binding between EBOV and TIM proteins. Similarly, we find that for larger persistence length (less flexible) the average binding force decreases, again because of a reduction in the probability of binding. Statement of Significance This work studies the mechanism of TIM-dependent adhesion of the Ebola virus to a cell. Through coarse grained modeling we show that longer TIM stalks adhere more easily as they can sample a larger area, thus offering a mechanistic interpretation of an experimental finding. Better mechanistic understanding can lead to therapeutic ideas for blocking adhesion.","output":"Length of Mucin-Like Domains Enhance Cell-Ebola Virus Adhesion by Increasing Binding Probability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: There have been significant changes to the management of COVID-19 in recent months, including protocols and guidelines designed to prevent, diagnose, and treat the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).

This study aimed to explore the epidemiologic characteristics of and prognostic factors for COVID-19 to provide updated recommendations for its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Methods: For this retrospective study, demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data were extracted from the medical records of patients admitted to the Maternal and Child Hospital of Hubei Province (Optical Valley) with COVID-19 between February 19, 2020, and March 19, 2020. The primary outcome was the prognosis that was determined at discharge as mentioned in the medical records. Descriptive statistics, univariate analyses, and stepwise logistic regression analysis were used for data analysis. Results: Of the 1,765 patients included, 93.1% were cured and the mortality was 1.8%. Univariate analyses identified 63 factors significantly associated with COVID-19 prognosis. Logistic regression analysis revealed that a poorer prognosis was associated with undergoing resuscitation, complex disease manifestations, consultation with outside specialists, elevated basophil or lymphocyte counts, an albumin (ALB)/globulin (A/G) ratio > 2.4, and elevated levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or creatinine. Patients had a better prognosis if the following conditions were met: dry cough reported as an initial symptom, fatigue as a clinical manifestation, and a diagnosis based on laboratory testing. Conclusion: To prevent clinical deterioration, clinicians should provide special care to patients who underwent resuscitation, with a critical disease, or requiring consultation with outside specialists.

METHODS We conducted a prospective, multi-center, observational study of consecutive hospitalized adults in the NYC metropolitan area with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of new neurologic disorders (as diagnosed by a neurologist) was recorded and in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition were compared between COVID-19 patients with and without neurologic disorders. RESULTS Of 4,491 COVID-19 patients hospitalized during the study timeframe, 606 (13.5%) developed a new neurologic disorder in a median of 2 days from COVID-19 symptom onset. The most common diagnoses were: toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (6.8%), seizure (1.6%), stroke (1.9%), and hypoxic/ischemic injury (1.4%). No patient had meningitis/encephalitis, or myelopathy/myelitis referable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and 18/18 CSF specimens were RT-PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with neurologic disorders were more often older, male, white, hypertensive, diabetic, intubated, and had higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (all P<0.05). After adjusting for age, sex, SOFA-scores, intubation, past history, medical complications, medications and comfort-care-status, COVID-19 patients with neurologic disorders had increased risk of in-hospital mortality (Hazard Ratio[HR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.17-1.62, P<0.001) and decreased likelihood of discharge home (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.85, P<0.001).

An abnormal and overactivated inflammatory response is occasionally elicited by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this hyperinflammation is associated with worse prognosis of COVID-19. Theoretically, one would expect patients with asthma to be at a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection considering their increased susceptibility to common respiratory virus-associated exacerbations. Surprisingly, current data do not consistently suggest an increased prevalence of asthma among patients with COVID-19. Considering the high global prevalence of asthma, the characteristics of the disease and/or their conventional therapy might play a role in their potential defense against COVID-19. This may be attributed to the T helper type 2 immune response predominantly seen in patients with asthma. Likewise, asthma therapeutics, including corticosteroids and biologics, may in fact benefit the patients with asthma by alleviating the development of hyperinflammation.

We propose that DNA damage induced-apoptosis accelerates viral release, triggered by depletion of host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) from nuclear RNA bound to replicating viral sequences. Methods: Information theory-based analysis of interactions between RBPs and individual sequences in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Influenza A (H3N2), HIV-1, and Dengue genomes identifies strong RBP binding sites in these viral genomes. Replication and expression of viral sequences is expected to increasingly sequester RBPs - SRSF1 and RNPS1. Ordinarily, RBPs bound to nascent host transcripts prevents their annealing to complementary DNA. Their depletion induces destabilizing R-loops. Chromosomal breakage occurs when an excess of unresolved R-loops collide with incoming replication forks, overwhelming the DNA repair machinery. We estimated stoichiometry of inhibition of RBPs in host nuclear RNA by counting competing binding sites in replicating viral genomes and host RNA. Results: Host RBP binding sites are frequent and conserved among different strains of RNA viral genomes. Similar binding motifs of SRSF1 and RNPS1 explain why DNA damage resulting from SRSF1 depletion is complemented by expression of RNPS1. Clustering of strong RBP binding sites coincides with the distribution of RNA-DNA hybridization sites across the genome. SARS-CoV-2 replication is estimated to require 32.5-41.8 hours to effectively compete for binding of an equal proportion of SRSF1 binding sites in host encoded nuclear RNAs. Significant changes in expression of transcripts encoding DNA repair and apoptotic proteins were found in an analysis of influenza A and Dengue-infected cells in some individuals. Conclusions: R-loop-induced apoptosis indirectly resulting from viral replication could release significant quantities of membrane-associated virions into neighboring alveoli. These could infect adjacent pneumocytes and other tissues, rapidly compromising lung function, causing multiorgan system failure and other described symptoms.","output":"A proposed molecular mechanism for pathogenesis of severe RNA-viral pulmonary infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is often related to hyperinflammation that drives lung or multi-organ injury. The immunopathological mechanisms that cause excessive inflammation following SARS-Cov-2 infection are under investigation while different approaches to limit hyperinflammation in affected patients are being proposed. Here, a computational protein-protein interaction network approach was used on recently available data to identify possible Covid-19 inflammatory mechanisms and bioactive genes. First, network analysis of putative SARS-Cov-2 cellular receptors and their directly associated proteins, led to the mining of a robust neutrophil response signature and multiple relevant inflammatory genes. Second, analysis of RNA-seq datasets of lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-Cov-2 revealed that infected cells specifically expressed neutrophil-attracting chemokines, further supporting the likely role of neutrophils in Covid-19 inflammation. Third, analysis of RNA-seq datasets of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from Covid-19 patients, identified neutrophil-specific genes and chemokines. Different immunoregulatory and neutrophil-relevant molecules mined here such as, TNFR, IL8, CXCR1, CXCR2, ADAM10, GPR84, MME-neprilysin, ANPEP and LAP3 are druggable and might be therapeutic targets in efforts to limit SARS-Cov-2 inflammation in severe clinical cases.

These targeted monoclonal antibodies can dampen the downstream IL-6 signaling pathways, which can lead to decreased cell proliferation, differentiation, oxidative stress, exudation, and improve clinical outcomes in patients with evident features of cytokine-driven inflammation like persistent fever, dyspnea and elevated markers.

It is important to study the molecular structure of Covid-19 so as to aid in the development of therapeutic measures. Existing Covid-19 pandemic poses an extraordinary risk to health and healthcare systems worldwide. Corona viruses are made of single stranded RNA present within the coat proteins. The virus has a diameter of nearly 80C120 nm. Usually, Covid-19 presents with the signs and symptoms of respiratory illness. Cough commonly dry cough, fever, associated with myalgias and sometimes breathing difficulties due to decrease in oxygen saturation rates are also present in these patients. Some people show fever with body aches, while some are relatively asymptomatic. Corona virus is primarily transmitted in humans through respiratory route and is highly contagious. Mostly old people and those having comorbid illnesses suffer most. After invading into the human body, the virus may lead to a sequence of processes such as viral invasion, replication, and programmed cell death, that is, apoptosis. To control and prevent this viral infection, we need to study the molecular aspects of Covid-19 in detail so as to design therapeutic agents as well as for vaccine formation.

This was completed by inducing micro-RNA cleavage, breakdown, translation, inhibition, or other mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the annual costs from a societal perspective in a triple dimension of direct health care costs, direct non-health care costs (formal and informal care) and labor productivity losses in MG patients from Bulgaria, as well as to identify the main clinical and demographical cost drivers. METHODS: A bottom-up, cross-sectional, cost-of-illness analysis of 54 adult MG patients was carried out in 2020. To collect data on demographic characteristics, health resource utilization, informal care and productivity losses, questionnaires were administered to and completed by patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Median annual costs of MG in Bulgaria were 4,047 EUR per patient. Direct costs slightly outweighed indirect costs, with drugs cost item having the biggest monetary impact. Despite the zero-inflated median, hospitalizations also influenced the direct costs by an estimated amount of 1,512 EUR in the 3rd quartile. Social services and professional caregiver costs were found to be almost missing, with the vast majority of patients reporting reliance on informal caregivers. Severe generalized disease, disease crises, and recurrent infections were confirmed as statistically significant cost driving factors. There were no severe generalized MG patients in the bottom quartile of the total costs distribution. It should be noted that in both cases of crises or infections, the overall increase in the total costs was mainly due to higher indirect costs observed. Reliance on family members as informal caregivers is routine among Bulgarian MG patients. This phenomenon is likely due to the lack of access to appropriate social services. Moreover, it is directly related with higher disease burden and significant inequalities. There is a need for further research on MG in Bulgaria in order to design targeted health policies that meet the needs and expectations of these patients.","output":"Socio-Economic Burden of Myasthenia Gravis: A Cost-of-Illness Study in Bulgaria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is having an impact on how we bury and mourn our dead","output":"Mourning our dead in the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is my first column as President of AFS, and I am honored to have the chance to serve you in this capacity In these tumultuous times, I pledge to do all I can to keep our organization on track as an effective voice for our members and for aquatic conservation The coronavirus pandemic has limited our ability to meet in the face-to-face venues that AFS normally sponsors, so AFS and various Units are doing all we can to maintain open lines of communication To that end, we thank the Columbus organizing team for their yeoman?s efforts to convert the Annual Meeting to a virtual format with something for everyone","output":"What Would John Do?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has hampered all human activities, both from the economic sector, entertainment and the most impactful, namely the health sector.

RESULTS: Vitamin D is considered an important factor in immune homeostasis. Various effects have been considered for this nutrient on the immune system, particularly because of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Cytochrome P450 Family 27 Subfamily B Member 1 (CYP27B1) expression in most of the immune cells.

Larger droplets can travel further from the source before getting pulled into the sink by virtue of their larger inertia, and their maximum travelled distance is determined analytically. We investigate the effects of gravity, and we find that there are three distinct droplet behaviours categorised by their relative sizes: small, intermediate-sized, and large. Counterintuitively, we find that the droplets with minimum horizontal range are neither small nor large, but of intermediate size. Furthermore, we show that in conditions of regular human respiration, these intermediate-sized droplets range from a few $\\\\mu$m to a few hundred $\\\\mu$m. The result that such droplets have a very short range could have important implications for the interpretation of existing data on droplet dispersion.","output":"Dynamics of spherical droplets in source-sink pair flow fields"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health crisis of our time.

The growing prevalence of mobility scooters as a mode of transportation has the potential to not only affect the lives of older adults who use them but to impact urban environments at large as well as have implications for the safety of pedestrians and of other vehicle users. Goal The goal of this paper is to explore the gaps in the existing literature regarding mobility scooters, laying out key areas for future research. Results We propose three areas of research that focus on mobility scooter use by older people: (1) research involving users C impacts on older people employing mobility scooters; (2) studying the impact on urban space - public spaces and passageways used as travel routes, the barriers impeding travel and lack of appropriate parking solutions in the urban environment; and (3) issues of safety - mobility scooter driving and travel regulations and infrastructure design regulations.

The formation of M/S complexes under these conditions indicates that M and S can interact independently of other coronaviral factors. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that M and S associate in a pre-Golgi compartment. M/S complexes are efficiently transported beyond the coronavirus budding compartment to the Golgi complex. The failure to detect complexes at the surface of coexpressing cells demonstrated that they are retained intracellularly. Thus, coexpression of the envelope glycoproteins drastically affects the intracellular transport of the S protein: instead of being transported to the cell surface, S is retained intracellularly by its association with M.","output":"Coexpression and association of the spike protein and the membrane protein of mouse hepatitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Positive-strand RNA viruses universally remodel host intracellular membranes to form membrane-bound viral replication complexes, where viral offspring RNAs are synthesized. In the majority of cases, viral replication proteins are targeted to and play critical roles in the modulation of the designated organelle membranes. Many viral replication proteins do not have transmembrane domains, but contain single or multiple amphipathic alpha-helices. It has been conventionally recognized that these helices serve as an anchor for viral replication protein to be associated with membranes. We report here that a peptide representing the amphipathic -helix at the N-terminus of the poliovirus 2C protein not only binds to liposomes, but also remodels spherical liposomes into tubules. The membrane remodeling ability of this amphipathic alpha-helix is similar to that recognized in other amphipathic alpha-helices from cellular proteins involved in membrane remodeling, such as BAR domain proteins. Mutations affecting the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic alpha-helix severely compromised membrane remodeling of vesicles with physiologically relevant phospholipid composition. These mutations also affected the ability of poliovirus to form plaques indicative of reduced viral replication, further underscoring the importance of membrane remodeling by the amphipathic alpha-helix in possible relation to the formation of viral replication complexes.","output":"An Amphipathic Alpha-Helix Domain from Poliovirus 2C Protein Tubulate Lipid Vesicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We rely on the ESG ratings assigned by four distinct agencies (MSCI, Refinitiv, Robeco, and Sustainalytics) to study the link between ESG scores and firms cost of debt financing during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aimed to describe the epidemiological aspects of mucormycosis cases presenting to a tertiary care centre of Western Rajasthan, India, as well as to identify potential risk factors for Mucormycosis. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study included 55 patients admitted with a diagnosis of mucormycosis between May and June, 2021, covering the second wave's post-COVID-19 period. Data was collected using a pre-designed, semi-structured questionnaire and hospital case sheets. Results: The mean age of the patients was 54.412.53 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.89:1. Of the patients, 49% were obese and had no prior history of diabetes. Most COVID-19 patients (54.6%) were treated at home and did not require oxygen support during their COVID-19 course. The majority (89%) were on steroid medication, which was mainly intravenous (93.8%) and lasted 5-10 days in most patients. Rhinoorbitocerebral mucormycosis was the most common type seen in this setting, with symptoms appearing 15-30 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. During the fungal infection, about 61.8% of patients had random blood sugar readings of more than 140 mg/dl. Mortality occurred in 14.5% of patients with mucormycosis. Mortality was observed to be associated with high BMI, raised glycated haemoglobin (HBA1C), and urban residency. Conclusion: Mucormycosis appears to be caused by impaired glycemic control due to pre-existing or new-onset diabetes, which may be exacerbated by unintentional glucocorticoid use. It is necessary to use steroids with caution and maintain care for at least 15-30 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms.","output":"Epidemiology of Mucormycosis Cases During the Second Wave of COVID-19 in a Tertiary Care Institute in Western Rajasthan, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The appearance of the virus SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019 and its spreading all over the world has caused global panic and increase of personal protection equipment usage to protect people against infection.

Evidence of a reduction in dengue case incidence following field releases of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti has been reported previously from a cluster randomised controlled trial in Indonesia, and quasi-experimental studies in Indonesia and northern Australia. Methods: Following a period of intensive community engagement, deployments of adult wMel-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were conducted in Niteroi, Brazil during 2017 - 2019. Deployments were phased across four release zones, with a total area of 83 km2 and a residential population of approximately 373,000. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of wMel deployments in reducing dengue and chikungunya incidence. An untreated control zone was pre-defined, which was comparable to the intervention area in historical dengue trends. The wMel intervention effect was estimated by controlled interrupted time series analysis of monthly dengue and chikungunya case notifications to the public health surveillance system before, during and after releases, from release zones and the control zone. Results: Three years after commencement of releases, wMel introgression into local Ae. aegypti populations was heterogeneous throughout Niteroi, reaching a high prevalence (>80%) in the earliest release zone, and more moderate levels (prevalence 40 -70%) elsewhere. Despite this spatial heterogeneity in entomological outcomes, the wMel intervention was associated with a 69% reduction in dengue incidence (95% confidence interval 54%, 80%) and a 60% reduction in chikungunya incidence (95%CI 21%, 80%), in the aggregate release area compared with the pre-defined control area. This significant intervention effect on dengue was replicated across all four release zones, and in three of four zones for chikungunya. Conclusions: We demonstrate that wMel Wolbachia can be successfully introgressed into Ae. aegypti populations in a large and complex urban setting, and that a significant public health benefit from reduced incidence of dengue and chikungunya accrues even where the prevalence of wMel in local mosquito populations is moderate and spatially heterogeneous. These findings are consistent with the results of randomised and non-randomised field trials in Indonesia and northern Australia, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Wolbachia biocontrol method as a multivalent intervention against both dengue and chikungunya.","output":"Effectiveness of Wolbachia-infected mosquito deployments in reducing the incidence of dengue and chikungunya in Niteroi, Brazil: a quasi-experimental study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is the most discussed subject in medical researches worldwide.

Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. METHOD: Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. RESULTS: As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. CONCLUSION: In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.","output":"Immuno-psychiatrie et pandmie de SARS-CoV-2 : liens et possibles consquences./ [Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Links and possible consequences]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penyakit Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) telah menyebar ke seluruh dunia dan perawat berisiko tinggi tertular hingga mengalami kematian akibat virus tersebut yang mengakibatkan sekitar 55 perawat di Indonesia meninggal dunia.

METHODS An online survey was completed by 1500 men and women, aged 60 or above, from the general community in Japan. When responding to questions regarding motivation for participating in dementia prevention activities and providing support to people with dementia, respondents were randomly assigned different incentive conditions. Two incentive options were used for dementia prevention activities (no incentives, and a small number of reward points). Three incentive options were used for support activities (no incentives, a small cash reward, or an in-kind time reward that allowed respondents or their family members to use similar services at a later time (time credits)). RESULTS Financial incentives decreased motivation for participating in dementia prevention activities, while time credits significantly increased motivation to participate in providing support to people with dementia for going out of their home, when receiving a cash reward was compared with receiving no reward. No significant differences by incentive were found for participating in daily living support for those with dementia or for providing support at a dementia caf where people with dementia and their families interact. CONCLUSIONS The adverse influence of financial incentives on motivation to participate in dementia prevention suggested that financial incentives may reduce intrinsic motivation for dementia prevention activities. The positive effects of time credits in providing support to people with dementia in going out suggested that time credits might be effective for some support activities for people with dementia.

The parameters MRI T stage (subjective evaluation), thickness, maximum area and volume of the lesions were evaluated by two radiologists. Specific indicators including AUC, optimal cutoff, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI T stage, thickness, maximum area and volume for differentiating T1a-T1b from T2 stage lesions were calculated. The ROC curves were compared by the Delong test. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical benefit. RESULTS: The ROC curves for thickness (AUC = 0.926), maximum area (AUC = 0.902) and volume (AUC = 0.897) were all significantly better than those of the MRI T stage (AUC = 0.807) in differentiating T1a-T1b from T2 lesions, with p values of 0.004, 0.034 and 0.041, respectively. The values corresponding to the thickness (including AUC, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV, PLR and NLR) were all higher than those corresponding to the MRI T stage, maximum area and volume.

Although thrombotic complications may be ascribed to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in endothelial cells, it has been poorly investigated whether, in the complexity of viral infection in the human host, specific viral elements alone can induce endothelial damage. Detection of circulating spike protein in the sera of severe COVID-19 patients was evaluated by ELISA. In vitro experiments were performed on human microvascular endothelial cells from the derma and lung exposed to SARS-CoV-2-derived spike protein 1 (S1). The expression of adhesive molecules was studied by immunofluorescence and leukocyte adhesion and platelet aggregation were assessed under flow conditions. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and AMPK expression were investigated by Western Blot analysis. In addition, S1-treated endothelial cells were incubated with anti-ACE2 blocking antibody, AMPK agonist, or complement inhibitors. Our results show that significant levels of spike protein were found in the 30.4% of severe COVID-19 patients. In vitro, the activation of endothelial cells with S1 protein, via ACE2, impaired AMPK signalling, leading to robust leukocyte recruitment due to increased adhesive molecule expression and thrombomodulin loss. This S1-induced pro-inflammatory phenotype led to exuberant C3 and C5b-9 deposition on endothelial cells, along with C3a and C5a generation that further amplified S1-induced complement activation. Functional blockade of ACE2 or complement inhibition halted S1-induced platelet aggregates by limiting von Willebrand factor and P-selectin exocytosis and expression on endothelial cells. Overall, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-derived S1 is sufficient in itself to propagate inflammatory and thrombogenic processes in the microvasculature, amplified by the complement system, recapitulating the thromboembolic complications of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein 1 Activates Microvascular Endothelial Cells and Complement System Leading to Platelet Aggregation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that can enter its hosts through the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor ACE2 is mainly expressed in cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophageal epithelium and enterocytes from the ileum-colon Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has varying clinical symptoms and presents differently in individuals, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to moderate clinical spectrum with mild pneumonia clinical features, and to a severe clinical presentation with dyspnea and hypoxia, leading to death due to respiratory or multi-organ failure COVID-19 infection can also manifest themselves in the form of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain Severe complications of gastrointestinal COVID-19 infections include hemorrhage or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract and severe inflammation, which can adversely affect the intestinal immune system, and therefore the systemic immune system of the host Furthermore, COVID-19 has also shown to affect microbiota homeostasis in the digestive tract To date, no clear explanation is available regarding the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection, fecal RNA detection, and the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 This review aims to discuss the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the digestive tract, microbiota, and lung, and the possibility of fecal-oral transmission in COVID-19","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the Gut: A Review of the Manifestations, Pathology, Management, and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is difficult to distinguish subtle differences shown in computed tomography (CT) images of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and bacterial pneumonia patients, which often leads to an inaccurate diagnosis. It is desirable to design and evaluate interpretable feature extraction techniques to describe the patient's condition. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 170 confirmed patients with COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia acquired at Yeungnam University Hospital in Daegu, Korea. The Lung and lesion regions were segmented to crop the lesion into 2D patches to train a classifier model that could differentiate between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The K-means algorithm was used to cluster deep features extracted by the trained model into 20 groups. Each lesion patch cluster was described by a characteristic imaging term for comparison. For each CT image containing multiple lesions, a histogram of lesion types was constructed using the cluster information. Finally, a Support Vector Machine classifier was trained with the histogram and radiomics features to distinguish diseases and severity. RESULTS: The 20 clusters constructed from 170 patients were reviewed based on common radiographic appearance types. Two clusters showed typical findings of COVID-19, with two other clusters showing typical findings related to bacterial pneumonia. Notably, there is one cluster that showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the central and peripheral lungs and was considered to be a key factor for severity classification. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 91.2% for classifying COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia patients with 95% reported for severity classification. The CT quantitative parameters represented by the values of cluster 8 were correlated with existing laboratory data and clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: Deep chest CT analysis with constructed lesion clusters revealed well-known COVID-19 CT manifestations comparable to manual CT analysis. The constructed histogram features improved accuracy for both diseases and severity classification, and showed correlations with laboratory data and clinical parameters. The constructed histogram features can provide guidance for improved analysis and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Quantitative Assessment of Chest CT Patterns in COVID-19 and Bacterial Pneumonia Patients: a Deep Learning Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Critical care nursing is at the epicentre of the COVID-19 global pandemic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Emergency Nurse is the property of RNCi and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"NHS services are running on goodwill and teamwork: The coronavirus pandemic proves that better staff retention across health and social care is critical"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations in the ADCY5 gene can cause a complex hyperkinetic movement disorder.

PURPOSE: To compare the performance of density histograms (mean lung attenuation, skewness, and kurtosis) and visual scores, along with lung function correlations, in IPF patients submitted to incremental or volumetric thorax HRCT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical data and CT scans of 89 newly diagnosed and therapy-naive IPF patients were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-six incremental and 43 volumetric CT scans were reviewed. No differences of density histograms and visual scores estimates were found by comparing two HRCT techniques, with an optimal inter-operator agreement (concordance correlation coefficient >0.90 in all instances). Single-breath diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO(sb)) was inversely related with the Best score (r = ?00.416; p = 0.014), the Kazerooni fibrosis extent (r = ?0.481; p = 0.004) and the mean lung attenuation (r = ?0.382; p = 0.026), while a positive correlation was observed with skewness (r = 0.583; p = 0.001) and kurtosis (r = 0.543; p = 0.001) in the incremental HRCT sub-group. Similarly, in the volumetric CT sub-cohort, DLCO(sb) was significantly associated with skewness (r = 0.581; p = 0.007) and kurtosis (r = 0.549; p = 0.018). Correlations with visual scores were not confirmed. Forced vital capacity significantly related to all density indices independently on HRCT technique.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiviral activity of photodynamic therapy (PDT) against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. METHODS: Vero E6 cells and SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Russia were used for PDT with methylene blue (MB) and Radahlorin. A continuous laser with wavelength &#955; = 662 nm in doses of 16 J/cm2 and 40 J/cm2 laser irradiation was used for PDT of a viral suspension and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. The direct cytopathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated via light microscopy to calculate the TCID50 in the samples and perform statistical analysis. RESULTS: Viral suspensions of SARS-CoV-2 that had a TCID50 greater than 103 were inactivated by PDT in the presence of MB and Radahlorin. Vero E6 cells were protected from 104 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 by PDT post infection. The range of protective concentrations was 1.0-10.0 g/ml and 0.5-5.0 g/ml for MB and Radahlorin, respectively. Additionally, it was found that MB and Radahlorin also possess significant antiviral activity even without PDT. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) against 102 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 0.22 and 0.33 g/ml with the addition of MB and Radahlorin, respectively, to cells concomitantly with virus, whereas in the case of applying the photosensitizers at 3.5 hours post infection, the IC50 was 0.6 and 2.0 g/ml for MB and Radahlorin, respectively.

The ED plays an important part in detecting an increasing number of new contagious diseases, which could potentially lead to an epidemic or pandemic.During a pandemic, the ED's main task is to detect infected individuals. These patients then need to be isolated and an adequate treatment is required. The ED must be prepared in order to perform well in such a situation. One major part for readiness is communication in an open manner to all partners within the department, as well as with emergency medical services and other departments of the hospital.The ED must be restructured to withstand the rising number of infected patients. These patients must be separated from other critically ill patients. Strategies for a diagnostic workup depending on the kind of infection have to be put in place. Pathways for the outpatient and inpatient management must be defined to avoid overcrowding in the ED. Depending on the number of patients, escalation and de-escalation strategies have to be set up within the hospital.Over the whole course of the pandemic, all staff members are the key resources for the ED and the entire hospital. The ED can only cope with a pandemic situation if staff are working together as a whole. This implies several important steps to get the staff prepared: Recurring, open conversations about fears, problems, and successes are critical for staff morale.

Subsequently, composting facilities are associated with high levels of A. fumigatus spores that are aerosolised from compost and cause respiratory illness in workers. In the UK, gardening is an activity enjoyed by individuals of all ages and it is likely that they are being exposed to A. fumigatus spores when handling commercial compost or compost they have produced themselves. In this study, 246 citizen scientists collected 509 soil samples from locations in their garden in the UK, from which were cultured 5,174 A. fumigatus isolates. Of these isolates, 736 (14%) were resistant to tebuconazole: the third most-sprayed triazole fungicide in the UK, which confers cross-resistance to the medical triazoles used to treat A. fumigatus lung infections in humans. These isolates were found to contain the common resistance mechanisms in the A. fumigatus cyp51A gene TR34/L98H or TR46/Y121F/T289A, and less common resistance mechanisms TR34, TR53, TR46/Y121F/T289A/S363P/I364V/G448S and (TR46)2/Y121F/M172I/T289A/G448S. Regression analyses found that soil samples containing compost were significantly more likely to grow susceptible and tebuconazole-resistant A. fumigatus than those that did not, and that compost samples grew significantly higher numbers of A. fumigatus than other samples. Importance These findings highlight compost as a potential health hazard to individuals with pre-disposing factors to A. fumigatus lung infections, and a potential health hazard to immunocompetent individuals who could be exposed to sufficiently high numbers of spores to develop infection. This raises the question of whether compost bags should carry additional health warnings regarding inhalation of A. fumigatus spores, whether individuals should be advised to wear facemasks whilst handling compost or whether commercial producers should be responsible for sterilising compost before shipping. The findings support increasing public awareness of the hazard posed by compost and investigating measures that can be taken to reduce the exposure risk.","output":"Citizen-science surveillance of triazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus in UK residential garden soils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose There is high-level evidence for addition of androgen deprivation therapy to photon-based radiotherapy of the prostate in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.

Methods A thorough search in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were conducted, searching for relevant studies. Clinical studies on prostate cancer and the treatment combination of particle therapy and androgen deprivation therapy were included. The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021230801).

SARS-CoV-2 spreads by air with a transmission rate of up to 15%, but the probability of its maternalCfetal transmission through the placenta is reported to be low at around 3.28%. However, it is still unclear that which tissues and developmental periods hold higher risks and what the underlying molecular mechanisms are. We conducted an integrated analysis of large-scale transcriptome and single-cell sequencing data to investigate the key factors that affect SARS-CoV-2 maternalCfetal transmission as well as the characteristics and effects of them. Our results showed that the abundance of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection-associated factors in the placenta were higher than their primarily infected tissues, while the expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) were similar between lung and placenta. By contrast, an important SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated factor, type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), was poorly expressed in placenta. Further scRNA-Seq analysis revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were co-expressed in very few trophoblastic cells. Interestingly, during the embryonic development stages, the abundance of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was much higher in multiple embryonic tissues than in the placenta. Based on our present analysis, the intestine in 20th week of embryonic development was at a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we found that during the fetal development, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were enriched in pathogen infection-associated pathways and may involve in the biological processes related to T-cell activation. In conclusion, our present study suggests that though the placenta provides a good physical barrier against SARS-CoV-2 infection for healthy fetal development, multiple embryonic tissues are under risks of the virus infection, which may be adversely affected once infected prenatally. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance maternal care to prevent the potential impact and harm of SARS-CoV-2 maternalCfetal transmission.","output":"Integrated Analysis Reveals the Characteristics and Effects of SARS-CoV-2 MaternalCFetal Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) often coexist.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 103 patients [64 years, 69% men, 79% persistent AF, LVEF 33% interquartile range (IQR) (25-38)] undergoing first time AF ablation were investigated. Identification of LA fibrosis and selection of ablation strategy were based on sinus rhythm voltage mapping. Continuous rhythm monitoring was used to assess ablation success. Improvement in post-ablation LVEF was measured as primary study endpoint. An absolute increase in post-ablation LVEF &#8805;10% was defined as 'Super Response'. Left atrial fibrosis was present in 38% of patients. After ablation LVEF increased by absolute 15% (IQR 6-25) (P < 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction improvement was higher in patients without LA fibrosis [15% (IQR 10-25) vs. 10% (IQR 0-20), P < 0.001]. An inverse correlation between LVEF improvement and the extent of LA fibrosis was found (R2 = 0.931).

We demonstrate here that isolated, ex vivo cultured human hair follicles exposed to these treatments display similar ectopic pigmentation within the bulge area which is accompanied by induction of differentiated melanocytic markers.

Public health authorities are developing vaccination programmes with priorities that minimize the risk of mortality and severe events in individuals and communities. We propose an evidence-based strategy that targets the frailest subjects whose timely vaccination is likely to minimize future deaths and preserve the resilience of the health service by preventing infections. Methods: The cohort includes 146,087 cases with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Milan (3.49 million inhabitants). Individual level data on 42 chronic diseases and vital status updated as of January 21, 2021, were available in administrative data collected during the pandemic. Analyses were performed in three sub-cohorts of age (16-64, 65-79 and 80+ years) and comorbidities affecting mortality were selected by means of LASSO cross-validated conditional logistic regression. Simplified models based on previous results identified high-risk categories worth targeting with highest priority. Results adjusted by age and gender, were reported in terms of odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Findings: The final models include as predictors of mortality (7,667 deaths, 5.2%) 10, 12, and 5 chronic diseases, respectively. The older age categories shared, as risk factors, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases. In the younger age category, predictors included neoplasm, organ transplantation and psychiatric conditions. Results were consistent with those obtained on mortality at 60 days from diagnosis (6,968 deaths). Interpretation: This approach defines a two-level stratification for priorities in the vaccination that can easily be applied by health authorities, eventually adapted to local results in terms of number and types of comorbidities, and rapidly updated with current data. After the early phase of vaccination, data on effectiveness and safety will give the opportunity to revise prioritization and discuss the future approach in the remaining population.

During hospitalization, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol(TC), HDL-C and Apo-AI were shown an increasing trend in survivors, but maintained lower levels or shown downward trend in non-survivors. The serum levels of HDL-C and Apo-AI were inversely correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP), length of hospital stay of survivors and disease severity. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified a CRP/ HDL-C ratio cut-off value of 62.54 as the predictor for in-hospital mortality (AUC=0.823, Sensitivity=83.3%, Specificity=70.8%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that hypertension, neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio(NLR), platelet count and high CRP/ HDL-C ratio (>62.54) were independent factors to predict in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: : The results demonstrated that dyslipidemia was associated with the inflammatory response, disease severity and poor prognosis of COVID-19. High CRP/ HDL-C ratio may serve as an independently potential predictor for hospital mortality among patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"Changes in lipid metabolism in patients with severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Biodiesel produced from renewable energy sources has gained significant attention in the arena of fuel diversification from fossil sources However, the conventional treatment to separate biodiesel from glycerol produces large volumes of wastewater, causing environmental concerns The present study aims to assess ceramic membrane technology for improving biodiesel separation and purification, and overcome the traditional process constraints RESULTS: Biodiesel was obtained by ethylic transesterification of crude, degummed and refined soybean oil The tangential ultrafiltration (-Al2O3/TiO2) performance in separating and purifying the produced biodiesel was evaluated based on the glycerol retention capacity and on the permeate flux values The separation was improved by use of acidified water [0 5% and 1% (m/m)] which promoted the demulsification of the reaction final mixture In the proposed system, the glycerol was retained, and the biodiesel was the continuous phase Higher free fatty acid content in the crude and degummed soybean oil, not only favoured the glycerol transfer over the aqueous phase, which was retained by the membrane, but also resulted in the lowest flux decline rates An increase in the oil acidity reduced the consumption of acidified water As the pore diameter (0 05 m and 20 kDa) and the transmembrane pressure (1 and 2 bar) decreased, the glycerol retention increased allowing the system to fulfill commercialization requirements CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the novel ultrafiltration process is efficient in separating biodiesel from glycerol and reducing wastewater generation when compared with the conventional process ? 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","output":"Soybean biodiesel purification through an acid-system membrane technology: effect of oil quality and separation process parameters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is a neuro-ophthalmic condition characterized by bilateral degeneration of the optic nerves. Although heterozygous mutations in OPA1 represent the most common genetic cause of ADOA, a significant number of cases remain undiagnosed.Here, we describe a family with a strong ADOA history with most family members spanning three generation having childhood onset of visual symptoms. The proband, in addition to optic atrophy, had neurological symptoms consistent with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Clinical exome analysis detected a novel mutation in the AFG3L2 gene (NM_006796.2:c.1010G > A; p.G337E), which segregated with optic atrophy in family members. AFG3L2 is a metalloprotease of the AAA subfamily which exerts quality control in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Interestingly, the identified mutation localizes close to the AAA domain of AFG3L2, while those localized in the proteolytic domain cause dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) or recessive spastic ataxia with epilepsy (SPAX5). Functional studies in patient fibroblasts demonstrate that the p.G337E AFG3L2 mutation strongly destabilizes the long isoforms of OPA1 via OMA hyper-activation and leads to mitochondrial fragmentation, thus explaining the family phenotype.

The current study aimed to compare the neutralizing antibody inhibition levels between COVID-Convalescent plasma from apheresis donors who had symptomatic COVID-19 history and asymptomatic blood donors, i.e., whole blood donors without prior any COVID-19 positive diagnosis nor symptoms/contact history related to COVID-19. METHODS: Observational study conducted at the Blood Centre, Tertiary Care Hospital, South India on blood donor samples during the period JulyCDecember 2020. A total of 90 samples (43 convalescent plasma donors and 47 whole blood donors) were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG and Neutralising antibodies. RESULTS: No significant difference in neutralization capacity was observed between these symptomatic vs. asymptomatic donors. Also, inhibition % appeared similar in the two groups with respect to age, gender, blood group, donation status, or type of donation without any statistical significance. On analyzing the correlation between the SARS-CoV-2-IgG levels and neutralizing antibodies among the WBD and CCP, both the groups showed a positive correlation, while neutralizing antibodies showed a significant correlation with SARS-CoV-2-IgG levels among the whole blood donors (Pearson correlation P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: No significant difference in neutralizing antibody capacity was observed in asymptomatic whole blood donors and convalescent plasma donors. Therefore, donors having adequate levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody levels on screening can be considered for convalescent plasma donation irrespective of prior COVID-19 diagnosis or COVID-related symptoms.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity among blood donors without prior COVID-19 symptomatic history vs. blood donors with prior COVID-19 symptomatic history: A comparative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initially described as an interferon (IFN)é\\\\inducing factor, interleukin (IL)\\\\18 is indeed involved in Th1 and NK cell activation, but also in Th2, IL\\\\17\\\\producing æ T cells and macrophage activation.

Triage during the Covid-19 pandemic can impose difficult allocation decisions when demand for mechanical ventilation or intensive care beds greatly exceeds available resources. Triage criteria should be objective, ethical, transparent, applied equitably and publically disclosed. The aim of this review is to describe the triage tools and process for critical care resources in a pandemic health emergency. METHODS. A narrative review was conducted of the literature on five electronic databases, namely PubMed, CINHAL, Web of Science, Cochrane and Embase, searching for studies published from January 2006 to July 2020. RESULTS. The results describe different triage tools. A gold standard of triage does not exist for the adult or paediatric population. Using probability of short-term survival as the sole allocation principle is problematic. In general, each triage protocol should be applied with a specific ethical justification, including transparency, duty to care, duty to steward resources, duty to plan, and distributive justice. CONCLUSIONS. Clinical triage decisions based on clinical judgment alone are prone to inconsistent application by triage officers in a pandemic. An ethical framework can inform decision-making and improve accountability. It remains difficult to connect clinical criteria and ethical criteria, because of the models on offer for health services.

In addition, a seroprevalence survey showed that 45% of the adult population have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Verbal autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 as the most likely cause of death in 29 cases. The mean age of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases was 76.9  12.1 years, while that of those dying from unrelated causes was 60.3  20.4 years (p = 0.003).

We present characteristics, interventions and longer-term outcomes of the entire, unselected cohort of all ICU patients with COVID-19 in Denmark where the ICU capacity was not exceeded. METHODS We identified all patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to any Danish ICU from March 10th to May 19th 2020 and registered demographics, chronic comorbidities, use of organ support, length of stay and vital status from patient files. Risk factors for death were analyzed by adjusted Cox regression analysis. RESULTS There were 323 ICU patients with confirmed COVID-19. Median age was 68 years, 74% were men, 50% had hypertension, 21% diabetes, and 20% chronic pulmonary disease; 29% had no chronic comorbidity. Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 82%, vasopressors in 83%, renal replacement therapy in 26% and ECMO in 8%. ICU stay was median 13 days (IQR 6-22) and hospital stay 19 days (11-30).

Through GRF, we estimated the non-linear relationships between the COVID-19 death rate and 29 socioeconomic and health-related factors during the first year of the pandemic in the USA (county level). GRF outputs are compared to global (Random Forest and OLS) and local (Geographically Weighted Regression) models.

Literature is beginning to suggest that these behaviours may be conducted automatically, although the instigation (deciding to do) and execution ('doing') of these behaviours has never been examined separately. The objective of this study was to test a theoretically informed supposition that oral hygiene behaviours in adults are automatic behaviours. METHODS: One hundred and fifty participants attending three types of dental providers covering emergency and routine dental services, completed a questionnaire. The self-reported behavioural automaticity index scale (SRBAI) was used to measure behavioural automaticity. RESULTS: Morning toothbrushing SRBAI scores were higher than evening scores (Z=-3.315, p = 0.001). Automaticity scores for instigating both toothbrushing and interdental cleaning were also higher compared to execution (toothbrushing: Z=-2.601, p = 0.009 and interdental cleaning: Z=-2.256. p = 0.024). Toothbrushing automaticity scores were associated with age, gender and self-efficacy, whereas interdental cleaning automaticity scores were associated with intention. Individuals in lower socio-economic status (SES) occupations had significantly higher automaticity scores for interdental cleaning compared to those with higher SES roles.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: From March 1, 2021 to March 20, 2021, this prospective cohort study included 816 CP afferent to our institution and eligible for the vaccination. A cohort of 274 health care workers (HCW) was used as age- and sex-matched control group. BNT162b2 was administered as a two-dose regimen given 21 days apart. Blood samples to analyze anti-Spike (S) IgG antibodies (Ab) were collected prevaccination [timepoint (TP) 0], and at 3 weeks (TP1) and 7 weeks (TP2) after the first dose. RESULTS: Patients characteristics: median age 62 (range, 21-97); breast/lung cancer/others (31/21/48%); active treatment/follow-up (90/10%). In the whole CP cohort, the serologic response rate (RR) and the titre of anti-S IgG significantly increased across the TPs; at TP2, the responders (IgG >15 AU/mL) were 94.2%. Active chemotherapy and chronic use of steroids were independent predictors of lower RR. Adverse events (AE) after the booster predicted higher likelihood of response (OR, 4.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-9.99; P = 0.003). Comparing the matched cohorts, the responders were significantly lower in CP than in HCW at TP1 (61.2% vs. 93.2%) and TP2 (93.3% vs. 100%), while the geometric mean concentration of IgG did not significantly differ at TP2 being significantly lower in CP (23.3) than in HCW (52.1) at TP1.

However, the existing PHS systems feeding on social media data have not been widely deployed in national surveillance systems, which appears to stem from the lack of practitioners and the publics trust in social media data. More robust and reliable data sets over which supervised ML models can be trained and tested reliably is a significant step toward overcoming this hurdle. The health implications of daily behaviors (physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep [PASS]), as an evergreen topic in PHS, are widely studied through traditional data sources such as surveillance surveys and administrative databases, which are often several months out-of-date by the time they are used, costly to collect, and thus limited in quantity and coverage. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to present a large-scale, multicountry, longitudinal, and fully labeled data set to enable and support digital PASS surveillance research in PHS. To support high-quality surveillance research using our data set, we have conducted further analysis on the data set to supplement it with additional PHS-related metadata. METHODS: We collected the data of this study from Twitter using the Twitter livestream application programming interface between November 28, 2018, and June 19, 2020. To obtain PASS-related tweets for manual annotation, we iteratively used regular expressions, unsupervised natural language processing, domain-specific ontologies, and linguistic analysis. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk to label the collected data to self-reported PASS categories and implemented a quality control pipeline to monitor and manage the validity of crowd-generated labels. Moreover, we used ML, latent semantic analysis, linguistic analysis, and label inference analysis to validate the different components of the data set. RESULTS: LPHEADA (Labelled Digital Public Health Dataset) contains 366,405 crowd-generated labels (3 labels per tweet) for 122,135 PASS-related tweets that originated in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, or the United States, labeled by 708 unique annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In addition to crowd-generated labels, LPHEADA provides details about the three critical components of any PHS system: place, time, and demographics (ie, gender and age range) associated with each tweet. CONCLUSIONS: Publicly available data sets for digital PASS surveillance are usually isolated and only provide labels for small subsets of the data. We believe that the novelty and comprehensiveness of the data set provided in this study will help develop, evaluate, and deploy digital PASS surveillance systems.

We used Facebook Messenger Room (FBMR), the preferred platform of participants. Despite some success, we generally encountered considerable challenges in terms of recruiting, retaining and moderating remote FGDs, particularly among caretakers of small children. Finding a quiet, private place proved unfeasible for many participants, who were juggling family demands in tight, locked down quarters.

The questionnaire was distributed using a social media platform for dental professionals in oral health care from all over the Netherlands. RESULTS 83.4% of 90 dental hygienists had paid attention to the patient's breath but only 37.8% of dental hygienists always informed the patient.

We assessed the impact of social distancing caused by this extreme weather event on the transmission of respiratory viruses. METHODS: Residual specimens from patients evaluated for acute respiratory illness at hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses. Transmission models were fit to each virus to estimate the magnitude reduction in transmission due to weather-related disruptions. Changes in contact rates and care-seeking were informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital visits. RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16 to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3 to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in an early epidemic phase. CONCLUSION: High-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak.

Dexmedetomidine also has been shown to prolong the sensory and motor duration when added as an adjuvant to local anaesthetic in nerve blocks. Objective To assess the effect of adding dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine in brachial block. Method Sixty patients, planned for upper limb surgeries under ultrasound guided brachial block were randomly allocated into two groups. Group RS (n=30) received 30 ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine + 1 ml Normal Saline and Group RD (n=30) received 30 ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine + 0.75 mcg/kg Dexmedetomidine diluted to 1 ml solution. The onset time to sensory and motor blockade were recorded. The duration of sensory and motor block and duration of analgesia were recorded. Result The mean time to onset of sensory block (12.602.67 min Vs 22.172.81 min) and motor block (14.203.22 min Vs 22.533.97) in Group RD was significantly faster in Group RD than Group RS.

This scoring system has been designed to obtain predicted postoperative mortality rates before surgery and this study was performed to assess its usefulness in elective surgery for gastric carcinoma. METHODS We investigated seven variables for mE-PASS and evaluated the postoperative course in 3,449 patients who underwent elective surgery for gastric carcinoma in Japan between August 20, 1987 and April 9, 2007, in order to quantify the predicted in-hospital mortality rates (R). The calibration and discrimination power of R were assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), respectively. The ratios of observed-to-estimated mortality rates (OE ratios) were quantified as a measure of quality. RESULTS The overall postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 19.0 and 2.0%, respectively. R demonstrated good power in calibration ((2) value, 12.5; df 8; P = 0.89) as well as discrimination (AUC, 95% confidence intervals: 0.80, 0.75-0.85). The OE ratios between hospitals ranged from 0.44 to 1.8. Overall, the OE ratios seemed to improve with time (OE ratio, 95% confidence intervals: 1.3, 0.73-2.4 for the early period between 1987 and 2000; 1.0, 0.59-1.7 for the middle period between 2001 and 2004; and 0.65, 0.36-1.2 for the late period between 2005 and 2007).

Any resident with symptoms consistent with ARI had a nasal swab specimen collected for RIDT by staff. Following RIDT, the residual swab was placed into viral transport medium and tested for influenza using Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and for 20 pathogens using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction respiratory pathogen panel. Numbers of viruses in each of 7 categories (influenza A, influenza B, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) across the 3 years were compared using (2). Totals of 160, 215, and 122 specimens were collected during 2016?2017, 2017?2018, and 2018?2019, respectively. Respiratory pathogen panel identified viruses in 54.8% of tested specimens. Influenza A (19.2%), influenza B (12.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%), and human metapneumovirus (20.9%) accounted for 69% of all detections, whereas coronaviruses (17.2%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (10.5%) and parainfluenza (3.8%) were less common. The distribution of viruses varied significantly across the 3 years ((2) = 71.663; df = 12; P < .001).

In humans, this fulminant infection is characterized by lung capillary leakage, respiratory failure, and cardiogenic shock. Individuals with HLA-B*3501 have an increased risk of developing severe HPS, suggesting that CD8(+) T cell responses to SNV contribute to pathogenesis. We identified three CD8(+) T cell epitopes in SNV presented by HLA-B*3501 and quantitated circulating SNV-specific CD8(+) T cells in 11 acute HPS patients using HLA/peptide tetramers. We found significantly higher frequencies of SNV-specific T cells in patients with severe HPS requiring mechanical ventilation (up to 44.2% of CD8(+) T cells) than in moderately ill HPS patients hospitalized but not requiring mechanical ventilation (up to 9.8% of CD8(+) T cells). These results imply that virus-specific CD8(+) T cells contribute to HPS disease outcome. Intense CD8(+) T cell responses to SNV may be induced by the encounter of the unnatural human host to this zoonotic virus without coevolution.

Sialic acids are often involved in interaction between the cells and the infectious agents by regulating the molecular relations as well as mediating a variety of cell-cell adhesion processes in the immune response. This study was conducted to assess the effect of T. annulata infection on sialic acid concentration in blood sera in naturally infected buffaloes. T. annulata-infected (n = 22) and uninfected control (n = 20) adult buffaloes were selected. Theileria infection was revealed by Giemsa-stained peripheral blood and was confirmed by nested-PCR using T. annulata-specific primers. Based on the detected parasitemia, the infected animals were subgrouped into low <1 %, moderate 1-3 %, high 3-5 %, and very high >5 %. Hematological parameters and the concentrations of total sialic acid (TSA), lipid-bound sialic acid (LBSA), and protein-bound sialic acid (PBSA) were measured and correlated to parasitemia. The results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in red blood cells (RBCs), packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin (Hb), and sialic acid concentrations between infected and control groups. As the parasitemia increased accordingly, a significant decrease in RBCs, PCV, Hb and increase in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and serum sialic acids was observed. We concluded that T. annulata infection could elevate the serum sialic acid concentrations. The increased levels of serum sialic acid concentrations during parasitemia presumably stimulate the host immune response and influence the parasite-host cell adhesion.","output":"Evaluation of serum sialic acid level in buffaloes naturally infected with Theileria annulata."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires rapid medical responses.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is characterized by abnormal neovascularization which also absorbs light and appears dark against a lighter fundus background. We analyzed neovascularization in PDR using NIR imaging, by observing changes in the neovascular complexes (NVCs) contrast and reflectivity over time. METHODS: Retrospective case series of 20 eyes of 17 patients with PDR who underwent NIR imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) using the Spectralis System. NVCs presence and activity was determined using clinical, tomographic and angiographic criteria. At baseline, all NVCs were qualitatively graded in the NIR image into 3 groups (absent, present and inactive and present and active) and their evolution over time was registered as progression, regression or same status. RESULTS: Twenty-seven NVCs were imaged, of which, 52% were neovascularization of the disc (NVD) and 48% were elsewhere (NVE). Consecutive NIR images were obtained from baseline to up to 5 time-points with a mean follow-up of 3.2  1.7 years. All eyes underwent laser treatment and 30% had additional intravitreal therapy. Using NIR imaging, NVCs were classified at baseline as absent, present and inactive and present and active, respectively in 11, 4 and 85% of cases. NIR identified active neovascularization as hyporeflective irregular dark vessels originating from the retinal venules in NVE or from the disc in NVD. In all groups during follow-up, progression was identified as the development of new vascular hyporeflective dark fronds while regression was shown by reduced dark perfusion. Five eyes developed a wolfs jaw configuration with vascular hyporeflective new vessels and hyperreflective tissue from extensive fibrosis. Fibrosis was more apparent in later images, reaching 86%. In 3 cases (11%), the NVC was no longer seen in NIR, although was still identifiable on OCT over the NVC area. CONCLUSIONS: NIR is a non-invasive imaging modality commonly performed alongside OCT and frequently overlooked which can be useful to evaluate NVCs in PDR. Changes in NVC contrast and reflectivity due to blood perfusion can help in the detection and monitoring of diabetic proliferative disease and aid clinicians in daily practice.","output":"Near-infrared reflectance imaging of neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, residents of the Bronx, New York experienced one of the first significant community COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States.

The impact of stringent measures in low- to middle-income African countries has bought time for healthcare facilities to prepare for the onslaught of COVID-19 cases, but some measures have been challenging to implement. In some settings, public health measures have been associated with serious violations of individual rights owing to abuse of power and gaps in implementation of well-intentioned policy.

The following problematic aspects of the SA MTA are highlighted: (a) Where only data and no human biological material are transferred, the SA MTA does not apply, leaving a lacuna; (b) Health Research Ethics Committees are required to be parties to a MTA despite it being outside their legal mandate and undermining their oversight function; (c) the SA MTAs consent provisions are not aligned with extant law; and, similarly, (d) its provision on donor ownership is misaligned with extant law; (e) its creation of fictitious performance can only cause frustration on the part of an injured party; (f) its benefit-sharing provision is vague and will have little practical effect; (g) its dispute-resolution provisions fail to adequately protect South African research institutions and research participants; (h) it fails to provide substantive guidance regarding intellectual property as its provisions relating to intellectual property may cause practical problems; and, finally, (i) its data privacy provision is insufficiently specific, is overbroad, and fails to provide terms that in general would facilitate the international sharing of human biological material and associated data in terms of existing privacy law. CONCLUSIONS: While some of the problematic aspects of the SA MTA are intricate and require consultative processes with stakeholders and others, to develop comprehensive solutions, most of the problematic aspects can be resolved immediately through amendments by the South African Minister of Health. The formulation of such amendments is proposed and, where possible, interim measures are suggested that may ameliorate the problems presented by the SA MTA.","output":"South Africas new standard material transfer agreement: proposals for improvement and pointers for implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has burgeoned in the past 15 years. Most of the research has focused on school-age children, ages 6 to 18 years. Yet, recent studies suggest that anxiety can emerge in young children, under 6 years, with ASD. This scoping review synthesized the literature on anxiety in young children with ASD. Three domains of anxiety research were reviewed: (a) prevalence/severity, phenomenology, and course; (b) correlates; and (c) treatment. Four online databases were searched from the start of the database until March 2020. Keywords pertaining to anxiety, autism, and young children were entered. The search identified 44 articles for inclusion. These studies varied with respect to sample source, informants, and measures to assess anxiety. The overall prevalence of anxiety ranged from 1.6 to 62%. Sixteen of 17 studies found that young children with ASD had higher levels of anxiety compared to various control groups. A variety of DSM anxiety symptoms and disorders were present in young children with the most common symptoms being specific, social, and generalized fears. Correlates of anxiety included sensory over-responsivity, sleep disturbance, aggression/defiance, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Three cognitive behavioral treatment studies for anxiety and one developmental intervention targeting ASD symptoms showed promise in reducing anxiety. Findings indicate an early emergence of anxiety in some children with ASD. Further research on the measurement, pathophysiology, and treatment of anxiety in early childhood is critical to improving outcomes in children with ASD. LAY SUMMARY: This scoping review synthesizes the literature on anxiety in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Results indicate that children with ASD have higher levels of anxiety than children without ASD. Potential factors that could be contributing to anxiety include sensory, sleep, and behavioral problems. Preliminary studies show that anxiety can improve with cognitive behavioral treatment. These findings suggest that research on anxiety in young children with ASD should be prioritized to improve mental health outcomes.","output":"A Scoping Review of Anxiety in Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2109 (COVID-19) vaccines have recently been approved to curb the global pandemic. The risk of allergic reactions to the vaccine polyethylene glycol (PEG) component has raised significant public concern. Desensitization is suggested in cases of vaccine related hypersensitivity reactions. After comprehensive literature review on the topic, our aim was to establish a safe and effective desensitization protocol for patients with suspected or confirmed immediate type hypersensitivity reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: Participants were referred to the McGill University Health Center (MUHC) Allergy-Immunology department for clinical evaluation following a reported reaction to their first dose of Moderna? mRNA-1273 or Pfizer-BioNTech? BNT162b2 vaccines. They underwent skin prick testing (SPT) with higher and lower molecular weight (MW) PEG and polysorbate 80, as per published protocols. Their second dose was administered following a desensitization protocol consisting of multiple dose-administration steps followed by a 60-min observation period. RESULTS: Among a cohort of 142 patients with an increased risk for allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines, six individuals were selected to undergo desensitization. All were female with allergic background including chronic spontaneous urticaria, anaphylaxis to medications, and/or vaccines. The main symptom after their first dose was difficulty swallowing with lightheadedness or immediate urticaria, angioedema, and/or dizziness. Two patients had positive skin testing. One patient was on chronic antihistamines which resulted in an inconclusive PEG skin test and the skin testing was negative for the three other patients. During the desensitization, two patients reported cutaneous symptoms of an immediate reaction and were managed with antihistamines. One of these patients also complained of ear pressure and had a drop in her systolic blood pressure, treated with intravenous fluids. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that some individuals with an immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction to their first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may safely receive their second dose using a desensitization protocol. The success of this desensitization protocol is a step forward in the fight against COVID-19, allowing more individuals to be immunized.","output":"Successful Desensitization to mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in a Case Series of Patients With a History of Anaphylaxis to the First Vaccine Dose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 outbreak has severely affected people around the world. There is a need of an efficient decision making tool to improve awareness about the spread of COVID-19 infections among the common public. An accurate and reliable neural network based tool for predicting confirmed, recovered and death cases of COVID-19 can be very helpful to the health consultants for taking appropriate actions to control the outbreak. This paper proposes a novel Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) Neural Network Time Series (NAR-NNTS) model for forecasting COVID-19 cases. This NAR-NNTS model is trained with Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), Levenberg Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian Regularization (BR) training algorithms. The performance of the proposed model has been compared by using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and correlation co-efficient i.e. R-value. The results show that NAR-NNTS model trained with LM training algorithm performs better than other models for COVID-19 epidemiological data prediction.","output":"Nonlinear Neural Network Based Forecasting Model for Predicting COVID-19 Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johnes disease in animals with zoonotic potential; it has been linked to many chronic diseases in humans, especially gastrointestinal diseases (GID). MAP has been extensively studied in Europe and America, but little reports were published from Africa. Sudan is a unique country with close contact between humans and livestock. Despite such interaction, the one health concept is neglected in dealing with cases of humans with GID. In this study, patients admitted to the reference GID hospital in the Sudan over a period of 8 months were screened for presence of MAP in their faeces or colonic biopsies. A total of 86 patients were recruited for this study, but only 67 were screened for MAP, as 19 did not provide the necessary samples for analysis. Both real-time PCR and culture were used to detect MAP in the collected samples and the microbial diversity in patients faecal samples was investigated using 16S rDNA nanopore sequencing. In total, 27 (40.3%) patients were MAP positive: they were 15 males and 12 females, of ages between 21 and 80 years. Logistic regression analysis revealed no statistical significance for all tested variables in MAP positive patients (occupation, gender, contact with animal, milk consumption, chronic disease, etc.). A unique microbiome profile of MAP-positive patients in comparison to MAP-negative was found. These findings suggest that a considerable proportion of the population could be MAP infected or carriers. Therefore, increase awareness at community level is urgently needed to decrease the risk of MAP at human/animal interface. This study represents the first report of MAP in humans in the Sudan; nevertheless, a better view of the situation of MAP in humans in the country requires a larger study including patients with other conditions.","output":"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and microbiome profile of patients in a referral gastrointestinal diseases centre in the Sudan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We sought to contain a healthcare-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, to evaluate contributory factors, and to prevent future outbreaks. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental cluster-control outbreak evaluation. METHODS: All patients and staff on the outbreak ward (case cluster), and randomly selected patients and staff on COVID-19 wards (positive control cluster) and a non-COVID-19 wards (negative control cluster) underwent reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance, detection of environmental SARS-COV-2 RNA, patient behavior, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody prevalence were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 145 staff and 26 patients were exposed, resulting in 24 secondary cases. Also, 4 of 14 (29%) staff and 7 of 10 (70%) patients were asymptomatic or presymptomatic. There was no difference in mean cycle threshold between asymptomatic or presymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals. None of 32 randomly selected staff from the control wards tested positive. Environmental RNA detection levels were higher on the COVID-19 ward than on the negative control ward (OR, 19.98; 95% CI, 2.63-906.38; P < .001). RNA levels on the COVID-19 ward (where there were no outbreaks) and the outbreak ward were similar (OR, 2.38; P = .18). Mean monthly hand hygiene compliance, based on 20,146 observations (over preceding year), was lower on the outbreak ward (P < .006). Compared to both control wards, the proportion of staff with detectable antibodies was higher on the outbreak ward (OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 1.01-14.25; P = .008). CONCLUSION: Staff seroconversion was more likely during a short-term outbreak than from sustained duty on a COVID-19 ward. Environmental contamination and PPE use were similar on the outbreak and control wards. Patient noncompliance, decreased hand hygiene, and asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission were more frequent on the outbreak ward.","output":"A cluster-control approach to a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on a stroke ward with infection control considerations for dementia and vascular units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, and social dysfunction among pregnant and/or lactating women and to measure the global pooled prevalence of mental health effects among these populations in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: Comprehensive literature searching was conducted and studies published from 1 January 2020 to 30 September 2020 reporting the prevalence of anxiety, depression; stress, insomnia, and social dysfunctions were included. The pooled prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, and social dysfunctions was estimated using a random-effect model. In this study, all statistical analyses were performed using STATA (version 15) software. RESULTS: There were a total of 19 studies included in the meta-analysis, of which 16, 14, 4, 2, and 2 studies were included in computing the pooled prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, and social dysfunction, respectively. The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 33% (95% confidence interval: 50%?61%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 99.68%, p = 0.001). The pooled prevalence of depression was 27% (95% confidence interval: 9%?45%), with remarkable heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 99.29%, p = 0.001). Likewise, the pooled prevalence of stress was 56% (95% confidence interval: 30.07%?82.22%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 98.8%, p = 0.0001). The pooled prevalence of social dysfunction was 24.3% (95% confidence interval: 13.41%?62.03%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 97.5%, p = 0.0001) and finally, the pooled prevalence of insomnia was 33.53% (95% confidence interval: 3.05%?64.0%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 99.6%, p = 0.0001).

RECENT FINDINGS Recent publications have developed models to assist in risk stratifying potential heart transplant recipients based on cardiac and noncardiac factors. These studies provide additional tools to assist clinicians in balancing individual risk and benefit of heart transplantation in the context of a limited donor organ supply. SUMMARY The primary goal of heart transplantation is to improve survival and maximize quality of life. To meet this goal, a careful assessment of patient-specific risks is essential.

The causes and mechanisms still remain elusive, but a complex interplay between several genes and a number of interconnected environmental factors, are chiefly involved in mDAn demise, as they intersect the key cellular functions affected in PD, such as the inflammatory response, mitochondrial, lysosomal, proteosomal and autophagic functions. Nuclear factor erythroid 2 -like 2 (NFE2L2/Nrf2), the master regulator of cellular defense against oxidative stress and inflammation, and Wingless (Wnt)/-catenin signaling cascade, a vital pathway for mDAn neurogenesis and neuroprotection, emerge as critical intertwinned actors in mDAn physiopathology, as a decline of an Nrf2/Wnt/-catenin prosurvival axis with age underlying PD mutations and a variety of noxious environmental exposures drive PD neurodegeneration. Unexpectedly, astrocytes, the so-called star-shaped cells, harbouring an arsenal of beneficial and harmful molecules represent the turning point in the physiopathological and therapeutical scenario of PD. Fascinatingly, astrocytes fil rouge brings back to Nrf2/Wnt resilience, as boosting the Nrf2/Wnt resilience program rejuvenates astrocytes, in turn (i) mitigating nigrostriatal degeneration of aged mice, (ii) reactivating neural stem progenitor cell proliferation and neuron differentiation in the brain and (iii) promoting a beneficial immunomodulation via bidirectional communication with mDAns. Then, through resilience of Nrf2/Wnt/-catenin anti-ageing, prosurvival and proregenerative molecular programs, it seems possible to boost the inherent endogenous self-repair mechanisms. Here, the cellular and molecular aspects as well as the therapeutical options for rejuvenating glia-neuron dialogue will be discussed together with major glial-derived mechanisms and therapies that will be fundamental to the identification of novel diagnostic tools and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), to fight ageing and nigrostriatal DAergic degeneration and promote functional recovery.","output":"Nrf2/Wnt resilience orchestrates rejuvenation of glia-neuron dialogue in Parkinsons disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Like many areas of medicine, vascular surgery has been transformed by the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.

The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) mediate the cellular response to hypoxia, but their role within the PDAC tumor microenvironment remains unknown. Methods We used a dual recombinase mouse model to delete Hif1 or Hif2 in -smooth muscle actin (SMA)-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) arising within spontaneous pancreatic tumors. The effects of CAF-Hif2 expression on tumor progression and composition of the tumor microenvironment were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, histology, immunostaining, and by both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. CAF-macrophage crosstalk was modeled ex vivo using conditioned media from CAFs after treatment with hypoxia and PT2399, a HIF2 inhibitor currently in clinical trials. Syngeneic flank and orthotopic PDAC models were used to assess whether HIF2 inhibition improves response to immune checkpoint blockade. Results CAF-specific deletion of HIF2, but not HIF1, suppressed PDAC tumor progression and growth, and improved survival of mice by 50% (n = 21-23 mice/group, Log-rank P = 0.0009). Deletion of CAF-HIF2 modestly reduced tumor fibrosis and significantly decreased the intratumoral recruitment of immunosuppressive M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Treatment with the clinical HIF2 inhibitor PT2399 significantly reduced in vitro macrophage chemotaxis and M2 polarization, and improved tumor responses to immunotherapy in both syngeneic PDAC mouse models.

Despite increasing enthusiasm for IPP/IPA LARC insertion, adolescents' preferences and experiences have seldom been examined. The objective of this review was to examine the attitudes of adolescents (aged 10-19 years) towards IPP/IPA LARC, their experiences and perceptions around having a LARC device fitted IPP/IPA and the factors involved in decision-making to use, not use or discontinue IPP/IPA LARC. MATERIAL AND METHODS In January 2021 we searched seven bibliographic databases for original research articles published in English, from the year 2000. Studies of any design focussed on IPP/IPA LARC were eligible for inclusion. Three of the authors assessed articles for eligibility and extracted data relevant to the outcomes of the review. Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools were used to assess methodological quality. Key themes emerging from the data were synthesised and reported narratively. RESULTS We identified 10 relevant articles, four of which were entirely adolescent-focused. Only three addressed IPA LARC. IPP availability was important for ensuring access to LARC postpartum. Attitudes towards LARC IPP were associated with adolescents' sociodemographic characteristics and positive perceptions related to the long duration of action. Determinants of discontinuation and non-use included poor-quality contraceptive counseling, intolerable side-effects and subsequent distress, misconceptions about LARC safety IPP and the influence of partners and community on autonomy. No factors involved in IPA LARC decision-making were available. Limited evidence demonstrated that adolescents may favour contraceptive implants over intrauterine devices, and in certain contexts may face greater barriers to IPA LARC access than adult women. CONCLUSIONS Immediate insertion of LARC postpartum appears acceptable to adolescents who do not experience side-effects and those with the opportunity to make autonomous contraception decisions. This important topic has been addressed in few studies involving an entirely adolescent population. Very limited evidence is available on IPA LARC. Further research on adolescents' lived experiences of IPP/IPA LARC access and use is necessary to inform the provision of person-centred care when assisting adolescents' contraceptive choice following pregnancy.","output":"Acceptability of immediate postpartum and post-abortion long-acting reversible contraception provision to adolescents: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Palliative care should be a component of COVID-19 management to relieve suffering, improve patient outcomes and save cost.

The D\\\\dimer is frequently elevated in COVID\\\\19, but other markers of coagulation activation, including the prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PF1.2) are poorly described. METHODS: We studied hospitalized adults with COVID\\\\19 and PF1.2 measurement performed at any time during hospitalization. We evaluated the relationship between PF1.2 and synchronously measured D\\\\dimer. We utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate optimal thresholds for diagnosing thrombosis and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate association with thrombosis. RESULTS: 115 patients were included [110 (95.7%) critically ill]. PF1.2 and D\\\\dimer were moderately positively correlated (r=0.542, P<0.001) but significant discordance was observed in elevation of each marker above the laboratory reference range (59.0% elevated PF1.2 vs. 98.5% elevated D\\\\dimer). Median PF1.2 levels were higher in patients with thrombosis than those without (611 vs. 374 pmol/L, P=0.006). In ROC analysis, PF1.2 had superior specificity and conferred a higher positive likelihood ratio in identifying patients with thrombosis than D\\\\dimer (PF1.2 threshold of >523 pmol/L: 69.2% sensitivity, 67.7% specificity; >924 pmol/L: 37.9% sensitivity, 87.8% specificity). In multivariable analysis, a PF1.2 >500 pmol/L was significantly associated with VTE [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.26, 95% CI, 1.12\\\\16.21, P=0.034] and any thrombotic manifestation (adjusted OR 3.85, 95% CI, 1.39\\\\10.65, P=0.010); conversely, synchronously measured D\\\\dimer was not significantly associated with thrombosis. 90.6% of patients with a non\\\\elevated PF1.2 result did not develop VTE. CONCLUSIONS: PF1.2 may be a useful assay, and potentially more discriminant than D\\\\dimer, in identifying thrombotic manifestations in hospitalized patients with COVID\\\\19.

Tumors can constitute a contraindication for transplantation or can lead to a delay of acceptance to the waiting-list. Current waiting time guidelines mainly refer to early data collected nearly 30 years ago, when the knowledge on tumors was, by current standards, still limited. RECENT FINDINGS Today, cancers can usually be divided into many different biological subtypes, according to histological and molecular subclassification and the availability of genetic testing. A more precise stratification and targeted antitumor therapies have led to better therapy outcomes or even cures from certain malignancies and to a better appreciation of tumor risks for the patient. SUMMARY Even though transplant patients do have an increased risk for malignancies, it is often overlooked that patients, while on dialysis, are equally prone to develop a tumor. Competing risks (e.g. cardiovascular, mortality risks) through prolonged time on dialysis have to be equally considered, when the decision for acceptance of a patient to the waiting-list is made. Current waiting time suggestions should be critically reconsidered for every patient after a thorough discussion with an oncologist, including new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, as well as novel risk stratifications.","output":"Waiting times in renal transplant candidates with a history of malignancy: time for a change?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo.

Patients perceived risk for infection and attitudes about receiving dental care during the pandemic are important to understand as patients consider returning to routine dental care as the pandemic progresses. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore dental patients perceptions of susceptibility to contracting COVID-19, their related attitudes and beliefs regarding dental care visits, and their considerations for returning to routine care during and after the pandemic. METHOD: Data for this cross-sectional study came from an electronic survey of 464 US adults. Survey variables include demographics, dental hygiene behaviors, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, attitudes and beliefs regarding risk for attending dental appointments, and the necessary conditions and events for them to feel comfortable returning to regular dental appointments. RESULTS: Over half of study participants had a 4-y degree, an annual income of at least $50,000, and good oral hygiene practices of frequent brushing and routine dental visits. Older age and agreement with positive attitudinal statements and beliefs about professional dental care were positively related to perceived susceptibility for contracting COVID-19 in a dental setting. Perceptions of susceptibility, a higher valuation of dentistry, and agreement that COVID-19 is a serious infection were each positively related to attitudinal statements and beliefs reflecting caution in attending dental visits. Last, assurance from public health officials confirming the safety to return for routine dental care was the largest reported factor necessary for a return to routine dental visits. CONCLUSION: This study provides early data about patient perceptions of susceptibility and attitudes toward COVID-19 in a professional dental setting and necessary conditions for returning to regular visits. This information can help formulate messaging related to returning to professional dental care, specifically targeting fears among the most susceptible populations. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: Government and public health agencies can play an important role in alleviating concerns and instilling confidence that dental settings are safe. With this information from the public, dental professionals and public health agencies can work together to share messaging that will consistently inform the public regarding the safety of returning to professional dental care as it relates to the reopening of states and cities.","output":"Patient Perceptions about Professional Dental Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses, including the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, redirect infected cell metabolism to their own purposes. After binding to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface, the SARS-CoV-2 is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis ending in the acidic endolysosomal compartment. The virus hijacks the endosomal machinery leading to fusion of viral and endosomal membranes and release of the viral RNA into the cytosol. This mini-review specifically highlights the membrane lipid organization of the endosomal system focusing on the unconventional and late endosome/lysosome-specific phospholipid, bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP). BMP is enriched in alveolar macrophages of lung, one of the target tissue of SARS-CoV-2. This review details the BMP structure, its unsaturated fatty acid composition and fusogenic properties that are essential for the highly dynamic formation of the intraluminal vesicles inside the endosomes. Interestingly, BMP is necessary for infection and replication of enveloped RNA virus such as SARS-CoV-1 and Dengue virus. We also emphasize the role of BMP in lipid sorting and degradation, especially cholesterol transport in cooperation with Niemann Pick type C proteins (NPC 1 and 2) and with some oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related proteins (ORPs) as well as in sphingolipid degradation. Interestingly, numerous virus infection required NPC1 as well as ORPs along the endocytic pathway. Furthermore, BMP content is increased during pathological endosomal lipid accumulation in various lysosomal storage disorders. This is particularly important knowing the high percentage of patients with metabolic disorders among the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presenting severe forms of COVID-19.","output":"Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, an important actor in the host endocytic machinery hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During pandemics, such as the SARS-CoV-2, filtering facepiece respirators plays an essential role in protecting healthcare personnel. The recycling of respirators is possible in case of critical shortage, but it raises the question of the effectiveness of decontamination as well as the performance of the reused respirators. METHOD: Disposable respirators were subjected to ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) treatment at single or successive doses of 60 mJ/cm2 after a short drying cycle (30 min, 70C). The germicidal efficacy of this treatment was tested by spiking respirators with two staphylococcal bacteriophages (vB_HSa_2002 and P66 phages). The respirator performance was investigated by the following parameters: particle penetration (NaCl aerosol, 10-300 nm), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry and mechanical tensile tests. RESULTS: No viable phage particles were recovered from any of the respirators after decontamination (log reduction in virus titre >3), and no reduction in chemical or physical properties (SEM, particle penetrations <5%-6%) were observed. Increasing the UVGI dose 10-fold led to chemical alterations of the respirator filtration media (FTIR) but did not affect the physical properties (particle penetration), which was unaltered even at 3000 mJ/cm2 (50 cycles). When respirators had been used by healthcare workers and undergone decontamination, they had particle penetration significantly greater than never donned respirators. CONCLUSION: This decontamination procedure is an attractive method for respirators in case of shortages during a SARS pandemic.

Morphological examination of these species has defined six phenotypic groups that are commonly used in characterizations of taxonomic hypotheses.

We re\\\\examined traditional characters used to define species groups and used multivariate statistics to quantitatively evaluate group structure in morphometric space. Clustering analyses of phenotypic similarity indicate that some (but not all) members of previously defined species groups are phenotypically most similar to other members of the same group. However, when species group membership was mapped on our partitioned Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis, only one species group corresponds to a clade; all other species group arrangements are strongly rejected by our phylogeny.

We sought to demonstrate the reduction in hospital room utilization after implementation of outpatient pelvic reconstructive surgery. METHODS: We included all minimally invasive reconstructive surgical procedures in this retrospective cohort study within a large managed care organization of 4.5 million members (2008-2018). We queried the system-wide medical record for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for all included procedures and patient perioperative data. Categorical variables were compared using &#967;2 test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. RESULTS: Of the 13,445 patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery, 5,506 were discharged the same day, whereas 7,939 were discharged the next day. Over the 10-year period, patients without hysterectomy had outpatient surgery rates increase from 31.2% to 76.4% (+45.2%), whereas those with hysterectomy increased from 3% to 56.4% (+53.4%). Hospital room utilization decreased by 45,200 room days/100,000 reconstructive procedures without hysterectomy and 53,400 room days/100,000 reconstructive procedures with hysterectomy. When compared to 2008, in 2018 after more widespread adoption of outpatient elective surgery, for the 738 patients undergoing surgery without hysterectomy, 334 less room days were used, whereas 335 less room days were used among the 640 patients who had a surgical procedure with hysterectomy.

Such signatures are motifs present in the viral genome that differentiate species or variants. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, the identification of such signatures can contribute to taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, help in recognizing and defining distinct emerging variants, and focus the characterization of functional properties of polymorphic gene products. Here, we study KEVOLVE, an approach based on a genetic algorithm with a machine learning kernel, to identify several genomic signatures based on minimal sets of k-mers. In a comparative study, in which we analyzed large SARS-CoV-2 genome dataset, KEVOLVE performed better in identifying variant-discriminative signatures than several gold-standard reference statistical tools. Subsequently, these signatures were characterized to highlight potential biological functions. The majority were associated with known mutations among the different variants, with respect to functional and pathological impact based on available literature. Notably, we found show evidence of new motifs, specifically in the Omicron variant, some of which include silent mutations, indicating potentially novel, variant-specific virulence determinants. The source code of the method and additional resources are available at: https://github.com/bioinfoUQAM/KEVOLVE. Author summary Advances in cloning and sequencing technologies have yielded a vast repository of viral genomic sequence data. To analyze this complex and massive data, Machine learning, which refers to the development and application of computer algorithms that improve with experience, has proven to be efficient. Although many methods have been developed to classify viruses into different characteristic groups, it is often difficult to explain the predictions of these methods. To overcome this, we are working in our laboratory on the design of machine learning based methods for discriminative signatures identification within viral genomic sequences. These signatures which are a specific motifs to groups of viruses known to be pervasive in their genome, are used to 1) build accurate and explainable prediction tools for pathogens and 2) highlight mutations potentially associated with functional changes. In this paper we present the potential of our latest approach KEVOLVE. We first compare it to three discriminating motif identification tools with data sets covering several SARS-CoV-2 variant genomes.

Serological tests can be an important complementary approach. We aimed to assess the practical performance of RT-PCR-based surveillance protocols and determine the extent of undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shenzhen, China. Methods: We did a cohort study in Shenzhen, China and attempted to recruit by telephone all RT-PCR-negative close contacts (defined as those who lived in the same residence as, or shared a meal, travelled, or socially interacted with, an index case within 2 days before symptom onset) of all RT-PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected since January, 2020, via contact tracing. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples from RT-PCR-negative close contacts 2-15 weeks after initial virological testing by RT-PCR, using total antibody, IgG, and IgM ELISAs. In addition, we did a serosurvey of volunteers from neighbourhoods with no reported cases, and from neighbourhoods with reported cases. We assessed rates of infection undetected by RT-PCR, performance of RT-PCR over the course of infection, and characteristics of individuals who were seropositive on total antibody ELISA but RT-PCR negative. Findings: Between April 12 and May 4, 2020, we enrolled and collected serological samples from 2345 (530%) of 4422 RT-PCR-negative close contacts of cases of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. 1175 (501%) of 2345 were close contacts of cases diagnosed in Shenzhen with contact tracing details, and of these, 880 (749%) had serum samples collected more than 2 weeks after exposure to an index case and were included in our analysis. 40 (45%) of 880 RT-PCR-negative close contacts were positive on total antibody ELISA. The seropositivity rate with total antibody ELISA among RT-PCR-negative close contacts, adjusted for assay performance, was 41% (95% CI 29-57), which was significantly higher than among individuals residing in neighbourhoods with no reported cases (00% [95% CI 00-11]). RT-PCR-positive individuals were 80 times (95% CI 53-127) more likely to report symptoms than those who were RT-PCR-negative but seropositive, but both groups had a similar distribution of sex, age, contact frequency, and mode of contact. RT-PCR did not detect 48 (36% [95% CI 28-44]) of 134 infected close contacts, and false-negative rates appeared to be associated with stage of infection. Interpretation: Even rigorous RT-PCR testing protocols might miss a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections, perhaps in part due to difficulties in determining the timing of testing in asymptomatic individuals for optimal sensitivity. RT-PCR-based surveillance and control protocols that include rapid contact tracing, universal RT-PCR testing, and mandatory 2-week quarantine were, nevertheless, able to contain community spread in Shenzhen, China.

Human lung fibroblast cell line MRC5 was mock-infected or infected with EV71, and treated with drugs. The cytotoxicity of the drugs was detected with MTT assay. The cytopathic effects such as cell death and condensed nuclei were morphologically observed. The VP1-coding sequence required for EV71 genome replication was assayed with qRT-PCR. Viral protein expression was analyzed with Western blotting. Viral TCID50 was determined to evaluate EV71 virulence. Flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide staining was performed to analyze the cell cycle distribution of MRC5 cells. Rheum emodin (29.6 mol/L) effectively protected MRC5 cells from EV71-induced cytopathic effects, which resulted from the inhibiting viral replication: rheum emodin treatment decreased viral genomic levels by 5.34-fold, viral protein expression by less than 30-fold and EV71 virulence by 0.33107-fold. The fact that inhibition of rheum emodin on viral virulence was much stronger than its effects on genomic levels and viral protein expression suggested that rheum emodin inhibited viral maturation. Furthermore, rheum emodin treatment markedly diminished cell cycle arrest at S phase in MRC5 cells, which was induced by EV71 infection and favored the viral replication. In contrast, neither astragaloside (50 mol/L) nor artemisinin (50 mol/L) showed similar anti-EV71 activities.

RESULTS: The mean survival duration following level I resuscitation was less than 1 year. Palliative care was administered to 15% of the resuscitation cohort. The palliative care group received significantly less life-sustaining treatment than did the usual care group. CONCLUSION: Among patients who underwent level I resuscitation, palliative care was inversely correlated with the scope of life-sustaining treatments. Furthermore, triage level I resuscitation status may present a possible new field for starting palliative care intervention and reducing low-value care.","output":"Choosing and Doing wisely: triage level I resuscitation a possible new field for starting palliative care and avoiding low-value care C a nationwide matched-pair retrospective cohort study in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research shows that care delivery regarding somatic health problems for patients with a severe mental illness (SMI) in community and mental health is difficult to establish.

We aimed to quantify missed vaccination opportunities among hospitalised children in India, and identify vaccination barriers perceived by caregivers and healthcare providers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Two public-sector tertiary-care hospitals in northern India, during November 2018 and March 2019. PARTICIPANTS: We tracked 263 hospitalised children aged 1C59 months through hospital discharge, to assess vaccination status, and document catch-up vaccinations given during the hospital stay. We interviewed caregivers and healthcare providers to assess their perceptions on vaccination. OUTCOMES: Proportion of hospitalised children considered under-vaccinated for their age; proportion of missed opportunities for vaccination among under-vaccinated children who were eligible for vaccination; and vaccine coverage by antigen. RESULTS: We found that 65.4% (172/263) of hospitalised children were under-vaccinated for their age when they presented to the hospital. Among under-vaccinated children, 61.0% were less than 4 months old, and 55.6% reported prior contact with a health facility for a sick visit. The proportion of under-vaccinated children in hospitals were higher compared with the general population as indicated by regional vaccination coverage data. Among under-vaccinated children who were tracked till discharge, 98.1% (158/161) remained incompletely vaccinated at discharge and were considered missed opportunities for vaccination. Perceived vaccination contraindications that are not part of established contraindications included in national and international guidelines was the most common reason for healthcare providers not to vaccinate children during hospital stay. Among caregivers of under-vaccinated children, 90.1% reported being comfortable having their children vaccinated while they were sick, if recommended by the healthcare provider. CONCLUSION: This pilot study confirmed that hospitalised sick children had substantial missed vaccination opportunities. Addressing these opportunities through concerted actions involving caregivers, healthcare providers and healthcare systems can improve overall vaccination coverage.","output":"Determining the burden of missed opportunities for vaccination among children admitted in healthcare facilities in India: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over 313,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases have been confirmed in Italy as of 30 September 2020, and the number of deaths exceeding thirty-five thousand makes Italy among the list of most significantly affected countries in the world Such an enormous occurrence of infections and death raises the urgent demand for effective available treatments Discovering the cellular/molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity is of paramount importance to understand how the infection becomes a disease and how to plan any therapeutic approach In this regard, we performed an in silico analysis to predict the putative virus targets and evidence the already available therapeutics Literature experimental results identified angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE and Spike proteins particularly involved in COVID-19 Consequently, we investigated the signalling pathways modulated by the two proteins through query miRNet, the platform linking miRNAs, targets, and functions Our bioinformatics analysis predicted microRNAs (miRs), miR-335-5p and miR-26b-5p, as being modulated by Spike and ACE together with histone deacetylate (HDAC) pathway Notably, our results identified ACE/ACE2-ATR1-Cholesterol-HDAC axis signals that also matched with some available clinical data We hypothesize that the current and EMA-approved, SARS-CoV-2 off-label HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) drugs may be repurposed to limit or block host-virus interactions Moreover, a ranked list of compounds is provided for further evaluation for safety, efficacy, and effectiveness","output":"MicroRNAs Bioinformatics Analyses Identifying HDAC Pathway as a Putative Target for Existing Anti-COVID-19 Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the COMPASS trial, the combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily and low-dose aspirin 75-100 mg daily produced a net clinical benefit of 20% in patients with chronic atherosclerotic vascular disease because it reduced major adverse events by 24% and overall mortality by 18% despite an initial increase in major bleeding.

It presents a unique therapeutic dilemma, as anticoagulation with heparin alone is insufficient to address the imbalance in fibrinolysis. And while the use of fibrinolytic agents could limit the disease severity, it is often associated with bleeding complications. There is a need for biomarkers that will guide the timely stratification of patients into those who may benefit from both anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapies. PATIENT CONCERNS: All 3 patients presented with shortness of breath along with comorbidities predisposing them to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. One patient (Patient 3) also suffered from bilateral deep venous thrombosis. DIAGNOSES: All 3 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and were eventually diagnosed with respiratory failure necessitating intubation. INTERVENTIONS: All 3 patients required mechanical ventilation support, 2 of which also required renal replacement therapy. All 3 patients were also placed on anticoagulation therapy. OUTCOMES: In Patients 1 and 2, the initial D-dimer levels of 0.97 g/ml fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) and 0.83 g/ml FEU were only slightly elevated (normal <0.50 g/ml FEU). They developed rising D-dimer levels to a peak of 13.21 g/ml FEU and >20.0 g/ml FEU, respectively, which dropped to 1.34 g/ml FEU 8 days later in Patient 1 and to 2.94 g/ml on hospital day 13 in Patient 2. In Patient 3, the D-dimer level on admission was found to be elevated to >20.00 g/ml FEU together with imaging evidence of thrombosis. And although he received therapeutic heparin infusion, he still developed pulmonary embolism (PE) and his D-dimer level declined to 5.91 g/ml FEU. Despite improvement in their D-dimer levels, all 3 patients succumbed to multi-system organ failure. On postmortem examination, numerous arterial and venous thromboses of varying ages, many consisting primarily of fibrin, were identified in the lungs of all patients. LESSONS: High D-dimer levels, with subsequent downtrend correlating with clinical deterioration, seems to be an indicator of fibrinolysis suppression. These findings can help form a hypothesis, as larger cohorts are necessary to demonstrate their reproducibility.","output":"Improvement in plasma D-dimer level in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection can be an indicator of fibrinolysis suppression: Case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research investigates the feasibility and challenges associated with implementing the jigsaw learning strategy using the breakout rooms feature in zoom meetings.

In the present study, we identified the genomic and proteomic variants of Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We identified 16 different genotypic variants were found among the 27 isolates. The genotypes of three isolates such as Bra/1236/2021 (G15), Bra/MASP2C844R2/2020 (G11), and Bra/RJ-DCVN5/2020 (G9) have a unique mutant in NSP4 (S184N), 2O-Mutase (R216N), membrane protein (A2V) and Envelope protein (V5A). A mutation in RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, particularly the change of Pro to Leu at 323 resulted in the stabilization of the structure in BRA/CD1739-P4/2020. NSP4, NSP5 protein mutants are more virulent in Genotype 15 and 16. A fast protein folding rate changes the structural stability and leads to escape for current antivirals.

Patients with IPF represent a heterogeneous population with several described clinical phenotypes. More recently, the development of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis in IPF patients, with an incidence higher than that in the general population, has drawn attention. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old woman previously diagnosed with IPF presented to the emergency department with hemoptysis and hypoxemic respiratory failure. DIAGNOSES: High-resolution chest computed tomography revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities associated with areas of consolidation superimposed on the patient's fibrotic background pattern. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was confirmed by the presence of hemorrhagic bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Hematological and biochemical investigations revealed an inflammatory syndrome, moderate anemia, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Serological analysis revealed perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positivity and high levels of antimyeloperoxidase antibodies antibodies. The patient underwent kidney biopsy, which revealed necrotizing glomerulonephritis. Clinical and laboratory findings were diagnostic of microscopic polyangiitis with lung and renal involvement. INTERVENTIONS: Cyclophosphamide in combination with methylprednisolone was administered as remission induction therapy. The maintenance therapy consisted of mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone. OUTCOMES: The patient achieved clinical, radiological, and serological remission within six weeks of treatment. LESSONS: The association between IPF and ANCA-associated vasculitis may represent a distinct clinical phenotype.

To monitor the vulnerability of countries to PV circulation, surveillance of neutralizing-antibody titers against PV in susceptible populations is essential in the end game of the polio eradication program. In this study, we have developed a PV neutralization test with type 1, 2, and 3 PV pseudoviruses to determine the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV in human serum samples. With this test, the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV could be determined within 2 days by automated interpretation of luciferase signals without using infectious PV strains. We validated the pseudovirus PV neutralization test with 131 human serum samples collected from a wide range of age groups (ages 1 to >60 years) by comparison with a conventional neutralization test. We found good correlation in the neutralizing-antibody titers determined by these tests.

METHODS AND RESULTS We identified appendectomy specimens in our department during the year 2018 with available H&E slides and electronic clinical data, and evaluated multiple histologic findings. Cases were then divided into AA and IA, based on clinical history (AA if the patient presented to the hospital within one week of symptom onset and underwent appendectomy within 48 hours; IA if appendectomy was delayed at least one week). Changes between groups were compared. The cohort included 165 cases (125 AA, 40 IA). Findings significantly more common in AA included mucosal acute inflammation, mural acute inflammation, and acute serositis. Findings significantly more common in IA included Crohn-like mural inflammation, mural fibrosis, goblet cell hyperplasia, granulomas, xanthogranulomatous inflammation, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and granulation tissue. The rate of IA in 2018 (24%) was noticeably higher than in previous years. CONCLUSION Acute inflammatory changes are more common in AA but can remain present in IA. Mural fibrosis, serosal adhesions, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and granulation tissue suggest IA.

Methods: A total of 21,865 patients were included in the analysis, 2,518 had obstructive lung disease and COVID-19. There were 1,370 [HA1] patients who had asthma and COVID-19, and 847 patients had COPD and COVID-19. There were 301 patients who had overlapping asthma and COPD diagnoses. There were 19,347 patients who had a diagnosis of COVID-19 without asthma or COPD. Logistic regression analysis of the data was performed. Results: Analysis of our data showed COPD patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be intubated as compared to the control group (OR 1.346 95% CI 1.061-1.707 p=0.0095). Additionally, there was no association between COPD and mortality in patients with COVID-19 (OR 0.845, 95% CI: 0.685-1.042 p=0.1436). There was no association between asthma and COVID-19 and intubation (OR 1.175 95% CI 0.936-1.475 p=0.2193). There was no statistical association between asthma and mortality in patients with COVID-19 (OR 0.849 95% CI 0.669-1.079 p=0.2455). However, patients with asthma were at a decreased risk of dying from COVID-19 compared to COPD patients with COVID-19 even after controlling for comorbid conditions (OR 0.718, 95% CI 0.526-0.979 p=0.0329). Patients presenting with asthma exacerbation or COPD exacerbation in the setting of COVID-19 infection were not at increased risk of death as compared to COPD or asthma patients with COVID-19 (Asthma exacerbation OR 1.042, 95% CI 0.62-1.73 p=0.8796), (COPD exacerbation OR 0.95 95% CI 0.67-1.36 p=0.762). Conclusion: Our finding with regards to intubation may be explained by an aggressive approach early on in the pandemic towards intubation especially in patients that may have been perceived as high-risk patients' due to underlying lung disease. Our data also showed no association between COPD and death in COVID-19 and asthma and mortality in COVID-19-meaning COPD and Asthma were not risk factors for death in our patient population. As to why asthma patients were at decreased odds of dying compared to COPD patients may be related to the different pathophysiological mechanisms of asthma as compared to COPD or a small protective effect of inhaled corticosteroids. Lastly, presenting with an asthma exacerbation or COPD exacerbation in the setting of COVID-19 infection did not increase your odds of mortality.","output":"COVID-19 and obstructive lung disease: Are COPD and asthma risk factors for severe COVID-19? evaluating the data from the largest health system in New York State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to use Ligand-based pharmacophore modelling approach for four established antiviral drugs, namely remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 inhibitors as training sets.

OBJECTIVE Based on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence data derived from a statewide random sample (as opposed to relying on reported case counts), we determine the infection-hospitalization ratio (IHR), defined as the percentage of infected individuals who are hospitalized, for various demographic groups in Indiana. Furthermore, for comparison, we show the extent to which case-based hospitalization ratios, compared with the IHR, overestimate the probability of hospitalization by demographic group.

The Taiwanese government also recognizes the need to implement a nationwide health care quality indicator system to strengthen quality surveillance. CHOICE OF SOLUTION In 1999, the Department of Health funded a 2-year project led by the Taiwan Healthcare Executive College to develop a comprehensive performance assessment system, subsequently named as Taiwan Healthcare Indicator Series (THIS). The series includes four categories of indicators, namely outpatient, in-patient, emergency care, and intensive care, and has 139 items in total. IMPLEMENTATION The system was officially launched in 2001. Participation is voluntary. The Taiwan Healthcare Executive College processes the data and provides feedback to the participating hospitals. The information is for the participating hospitals' own use and is not released to the public. EVALUATION Participating hospitals have increased from 45 in 2001 to 227 in 2006 and now constitute approximately 50% of the total hospital population in Taiwan. The reporting rate averaged 77.7% in 2004. The first five most reported indicators are the percentage of first-visit outpatients to outpatient clinics, the average length of in-patient stay, the nosocomial infection rate, the occupancy rate, and the crude mortality rate.

We performed a national, multicentre, observational and transversal study to assess the prevalence of iron deficiency as well as current iron deficiency screening practices in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 25 nephrology centres in France participated in the study. All adult non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients who met the inclusion (GFR>15mL/min/1.73m2) and exclusion criteria and provided consent were systematically recruited over a 4-week inclusion period. Investigators were asked to perform a blood test (hemoglobin concentration, serum iron, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation) and to complete a questionnaire about their iron status monitoring practices. The primary objective was to assess the prevalence of iron deficiency (serum ferritin<100g/L and/or transferrin saturation<20%). Secondary objectives were to evaluate the prevalence of absolute iron deficiency (serum ferritin<100g/L and transferrin saturation<20%) and functional iron deficiency (serum ferritin100g/L and transferrin saturation<20%), the prevalence of iron deficiency according to haemoglobin concentration and chronic kidney disease stage, the proportion of centres that perform routine evaluation of iron status and the number of patients receiving iron supplementation.

The rates of absolute iron deficiency and functional iron deficiency and anaemia were 13.4% and 17.1%, respectively. Among the 25 participating centres, 12 reported routine assessment of iron status in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients. CONCLUSION In this observational study, a high prevalence of iron deficiency was observed among non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients. Less than half of participating centres reported routine assessment of iron status.","output":"[Prevalence of iron deficiency in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease: The CARENFER national, multicentre, observational study]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Uncertainty tolerance (UT), a construct explicating individuals' response to perceived uncertainty, is increasingly considered a competency for effective medical practice. Lower UT among physicians is linked with negative outcomes, including less favorable attitudes toward patient-centered care, and increased burnout risk. Despite decades of research, as yet few have engaged methodological approaches aiming to understand the factors that may influence medical students' UT (so-called moderators). Such knowledge, though, could inform teaching practices for fostering learners' skills for managing uncertainties. Accordingly, we asked What factors do medical students in their clinical years perceive as moderating their perceptions of, and responses to, uncertainty? METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study with forty-one medical students in clinical years at an Australian medical school, with data collected throughout 2020. Participants described their experiences of uncertainty through both in-semester reflective diary entries (n = 230) and end of semester group or individual semi-structured interviews (n = 40). Data were analyzed using a team-based framework analysis approach. RESULTS: Four major themes of UT moderators were identified: (1) Individual factors, (2) Sociocultural factors, (3) Academic factors and (4) Reflective learning. Aspects of individual, sociocultural and academic factors were perceived as having either positive or negative influences on students' perceptions of uncertainty. By contrast, reflective learning was described as having a predominantly positive influence on students' perceptions of uncertainty, with students noting learning opportunities and personal growth afforded through uncertain experiences. CONCLUSIONS: As healthcare becomes increasingly complex, a future challenge is equipping our medical students with strategies and skills to manage uncertainties. Our study identified multiple moderators of medical students' UT, key among them being reflective learning. We also identified UT moderators that contemporary and future medical educators may be able to harness in order to develop learner UT as a healthcare graduate attribute, especially through teaching practices such as intellectual candor. Further research is now required to evaluate the impact of proposed educational interventions, and to develop effective assessments of students' skills for managing clinical uncertainties.","output":"Medical Student Experiences of Uncertainty Tolerance Moderators: A Longitudinal Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rhino-orbital mycosis has been recently recognised as one of the sequelae in COVID-19 recovered patients.

In this article, the authors aim to describe the characteristics of patients presenting with post covid fungal infection which could be detected on 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount and Giemsa stain put on crush biopsy smear. We describe 10 COVID-19 recovered patients admitted to ENT department of the hospital during second wave of COVID-19 infection. They presented with post covid fungal sinusitis and ophthalmic complications and planned for surgery. KOH mount and Giemsa stain were used for possible opinion and confirmed by culture. The observations were described in mean and percentages. All ten (100%) COVID-19 recovered patients were previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) for 2C11 years. All 10 patients (100%) were given oral or intravenous corticosteroids for mean of 21 days (3 weekstill presentation to ENT department). Simple procedures with 10% KOH mount and Giemsa stain could detect fungal hypae in all the cases and could provide possible opinion in 9 of 10 (90%) cases for timely management of the patients. The authors hypothesize that uncontrolled DM and prolonged use of corticosteroids may act as culprits of rhino-orbital mycosis in COVID-19 recovered patients.

However, there is currently a lack of methods and software tools for the processing of PTR-TOF-MS data from cohorts and suited for biomarker discovery studies. RESULTS: We developed a comprehensive suite of algorithms that process raw data from patient acquisitions and generate the table of feature intensities. Notably, we included an innovative two-dimensional peak deconvolution model based on penalized splines signal regression for accurate estimation of the temporal profile and feature quantification, as well as a method to specifically select the VOCs from exhaled breath. The workflow was implemented as the ptairMS software, which contains a graphical interface to facilitate cohort management and data analysis. The approach was validated on both simulated and experimental datasets, and we showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the VOC detection reached 99% and 98.4%, respectively, and that the error of quantification was below 8.1% for concentrations down to 19 ppb.

This case series study was conducted to determine the incidence rate and the course of Covid-19 infection in MS/NMOSD patients treated with Rituximab. METHODS: In this study, we designed a web-based questionnaire. Baseline information such as patient- reported walking disability, total number of Rituximab infusions received, delayed injections, occurrence of any relapse, and the use of corticosteroids during the pandemic were collected. Also, information regarding the Covid-19 pandemic such as adherence to self-isolation, any recent exposure to an infected individual and the presence of suggestive symptoms were collected. In case of positive test results, patients were grouped into 2 categories; mild to moderate and seriously ill and outcomes were evaluated as favorable (improved/ discharged) and unfavorable (expired). RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-eight patients with Multiple Sclerosis were enrolled in this study, 9 of the subjects (3.4%) were confirmed positive for Covid-19, five of which required hospitalizations (55.5%), two patients required ICU admission (22.2%) and 2 two patients died (22.2%). None of these patients ever mentioned using corticosteroids during the pandemic.

Retrospective study comparing RDN to HLDN in a collaborative transplant network. 176 patients were included, 72 in RDN and 104 in HLDN. Left-sided nephrectomy was favored in RDN (82% vs 52%, p < 0.01). Operative time was longer in RDN (287 vs 160 min; p < 0.01), while warm ischemia time was similar (221 vs 213 secs, p = 0.446). The hospital stay was shorter in RDN (3.9 vs 5.7 days, p < 0.01).Concerning renal function, a slightpersistent increase of 7% of the creatinine ratio was observed in the RDN compared to the HLDN group (1.56 vs 1.44 at 1-month checkup, p < 0.01). The results show that RDN appears safe and efficient in comparison to the gold-standard HLDN technique. Warm ischemia time was similar for both techniques, whereas RDN operative time was longer. Patients undergoing RDN had a shorter hospital stay, this being possibly mitigated by differences in center release criteria.

Applying both hierarchical and k-means clustering, we identified three regional groups: regions in cluster 1 exhibited higher prevalence and the highest trend of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases; those classified into cluster 2 constituted an intermediate group; those in cluster 3 were regions with a lower prevalence and the lowest trend of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. At the provincial level, we used a similar approach but working on the prevalence and trend of the total SARS-CoV-2 cases. Notably, provinces in cluster 1 exhibited the highest prevalence and trend of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Provinces in clusters 2 and 3, instead, showed a median prevalence of approximately 11 cases per 10,000 residents. However, provinces in cluster 3 were those with the lowest trend of cases. K-means clustering yielded to an alternative cluster solution in terms of the prevalence and trend of SARS-CoV-2 cases.

The screening program increased the dataset of known RNA motif-small molecule binding partners by 20-fold.

Herein, we report an antimicrobial, antiviral, and antibiofouling trifunctional polymer that can be easily coated onto the surface of medical protective clothing to effectively prevent pathogen contamination on the PPE. The coating layer is formed on the surfaces of PPE by the simple spray coating of an aqueous solution of the trifunctional polymer, poly(dodecyl methacrylate (DMA)Cpoly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA)Cquaternary ammonium (QA)). To establish an optimal ratio of antifouling and antimicrobial functional groups, we performed antifouling, antibacterial, and antiviral tests using four different ratios of the polymers. Antifouling and bactericidal results were assessed using Staphylococcus aureus, a typical pathogenic bacterium that induces an upper respiratory infection. Regardless of the molar ratio, polymer-coated PPE surfaces showed considerable antiadhesion (65C75%) and antibacterial (75C87%) efficacies soon after being in contact with pathogens and maintained their capability for at least 24 h, which is sufficient for disposable PPEs. Further antiviral tests using coronaviruses showed favorable results with PPE coated at two specific ratios (3.5:6:0.5 and 3.5:5.5:1) of poly(DMA-PEGMA-QA).

Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for two-thirds of the newly HIV-infected cases in the world. Similarly, the prevalence of HIV infections among Ethiopian university students has also increased as HIV prevention was not sufficiently prioritized. In order to decrease the surge of the HIV pandemic, prevention messages that encourage individuals to reduce sexual and risk behaviors still remain a key intervention strategy. Besides this, the behavioral response to HIV prevention messages among Ethiopian universities is not well studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess students behavioral response to HIV/AIDS prevention messages in selected universities of the Amhara region using an extended parallel process model (EPPM), in 2019. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was employed among 423 eligible students from January to February, 2019 using a stratified sampling technique. The dependent variable is response to HIV/AIDS prevention messages (danger control and fear control) which is addressed by EPPM. The model explains the components of threat (perceived susceptibility and perceived severity) and efficacy (response efficacy and self-efficacy). Subtracting wings of threat component score from efficacy wings score gives the critical value. If the critical value had positive scores, it showed responses of danger control; if the critical value was negative, it showed response of fear control. A logistic regression model was fitted to assess the association between the dependent and independent variables. RESULTS: The response rate of this study was 94.6%. Among 400 respondents, 263 (65.8%; 95%CI: 61C70) of them were in the danger control response whereas 137 (34.2%; 95%CI: 30C 39) were in fear control response. Moreover, 200 (50%) of the participants had adequate knowledge and 180 (45%) had a favorable attitude towards HIV/AIDS prevention messages. Danger control response for HIV prevention messages was higher among first-year students (AOR=5.5; 95%CI: 1.5C19) and third-year students (AOR=3.9; 95%CI: 2C14) compared with fifth-year students. Similarly, those students who reside on the campus were 60% times less likely to develop danger control when compared with students who live with their family (AOR=0.4; 95%CI: 0.2C0.9). Besides this, students who had adequate knowledge (AOR=2.6; 95%CI: 1.5C4.5) and students who receive fear-inducer messages (AOR=4.5; 95%CI: 3C25] were more likely to develop danger control responses. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: Nearly two-thirds of the participants were in the danger control response. Year of study, with whom students currently live, type of message they received, and the knowledge level of respondents were the factors associated with students response to HIV/AIDS prevention messages. Therefore, the messages must aim at enhancing threat component perception with appropriate efficacy messages to control danger and promote behavioral change.","output":"Behavioral Response to HIV/AIDS Prevention Messages Among Students in Selected Universities of Amhara Region, Northwest Ethiopia: An Extended Parallel Process Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two thalamic sites are of especial significance for understanding hippocampal - diencephalic interactions: the anterior thalamic nuclei and nucleus reuniens.

Adolescents may face huge psychological challenges in the process of changing family structures and relationships. To date, no mental health survey of adolescents from two-child families has been conducted. We investigated the prevalence and risk factors for childhood trauma, anxiety, and depression in two-child families in a statistically representative sample of Chinese senior high school students from Shanghai. A total of 426 participants were randomly selected from 1,059 students of four senior high schools in different districts of Shanghai. The childhood trauma questionnaire-short form (CTQ-SF), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) were used as the screening tools. We found that the overall prevalence of childhood trauma, anxiety, and depression among senior high school students in two-child families was 46.70% (95% CI, 39.93C53.47%), 22.17% (95% CI, 16.53C27.81%), and 35.85% (95% CI, 29.34C42.36%), respectively.

However, few studies have been reported on developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and their performance. This study shows steps on how to develop different ddPCR SAR-CoV-2 assays including higher order multiplex assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and antiviral screening. Methods: Using multiple primer/probe sets, we developed, optimized, and analyzed the performance of simplex (1 target), duplex (2 targets), triplex probe mix (3 targets), and quadruplex (4 targets) SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR assays based on a two-color ddPCR detection system. Results: Results showed that the quadruplex assay had similar limits of detection and accuracy to the lower multiplex assays. Analyzing 94 clinical samples demonstrated that the ddPCR triplex probe mix assay had better sensitivity than the RT-qPCR assay. Additionally, the ddPCR multiplex assay showed that remdesivir could inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro while another testing drug could not. Conclusion: Our research shows that developing multiplex ddPCR assays is possible by combing probe mix and amplitude-based multiplexing, which will help in developing multiplexed ddPCR assays for different SARS-CoV-2 applications.","output":"Developing multiplex ddPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on probe mix and amplitude based multiplexing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data on knowledge and fear of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and perceived stress were collected in July 2020 from a convenience sample of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong by asking participants to take part in three questionnaires.

However, inaccurate size(s) and location(s) of DG units increase power losses and associated Annual Financial Losses (AFL). A comprehensive review of the literature reveals that existing analytical, metaheuristic and hybrid algorithms employed on DG allocation problems trap in local or global optima resulting in higher power losses. To address these limitations, this article develops a parallel hybrid Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm and Salp Swarm Algorithm (AOASSA) for the optimal sizing and placement of DGs in the RDNs. The proposed parallel hybrid AOASSA enables the mutual benefit of both algorithms, i.e., the exploration capability of the SSA and the exploitation capability of the AOA. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been analyzed against the hybrid Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (AOAPSO), Salp Swarm Algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (SSAPSO), standard AOA, SSA, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. The results obtained reveals that the proposed algorithm produces quality solutions and minimum power losses in RDNs. The Power Loss Reduction (PLR) obtained with the proposed algorithm has also been validated against recent analytical, metaheuristic and hybrid optimization algorithms with the help of three cases based on the number of DG units allocated. Using the proposed algorithm, the PLR and associated AFL reduction of the 33-bus and 69-bus RDNs improved to 65.51% and 69.14%, respectively.

Kinins play a major role during acute inflammation by regulating vasodilatation and vascular permeability and by modulating adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Kinin system activation occurs in patients with ANCA vasculitis. Previous studies in animal models of GN and sclerosing kidney diseases have demonstrated protective effects of bradykinin receptor 1 (B1R) blockade via interference with myeloid cell trafficking. METHODS: To investigate the role of B1R in a murine model of MPO-ANCA GN, we evaluated effects of B1R genetic ablation and pharmacologic blockade. We used bone marrow chimeric mice to determine the role of B1R in bone marrow-derived cells (leukocytes) versus nonbone marrow-derived cells. We elucidated mechanisms of B1R effects using in vitro assays for MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation, endothelial adherence, endothelial transmigration, and neutrophil adhesion molecule surface display. RESULTS: B1R deficiency or blockade prevented or markedly reduced ANCA-induced glomerular crescents, necrosis, and leukocyte influx in mice. B1R was not required for in vitro MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Leukocyte B1R deficiency, but not endothelial B1R deficiency, decreased glomerular neutrophil infiltration induced by MPO-ANCA in vivo. B1R enhanced ANCA-induced neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration in vitro. ANCA-activated neutrophils exhibited changes in Mac-1 and LFA-1, important regulators of neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration: ANCA-activated neutrophils increased surface expression of Mac-1 and increased shedding of LFA-1, whereas B1R blockade reduced these effects. CONCLUSIONS: The leukocyte B1R plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MPO-ANCA-induced GN in a mouse model by modulating neutrophil-endothelial interaction. B1R blockade may have potential as a therapy for ANCA GN and vasculitis.","output":"Kinin B1 Receptor Is Important in the Pathogenesis of Myeloperoxidase-Specific ANCA GN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The practice of using race or ethnicity in medicine to explain differences between individuals is being called into question because it may contribute to biased medical care and research that perpetuates health disparities and structural racism.

In this study, we sought to evaluate the dynamic changes of immunological and radiographic features, and the association with the outcome of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Peripheral blood samples and radiographic data were collected longitudinally for up to 8 weeks from 158 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. The chest computed tomography (CT) scans were scored based on a semi-quantification assessment according to the extent of pulmonary abnormalities; the temporal change of the immunological and radiographic features was analyzed. Results: Compared with mild and moderate patients, severe patients had significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and CD19(+) B cells but dramatically elevated counts of neutrophils and levels of interleukin (IL)-6. Sequential monitoring showed a sustained increase in lymphocytes counts and significantly decreased levels of IL-6 in severe patients during the disease course. Notably, patients with persistent pulmonary lesions (CT score  5 in week 8) showed high levels of IL-6 during the follow-up period, compared with those with recovery lesions (CT score < 5 in week 8). More importantly, the peak expression of IL-6 prior to the aggravated lung injury was mainly found in patients with persistent lesions, and multivariate analysis showed that IL-6 level upon admission was an independent factor associated with the persistent pulmonary injury. Conclusion: Prolonged elevation of IL-6 is associated with persistent pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients.

Here we show that Omicron BA.1 has higher affinity for ACE2 compared to Delta, and confers very significant evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralising antibodies after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralisation. Importantly, antiviral drugs remdesevir and molnupiravir retain efficacy against Omicron BA.1. We found that in human nasal epithelial 3D cultures replication was similar for both Omicron and Delta. However, in lower airway organoids, Calu-3 lung cells and gut adenocarcinoma cell lines live Omicron virus demonstrated significantly lower replication in comparison to Delta. We noted that despite presence of mutations predicted to favour spike S1/S2 cleavage, the spike protein is less efficiently cleaved in live Omicron virions compared to Delta virions. We mapped the replication differences between the variants to entry efficiency using spike pseudotyped virus (PV) entry assays. The defect for Omicron PV in specific cell types correlated with higher cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2, and accordingly knock down of TMPRSS2 impacted Delta entry to a greater extent as compared to Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently utilises the cellular protease TMPRSS2 that mediates cell entry via plasma membrane fusion. Instead, we demonstrate that Omicron spike has greater dependency on cell entry via the endocytic pathway requiring the activity of endosomal cathepsins to cleave spike. Consistent with suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and inability to utilise TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by the Omicron spike was dramatically impaired compared to the Delta spike. Overall, Omicron appears to have gained significant evasion from neutralising antibodies whilst maintaining sensitivity to antiviral drugs targeting the polymerase. Omicron has shifted cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2 expressing cells that are enriched in cells found in the lower respiratory and GI tracts, with implications for altered pathogenesis.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike mediated immune escape, infectivity and cell-cell fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With the start of the Coronavirus disease19 (COVID19) pandemic, the Coronavirus has mutated constantly. Recently a new variant called Delta plus has been reported in few countries, including South Africa, Brazil and India. The Delta plus variant contains an additional mutation called K417N on the coronavirus spike. The present study aims to determine the virulence and transmissibility of the Delta plus variant and to check the efficiency of different antibodies on its neutralization. Materials: and Methods Different computational tools such as PROVEAN, an online tool, HOPE server, simulation using CABS Flex, Clus pro, an online docking tool, were used to predict the structure and function of Delta plus variant by performing a comparative study with wild type protein. Also, to find an effective antibody against Delta plus variant, antigen-antibody docking studies were conducted through Clus pro server. Furthermore, we performed a 2D interaction diagram analysis to find the amino acid residue's interaction against antibodies. Results: PROVEAN and HOPE showed the mutation (K417N) in the S-glycoprotein of Delta plus as NEUTRAL mutation. This mutation causes the loss of cysteine bonds leading to the destabilization of the 3D structure of spike protein. Furthermore, the RMSF plot emphasizing the 17 th amino acid position of wild and Delta plus mutant revealed the high fluctuation of mutant protein structure compared to the wild protein structure. Further, a comparative docking study against hACE2 shows higher binding energy of wild-type RBD (-751.7 kcal/mol) than mutant RBD (-750.1 kcal/mol). Moreover, antigen-antibody docking study revealed higher affinity of BD-23 Fab antibodies with greater interaction energy ( -997 kcal/mol) compared to other antibodies and thus may prove to be a promising therapeutic against Delta plus variant. Conclusion: Delta plus variant is less stable, has a lower binding affinity to hACE2 and has less virulence than wild type. However, the BD-23 Fab antibody has shown a more significant association for this variant and can be used in its treatment.","output":"Delta plus variant with neutral mutation is less virulent compared to wild type SARS-CoV2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of people worldwide. An increase in perceived stress can lead to unhealthy behaviors such as increased food consumption. The aim of this study was to find the level of perceived stress and its relationship with increased food consumption during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. This was a cross-sectional study that employed anonline self-reported frequency of consumption questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale-10. A total of 637 subjects participated and 83.6% of respondents had moderate or high stressmore prevalent in the female and young respondents. Moreover, 36.1% of respondents reported that they had increased the frequency of consumption of some foods, mainly nuts, snacks, and jellybeans, along with coffee, tea, cocoa, and soft drinks. Eating between meals was more pronounced in those with high stress (65.1%) than in those with moderate stress (40.4%) and low stress (20.2%). Furthermore, the respondents with high stress reported greater weight gain.

METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted from inception to December 2017 using MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. Studies were included if they specifically concerned older people (65 years) with limited life expectancy, including those residing in any type of aged care facility, or were based on representative patient profiles. Results were analyzed inspired by the Joanna Briggs Institute's method for synthesis of qualitative data. Studies were characterized using a checklist for reporting of qualitative research. RESULTS Eight studies were included. Six studies explored health care professionals' views on deprescribing in general, and two studies focused specifically on psychotropic agents. All eight studies explored the views of physicians, mostly general practitioners, while three studies also considered other health care professionals. Four themes related to health care professionals' attitudes towards deprescribing were identified: (i) patient and relative involvement; (ii) the importance of teamwork; (iii) health care professionals' self-assurance and skills; and (iv) the impact of organizational factors. Within each of these themes, 3-4 subthemes were identified and analysed. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that health care professionals' decisions to engage in deprescribing activities with older people with limited life expectancy depend on multiple factors which are highly interdependent.

Nowadays, compounds of natural origin constitute fundaments of material science, and the trend is called from nature to nature. Although biopolymers have found a broad range of applications in biomedical sciences, they do not present anti-microbial activity, and their physicochemical properties are rather poor. Biopolymers, however, may be modified with organic and inorganic additives which enhance their properties. Tannic acid, like phenolic acid, is classified into a polyphenolic group and can be isolated from natural sources, e.g., a pure compound or a component of a plant extract. Numerous studies have been carried out over the application of tannic acid as an additive to biopolymer materials due to its unique properties. On the one hand, it shows antimicrobial and antiviral activity, while on the other hand, it reveals promising biological properties, i.e., enhances the cell proliferation, tissue regeneration and wound healing processes. Tannic acid is added to different biopolymers, collagen and polysaccharides as chitosan, agarose and starch. Its activity has been proven by the determination of physicochemical properties, as well as the performance of in vitro and in vivo studies.

Besides ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are used for cardiovascular diseases. Although no sig-nificant increase in the risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection and no increase in the severity of disease in patients receving ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy were shown, it has been noticed that some patients have tendency to stop the use of these agents. The aim of this study is to determine the behavior attitude of the cardiovascular outpatients during pandemic who use ACE inhibitor/ARB and to asses the impact of COVID-19 on them. Material and Methods: One hundred outpatients were in-cluded. A survey questioning the social, psychological and the clinical implications of COVID-19 was applied to volunteers. To measure the anxiety and despair levels, Beck scorings were used. Results: A small num-ber of patients stopped using ACE inhibitors/ARBs. Severe hopelessness and severe anxiety levels were seen in a few patient. Gender, fear of get-ting sick, thinking to have enough information about COVID-19 and ac-cessibilty to cardiovascular drugs were the factors affecting the Beck scores. Social distancing and cleaning hands are stated as the best measures for protection. Most of the patients preferred primary health clinics for routine controls and a few patient had knowledge about tele-medicine. Conclusion: Although a confusion has occured in the public about the use of ACE inhibitors/ARBs, drug release rates were found to be low. The anxiety and disparity levels are subsantially not severe.

Post-COVID-19 multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C) is a severe post-COVID-19 complication in pediatric patients. Ocular manifestations may be the first presentation of MIS-C, wherein prompt treatment may improve outcomes. In this systematic review, we aimed to summarize the acute and sub-acute ocular manifestations in pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Methods: We included all online primary studies, with no language restriction and published between January 1, 2019 and November 18, 2020, reporting any acute or sub-acute ocular manifestations in children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. PubMed/MEDLINE was searched using the following MeSH and Emtree terms: eye, ophthalmologic, ocular, vision, conjunctivitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, corona, 2019-nCoV, COVID19, and COVID. The eligibility and quality of the selected records were assessed by two independent reviewers as per the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review. Results: A total of 1,192 records were identified electronically. Seven papers were extracted from the reference lists of the eligible records. Thirty-six papers met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into two subgroups according to acute or sub-acute presentation of ocular manifestations. Among 463 pediatric patients with COVID-19, 72 (15.5%) had acute ocular manifestations. There was one patient with central retinal vein occlusion and another with photophobia and diplopia associated with meningoencephalitis. Among 895 pediatric patients with post-COVID-19 MIS-C, 469 (52.4%) had ocular manifestations, which only included non-purulent conjunctivitis. Conclusions: Ocular manifestations have been reported in less than one-fifth of pediatric patients with acute COVID-19. Furthermore, conjunctivitis was the only ocular manifestation reported in half of the patients with MIS-C, and it may be missed easily due to its non-purulent nature.

Stochasticity in transmission within and between countries and/or actual advantage in virus transmissibility could explain the high frequency reached by some genomic variants during the course of the outbreak. Using a suite of statistical, population genetics, and theoretical approaches, we show that the globally most represented spike protein variant (i.e., the G clade, A  G nucleotide change at genomic position 23,403; D  G amino acid change at spike protein position 614) i) underwent a significant demographic expansion in most countries not explained by stochastic effects or enhanced pathogenicity; ii) affects the spike S1/S2 furin-like site increasing its conformational plasticity (short range effect), and iii) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect). Our study unambiguously links the spread of the G614 with a non-random process, and we hypothesize that this process is related to the selective advantage produced by a specific structural modification of the spike protein. We conclude that the different conformation of the S1/S2 proteolytic site is at the basis of the higher transmission rate of this invasive SARS-CoV-2 variant, and provide structural information to guide the design of selective and efficient drugs.","output":"Unveiling diffusion pattern and structural impact of the most invasive SARS-CoV-2 spike mutation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events.

METHODS: In February 2020, we searched four databases, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase and Web of Science, from inception to 5 February 2020 for papers published in English or Italian in peer-reviewed journals reporting on primary research exploring childrens social activities during unplanned school closures. Main findings were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures, but contact remained common. All studies reported children leaving the home or being cared for by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age (two studies) and parental disagreement (two studies) with closure were predictive of children leaving the home, and mixed evidence regarding the relationship between infection status and such. Parental agreement with closure was generally high, but some disagreed because of perceived low risk of infection and issues regarding childcare and financial impact. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that many children continue to leave home and mix with others during school closures despite public health recommendations to avoid social contact.

At the same time, human activities beyond agriculture have often driven the emergence of diseases. The more that humans expand the footprint of the global population, encroach into natural habitats, alter these habitats to extract resources and intensify food production, as well as move animals, people and commodities along with the pathogens they carry, the greater the potential for pathogens and pests to spread and for infection to emerge or re\\\\emerge. While essential to human well\\\\being, producing food also plays a major role in disease dynamics. The risk of emergence of pests and pathogens has increased as a consequence of global changes in the way food is produced, moved and consumed. Climate change is likely to increase pressure on the availability of food and provide newly suitable conditions for invasive pests and pathogens. Human population displacements due to economic, political and humanitarian crises represent another set of potential drivers for emerging issues. The overlapping drivers of plant, animal and human disease emergence and environmental changes point towards the concept of One Health. This paradigm underlines the urgent need to understand the influence of human behaviour and incorporate this understanding into our approach to emerging risks. For this, we face two major challenges. One is cultural; the second is methodological. We have to look at systems not under the narrow view of specific hazards but with a wider approach to system dynamics, and consider a broad spectrum of potential outcomes in terms of risk.

After 4 years of field and market research, this study includes interviews with stakeholders in the VCs, integrates different types of VCs, and further analyzes the VCs. GR characteristics were also assessed; the length and upper-middle diameter of the collected samples were measured, and the effective components of the samples were determined to rank the GR samples according to their quality. The effective components were further analyzed by the K-means clustering method. Concomitantly, the local price (the sales price of the place where the medicinal materials are produced) and market price (the sale price of medicinal materials in the market) of GR in Chifeng, Inner Mongolia, and Anguo, Hebei, were documented, and the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) method was used to predict the GR price. Ten VCs are summarized in this article. The results showed that the income of the staff at the beginning of the VC is inadequate. Regarding GR origin, Inner Mongolia GR showed higher quality than that of other areas. As a result, the price of medicinal materials is relatively high, which corresponds to the market price of the survey. The forecast results showed that the market price of GR would increase slightly in the future, which could provide reference for the selection of medicinal materials cultivation in the future.

The need for RRT/HD was significantly higher in patients with diabetes (21% vs 11% p = 0.013) as well as the need for vasopressors (28% vs 18% p = 0.023). Only age was found to be an independent predictor of mortality. We found no significant differences in inpatient mortality p = 0.856, need for RRT/HD p = 0.429, need for intubation p = 1.000 and need for vasopressors p = 0.471 in African-Americans with diabetes when compared to non-African-Americans. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 and diabetes tend to have more severe disease and poorer clinical outcomes. African-American patients with diabetes did not differ in outcomes or disease severity when compared to non-African-American patients.","output":"The relationship between diabetes and clinical outcomes in COVID-19: a single-center retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To screen the severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) mimotopes with random phage peptide library and to investigate their immunogenicity.

In addition, we also propose the significance of various anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic phytochemicals in the treatment of COVID-19. The virus induces many immune-modulatory cytokines and chemokines which help in the intravascular coagulation and create a pro-thrombotic environment along with pulmonary embolism and thrombocytopenia. Different types of innate and adaptive immune cells and their granular contents regulate the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial and platelet dysfunctions which correlate the involvement of platelets with myocardial injury and intravascular thrombi directly or indirectly.

No effective prophylactic or post-exposure treatments are available, although some anti-inflammatory compounds are currently in clinical trials. Studies of plant extracts and natural compounds show that polyphenols can play a beneficial role in the prevention and the progress of chronic diseases related to inflammation. The aim of this manuscript is to review the published background on the possible effectiveness of polyphenols to fight SARS-COV-2 infection, contributing to the reduction of inflammation. Here, some of the anti-inflammatory therapies are discussed and although great progress has been made though this year, there is no proven cytokine blocking agents for COVID currently used in clinical practice. In this regard, bioactive phytochemicals such as polyphenols may become promising tools to be used as adjuvants in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to shift this balance in either direction, because the crisis is not only causing serious economic damage but is also highlighting the usefulness of expert warnings. The current work examines the balance between public prioritisation of environment and economy in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A nationally representative YouGov sample of 1654 UK adults were presented with two political speeches, either linking COVID-19 to climate and prioritising environment as part of planned economic recovery, or separating the issues and stating that environmental prioritisation is now unaffordable. Most participants (62%) were positive towards the environmental prioritisation speech, and it was more popular than the other speech (which 36% were positive towards). The same proportion of Conservative voters (62%) were positive towards the environmental prioritisation speech (with 50% positive towards the other speech). Higher support for the environmental prioritisation speech was associated with more education but not with socioeconomic status. Voting history and socioeconomic status were therefore less predictive of differences in support for the speeches than expected based on previous research. Consistent with these results is the suggestion that environmental concern in the UK is becoming less tied to social identity and more tied to concern for personal well-being. These findings suggest that foregrounding environmental concerns is politically realistic in post-COVID-19 economic policy, consistent with suggestions from economists and environmental scientists that an environmental focus is feasible and necessary. ? 2021, PsychOpen.

Because no study to date has focused on maternal and child effects of HIV and ZIKV co-infection in pregnant women, we undertook the International Prospective Cohort Study of HIV and Zika in Infants and Pregnancy (HIV ZIP). The aims of this two-phase study of pregnant women and their infants are to compare the incidence of ZIKV infection among pregnant women with and without HIV infection and to determine the risk of adverse maternal and child outcomes associated with ZIKV/HIV co-infection at clinical sites in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the continental United States. Phase I was designed to enroll pregnant women/infant pairs who were: (1) infected with HIV only, (2) infected with ZIKV only, (3) infected with HIV and ZIKV, and (4) not infected with either HIV or ZIKV. A key goal of this phase was to assess the feasibility of enrolling 200 women/infant pairs within a year, with a target of 150 WLHIV, 50 HIV-uninfected women, and a minimum of 20 who were co-infected with HIV and ZIKV. If the feasibility of Phase I proved successful, Phase II would enroll up to 1,800 additional pregnant women/infant pairs to the same four groups. Enrolled women in both phases were to be followed throughout their pregnancy and up to 6 weeks post-partum. Infants were also to be followed for 1 year after birth. To date, Phase 1 data collection and follow-up have been completed. Delineation of possible harmful effects of HIV/ZIKV co-infection will allow the formulation of standard-of-care recommendations to minimize adverse effects but enable the continuation of preventive HIV therapy. Furthermore, while the prospective HIV ZIP study was developed before the COVID pandemic, it is especially relevant today since it can be easily adapted to provide critically important information on the impact of COVID-19 infection or other still unrecognized new agents among pregnant women and their offspring worldwide.","output":"An International Prospective Cohort Study of HIV and Zika in Infants and Pregnancy (HIV ZIP): Study Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Migrant workers returning to native places in COVID-19 times were the host for urban to rural transmission of cases as the migrant-receiving states witnessed over five times increase in the number of districts having a more significant concentration of COVID-19 cases from 1 May to 31 May 2020 There is an urgent need for the skill mapping of the migrant workforce and creating social security schemes to protect them under any socio-economic or health emergency","output":"Reverse migration of labourers amidst COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Adrenal insufficiency has various nonspecific symptoms, which are often overlooked until the patient presents with a life-threatening adrenal crisis.

The virus exists in a wide variety of genetically distinct viral types, and both phylogenetic analysis and measures of pairwise similarity among nucleotide or amino acid sequences have been used to classify IBV strains. However, there is currently no consensus on the method by which IBV sequences should be compared, and heterogeneous genetic group designations that are inconsistent with phylogenetic history have been adopted, leading to the confusing coexistence of multiple genotyping schemes. Herein, we propose a simple and repeatable phylogeny-based classification system combined with an unambiguous and rationale lineage nomenclature for the assignment of IBV strains. By using complete nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene we determined the phylogenetic structure of IBV, which in turn allowed us to define 6 genotypes that together comprise 32 distinct viral lineages and a number of inter-lineage recombinants. Because of extensive rate variation among IBVs, we suggest that the inference of phylogenetic relationships alone represents a more appropriate criterion for sequence classification than pairwise sequence comparisons. The adoption of an internationally accepted viral nomenclature is crucial for future studies of IBV epidemiology and evolution, and the classification scheme presented here can be updated and revised novel S1 sequences should become available.","output":"S1 gene-based phylogeny of infectious bronchitis virus: An attempt to harmonize virus classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is growing interest in far-UVC lighting, defined as wavelengths from 200 to 230 nm, because research has demonstrated these wavelengths to be an effective antimicrobial technology while posing a minimal hazard to human health. Far-UVC lighting is now being installed to directly irradiate spaces where humans are present, and it will be important to perform measurements to verify far-UVC lighting installations are operating within widely accepted exposure guidelines. In this work, we explore the use of a commercially available film, known as OrthoChromic OC-1, to measure ultraviolet radiation exposure. The film was tested with a variety of ultraviolet wavelengths and irradiance conditions, and the color change of the film was analyzed for increasing levels of radiant exposure. The film response extended over a dynamic range that was greater than the recommended exposure limits for far-UVC radiation so it can potentially be useful for health hazard monitoring. The spectrum of the incident ultraviolet radiation strongly affected the response of the film; therefore, for accurate measurements we recommend the measured spectrum match the spectrum used for calibration. Overall, dosimetry with this film provides a simple, accurate, and inexpensive method of quantifying ultraviolet radiation exposure that is suitable for far-UVC measurements.","output":"Improved Ultraviolet Radiation Film Dosimetry Using OrthoChromic OC-1 Film"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a major reason for tumor metastasis, circulating tumor cell (CTC) is one of the critical biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

There remains a pressing need for additional pulmonary supportive care measures, especially techniques that do not require systemic anticoagulation. The objective of our experiments was to determine whether systemic oxygenation could be increased in a large animal, with induced hypoxia, by perfusing the abdominal cavity with oxygenated perfluorocarbons. METHODS: Fifteen pigs with a mean ( SD) weight of 45  5 kg were intubated and rendered hypoxic by ventilating them with a blend of nitrogen and oxygen to achieve subatmospheric concentrations of inspired oxygen ranging from 18 to 10%, resulting in baseline mean Pao(2) range of 65.9  9.7 to 26.6  2.8 mm Hg, respectively. Peritoneal perfusion was performed in eight animals with oxygenated perfluorocarbon and in seven control animals with oxygenated saline solution. RESULTS: The average increase in Pao(2) with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion, compared to oxygenated saline solution perfusion, ranged from 8.1 to 18.2 mm Hg. A common treatment effect was estimated across all fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2)) values, representing the average mean difference in oxygen uptake between oxygenated perfluorocarbon and saline solution, irrespective of the level of Fio(2). This average was 12.8 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 7.4 to 18.2; p < 0.001). The most clinically relevant results occurred at an Fio(2) of 14%, resulting in a baseline mean Pao(2) of 39.4  5.0 mm Hg with oxygenated saline solution perfusion, and a mean Pao(2) of 55.3  7.6 mm Hg with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion. This corresponded to an increase in arterial oxygen saturation from 73 to 89%. CONCLUSION: These results of our principle experiments demonstrate that the peritoneal cavity can be used for gas exchange and, in our model, yielded clinically relevant increases in systemic arterial oxygen levels. This technique may have the potential for the supportive care of patients dying from hypoxia in the setting of reversible lung injury.","output":"Peritoneal Perfusion With Oxygenated Perfluorocarbon Augments Systemic Oxygenation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Life expectancy can be estimated accurately from a cohort of individuals born in the same year and followed from birth to death. Due to the difficult and time-consuming nature of following a cohort prospectively, life expectancy is often assessed based on death data, which may lead to potentially biased estimates. This is more likely to be a problem in rare diseases such as Morquio syndrome A. Method: To investigate how accurate the estimation of life expectancy is using death data, we simulate the survival of individuals with Morquio syndrome A under four different survival scenarios. In each scenario, we estimate the mean and median survival times within a defined period and compare them with the true life expectancy. Results: When life expectancy is constant during the entire period, using death data does not result in a biased estimate of life expectancy. However, when life expectancy increases during the follow-up period, using only death data leads to a substantial underestimation of life expectancy. Conclusion: Life expectancy can change over time, along with changes in the environment and/or biomedical innovation. When the life expectancy is increasing --- as is often expected to be the case in rare diseases --- estimating it based on contemporary death data will result in a downward bias. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how estimates of life expectancy are obtained and to interpret them in an appropriate context, and to assess estimation methods within a sensitivity analysis framework, similar to the simulations performed herein.","output":"Understanding bias when estimating life expectancy from age at death: A simulation approach applied to Morquio Syndrome A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Wikipedia Collaboration of Dental Schools (WCODS) is a student-led initiative that aims to publish high quality scientific, evidence-based dental content on the Wikipedia online encyclopaedia by equipping its members to use research, critical appraisal and writing skills to create accurate content.

In this report we examined the contribution of IFN-inducible phosphorylation-activation of specific signaling effectors to protection from infection by a SARS-related murine coronavirus, MHV-1.

Organizational empowerment practices in hospitals likely shape the psychological experiences of empowerment among these personnel;however, little is known about this relationship. Objective: We used qualitative inquiry to explore the relationship between organizational empowerment structural components and feelings of psychological empowerment among hospital frontline workers during a public health emergency. Methods: : Kanters Theory of Structural Empowerment and Spreitzers Psychological Empowerment in the Workplace Framework were applied to identify the conceptual influences of organizational practices on psychological experiences of empowerment. In-depth interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of NAs, caring for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Directed content analysis was performed to generate a data matrix consisting of the psychological experiences of meaning, competence, self-determination, and impact embedded under the organizational structural components of information, resources, support, and opportunity. Results: : Thirteen NAs (mean age= 42 years, 92% female) completed interviews. Information , or lack thereof, provided to the NAs influenced feelings of fear, preparation, and autonomy. Resources (e.g., protocols, equipment, and person-power) made it easier to cope with overwhelming emotions, affected the NAs abilities to do their jobs, and when limited, drove NAs to take on new roles. NAs noted that support was mostly provided by nurses and made the NAs feel appreciated, desiring to contribute more. While NAs felt they could consult leadership when needed, several felt leadership showed little appreciation for their roles and contributions. Similar to support, the opportunity to take care of COVID-19 patients yielded a diverse array of emotions, exposed advances and gaps in NA preparation, and challenged NAs to autonomously develop new care practices and processes. Conclusion: Management and empowerment of healthcare workers are critical to hospital performance and success. We found many ways in which the NAs psychological experiences of empowerment were shaped by the healthcare systems empowerment-related structural conditions during a public health emergency. To further develop an empowered and committed critical workforce, hospitals must acknowledge the organizational practice influence on the psychological experiences of empowerment among NAs.","output":"The Influence of Empowered Work Environments on the Psychological Experiences of Nursing Assistants During COVID-19: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: An increased tibial slope is a risk factor for rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. In addition, a tibial bone bruise or posterior lateral impression associated with slope changes also poses chronic ligamentous instability of the knee joint associated with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. In the majority of cases, the slope is measured in one plane X-ray in the lateral view. However, this does not sufficient represent the complex anatomy of the tibial plateau and especially for the posterolateral quadrant. Normal values from a \\"healthy\\" population are necessary to understand if stability of the knee joint is negatively affected by an increasing slope in the posterolateral area. Until now there are no data about the physiological slope in the posterolateral quadrant of the tibial plateau. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 116 MRI scans of patients without ligamentous lesions and 116 MRI scans with an ACL rupture, tibial slope was retrospectively determined using the method described by Hudek et al. Measurements were made in the postero-latero-lateral (PLL) and postero-latero-central (PLC) segments using the 10-segment classification. In both segments, the osseous as well as the cartilaginous slope was measured. Measurements were performed by two independent surgeons. RESULTS: In the group without ligamentous injury the mean bony PLL slope was 5.8  4.8 and the cartilaginous PLL slope was 6.7  4.8. In the PLC segment the mean bony slope was 6.6  5.0 and the cartilaginous slope was 9.4  5.7. In the cohort with ACL rupture, the bony and cartilaginous slope in both PLL and PCL were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than in the group without ACL injury (bony PLL 9.8  4.8, cartilage PLL 10.4  4.7, bony PLC 10.3  4.8, cartilage PLL 12.8  4.3). Measurements were performed independently by two experienced surgeons. There were good inter- (CI 87-98.7%) and good intraobserver (CI 85.8-99.6%) reliability. CONCLUSION: The bony and the cartilaginous slope in the posterolateral quadrant of the tibial plateau are different but not independent. Patients with an anterior cruciate ligament injury have a significantly steeper slope in the posterolateral quadrant compared to a healthy group. Our data indicate that this anatomic feature might be a risk factor for a primary ACL injury which has not been described yet.

This finding was robust to various estimates of susceptibility to infection in children relative to adults (up to 50%) and to estimates of various levels of concomitant reopening in the rest of the community, with minimal change in transmission when contact frequency in the rest of the community was returned up to 40% of baseline.

Thymoquinone (THQ), a main compound in black seed essential oils, has a variety of beneficial effects, including antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. On the other hand, scorpion venom peptides (SV) induce apoptosis in the cancer cells, making it a promising anticancer agent. THQ, SV, and Phospholipon(?) 90H (PL) were incorporated in a nano-based delivery platform to assess THQs cellular uptake and antiproliferative efficacy against a lung cancer cell line derived from human alveolar epithelial cells (A549). Several nanovesicles were prepared and optimized using factorial experimental design. The optimized phytosome formulation contained 79.0 mg of PL and 170.0 mg of SV, with vesicle size and zeta potential of 209.9 nm and 21.1 mV, respectively. The IC50 values revealed that A549 cells were significantly more sensitive to the THQ formula than the plain formula and THQ. Cell cycle analysis revealed that THQ formula treatment resulted in significant cell cycle arrest at the S phase, increasing cell population in this phase by 22.1%. Furthermore, the THQ formula greatly increased cell apoptosis (25.17%) when compared to the untreated control (1.76%), plain formula (11.96%), or THQ alone (13.18%). The results also indicated that treatment with THQ formula significantly increased caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, and p53 mRNA expression compared to plain formula and THQ. In terms of the inflammatory markers, THQ formula significantly reduced the activity of TNF- and NF-B in comparison with the plain formula and THQ only. Overall, the findings from the study proved that a phytosome formulation of THQ could be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.","output":"Phyto-Phospholipid Conjugated Scorpion Venom Nanovesicles as Promising Carrier That Improves Efficacy of Thymoquinone against Adenocarcinoma Human Alveolar Basal Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute febrile respiratory illness (FRI) leading to respiratory failure is a common reason for admission to the ICU. Viral pneumonia constitutes a portion of these cases, and often the viral etiology goes undiagnosed. Emerging viral infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza present with acute FRIs progressing to respiratory failure and ARDS. Therefore, early recognition of a viral cause of acute FRI leading to ARDS becomes important for protection of health-care workers (HCWs), lessening spread to other patients, and notification of public health officials. These patients often have longer courses of viral shedding and undergo higher-risk procedures that may potentially generate aerosols, such as intubation, bronchoscopy, bag-valve mask ventilation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and medication nebulization, further illustrating the importance of early detection and isolation. A small number of viral agents lead to acute FRI, respiratory failure, and ARDS: seasonal influenza, avian influenza, coronavirus associated with severe ARDS, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, varicella, human metapneumovirus, and hantavirus. A systematic approach to early isolation, testing for these agents, and public health involvement becomes important in dealing with acute FRI.

To address this discrepancy, this paper presents Leios. Leios is the first approach for systematically approximating arbitrary probabilistic programs that have discrete, or hybrid discrete-continuous random variables. The approximate programs have all their variables fully continualized. We show that once we have the fully continuous approximate program, we can perform inference and parameter estimation faster by exploiting the existing support that many languages offer for continuous distributions. Furthermore, we show that the estimates obtained when performing inference and parameter estimation on the continuous approximation are still comparably close to both the true parameter values and the estimates obtained when performing inference on the original model.","output":"Continualization of Probabilistic Programs With Correction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Southeast Asia was the first region to be affected outside China, and although COVID-19 cases have been reported in all countries of Southeast Asia, both the policies and epidemic trajectories differ substantially, potentially due to marked differences in social distancing measures that have been implemented by governments in the region. This paper studies the across-country relationships between social distancing and each populations response to policy, the subsequent effects of these responses to the transmissibility and epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2. The analysis couples COVID-19 case counts with real-time mobility data across Southeast Asia to estimate the effects of host population response to social distancing policy and the subsequent effects on the transmissibility and epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2. A novel inference strategy for the time-varying reproduction number is developed to allow explicit inference of the effects of social distancing on the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 through a regression structure. This framework replicates the observed epidemic trajectories across most Southeast Asian countries, provides estimates of the effects of social distancing on the transmissibility of disease and can simulate epidemic histories conditional on changes in the degree of intervention scenarios and compliance within Southeast Asia.","output":"Revealing regional disparities in the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 from interventions in Southeast Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of evidence based guidelines and many studies have been published to identify appropriate investigations that may be used as predictors of mortality and ITU admission.

This study aims to review the crosstalk between adipokines, myokines, and hepatokines. Far beyond understanding the actions of each biomarker alone, it is important to underline that these cytokines act together in the body, resulting in a complex network of actions in different tissues, which may have beneficial or non-beneficial effects on the genesis of various physiological disorders and their respective outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

The CBS-11, an 11-item tool specifically created for this study, was used to measure bullying behaviors towards COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: All items of the CBS-11 converged over a 1-factor solution with an eigenvalue over 1, accounting for a variance of 75.16%. The scale has a high Cronbachs alpha (.974), indicating excellent reliability. A positive correlation was found between the COVID-19 bullying scale and fear, anxiety, and stigma discrimination. The logistic regression showed that higher fear of COVID-19 (ORa = 1.04), a positive attitude toward COVID-19 preventive measures and hygiene recommendations (ORa = 1.18), higher stigma discrimination scores (ORa = 1.09), and having a health professional family member (ORa = 2.42) were significantly associated with bullying.

Understanding the demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased COVID-19 patients; and estimation of time-interval between symptom onset, hospital admission and death could inform public health interventions focusing on preventing mortality due to COVID-19. Methods: We obtained COVID-19 death summaries from the official dashboard of the Government of Tamil Nadu, between 10th May and July 10, 2020. Of the 1783 deaths, we included 1761 cases for analysis. Results: The mean age of the deceased was 62.5 years (SD: 13.7). The crude death rate was 2.44 per 100,000 population; the age-specific death rate was 22.72 among above 75 years and 0.02 among less than 14 years, and it was higher among men (3.5 vs 1.4 per 100,000 population). Around 85% reported having any one or more comorbidities; Diabetes (62%), hypertension (49.2%) and CAD (17.5%) were the commonly reported comorbidities. The median time interval between symptom onset and hospital admission was 4 days (IQR: 2, 7); admission and death was 4 days (IQR: 2, 7) with a significant difference between the type of admitting hospital. One-fourth of (24.2%) deaths occurred within a day of hospital admission. Conclusion: Elderly, male, people living in densely populated areas and people with underlying comorbidities die disproportionately due to COVID-19. While shorter time-interval between symptom onset and admission is essential, the relatively short time interval between admission and death is a concern and the possible reasons must be evaluated and addressed to reduce avoidable mortality.","output":"Who is dying from COVID-19 and when?

Such finger enslaving has predominantly been investigated for isometric force tasks. The aim of this study was to assess whether the extent of force enslaving is dependent on relative finger movements. Ten right-handed subjects (22-30 years) flexed the index finger while counteracting constant resistance forces (4, 6 and 8 N) orthogonal to the fingertip. The other, non-instructed fingers were held in extension. EMG activities of the mm. flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and extensor digitorum (ED) in the regions corresponding to the index, middle and ring fingers were measured. Forces exerted by the non-instructed fingers increased substantially (by 0.2 to 1.4 N) with flexion of the index finger, increasing the enslaving effect with respect to the static, pre-movement phase. Such changes in force were found 260-370 ms after the initiation of index flexion. The estimated MCP joint angle of the index finger at which forces exerted by the non-instructed fingers started to increase varied between 4 and 6. In contrast to the finger forces, no significant changes in EMG activity of the FDS regions corresponding to the non-instructed fingers upon index finger flexion were found. This mismatch between forces and EMG of the non-instructed fingers, as well as the delay in force development are in agreement with connective tissue linkages being slack when the positions of the fingers are similar, but pulled taut when one finger moves relative to the others. Although neural factors cannot be excluded, our results suggest that mechanical connections between muscle-tendon structures were (at least partly) responsible for the observed increase in force enslaving during index finger flexion.","output":"Timing and extent of finger force enslaving during a dynamic force task cannot be explained by EMG activity patterns."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Mechanical thrombectomy is beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke and a proximal anterior occlusion, but it is unclear if these results can be extrapolated to patients with an M2 occlusion. The purpose of this study was to examine the technical aspects, safety, and outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever in patients with an isolated M2 occlusion who were included in 3 large multicenter prospective studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS We included patients from the Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization (STAR), Solitaire With the Intention For Thrombectomy (SWIFT), and Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment (SWIFT PRIME) studies, 3 large multicenter prospective studies on thrombectomy for ischemic stroke. We compared outcomes and technical details of patients with an M2 with those with an M1 occlusion. All patients were treated with a stent retriever. Imaging data and outcomes were scored by an independent core laboratory. Successful reperfusion was defined as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b/3. RESULTS We included 50 patients with an M2 and 249 patients with an M1 occlusion. Patients with an M2 occlusion were older (mean age, 71 versus 67 years; P = .04) and had a lower NIHSS score (median, 13 versus 17; P < .001) compared with those with an M1 occlusion. Procedural time was nonsignificantly shorter in patients with an M2 occlusion (median, 29 versus 35 minutes; P = .41). The average number of passes with a stent retriever was also nonsignificantly lower in patients with an M2 occlusion (mean, 1.4 versus 1.7; P = .07). There were no significant differences in successful reperfusion (85% versus 82%, P = .82), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages (2% versus 2%, P = 1.0), device-related serious adverse events (6% versus 4%, P = .46), or modified Rankin Scale score 0-2 at follow-up (60% versus 56%, P = .64).

Three distinct disease states were evaluated: acute infections, cirrhosis and HCC. Age-standardized disease incidence and mortality were presented per 100,000 population and stratified by age, sex, year and 21 world regions. From 2010 to 2019, overall incidence of acute HBV declined by 19.3% (95% CI 4.1-32.0, p < .05) and HBV cirrhosis declined by 15.0% (95% CI 9.8-20.7, p < .05). Incidence of HCV cirrhosis increased by 5.6% (95% CI 0.3-10.2, p < .05) and HCV HCC remained stable. Incidence of acute HCV declined until 2015, after which it began increasing. From 2010 to 2019, overall mortality for HBV cirrhosis and HCV cirrhosis declined, whereas mortality for acute infections and HCC remained stable. Major differences in HBV and HCV incidence and mortality trends were observed when stratified by world regions. In conclusion, while our analyses of global trends in HBV and HCV incidence and mortality demonstrate encouraging trends, disparities in disease epidemiology were observed across world regions.

However, the role of D-dimer in predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remains incompletely characterized. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Optum? de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset. Patients were included if they were 18 or older, had been hospitalized within 7 days of confirmed COVID-19 positivity from March 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020. We determined the optimal threshold of D-dimer to predict in-hospital mortality and compared risks of in-hospital mortality between patients with D-dimer levels below and above the cutoff. Risk ratios (RRs) were estimated adjusting for baseline characteristics and clinical variables. Results: Among 15,250 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 positivity, 285 presented with AIS at admission (2%). Patients with AIS were older [70 (60C79) vs. 64 (52C75), p < 0.001] and had greater D-dimer levels at admission [1.42 (0.76C3.96) vs. 0.94 (0.55C1.81) g/ml FEU, p < 0.001]. Peak D-dimer level was a good predictor of in-hospital mortality among all patients [c-statistic 0.774 (95% CI 0.764C0.784)] and among patients with AIS [c-statistic 0.751 (95% CI 0.691C0.810)]. Among AIS patients, the optimum cutoff was identified at 5.15 g/ml FEU with 73% sensitivity and 69% specificity. Elevated peak D-dimer level above this cut-off was associated with almost 3 times increased mortality [adjusted RR 2.89 (95% CI 1.87C4.47), p < 0.001].

To play PathPyramid, a resident receives a pathology image and describes findings to their team (who do not see the image). The team answers the given prompts related to the image. Pre-game questionnaire was given to trainees to assess perceptions of their abilities in describing pathologic findings. Post-game questionnaire focused on the game's ability to achieve the goals of the activity. Surveys indicate that PathPyramid's strengths lie in building confidence in describing findings in a group and teambuilding. Additionally, variability of responses among trainee sheds light on unseen aspects of individual learning path diversity irrespective of year in training. PathPyramid complements a pathology residency curriculum by helping to erode potential barriers in communication, while fostering comradery.","output":"Are you ready to play Pathology Pyramid?

Previous nationwide studies have reported links between long-term PM2.5 concentrations and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. In order to translate these results to the state level, we use Bayesian hierarchical models to explore potential links between long-term PM2.5 concentrations and census tract-level rates of COVID-19 outcomes (infections, hospitalizations, and deaths) in Colorado. We explicitly consider how the uncertainty in PM2.5 estimates affect our results by comparing four different PM2.5 surfaces from academic and governmental organizations. After controlling for 20 census tract level covariates including race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, social distancing, age demographics, comorbidity rates, meteorology, and testing rate, we find that our results depend heavily on the choice of PM2.5 surface. Using PM2.5 estimates from the United States EPA, we find that a 1 g/m3 increase in long term PM2.5 is associated with a statistically significant 25% increase in the relative risk of hospitalizations and a 35% increase in mortality. Results for all other surfaces and outcomes were not statistically significant. At the same time, we find a clear association between communities of color and COVID-19 outcomes at the Colorado census-tract level that is minimally affected by the choice of PM2.5 surface. A per-interquartile range (IQR) increase in the percent of non-African American people of color was associated with a 31%, 44%, and 59% increase in the relative risk of infection, hospitalization, and mortality respectively, while a per-IQR increase in the proportion of non-Hispanic African Americans was associated with a 4% and 7% increase in the relative risk of infections and hospitalizations. These results have strong implications for the implementation of an equitable public health response during the crisis and suggest targeted areas for additional air monitoring in Colorado.","output":"Long-term air pollution and other risk factors associated with COVID-19 at the census-tract-level in Colorado"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the fast spread of COVID-19 is the cause of a sanitary emergency in Brazil. This situation is largely due to President Bolsonaro's denial and the uncoordinated actions between the federal and local governments. In addition, the Brazilian government has reported that it would change its method of sharing information about the pandemic. On June 6, 2020, the presentation of accumulated cases and deaths was stopped, and the Supreme Court of Brazil determined that the federal government should continue to consolidate and disseminate the accumulated figures of cases and deaths. However, doubt about the transparency of the data remained. We used data reported by the government from Situation Reports 38-209 of the World Health Organization to assess the Benford's law fulfillment as an indicator of data quality. This rapid evaluation of data quality during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil suggests that the Brazilian public health surveillance system had an acceptable performance at the beginning of the epidemic. Since the end of June, the quality of cumulative death data began to decrease and remains in that condition as of August 2020.

These sensors would continually monitor the manhole's wastewater, and whenever virus remnants are detected, transmit an alert signal. In a recent paper, we described two new algorithms, each sequentially opening and testing successive manholes for genetic remnants, each algorithm homing in on a neighborhood where the infected person or persons are located. This paper extends that work in six important ways: (1) we introduce the concept of in-manhole sensors, as these sensors will reduce the number of manholes requiring on-site testing; (2) we present a realistic tree network depicting the topology of the sewer pipeline network; (3) for simulations, we present a method to create random tree networks exhibiting key attributes of a given community; (4) using the simulations, we empirically demonstrate that the mean and median number of manholes to be opened in a search follows a well-known logarithmic function; (5) we develop procedures for determining the number of sensors to deploy; (6) we formulate the sensor location problem as an integer nonlinear optimization and develop heuristics to solve it. Our sensor-manhole system, to be implemented, would require at least three additional steps in R&D: (a) an accurate, inexpensive and fast SARS-Cov-2 genetic-remnants test that can be done at the manhole; (b) design, test and manufacture of the sensors; (c) in-the-field testing and fine tuning of an implemented system.","output":"Placing sensors in sewer networks: A system to pinpoint new cases of coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Without a robust evidence base to support recommendations for first aid, health, and medical services at mass gatherings (MGs), levels of care will continue to vary. Streamlining and standardizing post-event reporting for MG medical services could improve inter-event comparability, and prospectively influence event safety and planning through the application of a research template, thereby supporting and promoting growth of the evidence base and the operational safety of this discipline. Understanding the relationships between categories of variables is key. The present paper is focused on theory building, providing an evolving conceptual model, laying the groundwork for exploring the relationships between categories of variables pertaining the health outcomes of MGs. METHODS A content analysis of 54 published post-event medical case reports, including a comparison of the features of published data models for MG health outcomes.

This frail patient group requires specialist care, and disruption to services is likely to result in increases in morbidity, mortality and long-term healthcare costs. AIMS: To assess disruption to hip fracture services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed for completion by a senior clinician or service manager in each participating unit between April-September 2020. The survey was incorporated into existing national-level audits in Germany (n = 71), Scotland (n = 16), and Ireland (n = 16). Responses from a further 82 units in 11 nations were obtained via an online survey. RESULTS: There were 185 units from 14 countries that returned the survey. 102/160 (63.7%) units reported a worsening of overall service quality, which was attributed predominantly to staff redistribution, reallocation of inpatient areas, and reduced access to surgical facilities. There was a high rate of redeployment of staff to other services: two thirds lost specialist orthopaedic nurses, a third lost orthogeriatrics services, and a quarter lost physiotherapists. Reallocation of inpatient areas resulted in patients being managed by non-specialised teams in generic wards, which increased transit of patients and staff between clinical areas. There was reduced operating department access, with 74/160 (46.2%) centres reporting a >50% reduction. Reduced theatre efficiency was reported by 135/160 (84.4%) and was attributed to staff and resource redistribution, longer anaesthetic and transfer times, and delays for preoperative COVID-19 testing and using personal protective equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: Hip fracture services were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic and this may have a sustained impact on health and social care. Protection of hip fracture services is essential to ensure satisfactory outcomes for this vulnerable patient group.","output":"IMPACT of COVID-19 on hip fracture services: A global survey by the International Multicentre Project Auditing COVID-19 in Trauma & Orthopaedics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The occurrence of pneumonia separates severe cases of COVID-19 from the majority of cases with mild disease. However, the factors determining whether or not pneumonia develops remain to be fully uncovered. We therefore explored the associations of several lifestyle factors with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. Methods Between May and July 2020, we conducted an online survey of adults in Germany who had recently gone through COVID-19, predominantly as outpatients (n=201). Of these, 165 had a PCR-based diagnosis and 36 had a retrospective diagnosis by antibody testing. The survey covered demographic information, eight lifestyle factors, comorbidities and medication use. We defined the main outcome as the presence vs. the absence of signs of pneumonia, represented by dyspnea, the requirement for oxygen therapy or intubation. Results Signs of pneumonia occurred in 39 of the 165 individuals with a PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19 (23.6%). Among the lifestyle factors examined, only overweight/obesity associated with signs of pneumonia (odds ratio 2.68 (1.29 - 5.59) p=0.008). The observed association remained significant after multivariate adjustment, with BMI as a metric variable, and also after including the antibody-positive individuals into the analysis. Conclusions This exploratory study finds an association of overweight/obesity with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. This finding suggests that a signal proportional to body fat mass, such as the hormone leptin, impairs the body's ability to clear SARS-CoV-2 before pneumonia develops. This hypothesis concurs with previous work and should be investigated further to possibly reduce the proportion of severe cases of COVID-19.","output":"Overweight/obesity as the potentially most important lifestyle factor associated with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a risk factor for poor COVID-19 outcomes, but pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes are poorly represented in current studies. METHODS: T1D Exchange coordinated a US type 1 diabetes COVID-19 registry. Forty-six diabetes centers submitted pediatric cases for patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Associations between clinical factors and hospitalization were tested with Fisher's Exact Test. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for hospitalization. RESULTS: Data from 266 patients with previously established type 1 diabetes aged <19 years with COVID-19 were reported. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was the most common adverse outcome (n = 44, 72% of hospitalized patients). There were four hospitalizations for severe hypoglycemia, three hospitalizations requiring respiratory support (one of whom was intubated and mechanically ventilated), one case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and 10 patients who were hospitalized for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or diabetes. Hospitalized patients (n = 61) were more likely than nonhospitalized patients (n = 205) to have minority race/ethnicity (67% vs 39%, P < 0.001), public insurance (64% vs 41%, P < 0.001), higher A1c (11% [97 mmol/mol] vs 8.2% [66 mmol/mol], P < 0.001), and lower insulin pump and lower continuous glucose monitoring use (26% vs 54%, P < 0.001; 39% vs 75%, P < 0.001).

As a result, nutrient and organic concentrations in this effluent are incredibly high, and residues are slightly solubilized, likely to impact environmental pollution on streams, rivers, and other watercourses if discharged untreated. The biodegradation of abattoir waste was studied using a laboratory-scale cylindrical sequencing batch reactor (SBR) in aerobic mode. The aerobic sludge was collected from the aeration compartment of a paper and pulp effluent treatment facility and cultivated in a 2.83-L Perspex-based laboratory SBR. The raw wastewater comprised 6494  2144 mg/l chemical oxygen demand (COD), 1946  607 mg/l biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 1722  159 mg/l total suspended solids (TSS), 3062  592 mg/l CaCO(3) alkalinity, 7.00  0.27 pH. The duration of a complete cycle was 24 h and comprised four phases: fill (5 min), react (23 h 10 min), settle (40 min) and draw (5 min). The whole experiment was divided into four phases and the dilution was done with the help of domestic sewage. In the first stage, the reactor was fed four times diluted slaughterhouse effluent on a 24-h cyclic operation for two weeks. After achieving a significant reduction in COD, the organic content of the input was raised by lowering the dilution factor. In the second and third phases, the reactor was fed three times and twice diluted samples for two weeks each operating at the same cyclic interval. In the final stage, raw effluent was fed to the reactor for two more weeks. The average COD value of diluted wastewater in the first, second, third and fourth phase was 1040 mg/l, 3168 mg/l, 4800 mg/l, and 5200 mg/l, respectively. The COD removal efficiency at the end of the first, second, third and fourth phase was 83%, 93%, 85% and 97%, respectively. The average BOD value of diluted wastewater at the end of the first, second, third and fourth phase was 1120 mg/l, 610 mg/l, 1502 mg/l, and 1350 mg/l, respectively. The BOD removal efficiency at the end of the first, second, third and fourth phase was 84%, 88%, 85% and 98%, respectively.

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess infection complications after lymphodepletion and CAR-T cell therapy. Infections were commonly detected, but manageable in most cases. Fast and appropriate identification as well as treatment were critical, especially in this very vulnerable patient group. Effective strategies to prevent infections as well as adequate medical management also include standardized prophylaxis and additional supportive therapy. ABSTRACT: Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has proven to be very effective in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, infectionsrelated either due to lymphodepletion or the CAR-T cell therapy itselfcan result in severe and potentially life-threatening complications, while side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) might complicate differential diagnosis. Sixty-seven dosings of CAR-T cells in sixty adult patients with NHL (85%) and ALL (15%) receiving CAR-T cell therapy were assessed for infectious complications. Almost two-thirds of patients (61%) developed fever following lymphodepletion and CAR-T cell dosing. Microbiological or radiological findings were observed in 25% of all cases (bacterial 12%, viral 5%, fungal 8%). Inpatient infections were associated with more lines of therapy and more severe CRS. However, overall serious complications were rare after CAR-T therapy, with one patient dying of infection. Pathogen detection after inpatient stay was infrequent and mostly occurred in the first 90 days after dosing. Infections in CAR-T cell treated patents are common. Fast and suitable identification and treatment are crucial in these heavily pretreated and immunocompromised patients. In most cases infectious complications are manageable. Nonetheless, standardized anti-infective prophylaxis and supportive therapy are mandatory to reduce morbidity and mortality in CAR-T cell therapy.","output":"Infection Complications after Lymphodepletion and Dosing of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) Cell Therapy in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce a 2-layer network model for the study of the immunization dynamics in epidemics.

Different definitions for linkage to care have challenged comparisons as a public health marker. Its meaning in the era of universal test and treat has transformed in all settings, but is most relevant in sub-Sahara Africa, where the burden of new HIV infection is still highest. METHODS For this narrative review on linkage to care definitions with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa, we searched PubMed/Medline between September and December 2020, restricted to the period 2000C2020 using Boolean operators: HIV AND (linkage to care OR engagement in care) and screened for institutional definitions of linkage to care. Additionally, as one example of a rural sub-Saharan African setting, we analysed linkage steps within the Chronic Diseases Clinic Ifakara (CDCI) and its associated Kilombero and Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort (KIULARCO) in rural Tanzania between 1 January 2017 and 31 March 2019. RESULTS We analysed 81 articles that included linkage to care within different study settings and HIV organisations. Major differences in defining linkage to care exist, according to setting and location, patient populations and the timing of steps within the linkage process. We identified 16 different numerators and 10 denominators used to define linkage with time periods ranging from same day as diagnosis up to 12 months after diagnosis among 34 original articles from sub-Saharan Africa. At the CDCI, 1149/1671 (69%) newly diagnosed individuals were enrolled into care after diagnosis. Three months after enrolment into care, 94%, 86%, 85% and 71% of enrolled patients had a laboratory evaluation, a clinical evaluation, were initiated on treatment and had a first clinical follow-up visit after initiation of treatment, respectively. DUSCUSSION To address the inconsistency in defining linkage to care and in order to guarantee the comparability of linkage to care in the sub-Saharan Africa region, we support the definition from the European region with some adaptions.

The first wave of the pandemic outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in September 2019 and continued to March 2020. As declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), this virus affected populations all over the globe, and its accelerated spread is a universal concern. An ANN architecture was developed to predict the serious pandemic outbreak impact in Qatar, Spain, and Italy. Official statistical data gathered from each country until July 6th was used to validate and test the prediction model. The model sensitivity was analyzed using the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute percentage error and the regression coefficient index R2, which yielded highly accurate values of the predicted correlation for the infected and dead cases of 0.99 for the dates considered. The verified and validated growth model of COVID-19 for these countries showed the effects of the measures taken by the government and medical sectors to alleviate the pandemic effect and the effort to decrease the spread of the virus in order to reduce the death rate. The differences in the spread rate were related to different exogenous factors (such as social, political, and health factors, among others) that are difficult to measure. The simple and well-structured ANN model can be adapted to different propagation dynamics and could be useful for health managers and decision-makers to better control and prevent the occurrence of a pandemic.","output":"Forecast of the Outbreak of COVID-19 Using Artificial Neural Network: Case Study Qatar, Spain, and Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis paper aims to analytically show that in an over-lapping-generation (OLG) model, low earning cohorts bear unwanted risk and absorb higher economic cost than high earning cohorts do.Design/methodology/approachThis paper aims to consider the individual's risk appetite, using a simple utility function, based on consumptions and discount rates in each period. This paper calibrates the model according to teh Israeli pension system as a representative of a small open developed organization for economic cooperation and development country. Israel is considered as unique case study in the pension landscape, as it implements almost pure defined contribution pension scheme with continuous trend of pension market capitalization (Giorno and Jacques, 2016). Hence, this study finds Israel suitable for examining the theoretical mix of pension scheme. That model enables exploring combined solutions for adequate old age benefits, involving the first and the second pension pillars, under fiscal constraints.FindingsIt comes out that for risk-averse individuals, the optimal degree of funding is negatively correlated to asset returns' volatility and positively correlated to earning decile level. The neglect of risk and individual's current earning level will thus overstate the contribution level and funded percentage from total contributions. Moreover, even in an economy with minimum government intervention, and highly developed private pension fund with high average of rate of return, the authors find it is optimal that the pension system contains a sizeable unfunded pillar. This paper innovates by revealing a socio-economic anomaly in design of mix pension systems in favor of high earning cohorts on the expense of economic loss of low earning cohorts.Practical implicationsThe model presented in this paper could be implemented in countries with mix pension systems, as an alternative to public social transfers or means tested, alleviating poverty and inequality in old age. Additionally, this model could raise the public awareness of the financial sustainability of the unfunded pay-as-you-go pillar to diversify financial risk in pension systems, especially for low earning cohort in society.Social implicationsOne area of research that is particularly relevant in this context concerns the issue of alleviating poverty and income inequality. It is often stressed that the prevention of old age poverty is among the central targets of well-designed pension system (Holzmann and Hinz, 2005). The conceptualization of minimum pension guarantee used in this composition allows to clearly capturing the notion of such a poverty and social targets as an integral part of the pension system rolls.Originality/valueThis paper innovates by revealing a socio-economic anomaly in design of mix pension systems in favor of high earning cohorts on the expense of economic loss of low earning cohorts.

Its causes and mechanisms are diverse and complex, and it is still unavoidable in clinical work. There is a high incidence of ED after otorhinolaryngology surgery, which may result from the sudden loss of functional senses and discomfort of surgical organs. This study aims to test a non-invasive, non-drug treatment modality of nose clamping and mouth-breathing training before surgery to reduce ED. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) will include 200 patients who undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) at Shanghai General Hospital, China. Study participants will be randomly assigned in two groups with a 1:1 ratio. The pretreatment group (P-group) will receive an intervention by nasal splint and mouth-breathing training before surgery, while the control group (C-group) will not receive any intervention; following which both groups will undergo FESS under general anaesthesia in accordance with the same anaesthesia scheme. After surgery, we will perform a single-blinded assessment of ED occurrence with stratification. IBM SPSS Statistics V.20 statistical software will be used for statistical analyses.

Since its first appearance in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, SARS-CoV-2 infection has quickly spread across the globe, with the first case reported on the African continent, in Egypt on February 14 th, 2020. Although the global number of COVID-19 infections has increased exponentially since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of new infections and deaths recorded in African countries have been relatively modest, suggesting slower transmission dynamics of the virus on the continent, a lower case fatality rate, or simply a lack of testing or reliable data.

Although the viruses share a completely homologous repertoire of proteins and use the same cellular entry receptor, their transmission efficiencies and pathogenetic traits differ. We aimed to compare interferon antagonism by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: For this functional study, we infected Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells with strains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We studied differences in cell line-specific replication (Vero E6 vs Calu-3 cells) and analysed these differences in relation to TMPRSS2-dependent cell entry based on inhibition with the drug camostat mesilate. We evaluated viral sensitivity towards type I interferon treatment and assessed cytokine induction and type I interferon signalling in the host cells by RT-PCR and analysis of transcription factor activation and nuclear translocation. Based on reverse genetic engineering of SARS-CoV, we investigated the contribution of open reading frame 6 (ORF6) to the observed phenotypic differences in interferon signalling, because ORF6 encodes an interferon signalling antagonist. We did a luciferase-based interferon-stimulated response element promotor activation assay to evaluate the antagonistic capacity of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type ORF6 constructs and three mutants (Gln51Glu, Gln56Glu, or both) that represent amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 protein 6 in the carboxy-terminal domain. FINDINGS: Overall, replication was higher for SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells and for SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells. SARS-CoV-2 was reliant on TMPRSS2, found only in Calu-3 cells, for more efficient entry. SARS-CoV-2 was more sensitive to interferon treatment, less efficient in suppressing cytokine induction via IRF3 nuclear translocation, and permissive of a higher level of induction of interferon-stimulated genes MX1 and ISG56. SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 expressed in the context of a fully replicating SARS-CoV backbone suppressed MX1 gene induction, but this suppression was less efficient than that by SARS-CoV ORF6. Mutagenesis showed that charged amino acids in residues 51 and 56 shift the phenotype towards more efficient interferon antagonism, as seen in SARS-CoV. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 interferes less efficiently with human interferon induction and interferon signalling than SARS-CoV ORF6. Because of the homology of the genes, onward selection for fitness could involve functional optimisation of interferon antagonism. Charged amino acids at positions 51 and 56 in ORF6 should be monitored for potential adaptive changes.

This study explores the relationship between health expenditure and maternal mortality by using data set consisting of 18 years from 2000 to 2017. Fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) models were employed for the empirical analysis. The outcomes revealed that a 1% rise in health expenditure increased the maternal mortality rate by 1.95% in the case of FMOLS estimator and 0.16% in the case of DOLS estimator. This reflects that the prevailing health care system is not adequate for reducing maternal mortality. Moreover, the meager system and the priorities established by an elitist system in which the powerless and poor are not considered may also lead to worsen the situation. In addition, the study also added population, economic growth, sanitation, and clean fuel technology in the empirical model. The findings revealed that population growth has a significant long-term effect on maternal mortalityan increase of 40% in the case of FMOLS and 10% in the case of DOLSand infers that an increase in population growth has also dampened efforts towards reducing maternal mortality in the South Asian panel. Further, the results in the case of economic growth, sanitation, and clean fuel technologies showed significant long-term negative effects on maternal mortality by 94%, 7.2%, and 11%, respectively, in the case of the FMOLS estimator, and 18%, 1.9%, and 5%, respectively, in the case of the DOLS estimator. The findings imply that GDP and access to sanitation and clean fuel technologies are more nuanced in declining maternal mortality.

Using an N-gene based RT-qPCR assay, we tested 768 arbitrarily selected specimens and identified 2 samples which resulted in a positive detection of viral sequence in the absence of reverse transcriptase, a necessary but not sufficient signal consistent with possible integration of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene into the host genome. Regardless of possible viral N gene integration into the genome, in this small subset of samples, all patients were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as indicated by a much lower Ct value for reactions performed in the presence of reverse transcriptase (RT) versus reactions performed without RT. Moreover, one of the two positives observed in the absence of RT also tested positive when using primers targeting ORF1ab, a gene closer to the 5 prime end of the genome. These data are inconsistent with the N gene integration hypothesis suggested by the studies by Zhang et al., and importantly, our results suggest little to no practical impact of possible SARS-CoV-2 genome integration events on RT-qPCR testing.","output":"ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL SARS-CoV-2 VIRUS N GENE INTEGRATION INTO HUMAN GENOME REVEALS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RT-qPCR COVID-19 DIAGNOSTIC

for this virus. Since developing antiviral drugs is a time-consuming process, the most effective approach is to evaluate the approved and under investigation drugs using in silico methods. Among the different targets within the virus structure, as a vital component in the life cycle of coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) can be a critical target for antiviral drugs. The impact of the existence of RNA in the enzyme structure on the binding affinity of anti-RdRP drugs has not been investigated so far. METHODS: In this study, the potential anti-RdRP effects of a variety of drugs from two databases (Zinc database and DrugBank) were evaluated using molecular docking. For this purpose, the newly emerged model of COVID-19 (RdRP) post-translocated catalytic complex (PDB ID: 7BZF) that consists of RNA was chosen as the target. RESULTS: The results indicated that idarubicin (IDR), a member of the anthracycline antibiotic family, and fenoterol (FNT), a known beta-2 adrenergic agonist drug, tightly bind to the target enzyme and could be used as potential anti-RdRP inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These outcomes revealed that due to the ligand-protein interactions, the presence of RNA in this structure could remarkably affect the binding affinity of inhibitor compounds. CONCLUSION: In silico approaches, such as molecular docking, could effectively address the problem of finding appropriate treatment for COVID-19. Our results showed that IDR and FNT have a significant affinity to the RdRP of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, these drugs are remarkable inhibitors of coronaviruses.","output":"Evaluation of potential anti-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) drugs against the newly emerged model of COVID-19 RdRP using computational methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic is the momentum it has created for global changes affecting various aspects of daily lives. Among these, green building certification systems (GBCSs) should not be left behind as significant potential modifications may be required to ensure their versatility for residential buildings due to the new pandemic reality. The present study aims to evaluate the readiness of chosen GBCSs for a proper assessment of existing residential housing sustainability in a post-pandemic world. Based on a literature review of the state-of-the-art data sources and round table discussions, the present study proposes a particular set of sustainability indicators covering special sustainability requirements under pandemic conditions. Then, those indicators are used to evaluate the readiness of selected GBCSs (BREEAM, LEED, WELL, CASBEE) to meet new pandemic-resilient requirements based on their responses to the indicators. The assessment shows that none of the reviewed GBCSs are fully ready to cover all the proposed indicators. GBCSs have differing focuses on particular sustainability pillars, which also affected their responses to pandemic-resilient categories. For instance, WELL rating system successfully responded to the health and safety category, whereas LEED showed better preparedness in terms of environmental efficiency. BREEAM and CASBEE systems have a more evenly distributed attention to all three pandemic-resilient categories (Health & Safety, Environmental Resources Consumption, and Comfort) with an accent on the Comfort category. On a specific note, all GBCSs are insufficiently prepared for waste and wastewater management. In the future, GBCSs should be modified to better adapt to pandemic conditions, for which the current work may provide a basis. As an alternative, brand new standards can be created to face newly arising and evolving post-pandemic requirements.","output":"Readiness Assessment of Green Building Certification Systems for Residential Buildings during Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ein 43-j?hriger in Deutschland lebender Bengale wird am Wochenende im Februar 2004 mit dem Rettungstransportdienst in die Notaufnahme des Krankenhauses gebracht.

The present prospective study extends this research by examining both specific emotion regulation strategies and global emotion regulation difficulties in the context of acute stress following onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic in 119 young adults. As part of a larger study, emotion regulation was assessed prior to pandemic onset (January 2019 - February 2020) using two standard measures (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, ERQ, Gross & John, 2003; Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, DERS, Gratz & Roemer, 2004). A self-report assessment of acute stress was conducted 2-3? weeks after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. Results demonstrated cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression (i.e., ERQ) were not individually predictive of acute stress; however, there was a significant interaction of suppression by reappraisal. Simple effects indicated suppression was negatively associated with acute stress only when reappraisal levels were high. Greater global emotion regulation difficulties (i.e., DERS), particularly nonacceptance of emotions and limited access to emotion regulation strategies, significantly predicted greater acute stress. These results provide further evidence of the temporal relationship between emotion dysregulation and stress reactions, and also suggest the expected effects of emotion regulation strategies may differ across contexts.","output":"Individual differences in emotion regulation prospectively predict early COVID-19 related acute stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose During COVID pandemic, several cases of isolated COVID-associated mucormycosis and COVID-associated pulmonary aspergillosis have been reported.

This resulted not only in a setback to sustainable mobility, but also impacting on equity and social exclusion issues. The paper aimed to cover this topic, investigating the conjecture that the spread of the coronavirus is directly correlated to PT usage. A correlation analysis among the daily number of certified coronavirus cases and the PT trips measured in the day in which the contagions occurred was performed within the second wave in Italy. The appropriateness of the case study is twofold because Italy was one of the main European countries with a high mass contagion and because the vaccination campaign had not yet started in Italy. Estimation results show a high correlation (up to 0.87) between COVID-19 contagion and PT trips performed 22 days before. This threshold indicates that quarantine measures, commonly set at two weeks and based only on incubation considerations, were inadequate as a containment strategy, and may have produced a possible slowdown in identifying new cases and hence, in adopting mitigation policies. A causeCeffect test was also implemented, concluding that there is a strong causal link between COVID-19 and PT trips. The main issues discussed in this research cover the transportation and the health filed but also laid the groundwork for ethical considerations concerning the right to mobility and social equity. Obtained results could yield significant insights into the context variables that influence the spread of the virus, also helping appropriate definition of restrictive policies, thereby ensuring a sustainable recovery and development of urban areas in the post-pandemic era.","output":"The Role of Public Transport during the Second COVID-19 Wave in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corporate accelerators have become an important form of corporate-start-up collaboration. According to [1] mm1 (consultancy for Connected Business), two-thirds of all DAX 30 companies in Germany engaged with start-ups via an accelerator in the year 2020.

These events were followed by 4 aftershocks of magnitude M(w)  3.0. We carried out morphotectonic (high stream length-gradient index) and static Coulomb stress failure analyses to delineate the hidden causative fault(s) in the region. In the study, ASTER DEM data of 30 m resolution and Survey of India (SoI) toposheets on 1:50,000 scales were used for morphotectonic analysis. The analysis depicted a very high stream length-gradient (SL) and fall in elevation in the epicentral area, suggesting the area to be tectonically active with a NE-SW trending fault line. In addition, the nature of static Coulomb failure stress contours for both the main events, M(w) 3.5 and M(w) 3.4, suggests an NNE-SSW trending high Coulomb stress regime. Such a high coulomb stress regime is obvious at the location where a high SL index and fall in elevation were marked, which clearly indicates the presence of NNE-SSW trending a causative fault, named Khanpur-Japti fault.","output":"Delineation of the Causative Fault of Recent Earthquakes (AprilCMay 2020) in Delhi from Seismological and Morphometric Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater surveillance has shown to be a valuable and efficient tool to obtain information about the trends of COVID-19 in the community. Since the recent emergence of new variants, associated with increased transmissibility and/or antibody escape (variants of concern), there is an urgent need for methods that enable specific and timely detection and quantification of the occurrence of these variants in the community. In this study, we demonstrate the use of RT-ddPCR on wastewater samples for specific detection of mutation N501Y. This assay enabled simultaneous enumeration of lineage B.1.351 (containing the 501Y mutation) and Wild Type (WT, containing 501N) SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Detection of N501Y was possible in samples with mixtures of WT with low proportions of B.1.351 (0.5%) and could accurately determine the proportion of N501Y and WT in mixtures of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The application to raw sewage samples from the cities of Amsterdam and Utrecht demonstrated that this method can be applied to wastewater samples. The emergence of N501Y in Amsterdam and Utrecht wastewater aligned with the emergence of B.1.1.7 as causative agent of COVID-19 in the Netherlands, indicating that RT-ddPCR of wastewater samples can be used to monitor the emergence of the N501Y mutation in the community. It also indicates that RT-ddPCR could be used for sensitive and accurate monitoring of current (like K417N, K417T, E484K, L452R) or future mutations present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

However, TIP/S effect on the CF sputum microbiome has not been explored. We hypothesised that TIP/S has additional 'off-target' effects beyond merely P. aeruginosa and that baseline microbiome prior to initiation of therapy is associated with subsequent patient response. METHODS We drew sputum samples from a prospectively collected biobank. Patients were included if they had one sputum sample in the 18 months before and after TIP/S. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene profiling was used to characterise the sputum microbiome. RESULTS Forty-one patients met our inclusion criteria and 151 sputum samples were assessed. At baseline, median age was 30.4 years (IQR 24.2-35.2) and forced expiratory volume in 1 (FEV1) second was 57% predicted (IQR 44-74). Nineteen patients were defined a priori as responders having no net decrease in FEV1 in the year following TIP/S. No significant changes were observed in key microbiome metrics of alpha (within-sample) or beta (between-sample) diversity for samples collected before and after TIP/S. However, significant beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis) differences were noted at baseline between patients based on response status. Notably, responders were observed to have a higher abundance of Staphylococcus in pretherapy baseline samples.

Since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Caribbean on 1st March 2020, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been widely used to control the resulting COVID-19 outbreak. We document the variety of government measures introduced across the Caribbean and explore their impact on aspects of outbreak control. Methods Drawing on publically available information, we present confirmed cases and confirmed deaths to describe the extent of the Caribbean outbreak. We document the range of outbreak containment measures implemented by national Governments, focussing on measures to control movement and gatherings. We explore the temporal association of containment measures with the start of the outbreak in each country, and with aggregated information on human movement, using smartphone positioning data. We include a set of comparator countries to provide an international context. Results As of 25th May, the Caribbean reported 18,755 confirmed cases and 631 deaths. There have been broad similarities but also variation in the number, the type, the intensity, and particularly the timing of the NPIs introduced across the Caribbean. On average, Caribbean governments began controlling movement into countries 27 days before their first confirmed case and 23 days before comparator countries. Controls on movement within country were introduced 9 days after the first case and 36 days before comparators. Controls on gatherings were implemented 1 day before the first confirmed case and 30 days before comparators. Confirmed case growth rates and numbers of deaths have remained low across much the Caribbean. Stringent Caribbean curfews and stay-at-home orders coincided with large reductions in community mobility, regularly above 60%, and higher than most international comparator countries. Conclusion Stringent controls to limit movement, and specifically the early timing of those controls has had an important impact on containing the spread of COVID-19 across much of the Caribbean. Very early controls to limit movement into countries may well be particularly effective for small island developing states. With much of the region economically reliant on international tourism, and with steps to open borders now being implemented, it is critical that the region draws on a solid evidence-base to balance the competing demands of economic wellbeing and public health.","output":"COVID-19 containment in the Caribbean: The experience of Small Island developing states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Ever since the outbreak of COVID-19, the respiratory system has been the chief focus of researches, however, understanding the impact of this disease on the integumentary system is just as essential. OBJECTIVES: We aimed at collecting data on any cutaneous manifestation arising in patients with active and recovering COVID-19 infection, or a direct consequence of the infection's treatment, and correlating these findings with systemic disease severity and duration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in three tertiary care centers from Rajasthan, India, to acquire data of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 presenting with any mucocutaneous manifestation. RESULTS: Eight predominant patterns of dermatological involvement were seen, namely, maculopapular (14.59%), urticarial (13.17%), perniotic (12.1%), pityriasis rosea (11.74%), acral erythema/edema (10.3%), petechial (4.63%), vesicular (2.49%), and livedo (1.78%). Rare findings included eruptive pseudoangioma, eruptive hypomelanosis, alopecia parvimaculata, geographic tongue, chikungunya-like hyperpigmentation, and nail changes. On correlating these findings with the gradient of the disease, livedo, vasculitis, exfoliation, and erythroderma were associated with severe disease, whereas perniosis and eruptive pseudoangioma were seen in mild illness.

Features of RDH were compared with non-RDH in order to identify characteristics associated with RD phenomenon and possible risk factors for readmission. To explore predictors of RDH, a stepwise backword logistic regression model was built, including the variables that were significantly associated with RDH in the bivariate analyses.

We scanned the SARS-CoV-2 genome for putative miRNA genes and miRNA targets and conducted in vivo experiments to validate the virus-encoded miRNAs and their regulatory role on the putative targets. One of such virus-encoded miRNAs, MR147-3p, was overexpressed that resulted in significantly decreased transcript levels of all of the predicted targets in human, i.e., EXOC7, RAD9A, and TFE3 in the virus-infected cells. The analysis showed that the immune response and cytoskeleton organization are two of the most notable biological processes regulated by the infection-modulated miRNAs. Additionally, the genomic mutation of SARS-CoV-2 contributed to the changed miRNA repository and targets, suggesting a possible role of miRNAs in the attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 during its evolution.

The simulation places students in the role of a public health nurse in the outbreak investigation team, working in groups of five to seven students to complete analyses and make recommendations under time and information constraints. Since piloting in spring 2014, we have run the simulation three times (summer and fall 2014 and summer 2015). Student evaluations show high levels of engagement and interest and substantial increase in the skills and expertise required in an outbreak investigation. We share key lessons learned, including resources required for simulation development and delivery, revisions to the simulation format and content in response to student feedback, and transferability and sustainability of the simulation.

While anti-drug antibodies (ADA) are a standard clinical measure of protein therapeutic immunogenicity, T cell epitopes in the primary sequences of these drugs are the key drivers or modulators of ADA response, depending on the type of T cell response that is stimulated (e.g., T helper or Regulatory T cells, respectively). In a previous publication on T cell-dependent immunogenicity of biotherapeutics, we addressed mitigation efforts such as identifying and reducing the presence of T cell epitopes or T cell response to protein therapeutics prior to further development of the protein therapeutic for clinical use. Over the past 5 years, greater insight into the role of regulatory T cell epitopes and the conservation of T cell epitopes with self (beyond germline) has improved the preclinical assessment of immunogenic potential. In addition, impurities contained in therapeutic drug formulations such as host cell proteins have also attracted attention and become the focus of novel risk assessment methods. Target effects have come into focus, given the emergence of protein and peptide drugs that target immune receptors in immuno-oncology applications. Lastly, new modalities are entering the clinic, leading to the need to revise certain aspects of the preclinical immunogenicity assessment pathway. In addition to drugs that have multiple antibody-derived domains or non-antibody scaffolds, therapeutic drugs may now be introduced via viral vectors, cell-based constructs, or nucleic acid based therapeutics that may, in addition to delivering drug, also prime the immune system, driving immune response to the delivery vehicle as well as the encoded therapeutic, adding to the complexity of assessing immunogenicity risk. While it is challenging to keep pace with emerging methods for the preclinical assessment of protein therapeutics and new biologic therapeutic modalities, this collective compendium provides a guide to current best practices and new concepts in the field.","output":"T-Cell Dependent Immunogenicity of Protein Therapeutics Pre-clinical Assessment and MitigationCUpdated Consensus and Review 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of Covid-19 crisis on hip and knee joint replacement surgeries at a high volume tertiary care hospital in the Indian National Capital Region and to evaluate the early experience of resumption of arthroplasty services. METHODS: Institutional records of the arthroplasty cases, operated between 1st March to 31 August of 2019 (Group A, pre-Covid) and 2020 (Group B, pandemic year) were compared retrospectively over numerous parameters including the complications within six weeks of surgery. RESULTS: There was a significant drop (by 82.53 %) in the total number of arthroplasty surgeries in Group B (62) as compared with Group A (355). Average number of arthroplasties per month were 59.17  12.93 and 10.67  13.29 in Group A and Group B respectively (p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in postoperative complication rate 7/355 (1.97 %) in Group A vs 7/62 (11.29 %) in Group B during pandemic (p < 0.002), along with a higher 30-days mortality rate 2/355 (3.22 %) vs 2/62 (0.56 %). Pandemic year also saw an increased readmission rate (4.83 %) vs (0.56 %) and postoperative ICU transfer rate (1.61 %) vs (0.56 %) in comparison with pre-Covid year. CONCLUSION: In the pandemic, arthroplasty services got severely affected at our center. With nearly six fold increase in complication rates, higher 30-days mortality and increased readmission rates, caution is advised in resuming arthroplasty surgeries without robust evaluation of cases. Whether undetected Covid-19 infection or poor pre-existing disease control due to lockdown can be linked to these results is a matter of further research with larger multicenter studies.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 pandemic on arthroplasty services and early experience after resuming surgeries at a non Covid center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increase in disaster events requires preparedness from health workers as the frontline to provide medical services in handling victims when a disaster occurs.

AS is caused by mutations in the maternal copy of UBE3A located on chromosome 15q11-13. UBE3A codes for E6AP (E6 Associated Protein), a prominent member of the HECT (Homologous to E6AP C-Terminus) E3 ubiquitin ligase family. E6AP catalyzes the posttranslational attachment of ubiquitin via its HECT domain onto various intracellular target proteins to regulate DNA repair and cell cycle progression. The HECT domain consists of an N-lobe, required for E2~ubiquitin recruitment, while the C-lobe contains the conserved catalytic cysteine required for ubiquitin transfer. Previous genetic studies of AS patients have identified point mutations in UBE3A that result in amino acid substitutions or premature termination during translation. An AS transversion mutation (codon change from ATA to AAA) within the region of the gene that codes for the catalytic HECT domain of E6AP has been annotated (I827K), but the molecular basis for this loss of function substitution remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the I827K substitution destabilizes the 3D fold causing protein aggregation of the C-terminal lobe of E6AP using a combination of spectropolarimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Our fluorescent ubiquitin activity assays with E6AP-I827K show decreased ubiquitin thiolester formation and ubiquitin discharge. Using 3D models in combination with our biochemical and biophysical results, we rationalize why the I827K disrupts E6AP-dependent ubiquitylation. This work provides new insight into the E6AP mechanism and how its malfunction can be linked to the AS phenotype.","output":"An Angelman syndrome substitution in the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase C-terminal Lobe of E6AP affects protein stability and activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ChiCTR, ChiCTR2000029758.

In this context, most of recent approaches exploit similarity learning through comparing spatial-temporal patterns between normal and irregular records. However, they are limited in utilizing passenger-level information. First, all passenger transits are fused in a certain region at a timestamp whereas each passenger has own repetitive stops and time slots. Second, these differences in passenger profile result in high intra-class variance of normal records and blur the decision boundaries. To tackle these problems, we propose a modelling framework to extract passenger-level spatial-temporal profile and present a personalised similarity learning for irregular behavior detection. Specifically, a route-to-stop embedding is proposed to extract spatial correlations between transit stops and routes. Then attentive fusion is adopted to uncover spatial repetitive and time invariant patterns. Finally, a personalised similarity function is learned to evaluate the historical and recent mobility patterns.

Preliminary data have shown that the SMART (Simplified Management of Acute stroke using Revised Treatment) criteria greatly expand patient eligibility by reducing thrombolysis exclusions, but they have not been assessed on a large scale. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of general adoption of SMART thrombolysis criteria to a large regional stroke network. METHODS Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who received IV thrombolysis within a regional stroke network was performed. Patients were divided into those receiving thrombolysis locally versus at an outside hospital. The primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale score (1) at discharge and the main safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) rate. RESULTS There were 539 consecutive patients, and 50.5% received thrombolysis at an outside facility. Ninety percent of the patients possessed common conventional IV rt-PA contraindications. There were no significant differences between local and network treated patients in favorable outcome (45.4% versus 37.4%; odds ratio [OR], .72; P > .09), mortality (9% versus 14%; OR, 1.6; P > .07), or sICH rate (2.6% versus 5.1%; OR, 2.0; P = .13). Multivariate analysis showed no association between receiving IV rt-PA at an outlying spoke hospital and higher rate of sICH or worse outcome at discharge. CONCLUSIONS Generalized application of SMART criteria is safe and effective.

BACKGROUND Given that both dental caries and periodontitis are behaviourally mediated, biofilm-based diseases that are largely preventable with attention to regular oral hygiene practices and preventive dental visits, strategies to arrest or even heal carious lesions and high-quality maintenance care and plaque control without the need to resort to aerosol-generating surgical approaches are evidence-based best practices. Older immigrants have poorer oral health than older US-born natives, motivating the need for delivery of more effective and affordable services to this vulnerable population. MATERIALS AND METHODS CHWs were trained by the NYU College of Dentistry dental hygienist faculty members using dental models and flip charts to instruct patients on proper brushing and flossing techniques. In addition, they discussed the presented oral health promotion information one-on-one with patients, addressed any expressed concerns and encouraged prevention of oral conditions through regular dental visits and brushing with fluoride toothpaste. RESULTS More than 98% of the 74 older Chinese adult participants strongly agreed/agreed that the CHWs helped them to improve how they take care of their health, the CHWs answered their questions and concerns, the information and topics were informative, and the in-person demonstrations were helpful in improving oral health.

Amongst different possible therapies for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, ozone therapy seems to have an immunological role because of the modulation of cytokines and interferons, including the induction of gamma interferon. Some data suggest the possible role of ozone therapy in SARS, either as a monotherapy or, more realistically, as an adjunct to standard treatment regimens; therefore, there is increasing interest in the role of ozone therapy in COVID-19 treatment The PubMed and Scopus databases and the Italian Scientific Society of Oxygen Ozone Therapy website were used to identify articles focused on ozone therapy. The search was limited to articles published from January 2011 to July 2020. Of 280 articles found on ozone therapy, 13 were selected and narratively reviewed. Ozone exerts antiviral activity through the inhibition of viral replication and direct inactivation of viruses. Ozone is an antiviral drug enhancer and is not an alternative to antiviral drugs. Combined treatment with involving ozone and antivirals demonstrated a reduction in inflammation and lung damage. The routes of ozone administration are direct intravenous, major autohaemotherapy and extravascular blood oxygenation-ozonation. Systemic ozone therapy seems useful in controlling inflammation, stimulating immunity and as antiviral activity and providing protection from acute coronary syndromes and ischaemia reperfusion damage, thus suggesting a new methodology of immune therapy. Systemic ozone therapy in combination with antivirals in COVID-19-positive patients may be justified, helpful and synergic.","output":"Ozone therapy in COVID-19: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antigen-specific lung-resident memory T cells (T(RM)s) constitute the first line of defense that mediates rapid protection against respiratory pathogens and inspires novel vaccine designs against infectious pandemic threats, yet effective means of inducing T(RM)s, particularly via non-viral vectors, remain challenging. Here, we demonstrate safe and potent induction of lung-resident T(RM)s using a biodegradable polymeric nanoshell that co-encapsulates antigenic peptides and TLR9 agonist CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) in a virus-mimicking structure. Through subcutaneous priming and intranasal boosting, the combinatorial nanoshell vaccine elicits prominent lung-resident CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that surprisingly show better durability than live viral infections. In particular, nanoshells containing CpG-ODN and a pair of conserved class I and II major histocompatibility complex-restricted influenza nucleoprotein-derived antigenic peptides are demonstrated to induce near-sterilizing immunity against lethal infections with influenza A viruses of different strains and subtypes in mice, resulting in rapid elimination of replicating viruses. We further examine the pulmonary transport dynamic and optimal composition of the nanoshell vaccine conducive for robust T(RM) induction as well as the benefit of subcutaneous priming on T(RM) replenishment. The study presents a practical vaccination strategy for inducing protective T(RM)-mediated immunity, offering a compelling platform and critical insights in the ongoing quest toward a broadly protective vaccine against universal influenza as well as other respiratory pathogens.","output":"Robust induction of T(RM)s by combinatorial nanoshells confers cross-strain sterilizing immunity against lethal influenza viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic indirectly impacts HIV epidemiology in Central/West Africa. We estimated the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV prevention/treatment services and sexual partnerships on HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths among key populations including female sex workers (FSW), their clients, men who have sex with men (MSM), and overall. SETTING: Yaound (Cameroon) and Cotonou (Benin). METHODS: We used mathematical models of HIV calibrated to city- and risk-population-specific demographic/behavioural/epidemic data. We estimated the relative change in 1-year HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths for various disruption scenarios of HIV prevention/treatment services and decreased casual/commercial partnerships, compared to a scenario without COVID-19. RESULTS: A 50% reduction in condom use in all partnerships over 6 months would increase 1-year HIV incidence by 39%, 42%, 31% and 23% among MSM, FSW, clients, and overall in Yaound respectively, and 69%, 49% and 23% among FSW, clients and overall respectively in Cotonou. Combining a 6-month interruption of ART initiation and 50% reduction in HIV prevention/treatment use would increase HIV incidence by 50% and HIV-related deaths by 20%. This increase in HIV infections would be halved by a simultaneous 50% reduction in casual and commercial partnerships. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in condom use following COVID-19 would increase infections among key populations disproportionately, particularly FSW in Cotonou, who need uninterrupted condom provision. Disruptions in HIV prevention/treatment services have the biggest impacts on HIV infections and deaths overall, only partially mitigated by equal reductions in casual/commercial sexual partnerships. Maintaining ART provision must be prioritised to minimise short-term excess HIV-related deaths.","output":"Assessing the potential impact of disruptions due to COVID-19 on HIV among key and lower-risk populations in the largest cities of Cameroon and Benin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Over a few months in the spring of 2011, a cluster of patients with severe respiratory distress were admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). Household clustering was also observed. Extensive laboratory investigations failed to detect an infectious cause. METHODS Clinical, radiological and pathological investigations were conducted and the Korean Center for Disease Control performed epidemiological studies. RESULTS The case series consisted of 17 patients. Their median age was 35 (range 28-49) years. Six were pregnant at presentation and four had given birth 2 weeks previously. All presented with cough and dyspnoea. In the majority of patients (14/17), multifocal areas of patchy consolidation were identified in the lower lung zones on the initial CT. As the condition progressed, the patchy consolidation disappeared (10/13) and diffuse centrilobular ground-glass opacity nodules started to predominate and persist. Pathological specimens (11/17) showed a bronchiolocentric, temporally homogenous, acute lung injury pattern with sparing of the subpleural and peripheral alveolar areas. Ten patients required mechanical ventilation, eight of whom subsequently received extracorporeal life support. Four of the latter underwent lung transplantation. Five of the six patients in the ICU who did not receive lung transplantation died. An epidemiological investigation revealed that all patients had used humidifier disinfectants in their homes. CONCLUSIONS This case series report showed that lung injury and respiratory failure can occur as a result of inhaling humidifier disinfectants. This emphasises the need for more stringent safety regulations for potentially toxic inhalants that might be encountered in the home.","output":"A cluster of lung injury associated with home humidifier use: clinical, radiological and pathological description of a new syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main obstacle in identifying a biological attack (BA), while preventing false alarms, epidemics of panic and unnecessary expenditures is the insufficient data on which to rely. his new method of outbreak analysis is based on our original model of bioterrorism risk assessment. The intention was to develop a model of quick and accurate evaluation of an unusual epidemiologic event (UEE) that would save time, money, human and material resources and reduce confusion and panic. This UEE analysis is a subtle and detailed differentiation through assessment of BA feasibility in comparison with three other types of outbreak scenarios. There are two types of differences between these four scenarios: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative and quantitative differences are defined with 23 and 10 indicators, respectively. Both types of indicators can have three different values: N/A, 0 or 1. We have carried out a feasibility analysis for subtle and detailed differentiation among four outbreak scenarios. As a tool for feasibility analysis we have introduced a system of elimination. System elimination is applied if one component contains all indicators scored with 0 or as N/A C the related scenario is then eliminated from further consideration. The system was applied to four UEEs: (1) an intentional attack by a deliberate use of a biological agent (Amerithrax), (2) a spontaneous outbreak of a new or re-emerging disease (swine flu), (3) a spontaneous outbreak by an accidental release of a pathogen (Sverdlovsk anthrax), and (4) a spontaneous natural outbreak of a known endemic disease that may mimic bioterrorism or biowarfare (Kosovo tularemia). It was found that agent was the most important and the most informative UEE component of the new scoring system.

The COVID-19 epidemic posed an increased risk of treatment delay causing increased DTC morbidity and mortality rate of DTC. Several imaging techniques, including ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computer tomography (CT), have been applied in the early screening and diagnosis of DTC. However, these traditional methods have limited sensitivity and specificity due to dependence on the experience and skill of the radiologists. ABSTRACT: Radiomics is an emerging technique that allows the quantitative extraction of high-throughput features from single or multiple medical images, which cannot be observed directly with the naked eye, and then applies to machine learning approaches to construct classification or prediction models. This method makes it possible to evaluate tumor status and to differentiate malignant from benign tumors or nodules in a more objective manner. To date, the classification and prediction value of radiomics in DTC patients have been inconsistent. Herein, we summarize the available literature on the classification and prediction performance of radiomics-based DTC in various imaging techniques. More specifically, we reviewed the recent literature to discuss the capacity of radiomics to predict lymph node (LN) metastasis, distant metastasis, tumor extrathyroidal extension, disease-free survival, and B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutation and differentiate malignant from benign nodules. This review discusses the application and limitations of the radiomics process, and explores its ability to improve clinical decision-making with the hope of emphasizing its utility for DTC patients.","output":"Radiomics in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer and Nodules: Explorations, Application, and Limitations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People around the world ushered in the new year 2021 with a fear of COVID-19, as family members have lost their loved ones to the disease.

The recurrence might be due to failure to completely remove the prolapsed tissue or insufficient removal capacity of the instruments. Removing more prolapsed tissue to reduce the recurrence is believed to benefit more severe prolapsed hemorrhoids patients. Methods: We evaluated the short- and long-term safety and efficacy in 125 hemorrhoids patients who underwent SH in 2013-2015. Eighty patients had prolapsed tissue less than half of the circular anal dilator (CAD) and underwent a procedure for prolapsing hemorrhoids (PPH), while the remaining 45 patients with hemorrhoid prolapse greater than half of the CAD were treated with a tissue selection therapy stapler stapled transanal rectal resection plus (TST STARR+). Results: There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of operative time, hospitalization time, overall satisfaction or complications. At follow-up of up to 4 years after surgery, there was no significant difference in recurrence rates between TST STARR+ group and PPH group (5.2% vs. 4.7%, p < 0.05). The mean width and volume of the resected tissues were significantly larger in the TST STARR+ group than in the PPH group (4.8 vs. 2.9 cm, 10.2 vs. 4.4 cm3, P < 0.05).

This approach adopted in this work is not conventional when solving biological models by fractional derivatives. RESULTS: The results showed that the model has two equilibrium points namely, disease-free, and endemic equilibrium points, respectively. We showed conditions necessitating the existence of the endemic equilibrium point and showed that the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable. We also tested the stability of our solution using the iterative Laplace transform method on our model which was also shown stable agreeing with the disease-free equilibrium. CONCLUSIONS: Numerical simulations of our model showed clear comparison with our analytical results. The numerical solutions show that given fractional operator like the Caputo-Fabrizio operator, it is less noisy and hence plays a major role in making a precise decision and gives room or opportunity (freedom) to use data of specific patients as the model can be easily adjusted to accommodate this, as it a better fit for the patients data and provide meaningful predictions.

However, there is a paucity of data on patients' and nurses' abilities and perspectives on MDI with spacer for the treatment of acute airway obstruction during such an outbreak. METHODS We evaluated 50 consecutive MDI-with-spacer treatments administered in the respiratory wards of the National University Hospital of Singapore, and interviewed the patients after each treatment during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We also conducted interviews with 50 nurses who had experience in administering bronchodilators via both nebulizer and MDI with spacer. RESULTS Forty-six patients (92%) were able to use MDI with spacer effectively. Sixteen percent of the patients preferred nebulizer over MDI with spacer. Fifty-eight percent of the patients thought MDI with spacer was easier to use than nebulizer, and 34% thought MDI was as easy to use as nebulizer. Sixteen percent of the patients thought that nebulizer was more effective than MDI with spacer in relieving their symptoms. Ninety-six percent of the nurses preferred nebulizer over MDI with spacer. Forty-two nurses (84%) thought that nebulizer was more effective for treating acute airflow obstruction in the hospital.

Recent approaches for improvements are in a similar direction by just proposing variations of the AF, such as Leaky ReLU (LReLU), while maintaining the solution within the same unresolved gradient problems. In this paper, the Absolute Leaky ReLU (ALReLU) AF, a variation of LReLU, is proposed, as an alternative method to resolve the common 'dying ReLU problem' on NN-based algorithms for supervised learning. The experimental results demonstrate that by using the absolute values of LReLU's small negative gradient, has a significant improvement in comparison with LReLU and ReLU, on image classification of diseases such as COVID-19, text and tabular data classification tasks on five different datasets.","output":"ALReLU: A different approach on Leaky ReLU activation function to improve Neural Networks Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of hybrid indolo[3,2-c]isoquinoline (?-carboline) analogs incorporating two pyrimidine and piperizine ring frameworks were synthesized.

To circumvent this barrier, various lipid-based herbal formulations have been developed and trialled with promising experimental results. PURPOSE: This scoping review aims to describe the effect of lipid-based formulations on the oral bioavailability of herbal compounds. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across three electronic databases (Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library) between January 2010 and January 2021 to identify relevant studies. The articles were rigorously screened for eligibility. Data from eligible studies were then extracted and collated for synthesis and descriptive analysis using Covidence. RESULTS: A total of 109 studies were included in the present review: 105 animal studies and four clinical trials. Among the formulations investigated, 50% were emulsions, 34% lipid particulate systems, 12% vesicular systems, and 4% were other types of lipid-based formulations. Within the emulsion system classification, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems were observed to produce the best improvements in oral bioavailability, followed by mixed micellar formulations. The introduction of composite lipid-based formulations and the use of uncommon surfactants such as sodium oleate in emulsion preparation was shown to consistently enhance the bioavailability of herbal compounds with poor oral absorption. Interestingly, the lipid-based formulations of magnesium lithospermate B and Pulsatilla chinensis produced an absolute bioavailability greater than 100% indicating the possibility of prolonged systemic circulation. With respect to chemical conjugation, D--tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) was the most frequently used and significantly improved the bioavailability of its phytoconstituents. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that there is no distinct lipid-based formulation superior to the other. Bioavailability improvements were largely dependent on the nature of the phytoconstituents. This scoping review, however, provided a detailed summary of the most up-to-date evidence on phytoconstituents formulated into lipid preparations and their oral bioavailability. We conclude that a systematic review and meta-analysis between bioavailability improvements of individual phytoconstituents (such as kaempferol, morin and myricetin) in various lipid-based formulations will provide a more detailed association. Such a review will be highly beneficial for both researchers and herbal manufacturers.","output":"Improving oral bioavailability of medicinal herbal compounds through lipid-based formulations - A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As of 30 April 2020, 203.715 SARS-CoV-2 infections had been reported in Spain, 54.486 in Madrid, 21.4% were health care workers.

A 2011 study reported that Asian older adults had lower prevalence of disability compared to non-Hispanic white. We revisited the estimate a decade later using the recently released 2015-2019 Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) from the American Community Survey (ACS). We estimated the prevalence of six types of disability in adults aged 60 years and older who self-identified as Vietnamese, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Asian Indian, or non-Hispanic White. We also compared the risk for each disability type between Vietnamese and non-Hispanic White (reference group) using the adjusted (age, sex, marital status, education and poverty level) odds ratios. All analyses used survey weights for point estimate and the jackknife method for standard error. Significantly higher prevalence of limitations in independent living, self-care, cognitive function, and blindness were reported by Vietnamese than by non-Hispanic White. Vietnamese also had the highest prevalence in all six types of disability of the Asian groups examined. The adjusted odds ratio of limitations in independent living, self-care, and cognitive function was significantly higher for Vietnamese than non-Hispanic White. These findings suggest a possible negative outcome trend with the aging of the Vietnamese population.

Methods: A cross-sectional, online study using a validated Arabic version of the 5C questionnaire was conducted through different media platforms in different Arabic-speaking countries. The questionnaire included three sections: socio-demographics, COVID-19 related questions, and the 5C scale of vaccine psychological antecedents, namely confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility. Results: A total of 4,474 participants, 40.8% males from 13 Arab countries were included in the study. About 26.7% of participants had confidence in COVID-19 vaccination, 10.7% had complacency, 96.5% had no constraints, 48.8% had calculation and 40.4% had collective responsibility. The 5C antecedents showed variation among countries with confidence and collective responsibility being higher in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (59% and 58%, respectively), complacency and constraints were higher in Morocco (21% and 7%, respectively) and calculation was higher in Sudan (60%). Regression analysis revealed that sex, age, educational degrees, being a health care professional, getting a COVID-19 infection, having a relative infected or died from COVID-19 can affect the 5C psychological antecedents by different degrees.

Emerging adulthood, including the first year of college, is associated with declines in healthy eating and physical activity, as well as possible heightened distress. The impact of COVID-19 may exacerbate these concerns. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to examine changes in health behaviors and perceived stress in emerging adults over the first year of college and to determine whether prepandemic health behaviors were protective for mental health and stress during the initial changes after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS First-year college students (N = 234, 58.6% female) completed three surveys during their first year of school, the third being after the onset of COVID-19 and during a stay-at-home order. At Time 3, we also assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression. RESULTS Using linear mixed modeling, sedentary time increased and physical activity decreased over time, but 20%-35% of students reported improvements in these behaviors. Dietary changes appeared mixed, with some improvements noted early during COVID-19. Perceived stress increased over time. Multiple regression indicated that of the health behaviors examined for protective effects on mental health and stress during the pandemic, only diet quality emerged as a significant predictor. CONCLUSIONS Although notable declines in some health habits were observed over time, including following COVID-19 disruptions, some students reported improved health behaviors.

Ratios, medians, and ranges were calculated to describe categorical variables. Chi-square tests were performed to compare the difference between ratios. Results: A total of 741 patients receiving 746 HSCT procedures-including 376 allogeneic, 370 autologous, and four of both types-were included in the study. The overall incidence of BSI in post-transplantation patients was 8.8% (N = 65). Gram-negative bacteria were the most common strains each year (33.3-81.3%), and E. coli was the most frequently isolated (33.3%). Enterobacterales represented 64.9% of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, and the ratio of MDR rebounded from 25% to 100% within a year.

We aim to measure changes in health outcomes, including physical frailty status (SHARE-FI), clinical frailty status (CFS) and muscle mass, as a result of an optimised exercise and dietary intervention versus usual care in a primary care (PC) setting. The intervention has been derived from our systematic review and meta-analysis findings and optimised through patient and public involvement and multidisciplinary team input. Methods: This study is a multicentre randomised controlled parallel arm trial with a three month follow up. 210 eligible people aged 65 and over, no more than mildly frail, will be recruited in seven PC practices in Ireland and randomly assigned to intervention or usual care. Intervention participants will be provided a leaflet with strength exercises, protein dietary guidance and educational discussion. Baseline measurements will include demographics, health indicators, comorbidities, malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST), frailty status (SHARE-FI, CFS) and muscle mass (bioelectrical impedance). Primary outcome will be frailty status measured by SHARE-FI at three months.

Methods: Medical records of all CRAO patients who attended our tertiary referral hospital, during COVID-19 local outbreak (March to November 2020), were reviewed. Respiratory tract samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by the validated Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. If patients were able to cooperate, oropharyngeal saliva samples were obtained. Otherwise, nasopharyngeal and deep throat swabs were taken by registered nurses. Results: A total of 15 CRAO patients (7 males, 8 females) were identified during the 9-month study period.

Methods: Patients initiating a new systemic therapy at one of 210 practice sites in the Texas Oncology Practice were invited to use in the Navigating Cancer ePRO platform, with rolling implementation from July-December 2020. Participating patients received a weekly prompt by text message or email (patient choice) to selfreport common symptoms and well-being via web or smartphone. Severe self-reported symptoms triggered a real-time notification alert to nursing triage to address the symptom. Enrollment and compliance were systematically tracked weekly with evaluation of barriers and facilitators to adoption and sustainability. Results: 4375 patients planning systemic treatment enrolled and participated, with baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. 73% (1841/2522) of enrolled patients with follow up completed at least one ePRO assessment, and among these individuals, 65% (8762/25061) of all available weekly ePRO assessments were completed. Over a 10-week period, compliance with weekly symptom reporting declined from 72% to 52%. Patients on oral therapy had higher compliance rates overall. Barriers currently being addressed include lack of a second reminder text/email prompt, inconsistent discussion of reported ePROs by clinicians at visits, and COVID-related changes in workflow. Facilitators included patient and staff engagement on the importance of PROs for symptom management. Conclusions: ePROs can be effectively implemented in community oncology practice. Utilization of ePROs is high, but diminishes over time without attention to barriers. Ongoing work to address barriers and optimize compliance are underway.

In March 2020, Mauritius endured a small first wave and quickly implemented control measures which allowed elimination of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. When borders to the island reopened, it was accompanied by mandatory quarantine and testing of incoming passengers to avoid reintroduction of the virus into the community. As variants of concern (VOCs) emerged elsewhere in the world, Mauritius began using genomic surveillance to keep track of quarantined cases of these variants. In March 2021, another local outbreak occurred, and sequencing was used to investigate this new wave of local infections. Here, we analyze 154 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Mauritius, which represent 12% of all the infections seem in Mauritius, these were both from specimens of incoming passengers before March 2021 and those of cases during the second wave. Our findings indicate that despite the presence of known VOCs Beta (B.1.351) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) among quarantined passengers, the second wave of local SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mauritius was caused by a single introduction and dominant circulation of the B.1.1.318 virus. The B.1.1.318 variant is characterized by fourteen non-synonymous mutations in the S-gene, with five encoded amino acid substitutions (T95I, E484K, D614G, P681H, D796H) and one deletion (Y144del) in the Spike glycoprotein. This variant seems to be increasing in prevalence and it is now present in 34 countries. This study highlights that despite having stopped the introduction of more transmissible VOCs by travel quarantines, a single undetected introduction of a B.1.1.318 lineage virus was enough to initiate a large local outbreak in Mauritius and demonstrated the need for continuous genomic surveillance to fully inform public health decisions.","output":"A Novel and Expanding SARS-CoV-2 Variant, B.1.1.318, dominates infections in Mauritius"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Given the limited collaborative international studies that evaluated COVID-19 in patients with cancer in comparison to patients without cancer, we aimed to determine the independent risk factors associated with increased 30-day mortality and the impact of novel treatment modalities in a large group of cancer and non-cancer patients with COVID-19 from multiple countries. Methods We retrospectively collected de-identified data on cancer and non-cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January and November 2020, at 16 centers in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. A logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictors of all-cause mortality within 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Results Of the total 4015 COVID-19 confirmed patients entered, we analyzed 3966 patients, 1115 cancer and 2851 non-cancer patients. Cancer patients were older than non-cancer patients (median age, 61 vs 50 years;p< 0.0001);more likely to be pancytopenic , had pulmonary disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus. In addition, they were more likely to present with higher inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer, ferritin and procalcitonin), but were less likely to present with clinical symptoms. By multivariable logistic regression analysis, cancer was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality (OR 1.46;95% CI 1.03 to 2.07;p=0.035). Older age (65 years) was the strongest predictor of 30-day mortality in all patients (OR 4.55;95% CI 3.34 to 6.20;p< 0.0001). Remdesivir was the only therapeutic agent independently associated with decreased 30-day mortality (OR 0.58;CI 0.39-0.88;p=0.009). Among patients on low-flow oxygen at admission, patients who received remdesivir had a lower 30-day mortality rate than those who were on high flow oxygen (5.9% vs 17.6%;p=0.03). Patients transfused with convalescent plasma within 1 day of diagnosis had a lower 30-day mortality rate than those transfused later (1% vs 7%, p=0.04). Conclusion Cancer is an independent risk factor for increased 30-day all-cause mortality from COVID-19. Remdesivir, particularly in patients receiving low-flow oxygen, can reduce 30-day all-cause mortality, as well as convalescent plasma given early after COVID-19 diagnosis. Disclosures Roy F.

Along with inciting acute pulmonary complications, the virus attacks the cardiac, renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal systems as well as the central nervous system (CNS). The person-to-person variability in susceptibility of individuals to disease severity still remains a puzzle, although the comorbidities and the age/gender of a person are believed to play a key role. SARS-CoV-2 needs angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for its infectivity, and the association between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 leads to a decline in ACE2 activity and its neuroprotective effects. Acute respiratory distress may also induce hypoxia, leading to increased oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Infection of the neurons along with peripheral leukocytes activation results in proinflammatory cytokine release, rendering the brain more susceptible to neurodegenerative changes. Due to the advancement in molecular biology techniques and vaccine development programs, the world now has hope to relatively quickly study and combat the deadly virus. On the other side, however, the virus seems to be still evolving with new variants being discovered periodically. In keeping up with the pace of this virus, there has been an avalanche of studies. This review provides an update on the recent progress in adjudicating the CNS-related mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potential to incite or accelerate neurodegeneration in surviving patients. Current as well as emerging therapeutic opportunities and biomarker development are highlighted.","output":"A Peek into Pandoras Box: COVID-19 and Neurodegeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The current study aimed to identify effective factors on the death among COVID-19 patients","output":"Factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Childhood immunisation services have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO recommends considering outbreak risk using epidemiological criteria when deciding whether to conduct preventive vaccination campaigns during the pandemic. METHODS: We used two to three models per infection to estimate the health impact of 50% reduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 and delay of campaign vaccination from 2020 to 2021 for measles vaccination in Bangladesh, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Sudan, for meningococcal A vaccination in Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria, and for yellow fever vaccination in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, and Nigeria. Our counterfactual comparative scenario was sustaining immunisation services at coverage projections made prior to COVID-19 (i.e. without any disruption). RESULTS: Reduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 without catch-up vaccination may lead to an increase in measles and yellow fever disease burden in the modelled countries. Delaying planned campaigns in Ethiopia and Nigeria by a year may significantly increase the risk of measles outbreaks (both countries did complete their supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) planned for 2020). For yellow fever vaccination, delay in campaigns leads to a potential disease burden rise of >1 death per 100,000 people per year until the campaigns are implemented. For meningococcal A vaccination, short-term disruptions in 2020 are unlikely to have a significant impact due to the persistence of direct and indirect benefits from past introductory campaigns of the 1- to 29-year-old population, bolstered by inclusion of the vaccine into the routine immunisation schedule accompanied by further catch-up campaigns. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19-related disruption to vaccination programs varies between infections and countries. Planning and implementation of campaigns should consider country and infection-specific epidemiological factors and local immunity gaps worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic when prioritising vaccines and strategies for catch-up vaccination.

The study will report on the descriptive characteristics of the population, including gender, age and prior abnormalities to their blood test results. We will compare the results of those with positive and negative PCR test results, where appropriate. Nine hundred sixty-two adult patients attended publicly funded primary health care settings in the state of Qatar between February the 10th and April the 30th 2020 with a diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 infections had prior recorded blood investigations in the last six months and were included in this study. The population was young, mean of age is 38.811.6. (Median: 36 [Min: 19 - Max: 85]). Complete blood count of the sample had minimal missing data points. Females were more presented in our samples, Female (n=560, 58.21%) and Male (n=402, 41.79%).

About 5% of patients with Covid-19 have severe symptoms including septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the failure of several organs, while most of them have mild symptoms. Frequently, the kidneys are involved through direct or indirect mechanisms. Kidney involvement mainly manifests itself as proteinuria and acute kidney injury (AKI). The SARS-CoV-2-induced kidney damage is expected to be multifactorial; directly it can infect the kidney podocytes and proximal tubular cells and based on an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) pathway it can lead to acute tubular necrosis, protein leakage in Bowman's capsule, collapsing glomerulopathy and mitochondrial impairment. The SARS-CoV-2-driven dysregulation of the immune responses including cytokine storm, macrophage activation syndrome, and lymphopenia can be other causes of the AKI. Organ interactions, endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, rhabdomyolysis, and sepsis are other potential mechanisms of AKI.

A key finding of this study is that the cationic oligomer with a central thiophene ring and imidazolium charged groups give outstanding performance in both killing of E. coli bacterial cells and inactivation of the virus at very short times. Our introduction of cationic N-Methyl Imidazolium groups enhances the light-activation process for both E. coli and SARS-Cov-2 but dampens the dark killing of the bacteria and eliminates the dark inactivation of the virus. For the studies with this oligomer in solution at concentration of 1 g/mL and E. coli we obtain 3 log killing of the bacteria with 10 min irradiation with LuzChem cool white lights (mimicking indoor illumination). With the oligomer in solution at a concentration of 10 g/mL, we observe 4 logs inactivation (99.99 %) in 5 minutes of irradiation and total inactivation after 10 min. The oligomer is quite active against E. coli on oligomer-coated wipes papers and glass fiber filter supports. The SARS-Cov-2 is also inactivated by the oligomer coated glass fiber filter papers.

SARS-CoV-2 is not merely a respiratory virus, as its target cells range from upper airway respiratory cells to pulmonary cells but also and above all to the cardiovascular cells, such as pericytes and endothelial cells. Indeed, the pathology related to SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, may be defined as a thromboinflammatory syndrome in its most severe form, characterized by sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), which is prevalent in individuals already presenting a chronic level of inflammation (e.g., obese individuals, elderly) and hypertension. Pregnancy is not only an inflammatory-prone condition but is characterized by a consistent rearrangement of the blood circulation and coagulation profile. Cardiac output increases while arterial systolic and diastolic pressure decrease, regardless of the activation of the RAS system. ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor into the host cells, which transforms Ang II in Ang 1C7, is highly expressed in endothelial, smooth muscle cells and pericytes of placental villi, regulating blood pressure and fetal development. Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy disorder characterized by hypertension and low levels of ACE2, endothelial dysfunction, and a high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resembling COVID-19 manifestations. Whereas pre-eclampsia and COVID-19 have overlapping clinical features, a role for SARS-CoV-2 as a leading cause of pre-eclampsia in COVID-19 positive pregnant women has not been clarified yet.

Pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) is a simple and safe treatment for neurogenic dysphagia. It has been shown that PES can restore safe swallowing in orally intubated or tracheotomized ICU patients with neurogenic dysphagia following severe stroke. We report the case of a patient with severe neurogenic post-extubation dysphagia (PED) due to prolonged intubation and severe general muscle weakness related to COVID-19, which was successfully treated using PES. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old Caucasian female patient with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection developed neurogenic dysphagia following prolonged intubation in the ICU. To avoid aerosol-generating procedures, her swallowing function was evaluated non-instrumentally as recommended by recently published international guidelines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her swallowing function was markedly impaired and PES therapy was recommended. PES led to a rapid improvement of the PED, as evaluated by bedside swallowing assessments using the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS) and Dysphagia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS), and diet screening using the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). The improved swallowing, as reflected by these measures, allowed this patient to transfer from the ICU to a non-intensive medical department 5 days after completing PES treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PES treatment contributed to the restoration of a safe swallowing function in this critically ill patient with COVID-19 and ICU-acquired swallowing dysfunction. Early clinical bedside swallowing assessment and dysphagia intervention in COVID-19 patients is crucial to optimize their full recovery. PES may contribute to a safe and earlier ICU discharge of patients with ICU-acquired swallowing dysfunction. Earlier ICU discharge and reduced rates of re-intubation following PES can help alleviate some of the pressure on ICU bed capacity, which is critical in times of a health emergency such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Successful treatment of intubation-induced severe neurogenic post-extubation dysphagia using pharyngeal electrical stimulation in a COVID-19 survivor: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Echinaforce? is the standardised extract of Echinacea purpurea from Bioforce, Switzerland.

Severe complications including rhabdomyolysis regularly lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). The aim of this short report was to discuss management and differential diagnosis of massive creatine kinase (CK) elevation. PATIENT, MATERIAL AND METHODS: Herein, we report on a 19-year-old Austrian male of African descent with a history of respiratory tract infections and whole-body pain. He further developed acute viral myositis and massive CK elevation up to 440,000 IU/L but without any signs of AKI. A literature search relating AVM, management and differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was conducted in PubMed and UptoDate. RESULTS: A full panel of serological and autoimmune blood work-up including testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, influenza A/B, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and autoantibodies against various extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) did not reveal evidence for viral originators or autoimmune diseases. This case indicates that in acute viral myositis associated with extreme CK elevation (>400,000 IU/L) AKI might be completely absent.

Anaesthetists, however, do not usually observe the raw EEG data: they generally pay attention only to the Bispectral Index (BIS?) and other indices calculated by EEG monitors. This abstracted information only partially characterizes EEG features. To properly appreciate the availability and reliability of EEG-derived indices, it is necessary to understand how raw EEG changes during anaesthesia. With hemi-frontal lead EEGs obtained under volatile anaesthesia or propofol anaesthesia, the dominant EEG frequency decreases and the amplitude increases with increasing concentrations of anaesthetic. Looking more closely, the EEG changes are more complicated. At surgical concentrations of anaesthesia, spindle waves (alpha range) become dominant. At deeper levels, this activity decreases, and theta and delta waves predominate. At even deeper levels, EEG waveform changes into a burst and suppression pattern, and finally becomes flat. EEG waveforms vary in the presence of noxious stimuli (surgical skin incision), which is not always reflected in BIS?, or other processed EEG indices. Spindle waves are adequately sensitive, however, to noxious stimuli: under surgical anaesthesia they disappear when noxious stimuli are applied, and reappear when adequate analgesia is obtained. To prevent awareness during anaesthesia, I speculate that the most effective strategy is to administer anaesthetic agents in such a way as to maintain anaesthesia at a level where spindle waves predominate.","output":"Changes in the electroencephalogram during anaesthesia and their physiological basis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 and its' accompanied lockdowns impacted the entire globe in ways the world is only beginning to comprehend.

New methodologies for studying the immune response of dogs during Leishmania infection and after receiving vaccines and treatments against CVL would be useful. In this context, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy dogs to evaluate procedures related to (i) establishment of in vitro conditions of monocytes differentiated into macrophages infected with L. chagasi and (ii) purification procedures of T-cell subsets (CD4(+) and CD8(+)) using microbeads. Our data demonstrated that after 5 days of differentiation, macrophages were able to induce significant phagocytic and microbicidal activity after L. chagasi infection and also showed increased frequency of parasitism and a higher parasite load. Although N-acetyl--d-glucosaminidase (NAG) levels presented similar levels of macrophage culture and L. chagasi infection, a progressive decrease in myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels was a hallmark over 5 days of culture.

New Zealand moved swiftly to the highest alert level 4, described as lockdown, as the epidemic curve quickly accelerated. Auckland City Hospital saw a temporary change in acute surgical admissions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the national lockdown on emergency general surgery. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients admitted to Auckland City Hospital via the Acute Surgical Unit during lockdown from 26 March to 27 April 2020. A comparison group was collected from the 33 days prior to lockdown, 22 February to 25 March 2020. RESULTS The number of admissions decreased by 26% (p-value 0.000). A 56.8% decrease in patients presenting with trauma was found (p-value 0.002). After exclusion of trauma patients, no statistical difference in discharge diagnosis was found. There was a 43.6% reduction in operations performed (p-value 0.037). There was a difference found in the management of appendicitis and cholecystitis (p-value 0.003).

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of Peoples Republic of China during January 10CFebruary 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067C87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16C6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350C61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567C2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic.

Children were grouped according to detection of bacterial otopathogen in their middle ear effusion (MEE) at the time of VTI, and outcomes for future otorhinolaryngology surgery compared. RESULTS Age, gender, pneumococcal vaccination status, antibiotic usage, day-care attendance, number of siblings and number of AOM episodes were similar between groups.

The authors present a new colorimetric test to assess AChE and BChE activity in biological samples using chromogenic reagents, treated 3D-printed measuring pads and a smartphone camera as a signal detector. Multiwell pads treated with reagent substrates 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenyl acetate, indoxylacetate, ethoxyresorufin and methoxyresorufin were prepared and tested for AChE and BChE. In the experiments, 3D-printed pads containing indoxylacetate as a chromogenic substrate were optimal for analytical purposes. The best results were achieved using the red (R) channel, where the limit of detection was 4.05 kat/mL for BChE and 4.38 kat/mL for AChE using a 40 L sample and a 60 min assay. The major advantage of this method is its overall simplicity, as samples are applied directly without any specific treatment or added reagents. The assay was also validated to the standard Ellmans assay using human plasma samples.

Period 0 covers weeks 5 to 9 of 2020, where mainly sporadic cases of younger age were observed and few regional outbreaks emerged. In total, 167 cases with mostly mild outcomes were reported. Subsequently, the first COVID-19 wave occurred in period 1 (weeks 10 to 20 of 2020) with a total of 175,013 cases throughout Germany. Increasingly, outbreaks in hospitals and nursing homes were registered. Moreover, elderly cases and severe outcomes were observed more frequently. Period 2 (weeks 21 to 39 of 2020) was an interim period with more mild cases, where many cases were younger and often travel-associated. Additionally, larger trans-regional outbreaks in business settings were reported. Among the 111,790 cases, severe outcomes were less frequent than in period 1. In period 3 (week 40 of 2020 to week 8 of 2021), the second COVID-19 wave started and peaked at the end of 2020. With 2,158,013 reported cases and considerably more severe outcomes in all age groups, the second wave was substantially stronger than the first wave.

Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections raised concerns about real-world vaccine effectiveness. We aimed to evaluate effectiveness of four vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODSWe conducted a retrospective cohort analysis among adults in Almaty using aggregated vaccination data and individual-level breakthrough COVID-19 cases ([]14 days from 2nd dose) using national surveillance data. We ran time-adjusted Cox-proportional-hazards model with sensitivity analysis accounting for varying entry into vaccinated cohort to assess vaccine effectiveness for each vaccine (measured as 1-adjusted hazard ratios) using the unvaccinated population as reference (N=565,390). We separately calculated daily cumulative hazards for COVID-19 breakthrough among vaccinated persons by age and vaccine month. RESULTSFrom February 22 to Sept 1, 2021 in Almaty, 747,558 (57%) adults were fully vaccinated (received 2 doses) and 108,324 COVID-19 cases (11,472 breakthrough) were registered. Vaccine effectiveness against infection was 78% (sensitivity estimates: 74-82%) for QazVac, 77% (72- 81%) for Sputnik V, 71% (69-72%) for Hayat-Vax, and 69% (64-72%) for CoronaVac. Among vaccinated persons, the 90-day follow-up cumulative hazard for breakthrough infection was 2.2%. Cumulative hazard was 2.9% among people aged []60 years versus 1.9% among persons aged 18-39 years (p<0.001), and 1.2% for people vaccinated in February-May versus 3.3% in June-August (p<0.001).

It is important to understand the information that youth are exposed to about perfectionism on the internet and what may be required to make this more helpful in terms of accessing empirically supported descriptions and advice. METHODS: This research used novel methodology to investigate content about perfectionism on websites by conducting a realist synthesis of the definitions of perfectionism, and the degree to which websites contain empirically supported strategies and recognise the advantages and disadvantages of perfectionism. The results were presented to people aged 18 to 24 (N = 18) with a lived experience of anxiety/depression for feedback. RESULTS: The search yielded 992 websites, 266 of which were included in the synthesis; only one met the criteria for excellent quality with most (56%) judged as moderate. The feelings, thoughts, and behaviours that accompany perfectionism were commonly described, and strategies included identifying cognitions and developing alternatives, moving from self-criticism to self-compassion, normalising mistakes, adjusting goals, receiving practical support, and strategies for procrastination. The young people wanted further emphasis on depression and anxiety as consequences of perfectionism that contributed to a vicious cycle. They identified interventions were difficult, with greater levels of support needed. CONCLUSIONS: While most websites contained empirically supported information, the quality needs to improve, and further information needs to be provided on the links with anxiety and depression.

ExoU is phospholipase that is secreted by P. aeruginosa directly into the cytoplasm of target host cells, where its catalytic activity, directed towards plasma membranes, causes rapid cell lysis. Inhibition of ExoU may be a novel strategy to combat acutely cytotoxic ExoU expressing P. aeruginosa infections. Using an in vitro phospholipase assay, we performed a high throughput screen to identify compounds that might be repurposed as therapeutic ExoU inhibitors. We discovered a panel of compounds that appeared to inhibit ExoU through distinct mechanisms. Compound C prevented ExoU membrane localisation in HEK293T cells and caused colocalization with lysosomes, whereas compound D prevented PIP2 dependent oligomerisation of ExoU in vitro suggestive of synergistic action. Indeed, the concentrations required by compounds C and D to inhibit in vitro ExoU catalytic activity, when used in combination, was in the nanomolar region.

Obesity itself has been shown to be a predictor of poor outcome in people infected with the virus. The aim of this study was to report our experience as a high-volume bariatric institution resuming elective weight loss surgery safely amidst emergency admissions of COVID-19-positive patients. METHODS: A standard operating procedure based on national guidance and altered to accommodate local considerations was initiated across the hospital. Data were collected prospectively for 50 consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgery following recommencement of elective surgery after the first national lockdown in the UK. RESULTS: Between 28 June and 5 August 2020, a total of 50 patients underwent bariatric surgery of whom 94% were female. Median age was 41 years and median body mass index was 43.8 (interquartile range 40.0-48.8)kg/m2. Half of the patients (n = 25/50) underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and half underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Of these 50 patients, 9 (18%) had revisional bariatric surgery. Overall median length of hospital stay was 1 day, with 96% of the study population being discharged within 24h of surgery. The overall rate of readmission was 6% and one patient (2%) returned to theatre with an obstruction proximal to jejuno-jejunal anastomosis.

The current literature suggests that there are no specific histopathological characteristics in the placenta related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but placentas from infected women are more likely to show findings of maternal and/or fetal malperfusion. The most common findings in placentas from infected women were fibrin deposition and intense recruitment of inflammatory infiltrates. The transplacental transmission of this virus is unlikely to occur, probably due to low expression of the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in placental cell types.

Their emergence has radically changed the concept of therapy in oncologic patients. However, despite their overall favorable profile, their use has been associated with specific toxicities that may potentially affect treatment. The so-called immune-related adverse events (irAEs) mostly correspond to dysimmune reactions that can affect nearly every organ system, in theory, notably with the development of colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, or thyroiditis. Dermatologic irAEs are also among the most common, reaching a rate of approximately 40%. They are characterized by a wide phenotypic range, including mainly eczematous or lichenoid rashes, psoriasis, or autoimmune bullous disorders. Pruritus may accompany the aforementioned rashes or develop as an isolated symptom without the presence of skin changes. Depigmentation and hair/nail changes can be also observed in association with immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. In the current article, we present an overview of the clinical spectrum of irAEs and provide tips for early recognition and management of dermatologic irAEs.

TILs are important in breast cancer and malignant melanoma and are being established as a marker of prognosis and sensitivity to chemotherapy. This has resulted in various therapies being developed in fields such as breast cancer. However, the evaluation of TILs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is not progressing, and the prognosis is still poor. Thus, investigating whether or not the evaluation of TILs is also effective in HNSCC and prognoses can be predicted with just biopsy samples alone is required. METHODS This study included 153 patients who were diagnosed with HNSCC between January 2010 and December 2019, underwent treatment, and could be followed up thereafter at our institution. RESULTS TILs, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated in all patients, the chemoradiotherapy arm, and the surgery arm. The cut-off value for TILs was 50%. In all patients, OS was 69.8% and 40.2% (P = 0.01) and PFS was 58.4% and 31.6% (P = 0.003) in the high and low TIL groups, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that TILs independently predicted prognosis. In the chemoradiotherapy arm, OS was 70.8% and 31.6% (P = 0.012) and PFS was 63.4% and 20.3% (P = 0.001) in the high and low TIL groups, respectively. No significant differences were noted in the surgery arm. CONCLUSIONS In HNSCC, TILs can be used as a prognosis predictor and chemoradiotherapy biomarker. Assessments can be performed just with hematoxylin-eosin staining and is very simple. This will greatly contribute to report personalized therapy progress. Further evaluations and, thus, prospective clinical multicenter trials are needed to use TILs in clinical practice for HNSCC.","output":"Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes are Prognostic Factors and Can Be Markers of Sensitivity to Chemoradiotherapy in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diseases affecting the colon are common worldwide and can cause a major health problem.

Educational institutions were compelled to adapt their educational strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The innovation of boot camps as a strategy for learning and teaching clinical skills was applied by a school of nursing immediately after the hard lockdown in South Africa. Objectives. To describe the outcomes of implementing an innovative educational strategy for the learning and teaching of clinical skills in an undergraduate nursing programme. Methods. The study comprised a parallel convergent mixed-methods design. Qualitative data were collected from educators (n=7) involved with the boot camps, while the quantitative data comprised module evaluations by 219 students and summative practical assessment scores. Thematic analysis through an inductive approach was applied for the qualitative data, while central tendency and frequencies were used to analyse the quantitative data. Results. Three themes emerged from the narrative data, i.e. rationalising the boot camps, executing the boot camps and learning from the boot camps. Quantitative data support each of the themes. The boot camps appeared to have been appreciated as an emergency innovative educational strategy, with improved student assessment outcomes. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic forced education institutions to adopt a variety of innovative educational strategies. Boot camps appear to have positively influenced the learning and teaching of clinical skills at a school of nursing. There is a need for robust longitudinal research evaluating the long-term effect of such innovative educational strategies.

The Hubs hospitals were required to guarantee full-time evaluation of all patients presenting with cardiovascular diseases with an independent pathway for patients with suspect or confirmed COVID-19 infection. San Raffaele Hospital was identified as Hub for cardiovascular emergencies and the Vascular Surgery Department was remodeled to face this epidemic situation. Surgical treatment was reserved only to symptomatic, urgent, or emergent cases. Large areas of the hospital were simultaneously reorganized to assist patients with COVID-19.

CXCL10, in combination with IL-2 and/or IFN, induces apoptosis in T lymphocytes. Moreover, CXCL10-induced activation of CXCR3 also triggers pro-survival signals that can be blocked by pertussis toxin. The analysis of the downstream signaling kinases shows that apoptosis is p38 MAPK-dependent and the pro-survival signals rely on the sustained activation of PI3K and the transient activation of Akt. On the other hand, the transient activation of p44/p42 ERK did not have an impact on T lymphocyte survival. We propose an immunological model in which CXCL10, together with other co-stimulating cytokines, participates in the activation of T lymphocytes, promotes survival and expansion of certain lymphocyte subsets, and induces chemotaxis toward the infected tissues.

However, directly learning a ranker from implicit data is challenging, as users implicit feedback usually contains bias (e.g., position bias, selection bias) and noise (e.g., clicking on irrelevant but attractive snippets, adversarial clicks). Two main methods have arisen for optimizing rankers based on implicit feedback: counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR), which learns a ranker from the historical click-through data collected from a deployed, logging ranker; and online learning to rank (OLTR), where a ranker is updated by recording user interaction with a result list produced by multiple rankers (usually via interleaving). In this paper, we propose a counterfactual online learning to rank algorithm (COLTR) that combines the key components of both CLTR and OLTR. It does so by replacing the online evaluation required by traditional OLTR methods with the counterfactual evaluation common in CLTR.

A recent study showed that the inhibitory effect of face masks on viral shedding of HRV was less prominent than that on other respiratory viruses. Considering that most Chinese people have worn face masks in public area since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, we aimed to find out whether HRV prevailed among children in 2020 and demonstrate the details of the epidemiological features of HRV under such a special circumstance. METHODS: We summarized the incidences of various respiratory virus infections in patients who visited the Childrens Hospital of Fudan University during 2018C2020, and genotyped HRV positive nasopharyngeal specimens collected from 316 inpatients and 72 outpatients that visited the hospital in 2020. RESULTS: There was a major prevalence of HRV among children in the latter half of 2020, with a clear seasonality that HRV-As prevailed in summer while HRV-Cs in autumn. HRV-As were more prone to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), while HRV-Cs were closely associated with childhood wheezing. The predominant genotypes were A11, A28, A47, A82, A101, C40 and C43. Notably, A21, A82 and A101 took up larger proportions in severe cases than in non-severe cases.

Despite a semi-annual progress report on implementing the Global Strategic Plan in June 2020, there is limited granular information available on the extent of the national plans content and implementation, particularly in the Member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Therefore, we sought to review the preparedness and responsiveness towards the COVID-19 outbreak in the GCC in the first phase of the pandemic and to document lessons learned for improving the ongoing response efforts and preparedness for future pandemics. METHODS: A rapid appraisal was conducted in June 2020 according to the WHO Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan and the accompanying Operational Planning Guidelines. The survey was administered to public health professionals or/and infectious disease experts in the states. The findings were cross-triangulated with secondary data that was publicly available for each country. RESULTS: The preparedness and response efforts of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE were fully compliant with all 11 (100%) pillars of the modified strategic response measures. Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar complied with eight of the pillars. The component on conducting COVID-19 related research was the lowest-performing across all the six states. CONCLUSIONS: All GCC states demonstrated an effective response to the pandemic, enhanced existing infrastructures, and accelerated reforms that would have otherwise taken longer.

Its difficult for encoders to capture such powerful representations under this complex situation. To address this challenge, we propose a self-supervised Siamese inference network to improve the generalization and robustness of encoders. It can encode contextual semantics from full-resolution images and obtain more discriminative representations. To deal with geometric variations of face images, a dense correspondence field is integrated into the network. We further propose a multi-scale decoder with a novel dual attention fusion module (DAF), which can combine the restored and known regions in an adaptive manner. This multi-scale architecture is beneficial for the decoder to utilize discriminative representations learned from encoders into images.

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a key coronavirus enzyme, which is a potential drug target, has been successfully crystallised. There is evidence suggesting that statins exert anti-viral activity and may block the infectivity of enveloped viruses. The aim of this study was to assess whether statins are potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors, using a molecular docking study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock/Vina, a computational docking program. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was docked with all statins, while antiviral and antiretroviral drugs C favipiravir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir C were used as standards for comparison. RESULTS: The binding energies obtained from the docking of 6LU7 with native ligand favipiravir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin were C6.8, C5.8, C7.9, C7.9, C7.0, C7.7, C6.6, C8.2, C7.4, C7.7, and C6.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The number of hydrogen bonds between statins and amino acid residues of Mpro were 7, 4, and 3 for rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin, respectively, while other statins had two hydrogen bonds. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate, based upon the binding energy of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin, that statins could be efficient SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. This is supported by the fact that the effects of some statins, especially pitavastatin, have a binding energy that is even greater than that of protease or polymerase inhibitors.

However, studies have reported the presence of both HR-HPV and EBV in some types of head and neck cancers. In this review, we discuss the potential contribution and role of HR-HPV/EBV coinfection in head and neck carcinogenesis, as well as the mechanisms that are potentially involved.

ABSTRACT: High-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) and EpsteinCBarr virus (EBV) are recognized oncogenic viruses involved in the development of a subset of head and neck cancers (HNCs). HR-HPVs are etiologically associated with a subset of oropharyngeal carcinomas (OPCs), whereas EBV is a recognized etiological agent of undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs). In this review, we address epidemiological and mechanistic evidence regarding a potential cooperation between HR-HPV and EBV for HNC development. Considering that: (1) both HR-HPV and EBV infections require cofactors for carcinogenesis; and (2) both oropharyngeal and oral epithelium can be directly exposed to carcinogens, such as alcohol or tobacco smoke, we hypothesize possible interaction mechanisms. The epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that HR-HPV/EBV cooperation for developing a subset of HNCs is plausible and warrants further investigation.","output":"High-Risk Human Papillomavirus and EpsteinCBarr Virus Coinfection: A Potential Role in Head and Neck Carcinogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the outbreak of COVID-19, medical institutions in China and even around the world are facing unprecedented challenges.

Using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model we establish that under some mild assumptions the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths is a time-delayed approximation of the growth rate of COVID-19 infections. We then hypothesize that the growth rate of COVID-19 infections is a function of population mobility, which leads to a statistical model that predicts the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths as a delayed function of population mobility. The parameters of the statistical model directly reveal the growth rate of infections, the mobility-dependent transmission rate, the mobility-independent recovery rate, and the critical mobility, below which COVID-19 growth rate becomes negative. We fitted the proposed statistical model on publicly available data from 14 countries where daily death counts exceeded 100 for more than 3 days as of May 6th, 2020. The publicly available Google Mobility Index (GMI) was used as a measure of population mobility at the country level.

The estimated 95% confidence interval for the critical mobility is in the range between 36.1% and 47.6% of the pre-COVID-19 mobility.

In Portugal, for instance, public hospitals represent more than half of the National Health Service debt and are decisive in their financial insufficiency. Although profit is not the primary goal of hospitals, it is essential to guarantee their financial sustainability to ensure users' health care and the necessary resources. An analysis of the existing literature shows that researches focus mainly on the hospital's technical efficiency. The literature has paid little or even no attention to the use of composite indicators in hospital benchmarking studies. This study uses the Benefit of Doubt methodology alongside recent data about Portuguese public hospitals (2013C2017) to understand the factors that contribute to low performance and high indebtedness levels. Our results suggest that hospitals perform better in terms of access (average score: 0.982). The group of criteria with the lowest performance was efficiency and productivity (average score: 0.919), suggesting resources waste. Financial performance is, in general, higher than quality, raising social concerns about the way that public hospitals have been managed. Findings bring relevant implications. For example, the way hospitals are currently financed should consider efficiency, productivity, quality, and access. Regulators should ensure that minimum performance levels are fulfilled, applying preventive and corrective measures to avoid future low-performance levels. We suggest that hospital managers introduce satisfaction inquiries to improve quality. These improvements can attract more patients in the medium- or long-term; thus, our results are useful to citizens to make a better choice.","output":"Economic Analysis of Portuguese Public Hospitals Through the Construction of Quality, Efficiency, Access, and Financial Related Composite Indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dried blood spot samples (DBS) provide an alternative sample type to venous blood samples for antibody testing.

The study aimed to compare antibody detection in DBS eluates using the Roche Elecsys ? immunoassay with antibody detection in paired plasma samples, using the same assay. The study was in one Police and one Fire & Rescue facility in England; it comprised of 195 participants within a larger sample COVID-19 serodiagnostics study of keyworkers, EDSAB-HOME. Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of DBS (the index test) relative to plasma (the reference test), at an experimental cut-off; quality of DBS sample collected; estimates of relative sensitivity of DBS vs. plasma immunoassay in a larger population. 18/195 (9.2%) participants tested positive using plasma samples. DBS sample quality varied markedly by phlebotomist, and low sample volume significantly reduced immunoassay signals. Using an experimental cut-off, sensitivity and specificity of DBS were 89.0% (95% CI 67.2, 96.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI 97.9, 100%) respectively compared with using plasma. The limit of detection for DBS is about 30 times higher than for plasma. DBS use for SARS-CoV-2 serology, though feasible, is insensitive relative to immunoassays on plasma. Sample quality impacts on assay performance.

In addition, some measures adopted by most countries in order to contain the virus spread, such as isolation and social distancing, leading to the interruption of routine activities, including partial or complete interruption of face-to-face classes may be associated with increased stress, depression and anxiety among undergraduate medical students (1). From March to September, 2020, the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology carried out the Mario Pinotti II Project (MPII), a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study designed to monitor the COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic disease on hydroxychloroquine, using periodic telephone calls performed by undergraduate medical students (2). Objectives: To compare the mental health status of medical students who were participating from the MPII with theirs colleagues not involved in this project. Methods: A web-based survey via google forms platform was developed by a panel composed of undergraduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor. It included details on demographic and life habits data and domains regarding depression, anxiety and stress, using the DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety & Stress Scale), Brazilian version. Data collection occurred from July 20th to August 31st, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 20.0. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis were performed to verify associations with the DASS-21, defined as dependent variable. A p-value < 0.05 was deemed as significant. This study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee. Results: A total of 684 undergraduate medical students were included in this study, of whom 228 as MPII volunteers (VG) and 456 as control group (CG). Median age was 23 years (IQ 21-24) and the CG was older than the VG (p<0.03). Most of them were white (68.8%) and women (63%). There were no significant differences regarding comorbidities, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity. Older age, male gender, participation of MPII study, absence of a worsening in sleep pattern during the pandemic and a lower number of prior comorbidities were associated with lower DASS21 scores, suggesting a better mental health (Table 1). Conclusion: Several aspects may be involved with mental health, including increased emotional maturity, gender and sleep pattern. Although with marginal independent association, medical students with participation in the MPII study had better mental health than their student colleagues not engaged with this research. Our data pointed out that voluntary participation in a research project which foresees interaction by telephone contact with rheumatic patients, professors, rheumatologists, and colleagues is associated with better mental health.","output":"Participation of undergraduate medical students as investigators in a rheumatologic cohort: Impact on depression, anxiety & stress scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a viral infectious disease which has been created critical situation all over the world As it is a new disease, there is no vaccine to prevent the disease There is no established protocol for treatment for the disease in modern science According to Ayurvedic perspective the disease can be correlated with SannipatikJwaraJanapadUdhwansaVyadhi By following the diet, regime and medications advised for SannipatikJwara in Ayurveda, the disease COVID-19 can be prevented and cured Medicines like Lakshmivilas Rasa, SuvarnaSutshekhar rasa, SitopaladiChurnacan cure the disease Use of emergency medicines like HemgarbhaPottali Rasa can save life of critical patients Hence here is an attempt to establish protocol for the disease COVID-19 as per Ayurveda ? 2020 by Advance Scientific Research","output":"Ayurvedic perspective of COVID-19 diagnosis and management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Turbulent gas motions are observed in the intracluster medium (ICM). The ICM is density-stratified, with the gas density being highest at the centre of the cluster and decreasing radially outwards.

The gas motions are instead explained by anisotropic stratified turbulence, with the stratification quantified by the perpendicular Froude number ($\\\\mathrm{Fr}_\\\\perp$). These turbulent motions are associated with density and pressure fluctuations, which manifest as perturbations in X-ray surface brightness maps of the ICM and as thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZ) fluctuations, respectively.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the medical data of the children who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 26 to March 5, 2020. The children were divided into an asymptomatic group with 41 children and a symptomatic group with 73 children. A subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the effect of different antiviral regimens (monotherapy, double therapy, or triple therapy) and whether interferon -1b was used in combination with azithromycin on the length of hospital stay and the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. RESULTS: A total of 114 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection (72 boys and 42 girls) were enrolled. The median age of the children was 7.1 years. The median length of hospital stay was 10 days and the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 6 days.

There is an ongoing discussion whether the clinical presentation and ventilatory parameters are the same as typical ARDS or not. There is no clear understanding of how the hemodynamic parameters have been affected in COVID-19 ARDS patients. We aimed to compare hemodynamic and respiratory parameters of moderate and severe COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. These patients were monitored with an advanced hemodynamic measurement system by the transpulmonary thermodilution method in prone and supine positions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of 17 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 16 patients diagnosed with other types of diseases with moderate and severe ARDS, mechanically ventilated, placed in a prone position, had advanced hemodynamic measurements with PiCCO, and stayed in the intensive care unit for more than a week were analyzed retrospectively. Patient characteristics and arterial blood gases analysis recorded at admission and respiratory and advanced hemodynamic parameters during the first week were compared in prone and supine positions. RESULTS: No difference was observed in the respiratory parameters including respiratory system compliance between COVID-19 and non-COVD-19 patients in prone and supine positions. In comparison of advanced hemodynamic parameters in the first week of intensive care, the extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability indexes measured in supine position of COVID-19 ARDS patients were found to be significantly higher than non-COVID-19 patients. Duration of prone position was significantly longer in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 ARDS.

While there is a global acceptance of the benefits of exercise for the general population, there exists hesitancy and confusion among health-care professionals, particularly oncologists, as to whether these benefits translate to cancer patients. Patient referrals to accessible, structured exercise programs in this setting are often overlooked by physicians when formulating a cancer management plan. There is however increasing awareness and acceptance of cancer survivorship as a part of the cancer care continuum, identifying multiple factors that contribute to well-being beyond just cancer outcomes. Efforts to optimize cancer survivorship have stimulated further academic interest in the benefits of healthy living and particularly exercise oncology. There is now compelling evidence that exercise, which includes daily activities such as walking, as well as structured programs, improves multiple-cancer outcomes such as fatigue, quality of life and likely survival, and warrants consideration in the multidisciplinary care of cancer patients. International guidelines have been established that recommend counseling cancer patients with regard to healthy lifestyle changes including exercise. However, there still remains a reluctance from oncology physicians to prescribe exercise for these patients, largely due to uncertainty with regard to their patients' ability to tolerate such an intervention, coupled with insufficient understanding of the potential benefits of these programs. There also exist patient barriers and attitudes that must be overcome. Exercise strategies and bespoke programs that are tailored to the unique abilities and goals of the patients will enhance participation. To move the field forward and integrate exercise oncology into standard practice, it is imperative to raise awareness of the benefits of exercise to cancer patients and their health-care providers. This will facilitate the prescription of exercise as part of the multimodal treatment plan with the ultimate aim of promoting an active lifestyle to optimize patient care and well-being.","output":"Exercise oncology: an emerging discipline in the cancer care continuum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-cell sequencing is a fast developing and very promising field; however, it is not commonly used in forensics. The main motivation behind introducing this technology into forensics is to improve mixture deconvolution, especially when a trace consists of the same cell type. Successful studies demonstrate the ability to analyze a mixture by separating single cells and obtaining CE-based STR profiles. This indicates a potential use of the method in other forensic investigations, like forensic DNA phenotyping, in which using mixed traces is not fully recommended. For this study, we collected single-source autopsy blood from which the white cells were first stained and later separated with the DEPArray? NT System.

With this survey we aimed to rapidly assess the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent physical distancing/isolation measures on the mental health and physical activity of pregnant and postpartum women. Methods: Between April 14 and May 8, 2020, we recruited women who were pregnant or within the first year after delivery to participate in an online survey. This included questionnaires on self-reported levels of depression/depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Survey; EPDS), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI-State), and physical activity. Current and pre-pandemic values were assessed for each. Results: Of 900 eligible women, 520 (58%) were pregnant and 380 (42%) were in the first year after delivery. Sixty-four percent of women reported reduced physical activity with the onset of isolation measures, while 15% increased, and 21% had no change to their physical activity. An EPDS score >13 (indicative of depression) was self-identified in 15% of respondents pre-pandemic and in 40.7% currently (mean  SD; 7.5  4.9 vs. 11.2  6.3, respectively; p < 0.01, moderate effect). Moderate to high anxiety (STAI-state score >40) was identified in 29% of women before the pandemic (mean STAI = 34.5  11.4) vs. 72% of women currently (mean STAI = 48.1  13.6; p < 0.01, large effect). However, women engaging in at least 150 min of moderate intensity physical activity (meeting current guidelines) during the pandemic had significantly lower scores for both anxiety and depression than those who did not (p < 0.01, large and small effect, respectively). Discussion: This rapid response survey identifies a substantial increase in the likelihood of maternal depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. This highlights the strong need for heightened assessment and treatment of maternal mental health. However, these data also suggest that physical activity, which has previously been shown to reduce depression and depressive symptoms in pregnancy, may be associated with better mental health during the pandemic.","output":"Moms Are Not OK: COVID-19 and Maternal Mental Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the evolution of Spains capitalism during the last decades in order to unveil the factors underlying the harshness with which the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Spain.

To mitigate colony losses, beekeepers in Canada and around the world introduce queens into replacement colonies; however, Canadas short queen rearing season has historically limited the production of early season queens. As a result, Canadian beekeepers rely on the importation of foreign bees, particularly queens from warmer climates. Importing a large proportion of (often mal-adapted) queens each year creates a dependency on foreign bee sources, putting beekeeping, and pollination sectors at risk in the event of border closures, transportation issues, and other restrictions as is currently happening due to the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. Although traditional Canadian queen production is unable to fully meet early season demand, increasing domestic queen production to meet mid- and later season demand would reduce Canadas dependency. As well, on-going studies exploring the potential for overwintering queens in Canada may offer a strategy to have early season domestic queens available. Increasing the local supply of queens could provide Canadian beekeepers, farmers, and consumers with a greater level of agricultural stability and food security. Our study is the first rigorous analysis of the economic feasibility of queen production. We present the costs of queen production for three Canadian operations over two years.

Agranulocytosis, although rare, is a life-threatening condition associated with ATD therapy. For patients who recovered from ATD-induced agranulocytosis, surgery or radioiodine (RAI) therapy are adequate options to restore the patients euthyroid state. Here we report a case of ATD-related agranulocytosis where lithium therapy was used before RAI to control thyrotoxicosis and prevent worsening of hyperthyroidism. Case Report: A 74-year-old female with a previous history of hypertension presented with a 2-month history of weight loss (12 lbs), palpitations and shortness of breath. She was afebrile with a heart rate of 110, a blood pressure of 149/80, a fine tremor and a moderate diffuse goiter. She had a normal eye exam. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated TSH <0.01 uIU/mL (0.35-5.5), FT4 3.11 ng/dL (0.51-1.65) and TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) 40 (<1,0 U/L), consistent with thyrotoxicosis due to Graves disease. She was started on methimazole (MMI) 15mg and metoprolol. After four weeks, symptoms resolved and thyroid function tests (TFT) improved. However, after two months of treatment, she was hospitalized for fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain. White blood cell count (WBC) was 650/L, and neutrophil count was 90/L. A diagnosis of gastroenteritis and agranulocytosis was made and MMI was stopped. After seven days, symptoms resolved, the neutrophil count was 2200/ul and TFT were acceptable (FT4 1.25, ng/dL TT3 1.67 ng/ml, TSH < 0.02 uIU/mL). She was discharged without ATDs and a RAI dose of 20 mCi was scheduled. However, RAI therapy had to be postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. After 3 weeks, TFT worsened and therapy with lithium carbonate 300 mg TID was started as the patient refused thyroidectomy. Lithium was initiated 12 days before RAI therapy and was maintained 7 days after the procedure. No side effects associated with lithium treatment were reported. TFT 7 days after RAI were FT4 1.43, ng/dL TT3 2.05 ng/ml and TSH < 0.02 uIU/mL. One month later, the patient was euthyroid without need for thyroid medication and remains on follow up. Discussion: Serum thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations usually increase after RAI therapy for Graves disease, a worrisome fact in patients with increased risk for cardiovascular complications. Previous studies report that pre-RAI treatment with lithium prevents changes in serum TH concentrations and enhances RAI therapys effectiveness. Here, treatment with lithium was used to control thyrotoxicosis and prevent further increase in TH levels associated with RAI therapy. Lithium is particularly suitable for patients with ATD-related side effects before definitive therapy (radioiodine or thyroidectomy). The antithyroid effect of lithium in this setting should be further studied.","output":"Successful Management of Hyperthyroidism With Lithium and Radioiodine in a Patient With Previous Methimazole-Induced Agranulocytosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Round pneumonia or spherical pneumonia is a well-characterized clinical entity that seems to be less addressed by pediatricians in Taiwan.

This study explored the disease progression, various clinical outcomes, changes in viral load, and costs associated with early remdesivir treatment among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A territory-wide retrospective cohort of 10,419 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized from 21st January 2020 to 31st January 2021 in Hong Kong were identified. Early remdesivir users were matched with controls using propensity-score matching in a ratio of up to 1:4. Study outcomes were time to clinical improvement on the WHO clinical progression scale of at least 1 score; hospital discharge; recovery; viral clearance; low viral load; positive IgG antibody; in-hospital death; and composite outcomes of in-hospital death, requiring invasive ventilation or intensive care. RESULTS: After multiple imputation and propensity-score matching, the median follow-up was 14 days for both remdesivir (n=352) and control (n=1,347) groups. Time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter in the remdesivir group than that of control (hazard ratio (HR)=1.14, 95%CI 1.01-1.29, p=0.038), as well as for achieving low viral load (HR=1.51, 95%CI 1.24-1.83, p<0.001) and positive IgG antibody (HR=1.50, 95%CI 1.31-1.70, p<0.001). Early remdesivir treatment was associated with a lower risk of in-hospital death (HR=0.58, 95%CI 0.34-0.99, p=0.045), in addition to a significantly shorter length of hospital stay (difference -2.56 days, 95%CI -4.86 to -0.26, p=0.029), without increasing the risks of composite outcomes for clinical deterioration.

There is a stepwise increase in mean lactase/sucrase ratio going from crypt to villus. The data indicate that unlike sucrase activity, which is expressed maximally in enterocytes along the entire villus, maximal lactase activity is not attained until midvillus. The delay in expression of maximal lactase activity might help to explain the vulnerability of this enzyme to acute mucosal insult such as occurs in viral gastroenteritis.","output":"Demonstration of a difference in expression of maximal lactase and sucrase activity along the villus in the adult rat jejunum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Ecological Society of America has evaluated current U.S. national policies and practices on biological invasions in light of current scientific knowledge. Invasions by harmful nonnative species are increasing in number and area affected; the damages to ecosystems, economic activity, and human welfare are accumulating. Without improved strategies based on recent scientific advances and increased investments to counter invasions, harm from invasive species is likely to accelerate. Federal leadership, with the cooperation of state and local governments, is required to increase the effectiveness of prevention of invasions, detect and respond quickly to new potentially harmful invasions, control and slow the spread of existing invasions, and provide a national center to ensure that these efforts are coordinated and cost effective. Specifically, the Ecological Society of America recommends that the federal government take the following six actions: (1) Use new information and practices to better manage commercial and other pathways to reduce the transport and release of potentially harmful species; (2) Adopt more quantitative procedures for risk analysis and apply them to every species proposed for importation into the country; (3) Use new cost-effective diagnostic technologies to increase active surveillance and sharing of information about invasive species so that responses to new invasions can be more rapid and effective; (4) Create new legal authority and provide emergency funding to support rapid responses to emerging invasions; (5) Provide funding and incentives for cost-effective programs to slow the spread of existing invasive species in order to protect still uninvaded ecosystems, social and industrial infrastructure, and human welfare; and (6) Establish a National Center for Invasive Species Management (under the existing National Invasive Species Council) to coordinate and lead improvements in federal, state, and international policies on invasive species. Recent scientific and technical advances provide a sound basis for more cost-effective national responses to invasive species. Greater investments in improved technology and management practices would be more than repaid by reduced damages from current and future invasive species.

The current study compares traditional conclusion scales against strength-of-support scales to determine how these new statements might be used by examiners in casework. Each participant completed 60 comparisons within their discipline, which were designed to approximate casework conditions, using either a traditional or a strength-of-support conclusion scale.

Fingerprint examiners were much less likely to use Extremely Strong Support for Common Source than Identification. Footwear examiners treated the traditional and strength-of-support scales similarly, but toolmark examiners were much less likely to use Extremely Strong Support for Common Source than Identification, similar to fingerprint examiners. A separate group of fingerprint examiners used Identification less often when an expanded scale was available. The results demonstrate that expanded scales may result in the highest conclusion category being used less often by examiners when other alternatives are possible, and the term \\"extremely strong support\\" may introduce risk aversion on the part of examiners.","output":"Validating strength-of-support conclusion scales for fingerprint, footwear, and toolmark impressions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The fourth sector, which is composed of ?for-benefit? enterprises, can play a fundamental and positive role for the community, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic It supports public organizations and protects disadvantaged populations Further research is suggested on the cross-sectoral collaboration based on non-profit motivations during the pandemic","output":"The role of the fourth sector in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Endothermal techniques have proved to be effective for treatment of incompetent truncal veins. The tumescentless mechanochemical ablation (MOCA) technique has become an alternative treatment modality, but its outcome with regard to endothermal techniques is still unclear. METHODS A multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial was designed comparing MOCA with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to treat great saphenous vein incompetence with the hypothesis that MOCA is associated with less postprocedural pain and a comparable anatomic and clinical success rate at 1-year follow-up. Disease-specific quality of life and general health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were measured using questionnaires. Inclusion was terminated prematurely because reimbursement was suspended. RESULTS A total of 213 patients (46.3% of intended number of patients) were randomized, of whom 209 were treated (105 in the MOCA group and 104 in the RFA group). Overall median pain scores during the first 14 days were lower after MOCA (0.2 vs 0.5 after RFA; P = .010), although the absolute difference was small. At 30 days, similar complication numbers (MOCA, n = 62; RFA, n = 63) and HRQoL scores (Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire: MOCA, 8.9; RFA, 7.6; P = .233) were observed. Hyperpigmentation was reported in seven patients in the MOCA group and two patients in the RFA group (P = .038). In the MOCA group, there were four complete failures (3.8%) compared with none in the RFA group (P = .045), although in one patient at 1 year, the vein showed occlusion. Median 30-day Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) was significantly lower at 30 days after MOCA (1.0 vs 2.0 in the RFA group; P = .001), whereas VCSS was comparable at baseline (MOCA, 4.0; RFA, 5.0; P = .155). The 1- and 2-year anatomic success rate was lower after MOCA (83.5% and 80.0%) compared with RFA (94.2% and 88.3%; P = .025 and .066), mainly driven by partial recanalizations. After 2 years of follow-up, no differences were observed in the number of complete failures. Similar clinical success rates at 1 year (MOCA, 88.7%; RFA, 93.2%; P = .315) and 2 years (MOCA, 93.0%; RFA, 90.4%; P = .699) and no differences in HRQoL scores on the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire at 1 year (MOCA, 7.5; RFA, 7.0; P = .753) and 2 years (MOCA, 5.0%; RFA, 4.8%; P = .573) were observed. There were two cardiac serious adverse events, a ventricular fibrillation in the MOCA group (1 year) and an unstable angina in the RFA group (2 years). One deep venous thrombosis occurred in the RFA group on 1-year duplex ultrasound, without clinical sequelae. CONCLUSIONS Unilateral treatment with MOCA in the short term resulted in less postoperative pain but more hyperpigmentation compared with RFA and a faster improvement in VCSS.

Given the chemical nature of these compounds two features are always present. A portion or portions of the molecule that has little affinity for apolar surfaces and media and on the contrary a series of part or one large part that has considerable affinity for hydrophilic, polar or charged media and surfaces. A series of techniques are routinely used to probe the molecular interactions that can arise between components, such as the drug, a range of surface- active excipients and flavor compounds, for example terpenoids and the solvent or dispersion medium. RESULTS Fifty-eight papers were included in the review, a large number (16) being of theoretical nature and an equally large number (14) directly pertaining to medicine and pharmacy; alongside experimental data and phenomenological modelling. The review therefore simultaneously represents an amalgam of review article and research paper with routinely used or established (10) and well-reported methodologies (also included in the citations within the review). Experimental data included from various sources as diverse as foam micro-conductivity, interferometric measurements of surface adsorbates and laser fluorescence spectroscopy (FRAP) are used to indicate the complexity and utility of foams and surface soft matter structures for a range of purposes but specifically, here for encapsulation and incorporation of therapeutics actives (pharmaceutical molecules, vaccines and excipients used in medicaments). Techniques such as interfacial tensiometry, interfacial rheology (viscosity, elasticity and visco-elasticity) and nanoparticle particle size (hydrodynamic diameter) and charge measurements (zeta potential), in addition to atomic force and scanning electron microscopy have proven to be very useful in understanding how such elemental components combine, link or replace one another (competitive displacement). They have also proven to be both beneficial and worthwhile in the sense of quantifying the unseen actions and interplay of adsorbed molecules and the macroscopic effects, such as froth formation, creaming or sedimentation that can occur as a result of these interactions. CONCLUSION The disclosures and evaluations presented in this review confirm the importance of a theoretical understanding of a complex model of the molecular interactions, network and present a framework for the understanding of really very complex physical forms. Future therapeutic developers rely on an understanding of such complexity to garner a route to a more successful administration and formulation of a new generation of therapeutic delivery systems for use in medicine.","output":"Architectures and Mechanical Properties of Drugs and Complexes of Surface-Active Compounds at Air-Water and Oil-Water Interfaces."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To define \\"best possible\\" outcomes for bariatric surgery (BS)(Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB] and sleeve gastrectomy [SG]).

Consequently, outcome comparison across centers and over time is impeded by heterogeneity in case-mix. METHODS Out of 39,424 elective BS performed in 19 high-volume academic centers from 3 continents between June 2012 and May 2017, we identified 4120 RYGB and 1457 SG low-risk cases defined by absence of previous abdominal surgery, concomitant procedures, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, cardiopathy, renal insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, immunosuppression, anticoagulation, BMI>50 kg/m and age>65 years. We chose clinically relevant endpoints covering the intra- and postoperative course. Complications were graded by severity using the comprehensive complication index. Benchmark values were defined as the 75th percentile of the participating centers' median values for respective quality indicators. RESULTS Patients were mainly females (78%), aged 3811 years, with a baseline BMI 40.8  5.8 kg/m. Over 90 days, 7.2% of RYGB and 6.2% of SG patients presented at least 1 complication and no patients died (mortality in nonbenchmark cases: 0.06%).

The data was compared to evidence from the same referral period in 2019. RESULTS: 681 referrals were received during March-June 2020, compared to 1032 in 2019, indicating a 34% decrease. The majority of patients were reviewed in telephone clinic (76.2%) rather than physical appointments (15.4%). Although the commonest mode of investigation was endoscopy(46.2%), there was increased use of CT scan(35.8%). 114(17.1%) patients were not investigated, of which 40(35.1%) declined investigation, primarily due to COVID-19 apprehension. 6 patients were re-referred and 67(58.8%) were removed from the pathway for unknown reasons. 1 patient was subsequently admitted as an emergency.

METHODS Pre-and post-training Likert scales and a semi-structured survey were used to evaluate the effectiveness of an intellectual disabilities awareness programme delivered to LEOs. Quantitative differences in Likert scores and thematic analyses of practice-based responses were used in evaluation. RESULTS Twenty-two LEOs participated in the training and 11 completed the evaluation cycle. Statistically significant improvements were found in participants' self-rated knowledge of intellectual disability, their understanding of the challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities in law enforcement interactions, their communication skills and their knowledge of how to approach a person with a disability in crisis. Thematic analysis excavated potential practical application of learning around pre-arrest considerations, recognition of disability, communication skills and need for procedural safeguards. CONCLUSIONS An approach grounded in the views of people with intellectual disabilities and with emphasis on recognition of disability, communication, accessibility of information and providing appropriate support in custody, appears to promote improvement in self-reported knowledge and prospective application in LEOs.

Little work has been done to understand the potential mimicry of the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV spike proteins, particularly the receptor-binding motifs, which could be important in determining tropism and druggability of the virus. Peptide and epitope motifs have been detected on coronavirus spike proteins using sequence homology approaches; however, comparing the three-dimensional shape of the protein has been shown as more informative in predicting mimicry than sequence-based comparisons. Here, we use structural bioinformatics software to characterize potential mimicry of the three coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding motifs. We utilize sequence-independent alignment tools to compare structurally known protein models with the receptor-binding motifs and verify potential mimicked interactions with protein docking simulations. Both human and non-human proteins were returned for all three receptor-binding motifs. For example, all three were similar to several proteins containing EGF-like domains: some of which are endogenous to humans, such as thrombomodulin, and others exogenous, such as Plasmodium falciparum MSP-1. Similarity to human proteins may reveal which pathways the spike protein is co-opting, while analogous non-human proteins may indicate shared host interaction partners and overlapping antibody cross-reactivity.

In other words, even if the countries control the covid-19 locally, the negative global impact on the stock market will continue.","output":"Impacts of Global and Local Covid-19 Cases on Emerging Stock Markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cytokine storm has been widely known to contribute to the development of the critical condition in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and studies had been conducted to assess the potential aspect of cytokine storm elimination by performing therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE).

Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted by collecting data from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Data on the mortality rate of critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with TPE plus standard of care and that of patients treated with standard of care alone were analyzed using a Z test. Results: We included a total of four papers assessing the association between TPE and the risk of mortality among critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggested that critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with TPE had lower risk of mortality compared to those without TPE treatment.

In the current educational landscape, programs that meet these competencies are offered and attended in an ad hoc manner. During the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying switch to virtual learning, our team observed a surge in interest for our weekly nonsequential programs. In this study, we surveyed our learners to better understand motivators for attending these programs during the pandemic and to identify barriers for participating in such events before and during Work-from-Home. Our data indicate that conflict with research responsibilities, time spent to get to the event location, and planning time to attend are all significant barriers to engagement. Notably, feelings of being overwhelmed, which increased slightly during the pandemic, stood out as an identified barrier. Per our results, the virtual format was an attraction. While 58% of respondents would prefer to access professional development programs virtually in the future, almost 42% indicated a preference for in-person events when normalcy resumes, as the physical presence of an instructor and of peers result in a deeper engagement. Our collective analysis here suggests that learners will benefit from a hybrid or combination of synchronous and asynchronous career and professional development programming in the future, even postpandemic, to reduce identified barriers. Alongside hybrid learning engagements, we strongly recommend structured time for learners to enhance their professional competencies, enabled by a commitment from departments and faculty mentors to bring equity in professional skill building and foster a life-long growth mindset.","output":"Remote Learning Barriers and Opportunities for Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Learners in Career and Professional Skill Development: A Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we report the near-complete genome sequence of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain VFAR-047, isolated in Peru in 2014.

To address this evidence gap, we present data on a cohort of U.S. women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy to help inform clinical practice. Study Design PRIORITY is an ongoing nationwide prospective cohort study of COVID-19 during pregnancy in the U.S. Participants are  13 years, under investigation for or had confirmed COVID-19 defined as positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, enrolled from March-October 2020. For this analysis, we selected participants who enrolled at <14 weeks gestation and had SARS-CoV-2 testing; 7 were excluded that did not have longitudinal follow-up. The study was approved by the UCSF Institutional Review Board (IRB #20-30410). Participants completed questionnaires at enrollment, weekly for 4 weeks, and then multiple times throughout pregnancy. Medical record review was used to adjudicate adverse outcomes in a subsample of the population. We calculated the incidence and 95% confidence intervals for early pregnancy loss (EPL) defined as pregnancy loss <20 weeks gestation. Results Among the 1,338 PRIORITY participants, 109 comprise the analysis set who enrolled at <14 weeks gestation; 94 were COVID-19 positive, 15 were COVID-19 negative. All 109 were outpatients and all were symptomatic. Average age of the population was 31 years; 30% of participants were Latinx (Table). The mean gestational age at enrollment was approximately 9 weeks; 83% of participants had at least 1 month of longitudinal follow-up prior to ending pregnancy. In the COVID-19 positive group, 6/94 (6.4%, 95% CI 2.4%-13.4%) had EPL compared with 1/15 in the COVID-19 negative group (6.7%, 95% CI 0.1%-31.9%). In the COVID-19 positive group, 5 EPLs occurred at 7-12 weeks and one at 15 weeks. In a subgroup analysis of 34 COVID-19 positive participants enrolled at <8 weeks gestation, 2/34 had EPL (5.9%). In the COVID-19 positive group, 82/90 (91.1%, 95% CI 83.2%-96.1%) had live births; 84.4% (95% CI 75.3%-91.2%) at term and 15.6% (95% CI 8.8%-24.7%) at <37 weeks; 6/94 pregnancies are ongoing but all are >24 weeks. Conclusion In this nationwide study of pregnant people in the U.S., the risk of pregnancy loss at <20 weeks gestation was about 6%, both for participants with COVID-19 (N=94) and COVID-19 negative controls (N=15). This data compares favorably to the 10% rate of miscarriage among clinically recognized first trimester pregnancies prior to the pandemic.6 To our knowledge, this is the largest analyses of COVID-19 in the first trimester in a U.S. longitudinal cohort. With this sample size, the upper bound of the confidence interval for pregnancy loss of 13.4% is reassuring because it is not significantly higher than the expected miscarriage rate without viral infection. These results can guide counseling for people infected with SARS-CoV-2 early in pregnancy.","output":"Risk of Pregnancy Loss Prior to 20 weeks Gestation with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is important to understand the mode of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for disease control. We aimed to clarify how soon SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur after infection by asymptomatically infected individuals. METHODS: We analyzed the publicly available epidemiological information for a cluster of 108 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Osaka, Japan. RESULTS: Among cases, 51 cases attended a live music club only once and were considered to have a single visit. Ten remained asymptomatic at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, which was on average 20 days after exposure. Three routes of secondary transmission were identified, with 2-4 days from infection to transmission. All index cases for secondary transmission were asymptomatic at the time of contact with other people. Based on the date of symptom onset in the remaining 41 cases, the period from exposure to illness ranged from 2 to 17 days. CONCLUSIONS: Seemingly healthy people could spread SARS-CoV-2 during intense activities in enclosed environments without sufficient ventilation. Asymptomatically infected persons can transmit the virus as soon as 2 days after infection.

Therefore, this study used in silico screening to identify natural bioactive compounds from fruits, herbaceous plants, and marine invertebrates that are able to inhibit protease activity in SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6LU7). We have used extensive screening strategies such as drug likeliness, antiviral activity value prediction, molecular docking, ADME, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and MM/GBSA. A total of 17 compounds were shortlisted using Lipinskis rule in which 5 compounds showed significant predicted antiviral activity values. Among these 5, only 2 compounds, Macrolactin A and Stachyflin, showed good binding energy of ?9.22 and ?8.00 kcal/mol, respectively, within the binding pocket of the M(pro) catalytic residues (HIS 41 and CYS 145). These two compounds were further analyzed to determine their ADME properties. The ADME evaluation of these 2 compounds suggested that they could be effective in developing therapeutic drugs to be used in clinical trials. MD simulations showed that proteinCligand complexes of Macrolactin A and Stachyflin with the target receptor (6LU7) were stable for 100 nanoseconds. The MM/GBSA calculations of M(pro)CMacrolactin A complex indicated higher binding free energy (?42.58  6.35 kcal/mol). Dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) and principal component analysis (PCA) on the residual movement in the MD trajectories further confirmed the stability of Macrolactin A bound state with 6LU7. In conclusion, this study showed that marine natural compound Macrolactin A could be an effective therapeutic inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 protease (6LU7). Additional in vitro and in vivo validations are strongly needed to determine the efficacy and therapeutic dose of Macrolactin A in biological systems.

Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases, causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. A critical step in the life cycle of MERS-CoV is the fusion with the host cell with its spike (S) protein as main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by substituting E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP with neutrally charged alanines. Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (PPs) on host cells without and with Ca2+. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+ interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds two. Our data suggests that there are significant differences in FP-Ca2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of Ca2+ ions interacting with the FP has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus.","output":"Ca2+ ions promote fusion of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus with host cells and increase infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Data on the clinical outcome of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) affected by severe viral pneumonia are limited. We analysed morbidity and mortality of viral pneumonia and evaluated the association between medical conditions, medication, vaccination and outcome specifically in patients with CHD requiring hospitalisation for viral pneumonia. METHODS: Based on data from one of Germanys largest health insurers, all cases of viral pneumonia requiring hospital admission (2005C2018) were studied. Mortality, and composites of death, transplantation, mechanical circulatory support, ventilation or extracorporeal lung support served as endpoints. RESULTS: Overall, 26 262 viral pneumonia cases occurred in 24 980 patients. Of these, 1180 cases occurred in patients with CHD. Compared with patients without CHD, mortality rate was elevated in patients with CHD. As a group, patients with CHD aged 20C59 years even exceeded mortality rates in patients without CHD aged >60 years. No mortality was observed in patients with CHD with simple defects <60 years of age without associated cardiovascular risk factors. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, age, CHD complexity, chromosomal anomalies, cardiac medication, use of immunosuppressants and absence of vaccination for influenza emerged as risk factors of adverse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We present timely data on morbidity and mortality of severe viral pneumonia requiring hospital admission in patients with CHD. Need for mechanical ventilation and risk of death in CHD increase early in life, reaching a level equivalent to non-CHD individuals >60 years of age.

This research used spatial panel models and data from 30 provinces in China from 2004 to 2017 to empirically analyse the relationship between OFDI and air pollution. The results revealed that, first, China's air pollution showed two spatial clustering areas: the eastern coastal area (e.g. Zhejiang) and the north-western area (e.g. Xinjiang). Second, with the increase in OFDI, the direct effect on the concentration of respirable suspended particulate matter (PM10) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) was negative, and the direct effect on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was positive; however, the total effect was negative. An increase of 1% in OFDI would directly decrease the concentrations of PM10 and SO2 by 0.024% and 0.096%, respectively, while NO2 would directly increase by 0.061%, but the total effect of OFDI on the three air pollutants was negative. Third, the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis existed between economic growth and SO2 and NO2 but not between economic growth and PM10. The spatial panel model results revealed that the spatial spillover effects of air pollutants (i.e. PM10, SO2, and NO2) were 0.494, 0.447 and 0.314, respectively. Moreover, the impact of OFDI on air pollution had significant temporal heterogeneity. To make the results robust, this research conducted a robustness test by replacing the spatial weight matrix and dependent variables.

Since the pandemic entered our lives suddenly, the professors found themselves having to lecture using an e-learning platform that they had never used before, and for which they could not receive training due to the health emergency. In addition to the emotional aspects related to the particular situation of the pandemic, there are two aspects to consider when teaching mathematics at a distance. The first is related to the fact that at university level, lecturers generally teach mathematics in a formal way, using many symbols and formulas that they are used to writing. The second aspect is that the way mathematics is taught is also related to the students to whom the teaching is addressed. In fact, not only online, but also in face-to-face modality, the teaching of mathematics to students on the mathematics degree course involves a different approach to lessons (as well as to the choice of topics to explain) than teaching mathematics in another degree course. In order to investigate how the Sicilian State university mathematics professors taught mathematics at distance, a questionnaire was prepared and administered one month after the beginning of the lockdown in Italy. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were made, which allowed us to observe the way that university professors have adapted to the new teaching modality: they started to appropriate new artifacts (writing tablets, mathematical software, e-learning platform) to replicate their face-to-face teaching modality, mostly maintaining their blackboard teacher status.

However, despite growing evidence for their impact, chaplains are commonly undervalued and misunderstood by their organisations, and the global pandemic revealed the consequences of this confusion. Whilst some chaplains were applauded as heroes along with their fellow health colleagues, others were seen as little more than an infection risk. A survey was designed to capture and learn from the full range of chaplain experiences of the impact of the pandemic across the globe. In June 2020, 1657 chaplains responded from 36 countries. They all experienced considerable disruption to their usual practice, with enforced social distancing having the biggest impact. Out of necessity they embraced technology to maintain contact with patients and families, and shifted focus of their support to staff.

In this context, our study retrospectively analysed the management strategy for patients with acute cholecystitis. METHODS: We analysed all patients admitted to our Emergency Department for acute cholecystitis between February and April 2020 and we graded each case according to 2018 Tokyo Guidelines. All patients were tested for positivity to SARS-CoV-2 and received an initial conservative treatment. We focused on patients submitted to cholecystostomy during the acute phase of pandemic and their subsequent disease evolution. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were admitted for acute cholecystitis (13 grade I, 16 grade II, 8 grade III). According to Tokyo Guidelines (2018), patients were successfully treated with antibiotic only, bedside percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PC) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in 29.7%, 21.6% and 48.7% of cases respectively. Therapeutic strategy of three out of 8 cases, otherwise fit for surgery, submitted to bedside percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (37.5%), were directly modified by COVID-19 pandemic: one due to the SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while two others due to unavailability of operating room and intensive care unit for post-operative monitoring respectively. Overall success rate of percutaneous cholecystostomy was of 87.5%. The mean post-procedural hospitalization length was 9 days, and no related adverse events were observed apart from transient parietal bleeding, conservatively treated. Once discharged, two patients required readmission because of acute biliary symptoms. Median time of drainage removal was 43 days and only 50% patients thereafter underwent cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous cholecystostomy has shown to be an effective and safe treatment thus acquiring an increased relevance in the first phase of the pandemic. Nowadays, considering we are forced to live with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, PC should be considered as a virtuous, alternative tool for potentially all COVID-19 positive patients and selectively for negative cases unresponsive to conservative therapy and unfit for surgery.","output":"COVID-19 outbreak and acute cholecystitis in a Hub Hospital in Milan: wider indications for percutaneous cholecystostomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children born preterm often exhibit reduced lung function and increased severity of response to respiratory viruses, suggesting that premature birth has compromised proper development of the respiratory epithelium and innate immune defenses.

The percentage of the (99m)Tc-surfactant mixture deposited in the lungs was estimated by scintigraphy. RESULTS: Median (range) deposition in the lungs was 40% (24C68%) after atomization and 87% (55C95%) after instillation (p < 0.001). Overall, almost 80% of the deposited surfactant was in the dependent lung. Effective atomization time (atomizer on) was 28 (17C52) min, yielding an output rate of 0.1C0.2 mL min(?1). CONCLUSIONS: Without endotracheal intubation, in spontaneously breathing newborn piglets, this new supraglottic atomizer delivery system attained a median lung deposition of 40% of the nominal dose of surfactant.","output":"A novel delivery system for supraglottic atomization allows increased lung deposition rates of pulmonary surfactant in newborn piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review tries to make the case that physicians should be adequately rewarded financially so that they can have a clear fiduciary responsibility to do only what is best for their patients without unseemly personal financial gain.

Rectal thermometry, the most commonly used method, is stressful, invasive and time consuming. Non-contact infrared thermometry (NIRT) has been used with mixed success to measure temperature in humans and other species. The purpose of this study was to determine if NIRT measurements were comparable to rectal temperature measurements or, if not highly correlated, could at least identify cats in the hypothermic or hyperthermic range in need of further evaluation. METHODS From a total of six NIRT devices and 15 anatomic sites, three devices and three sites (pinna, gingiva and perineum) with the highest correlation to rectal temperature were selected for further study. Measurements were made in 188 adult cats housed indoors at animal shelters, veterinary clinics and private homes across a wide range of body temperatures and compared with rectal temperatures. RESULTS Bland-Altman analysis revealed poor agreement between NIRT and rectal thermometry. The mean NIRT measurements ranged from 0.7-1.3C below the mean rectal measurements, but the effect was not consistent; NIRT measurements tended to exceed rectal measurements in hypothermic cats and fall below rectal measurements in normothermic and hyperthermic cats.

It is similar in design to a previous scheme by Couveignes, Rostovtsev and Stolbunov, but aims at an improved balance between efficiency and security. In the proposal, the authors suggest concrete parameters in order to meet some desired levels of quantum security. These parameters are based on the hardness of recovering a hidden isogeny between two elliptic curves, using a quantum subexponential algorithm of Childs, Jao and Soukharev. This algorithm combines two building blocks: first, a quantum algorithm for recovering a hidden shift in a commutative group. Second, a computation in superposition of all isogenies originating from a given curve, which the algorithm calls as a black box. In this paper, we give a comprehensive security analysis of CSIDH. Our first step is to revisit three quantum algorithms for the abelian hidden shift problem from the perspective of non-asymptotic cost, with trade-offs between their quantum and classical complexities. Second, we complete the non-asymptotic study of the black box in the hidden shift algorithm. We give a quantum procedure that evaluates CSIDH-512 using less than 40 000 logical qubits.

High-intensity exercise training modalities still controversial in this population. The study aims to preliminary assess the consequences of high-intensity exercise training modalities, aerobic interval training (HIIT) and progressive high circuit-resistance training (CRT), on primarily endothelial function and cardiorespiratory fitness, and secondly on muscle strength and physical performance in heart failure patients. METHODS: This preliminary multicentric randomized controlled trial comprised 23 heart failure patients, aged 56  10 years old, mainly New York Heart Association classification I and II (%), hemodynamically stable, who compromise at least 36 exercise sessions of a randomly assigned intervention (HIIT, CRT or control group). Endothelial function, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, muscle strength and physical performance were completed at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Although no effects on endothelial function; both HIIT and CRT modalities were able to produce a positive effect on [Image: see text] peak (HIIT = +2.16.5, CRT = +3.04.2 and control group = -0.1 5.3 mL/kg/min, time*group p-value<0,05) and METs (HIIT = +0.61.8, CRT = +0.91.2 and control group = 01.6, time*group p-value<0,05). Only HIIT increased isokinetic torque peak (HIIT = +8.855.8, CRT = 0.060.7 and control group = 1.657.6 Nm) matched p-value<0,05. Regarding the physical performance, the CRT modality reduced chair stand test completion time (HIIT = -0.73.1, CRT = -3.33.2 and control group = -0.32.5 s, matched p-value<0,05 and HIIT improved global physical performance(time*group p<0,05). CONCLUSION: This preliminary study trends to indicate for the first time that high-intensity interval training promotes a jointly superior effect compared to progressive high intensity circuit-resistance training by improving cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, and physical performance.

The endothelial inflammation and hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2) poses a risk of arterial and venous thromboembolism. Herein, we present a series of stroke patients with ILT in the setting of a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods and Results: From July 9 , 2020 to August 17 , 2020, four patients were identified with acute ischemic stroke with varying thrombus burden but similar morphological patterns of ILT. All patients had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection as confirmed by PCR (n=3) or IgG antibody (n=1) in addition to clinical and radiological manifestations consistent with COVID-19. General characteristics and imaging of the patients are shown in table 1. Mean age was 55.3 7.7 years. Most patients (3) had at least two vascular risk factors and none had a central embolic source other than ILT. D-Dimer was profoundly elevated in 3 patients. ILT involved the cervical (3) and intracranial (1) internal carotid artery. COVID-19 symptoms ranged from mild transient respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia requiring critical care support. None of the patients received acute reperfusion therapy either due to presentation beyond the therapeutic window or due to the absence of large vessel occlusion and/or unfavorable imaging profile. Conclusion: In this small case series of relatively young patients with acute ischemic stroke we found an association between COVID-19 infection and ILT. This suggests a distinctive pathophysiological pattern of stroke in COVID-19 patients. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and target specific treatment modalities.

Their excellent antigen presentation potential can contribute to the activation of other cells of the immune system, and evidence is emerging that specialized subsets of these cells, that may be increased with age, can influence the cell-mediated immune system in antitumor responses. They can also regulate immune responses, to avoid autoreactivity and excessive inflammation. Deficiencies in regulatory B cells may be beneficial in cancer but will only exacerbate the inflammatory environment that is a hallmark of aging. The B cell role as antibody producers is particularly important, since antibodies perform numerous different functions in different environments. Although studying tissue responses in humans is not as easy as in mice, we do know that certain classes of antibodies are more suited to protecting the mucosal tissues (IgA) or responding to T-independent bacterial polysaccharide antigens (IgG(2)) so we can make some inference with respect to tissue-specific immunity from a study of peripheral blood.

In this context, the so-called hyperinflammation syndrome characterized by a cytokine storm accompanied by a massive increase in inflammatory markers such as interleukin(IL)-6, represents such a situation. This case report describes the therapeutic approach of using the IL-6-specific antibody tocilizumab in combination with hemoadsorption therapy (CytoSorb) in a 58-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient suffered a massive clinical deterioration with concomitant Horovitz index of 127 mmHg that occurred on the 6th day of ventilation. After combined application of the above-mentioned therapeutic approaches, the patient stabilized rapidly paralleled by a significant increase in the Horovitz index, and the possibility of de-escalating the ventilation regimen, which ultimately enabled successful extubation after only 13 days of ventilation. Moreover, the combined treatment was associated with significant hemodynamic stabilization and a consecutive reduction in vasopressor doses, while hyperinflammation could be kept well under control. The incorporation of the hemoadsorber into the therapeutic regimen proved to be safe and straightforward. In conclusion, the combination of CytoSorb therapy and IL-6 blockade by tocilizumab appeared, at least in this case, to be an effective measure to modulate an overshooting immune response in COVID-19 pneumonia with a concomitant clinical improvement in both respiratory and hemodynamic function, and thus could be used as a potential therapeutic option in this clinical picture.","output":"[Treatment of a Patient with a Pronounced Cytokine Storm in Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia using a Hemoadsorption in Combination with the Administration of tocilizumab]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed older adults to increased health risks, yet social distancing precautions also heightened risks to their social well-being.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Midwestern sample of 76 older adults aged 70-97 completed a series of four interviews from March 2020 through April 2021 about their experiences with COVID-19 social distancing precautions. Participants reported social engagement satisfaction and frequency of contact with family and friends. Additionally, they responded to open-ended questions about social connection experiences. RESULTS: Satisfaction with social engagement rebounded with significant increases across the year of the pandemic, whereas frequency of contact shifted from high remote contact early in the pandemic to greater in-person contact over time, with nuanced distinctions between family and friends. Qualitative thematic analysis identified themes including: 1) shifts in family support, 2) adaptable and flexible friendships, 3) social isolation fatigue, and 4) communication through technology. Within each theme, perceptions of interpersonal connections shifted over time.

The association between Usher syndrome-causative genes and resultant Usher syndrome phenotypes in patients are highly variable. In the present study, a Chinese family with Usher syndrome was recruited, and targeted next-generation sequencing, Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis were performed. The expression profiles and functional effects of the pathogenic variants of USH2A identified were analyzed. Novel nonsense compound heterozygous variants, c.T449G (p.L150*) and c.T10695A (p.Y3565*), were identified in the USH2A gene, which showed co-segregation with the disease phenotype causing Usher syndrome type IIA in the recruited Chinese pedigree. The p.L150* variant was predicted to produce a truncated protein which lacked almost all the functional domains of USH2A, whereas the p.Y3565* variant is located in one of the fibronectin type 3 domains, resulting in the loss of several fibronectin type 3 domains at the C-terminus of USH2A by producing the truncated protein. It was shown that Ush2a mRNA expression levels were higher in the retina compared with those in the eye tissues (lens, sclera and cornea), uterus, ovary, breast, testis, spleen, kidney, liver, intestine, brain, skeletal muscle and blood. Additionally, the protein structure was shown to be highly conserved by comparing Homo sapiens USH2A to eight other species.

Thus, we explore the COVID-19 pandemic and concurrent economic situation as functions of historical pandemic data and mobility control. This approach allows us to formulate an efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic feedback control problem that minimizes the aggregated risks of disease transmission and economic volatility. We further demonstrate the use of a deep learning algorithm to solve this control problem.

Although the majority of patients are asymptomatic, some patients may experience bone pain due to local periosteal involvement or osteoarthritic lesions in the spine; in addition, limb deformities may lead to secondary gait problems or degenerative joint changes. Anemia has an overall prevalence of 12-17% in elderly adults (>65 years old), with macrocytic anemia being the less common type. Megaloblastic anemia is a macrocytic anemia characterized by the presence of large, immature, nucleated cells (megaloblasts) in the blood, with the most common cause being a deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12. We herein report the rare case of a 72-year-old male patient exhibiting both these conditions, with the aim of discussing the possible association between the two and, most importantly, the clinical management of the patient in a real-life setting over a period of 10 years. The patient was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms (bone pain), radiological imaging and specific laboratory tests, and received discontinuous courses of bisphosphonates and cyanocobalamin supplementation therapy, based mainly on aggravated symptomatology. A systematic literature review was also performed and revealed not only the scarcity of reports on similar cases, but also the mechanisms that may underlie the possible association of PDB with macrocytic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency in elderly patients.","output":"Paget's disease of bone and megaloblastic anemia in a 72-year-old patient: A case report and systematic literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To alleviate the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the economy, Taiwan introduced a stimulus package in the form of triple stimulus vouchers. Despite intense promotion to opt for the vouchers in digital form, Taiwanese public overwhelmingly chose the paper form. This study considers the reasons that influenced their decision comfort in choosing paper rather than digital vouchers based on two categories: rational (promotion depth and ease of use) and behavioral economics factors (analysis paralysis, mental accounting related to ease of tracking expenses, social influence and payment habits). Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares (PLS) method was utilized to analyze survey information obtained from 183 individuals who chose paper vouchers. Findings: Individuals consider rational and behavioral economic factors in their perception of decision comfort while choosing paper over digital vouchers. Decision comfort is driven more by behavioral economics than rational factors such as ease of use. Interestingly, analysis paralysis related to paper vouchers has the greatest impact, but it positively influences decision comfort, indicating that Taiwanese people view paper vouchers as a safe haven in the midst of uncertainties and information overload. Therefore, when designing public policies or promotional campaigns, possible behavior outcomes should be considered from both rational and behavioral economic perspectives. Originality/value: This study provides insights into the dynamics of how individuals arrive at their decision of opting paper vouchers over digital ones and offers theoretical contributions related to system adoption and behavioral economics. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Homo economicus?

However, m336 was found to have reduced efficacy against MERS-CoV strains with mutations in RBD, and HR2P-M2 showed low potency, thus limiting the clinical application of each when administered separately. However, we herein report that the combination of m336 and HR2P-M2 exhibited potent synergism in inhibiting MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cellCcell fusion and infection by MERS-CoV pseudoviruses with or without mutations in the RBD, resulting in the enhancement of antiviral activity in contrast to either one administered alone.

Similar alterations have been described in bacterial sepsis and therapeutic strategies targeting T cell function such as recombinant human interleukin 7 (rhIL-7) have been proposed in this clinical context. As COVID-19 is a viral sepsis, the objectives of this study were to characterize T lymphocyte response over time in severe COVID-19 patients and to assess the effect of ex vivo administration of rhIL-7. RESULTS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU) were collected at admission and after 20 days. Transcriptomic profile was evaluated through NanoString technology. Inhibitory immune checkpoints expressions were determined by flow cytometry. T lymphocyte proliferation and IFN- production were evaluated after ex vivo stimulation in the presence or not of rhIL-7. COVID-19 ICU patients were markedly lymphopenic at admission. Mononuclear cells presented with inhibited transcriptomic profile prevalently with impaired T cell activation pathways. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells presented with over-expression of co-inhibitory molecules PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and TIM-3. CD4 + and CD8 + T cell proliferation and IFN- production were markedly altered in samples collected at ICU admission. These alterations, characteristic of a T cell exhaustion state, were more pronounced at ICU admission and alleviated over time. Treatment with rhIL-7 ex vivo significantly improved both T cell proliferation and IFN- production in cells from COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 patients present with features of profound T cell exhaustion upon ICU admission which can be reversed ex vivo by rhIL-7. These results reinforce our understanding of severe COVID-19 pathophysiology and opens novel therapeutic avenues to treat such critically ill patients based of immunomodulation approaches. Defining the appropriate timing for initiating such immune-adjuvant therapy in clinical setting and the pertinent markers for a careful selection of patients are now warranted to confirm the ex vivo results described so far.

While new line of drug/vaccine development has been initiated world-wide, in the current scenario of high infected numbers, severity of the disease and high morbidity, repurposing of the existing drugs is heavily explored. Here, we used a homology-based structural model of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a cell surface receptor, required for entry of virus to the target host cell. Using the strengths of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we examined the binding potential of Withaferin-A (Wi-A), Withanone (Wi-N) and caffeic acid phenethyl ester to TPMRSS2 in comparison to its known inhibitor, Camostat mesylate. We found that both Wi-A and Wi-N could bind and stably interact at the catalytic site of TMPRSS2. Wi-N showed stronger interactions with TMPRSS2 catalytic residues than Wi-A and was also able to induce changes in its allosteric site. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Wi-N on TMPRSS2 expression in MCF7 cells and found remarkable downregulation of TMPRSS2 mRNA in treated cells predicting dual action of Wi-N to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. Since the natural compounds are easily available/affordable, they may even offer a timely therapeutic/preventive value for the management of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Understanding the contributing factors that encourage junior doctors and medical students to consider an IR career will help the IR community to better focus the efforts on recruiting and nurturing the next generation. METHODS: Anonymised questionnaires on undergraduate and postgraduate IR exposure were distributed to attendees of five UK IR symposia between 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: 220 responses were received from 103 (47%) junior doctors and 117 (53%) medical students. Prior IR exposure strongly correlates with individuals positive views towards an IR career (Pearsons R = 0.40, p < 0.001), with involvement in clinical activities as the most important independent contributor (OR 3.6, 95%CI 1.21C10.50, p = 0.021). Longer time spent in IR (especially as elective modules) and IR-related portfolio-building experiences (such as participating in research, attending conferences and obtaining career guidance) demonstrate strong association with willingness to pursue an IR career for the more motivated (p values < 0.05). The symposia had overall positive effects on subjective likelihood to pursue an IR career, particularly among junior doctors who face near-term career choices (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study, focusing on a self-selected cohort, identified contributing factors to individuals willingness to pursue an IR career. Symposia have additional recruitment effects in extra-curricular settings. Active engagement with junior doctors and medical students through clinical activities and non-clinical portfolio-related experiences are key to generate informed and motivated candidates for the future of IR.

METHODS: Data were taken from the Hamburg survey of homeless individuals (n = 100 individuals in the here used model, mean age 44.8 years, SD 12.5) focusing on homeless individuals in Hamburg, Germany. The number of physician visits in the past 3 months and hospitalization in the preceding 12 months were used as outcome measures. Drawing on the Andersen model of health care use as a conceptual framework, predisposing characteristics, enabling resources and need factors as well as psychosocial variables were included as correlates. RESULTS: Negative binomial regressions showed that increased physician visits were associated with being female (IRR: 4.02 [95% CI: 1.60C10.11]), absence of chronic alcohol consume (IRR: 0.26 [95% CI: 0.12C0.57]) and lower health-related quality of life (IRR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.96C0.98]).

However, effects of exposure to PM(2.5) on the finite ovarian follicle pool have hardly been investigated, nor have interactions between ovarian and cardiovascular effects. We hypothesized that subchronic inhalation exposure to human-relevant concentrations of PM(2.5) results in destruction of ovarian follicles via apoptosis induction, as well as accelerated recruitment of primordial follicles into the growing pool. Further, we hypothesized that destruction of ovarian follicles enhances the adverse cardiovascular effects of PM(2.5) in females. RESULTS: Hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E (Apoe) null ovary-intact or ovariectomized female mice and testis-intact male mice were exposed to concentrated ambient PM(2.5) or filtered air for 12 weeks, 5 days/week for 4 h/day using a versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system. Primordial, primary, and secondary ovarian follicle numbers were decreased by 45%, 40%, and 17%, respectively, in PM(2.5)-exposed ovary-intact mice compared to controls (P < 0.05). The percentage of primary follicles with granulosa cells positive for the mitosis marker Ki67 was increased in the ovaries from PM(2.5)-exposed females versus controls (P < 0.05), consistent with increased recruitment of primordial follicles into the growing pool. Exposure to PM(2.5) increased the percentages of primary and secondary follicles with DNA damage, assessed by H2AX immunostaining (P < 0.05). Exposure to PM(2.5) increased the percentages of apoptotic antral follicles, determined by TUNEL and activated caspase 3 immunostaining (P < 0.05). Removal of the ovaries and PM(2.5)-exposure exacerbated the atherosclerotic effects of hyperlipidemia in females (P < 0.05). While there were statistically significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate variability in PM(2.5)-compared to Air-exposed gonad-intact males and females and ovariectomized females, the changes were not consistent between exposure years and assessment methods. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that subchronic PM(2.5) exposure depletes the ovarian reserve by increasing recruitment of primordial follicles into the growing pool and increasing apoptosis of growing follicles. Further, PM(2.5) exposure and removal of the ovaries each increase atherosclerosis progression in Apoe-/- females. Premature loss of ovarian function is associated with increased risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimers disease in women. Our results thus support possible links between PM(2.5) exposure and other adverse health outcomes in women.

Therefore, drawing upon resource orchestration theory, this article investigates how hospitals orchestrate data-driven culture (DDC) and digital technology orientation (DTO) to develop big data analytics capability (BDAC) for operational performance improvement. Survey data were collected from 105 hospitals in China and analyzed using structural equation modeling and ordinary least square regression. The results show that DDC has a significant positive impact on DTO. More interestingly, there is no significant interaction effect between DDC and DTO, indicating that DDC and DTO affect BDAC independently, and not synergistically. The results further reveal that BDAC fully mediates the DTO-operational performance relationship. The findings offer useful and timely guidance on how healthcare executives can manage data-driven hospital operations to improve operational performance during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Exploring the Effects of Data-Driven Hospital Operations on Operational Performance From the Resource Orchestration Theory Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2010, new Chinese strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), clinically more severe than the classical strains, emerged.

In the present study, an analysis of PEDV field sequences from Ecuador was conducted by comparing all the PEDV S gene sequences available in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic comparisons and Bayesian phylogeographic inference based on complete S gene sequences were also conducted to track the origin and putative route of PEDV. The sequence from the PED-outbreak in Ecuador was grouped into the clade II of PEDV genogroup 2a together with other sequences of isolates from Mexico, Canada, and United States. The phylogeographic study revealed the emergence of the Chinese PEDV strains, followed by spreading to US in 2013, from US to Korea, and later the introduction of PEDV to Canada, Mexico, and Ecuador directly from the US. The sources of imports of live swine in Ecuador in 2014 were mainly from Chile and US.

The continuous professional development (CPD) therefore would therefore benefit ELT teachers in such abrupt transitions of the teaching mode. CPD courses would also open new horizons for the ELT teachers and take them a step ahead of merely learning about teaching methodology. (C) 2021 Ani Publishing Ltd.

In this study we screened A. fumigatus isolates for intrinsic olorofim-resistant A. fumigatus and evaluated the ability of A. fumigatus to acquire an olorofim-resistant phenotype. No intrinsic resistance was found in 975 clinical A. fumigatus isolates. However, we found that isolates with increased olorofim MICs (> 8 mg/L) could be selected using a high number of conidia and olorofim exposure under laboratory conditions. Assessment of the frequency of acquired olorofim resistance development of A. fumigatus was shown to be higher than for voriconazole but lower than for itraconazole. Sequencing the PyrE gene of isogenic isolates with olorofim MICs of >8 mg/L identified various amino acid substitutions with a hotspot at locus G119. Olorofim was shown to have reduced affinity to mutated target protein dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) and the effect of these mutations were proven by introducing the mutations directly in A. fumigatus. We then investigated whether G119 mutations were associated with a fitness cost in A. fumigatus. These experiments showed a small but significant reduction in growth rate for strains with a G119V substitution, while strains with a G119C substitution did not exhibit a reduction in growth rate. These in vitro findings were confirmed in an in vivo pathogenicity model. Importance Olorofim represents an important new treatment option for patients with difficult to treat invasive fungal infections, including triazole-resistant A. fumigatus infection. Our study provides insights into one resistance mechanism and the potential dynamics of olorofim resistance, which will help to prevent and manage resistance selection. Such insights are critical to antifungal stewardship and to safeguard its prolonged use in clinical practice.","output":"Resistance profiling of Aspergillus fumigatus to olorofim indicates absence of intrinsic resistance and unveils the molecular mechanisms of acquired olorofim resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently published observational data suggests an increased risk of herpes zoster infection post-vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

This study aimed to characterize differences in gastrointestinal endoscopies in the New York metropolitan region before, during, and after the first wave of the pandemic. Methods Across three hospitals, we compared demographics, indications, and yield of endoscopies before and after March 16, 2020, the date on which elective procedures were cancelled, as well as a recovery period for five months after they were resumed. Results A total of 9,401 procedures before and 332 procedures were performed during the first wave. Females comprised 57% and 44% of patients (p <0.01), respectively. There was a decline in the proportion of Black (15% vs. 7%, p <0.02) and Hispanic patients (29% vs. 16%, p <0.02) undergoing outpatient procedures. There was a significant rise in urgent indications such as bleeding and jaundice. There was an increase in the diagnostic yield of all esophagogastroduodenoscopies for bleeding (p <0.01) and in outpatient endoscopic ultrasounds for malignancy (p = 0.01), but no increase in yield of inpatient colonoscopy for bleeding. Review of 7,475 procedures during the recovery period showed a return to many non-urgent indications, but still showed decreased proportions of Hispanic and male patients compared to the pre-pandemic period. Discussion / Conclusion Lower proportions of Black and Hispanic patients underwent outpatient endoscopies during and after the first wave. The proportion of procedures done for emergent indications, and their diagnostic yield, increased during the pandemic, suggesting a higher threshold to perform endoscopy. In resource-sparing conditions, clinicians should pay attention to thresholds to perform colonoscopy for bleeding, and to racial disparities in outpatient healthcare access.","output":"Characteristics and Outcomes of Endoscopies Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severity of symptoms represents an important source of distress in patients with a psychiatric disease. However, the extent to which this endogenous stress factor interacts with genetic vulnerability factors for predicting suicide risks remains unclear. METHODS: We evaluated whether the severity of symptoms interacts with a genetic vulnerability factor (the serotonin transporter gene-linked promoter region variation) in predicting the frequency of lifetime suicide attempts in patients with a psychiatric disease. Symptom severity and 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were collected from a sample of 95 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Lifetime suicide attempt was the primary outcome, and antecedent of multiple suicide attempts was the secondary outcome. RESULTS: The gene-by-symptoms interaction was associated with an excess risk of suicide attempts (OR = 4.39, 95CI[1.44, 13.38], p < 0.009) and of multiple suicide attempts (OR = 4.18, 95CI[1.04, 16.77], p = 0.043). Symptom severity (moderate, severe, or extreme) was associated with an approximately five-fold increase in the odds of a lifetime suicide attempt in patients carrying one or two copies of the short allele of 5-HTTLPR. No such relationship was found for patients carrying the long allele. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence for the gene-by-stress interaction on suicide attempt when stress is operationalized as symptom severity. Progress in suicide research may come from efforts to investigate the gene-by-symptoms interaction hypothesis in a variety of diseases.","output":"Preliminary Evidence That the Short Allele of 5-HTTLPR Moderates the Association of Psychiatric Symptom Severity on Suicide Attempt: The Example in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing more than two million deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins mediate viral entry and represent the main target for antibody responses. Humoral responses were shown to be important for preventing and controlling infection by coronaviruses. A promising approach to reduce the severity of COVID-19 is the transfusion of convalescent plasma. However, longitudinal studies revealed that the level of antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines rapidly after the resolution of the infection. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To extend this observation beyond the RBD domain, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the plasma from 15 convalescent donors. We generated a 293T cell line constitutively expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and used it to develop a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies in the plasma of convalescent donors. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that the level of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines gradually after the resolution of the infection. This decline was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the decline of RBD-specific antibodies and the number of days post-symptom onset. These findings help to better understand the decline of humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provide important information on when to collect plasma after recovery from active infection for convalescent plasma transfusion.","output":"High-throughput detection of antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in longitudinal convalescent plasma samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: COVID-19 pandemic has been the major threat to the global public health for a year (last of 2019Ctill date); and unfortunately, there is still as no specific antiviral agent which can be effectively used against this disease curation. Present review focused on the application of the convalescent plasma (CP) therapy as a quick remediation of the disease severity. RECENT FINDINGS: While several drugs have been repurposed based on a number of completed clinical trials together with a huge ongoing effort to develop appropriate vaccine against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the therapeutic approach of the CP therapy appears to be one of the effective methods to rescue the severely affected COVID-19 patients. Such a therapy based on passive immunity evolved from the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19; and hence these individuals are quite likely to possess high titers of the SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing immunoglobulins (antibodies). However, there are some risks such therapy, and its effectivity also appeared doubtful in some cases. Thus, the current review discussed the issues raised by the administration of such plasma into the SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. SUMMARY: Application of CP therapy has been conducted since long time; and for the mitigation of COVID-19 severity, such pharmaceutical strategy is also being employed in spite of several risks which actually can be monitored as well as optimized in order to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic and the Convalescent Plasma Therapy: Possible Benefits and Risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Parents well-being during pregnancy and early parenthood is critical for childrens development. Environmental stressors can significantly challenge parents well-being. Aims: To investigate how COVID-19 and associated restrictions influence mood and parenting confidence of expectant parents and those in early parenthood, identifying barriers and facilitators. Methods: We used a cross-sectional online survey to collect data from 590 expectant parents and parents of infants (564 females) during the most restrictive phase of the lockdown in the UK. Survey included a mixture of forced-choice and open-ended questions pertaining to mood, perceived social support, media use, online interactions, and parenting expectations. Quantitative data were analysed using multiple linear regression and proportional odds models, while an inductive thematic analysis was employed for qualitative data. Quantitative and qualitative data were qualitatively synthesised. Results: A decrease in mood and parenting confidence were found. Barriers included practical difficulties (finding essentials, reliable health information), social difficulties (loss of physical contact, decreased support), and uncertainty during pregnancy. Facilitators included support from others and for first-time parents, loss of childcare resulting in greater parenting confidence. While online resources and communication were not preferable to face-to-face interactions, technology was a helpful tool for communicating, getting support, and finding essentials and information during lockdown.

The purpose of facemasks is to prevent the transmission of viruses through the respiratory system from one person to another. Besides their advantages, they have disadvantages too. They may cause facial complications and negatively affect communication. Wearing a facemask is considered a new experience around the world. Therefore, it is useful to know the experience of people who wear it, especially for long periods. This research aims to study the experience of nurses who wore facemasks for extended hours. Researchers used the phenomenological method that explores the meaning that individuals give to the experiences they have had towards a particular phenomenon. The sample consisted of fifteen (15) adult nurses who were intentionally chosen from one hospital in the city of Oran (Algeria). Researchers used face-to-face semi-structured interviews with nurses. The following question: What was your experience as a nurse wearing a facemask while working for more than eight hours a day? was asked to each of them. Nurses were encouraged to speak freely while expressing their experience. The analysis of the nurses experience while wearing the facemask showed they were embodied in four major themes which are: 1- Health and safety concerns (headache and face wounds), 2- Physical ergonomic concerns (facemask design and anthropometric data), 3- Communication ergonomics concerns (communication disturbances) and 4- Aesthetic ergonomics (Appearance and Color).

Case description: A 56-year-old female attended her GDP with a small intraoral swelling buccal and lingual to the lower left incisors, canine and first premolar. Radiographic examination revealed gross caries in the lower left anterior dentition and periapical bone loss in the region. A week's course of antibiotics had no effect. The swelling increased rapidly and the involved teeth were extracted by the GDP before referral to Oral Surgery. The patient offered no history of weight loss, febrility or breathlessness. Her medical history was unremarkable. She smoked and did not consume alcohol. Histological examination revealed a poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma. A computerized tomography scan of the neck showed a 4 cm mass in the left anterior mandible with adjacent bony destruction. There was bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and a large right-sided upper lobe lung mass with metastasis to the contralateral upper lobe of the lung, the right adrenal gland and brain. A diagnosis of poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma of the lung was made, staged T4 N3 M1c.

Randomized controlled trials have shown that recurrences may be reduced, but there is also the fear of mesh-related complications. Experimental studies on the characteristics of specific mesh types with regard to the risk of such complications are rare. The current study aimed to investigate the properties of a circular heavy-weight polypropylene mesh in terms of stenosis, migration, erosions, and adhesions in a porcine model. METHODS A 55 x 55-mm heavy-weight polypropylene mesh with a 16.5-mm eccentric hole for the esophagus corresponding to a calculated mesh area of 2811 mm(2) and a hole area of 214 mm(2) were implanted in nine German Landrace pigs. Six weeks later, the meshes were explanted and investigated for size, shrinkage, migration and adhesions. RESULTS The total mesh area shrank to a mean of 2,040 +/- 178 mm(2) (p < 0.001), and the hole for the esophagus showed a trend toward an increase to 239 +/- 38 mm(2) (p = 0.108). In not a single location did the mesh overhang the hiatal margin. The mean distance of retraction from the hiatal margin was 4.3 +/- 2.8 mm. Therefore, no stenoses, migrations, or erosions occurred. CONCLUSIONS A circular heavy-weight polypropylene mesh seems to be appropriate for the application at the esophageal hiatus in terms of safety and stability. This means that it is characterized by a position-stable centered fixation around the esophagus without a tendency toward stenosis, migration, or erosion.","output":"Is a circular polypropylene mesh appropriate for application at the esophageal hiatus?

However, there is still a lack of proved protective vaccines or effective drugs against ZIKV. The peptide brevinin-2GHk (BR2GK), pertaining to the brevinin-2 family of antimicrobial peptides, has been reported to exhibit only weak antibacterial activity, and its antiviral effects have not been investigated. Thus, we analyzed the effect of BR2GK on ZIKV infection. BR2GK showed significant inhibitory activity in the early and middle stages of ZIKV infection, with negligible cytotoxicity. Furthermore, BR2GK was suggested to bind with ZIKV E protein and disrupt the integrity of the envelope, thus directly inactivating ZIKV. In addition, BR2GK can also penetrate the cell membrane, which may contribute to inhibition of the middle stage of ZIKV infection. BR2GK blocked ZIKV E protein expression with an IC(50) of 3.408  0.738 ̦. In summary, BR2GK was found to be a multi-functional candidate and a potential lead compound for further development of anti-ZIKV drugs.","output":"Brevinin-2GHk, a Peptide Derived from the Skin of Fejervarya limnocharis, Inhibits Zika Virus Infection by Disrupting Viral Integrity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an attempt to maintain elimination of COVID-19, the New Zealand government has closed the border to everyone except citizens and residents. All arrivals are required to spend 14 days in government-managed isolation/quarantine and to be tested for COVID-19 on day 3 and on day 12 of their stay. We model the testing, isolation and potential transmission of COVID-19 within managed isolation facilities to estimate the risk of undetected cases and the risk of infectious cases being released into the community. We use a stochastic individual-based that includes a time-dependent probability of a false negative test result, complete isolation of confirmed and probable cases, and secondary transmission of COVID-19 between close contacts. We show that the combination of 14-day quarantine with day 3 and day 12 testing reduces risk of releasing an infectious case to around 0.1% per infected arrival. Shorter quarantine periods, or reliance on testing only with no quarantine, substantially increase this risk. It is important to avoid contacts between individuals staying in quarantine to minimise the risk of secondary transmission. We calculate the ratio of cases detected on day 3 to cases detected on day 12 in the model and show that this may be a useful indicator of the likelihood of secondary transmission occurring within quarantine. We do not explicitly model transmission of COVID-19 from individuals in quarantine to staff, but this is likely to present a significant risk.

Recently, a new coronavirus disease COVID-19 has emerged as a respiratory infection with significant concern for global public health hazards. However, with each passing day, more and more confirmed cases are being reported worldwide which has alarmed the global authorities including the World Health Organization (WHO). In this study, the researcher uses the term neologism which means the coinage of new words. Neologism played a significant role throughout the history of epidemic and pandemic. The focus of this study is on the phenomenon of neologism to explore the creation of new words during the outbreak of COVID-19. The theoretical framework of this study is based on three components of neologism, i.e. word formation, borrowing, and lexical deviation. The researcher used the model of neologism as a research tool which is presented by Krishnamurthy in 2010. The study is also compared with the theory of onomasiology by Pavol Stekauer (1998). The secondary data have been used in this study. The data were collected from articles, books, Oxford Corpus, social media, and five different websites and retrieved from January 2020 to April 2020. The findings of this study revealed that with the outbreak of COVID-19, the majority of the people on social media and state briefings, the word-formation is utilized in the form of nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

While the emphasis has previously been primarily focused on the content of project-based learning programs, another factor that needs to be accounted for is the accessibility of the said programs. Unprecedented issues such as the sudden closure of educational facilities, as was experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, should not hinder the learning opportunities that the students are after. Therefore, the shift from hosting conventional STEM programs to online platforms has become a crucial element in the expansion of STEM education. Delivering engineering-based projects through online STEM programs to school students includes wide expansion of the participating audience C which is not confined by the capacity limit of in-person programs C as well as ease of access. This has value not only on the individual level but also at the social level. Three successful e-STEM (electronic STEM) programs are presented in this paper that are designed to support and enhance students learning of engineering concepts while also increasing students understanding of real-life applications. This has a close connection to the desire to increase online education in developing countries over recent years. The first program is called Innovate, Design and Engineer an App (IDEA). In this program, the students explore the fundamentals of programming and mobile app development. This provides the students with the foundation of coding, algorithms, and refining their ideas to produce a working mobile phone app that is created to meet a specified challenge. The second program is called Creative Fusion and Innovation (CFI). In this program, the students learned the basics of creating, editing, and analyzing their 3D designs;recognize the importance of creating 3D models in engineering;and understand how 3D printing works as they create their own 3D models. The third program is called Virtual Robotics Games (VRG). In this program, the students learn the fundamentals of designing, building, programming, and testing robots in a virtual environment. Through this program, the students learn the basics of robot design in addition to coding and simulation, which are all necessary tools for aspiring engineers. These programs aim to provide STEM education access to build communities specifically in engineering, which is in high demand. Throughout these programs, the students are able to learn important computer skills and the concepts of the engineering design process. The programs also equip them with the required knowledge and problem-solving skills to tackle challenges. At the end of each program, the students will have created successful designs as solutions to the real-life problems that they were tasked with.

In the developed world, some pandemic preparedness plans have already been examined from an ethical viewpoint. This paper assesses the attention given to ethics issues by the Ghana National Integrated Strategic Plan for Pandemic Influenza (NISPPI). METHODS: We critically analyzed the Ghana NISPPIs sensitivity to ethics issues to determine how well it reflects ethical commitments and principles identified in our review of global pandemic preparedness literature, existing pandemic plans, and relevant ethics frameworks. RESULTS: This paper reveals that important ethical issues have not been addressed in the Ghana NISPPI. Several important ethical issues are unanticipated, unacknowledged, and unplanned for. These include guidelines on allocation of scarce resources, the duties of healthcare workers, ethics-sensitive operational guidelines/protocols, and compensation programs. The NISPPI also pays scant attention to use of vaccines and antivirals, border issues and cooperation with neighboring countries, justification for delineated actions, and outbreak simulations. Feedback and communication plans are nebulous, while leadership, coordination, and budgeting are quite detailed. With respect to presentation, the NISPPIs text is organized around five thematic areas. While each area implicates ethical issues, NISPPI treatment of these areas consistently fails to address them. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis reveals a lack of consideration of ethics by the NISPPI. We contend that, while the plans content and fundamental assumptions provide support for implementation of the delineated public health actions, its consideration of ethical issues is poor. Deficiencies include a failure to incorporate guidelines that ensure fair distribution of scarce resources and a lack of justification for delineated procedures. Until these deficiencies are recognized and addressed, Ghana runs the risk of rolling out unjust and ethically indefensible actions with real negative effects in the event of a pandemic. Soliciting inputs from the public and consultation with ethicists during the next revision of the NISPPI will be useful in addressing these issues.","output":"Ethics-sensitivity of the Ghana national integrated strategic response plan for pandemic influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diverse coronavirus (CoV) strains can infect both humans and animals and produce various diseases. CoVs have caused three epidemics and pandemics in the last two decades, and caused a severe impact on public health and the global economy. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the emergence and evolution of endemic and emerging CoV diversity in humans and animals. For diverse bird species, the Infectious Bronchitis Virus is a significant one, whereas feline enteric and canine coronavirus, recombined to produce feline infectious peritonitis virus, infects wild cats. Bovine and canine CoVs have ancestral relationships, while porcine CoVs, especially SADS-CoV, can cross species barriers. Bats are considered as the natural host of diverse strains of alpha and beta coronaviruses. Though MERS-CoV is significant for both camels and humans, humans are nonetheless affected more severely. MERS-CoV cases have been reported mainly in the Arabic peninsula since 2012. To date, seven CoV strains have infected humans, all descended from animals. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) are presumed to be originated in Rhinolopoid bats that severely infect humans with spillover to multiple domestic and wild animals. Emerging alpha and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in pets and wild animals. Still, the intermediate hosts and all susceptible animal species remain unknown. SARS-CoV-2 might not be the last CoV to cross the species barrier. Hence, we recommend developing a universal CoV vaccine for humans so that any future outbreak can be prevented effectively. Furthermore, a One Health approach coronavirus surveillance should be implemented at human-animal interfaces to detect novel coronaviruses before emerging to humans and to prevent future epidemics and pandemics.","output":"Evolutionary Dynamics and Epidemiology of Endemic and Emerging Coronaviruses in Humans, Domestic Animals, and Wildlife"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThree randomized trials have been conducted indicating a clinical benefit of early treatment with fluvoxamine versus placebo for adults with symptomatic COVID-19.

Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with the prognosis of COVID-19 have not been reported yet. Methods In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020. The cases were confirmed by real-time PCR and the demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Prognosis was defined as hospitalization, discharged survivor and death, which was followed up until March 12, 2020. Results Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 138 (53.5%) were male. No significant differences in age and sex were identified between patients with and without diabetes. Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%), and fatigue (38%). Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes. COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease condition with more complications at presentation, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%).

The transcription start signal, GGGACAAGU, was identical to that of the F and matrix (M) proteins of turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV). There were two sequences with the potential to function as transcription termination/poly(A) signals, located at nucleotides 751 to 762 and 777 to 787; 15 clones derived from mRNA indicated that the first of these sequences formed the major signal. Part of the next downstream (5') gene was sequenced; unlike mammalian pneumoviruses the TRTV M2 gene did not overlap the beginning of the 5'-proximal gene. Northern blotting indicated that infected Vero cells contained less M2 mRNA than F mRNA and that about half of the M2 mRNA was present as a F-M2 dicistronic mRNA. The M2 gene contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs 1 and 2), as with RS virus. ORF 1 comprised 558 nucleotides with the coding potential for a 186 amino acid polypeptide, M(r) 20959, eight or nine residues shorter than for human RS virus strains. The overall amino acid identity was 40%, the N-terminal one-third of the proteins sharing 62% of residues, the remainder 29%. A hydropathy plot of the TRTV M2 protein had close similarity to that of the M2 or RS virus. The protein was predicted to have a basic character with no N-terminal signal sequence or other major highly hydrophobic sequences. In vitro translation of a transcript comprising both ORFs 1 and 2 produced a single product of apparent M(r) 23000, corresponding to the M2 product of ORF 1. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that this product was derived from ORF 1 and that frameshifting was not involved. The second ORF was expressed only from a transcript which lacked the AUG codons of ORF 1 and, although occupying a similar position to that in the RS virus M2 gene, had virtually no amino acid identity in its 73 residue length and was approximately 25% shorter than the corresponding RS virus ORF 2. The hydropathy plot of the potential products of the second ORFs of TRTV and RS virus showed little resemblance. Taken together these results suggest that ORF 2 is unlikely to be expressed in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","output":"Sequence and in vitro expression of the M2 gene of turkey rhinotracheitis pneumovirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel corona virus pandemic in 2020 has created havoc across the world.

Severe complications of SARS-CoV2 infection are linked to microvascular injury and complement activation is suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of endothelial cell damage in severe COVID-19. METHODS: We present the first two cases of aHUS triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection in two unrelated infants with the same mutation in the RNA exosome gene EXOSC3. This mutation is known to cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1b, an autosomal-recessive neurodegenerative disease. So far, no kidney involvement in affected persons was reported. RESULTS: As eculizumab treatment was unsuccessful and complement-mediated disorders were ruled out, we suppose that the atypical HUS in our two patients is not due to complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy but rather due to a dysfunction of the RNA exosome. CONCLUSIONS: The RNA exosome is crucial for the precise processing and degradation of nuclear and cytoplasmatic RNA. We suspect that the SARS-CoV-2 infection led to changes in RNA that could not be offset by the defective RNA exosome in our two patients. The accumulation/wrong processing of the viral RNA must have led to the endothelial cell damage resulting in aHUS. This would be a new  RNA-induced  mechanism of aHUS.","output":"Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome induced by SARS-CoV2 infection in infants with EXOSC3 mutation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThis study examined the association between increased alcohol consumption and telecommuting, comparing employees who expressed a preference for telecommuting and those who did not.

We investigated the joint effects of habitual PA and long-term fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) exposure on COPD incidence in a prospective population-based cohort. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted using data from the UK Biobank. Incidence of COPD was ascertained through linkage to the UK National Health Services register. Annual mean PM(2.5) concentration was obtained using land use regression model. PA was measured by questionnaire and wrist-worn accelerometer. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to examine the associations between PM(2.5), PA, and COPD. Additive and multiplicative interactions were examined. RESULTS: A total of 266,280 participants free of COPD at baseline were included in data analysis with an average follow-up of 10.64 years, contributing to around 2.8 million person-years. Compared with participants with low level of PA, those with higher PA levels had lower risks of COPD incidence [hazard ratio (HR): 0.769, 95% CI: 0.720, 0.820 for moderate level; HR: 0.726, 95% CI: 0.679, 0.776 for high level]. By contrast, PM(2.5) was associated with increased risk of COPD (HR per interquartile range increment: 1.065, 95% CI: 1.032, 1.099). Limited evidence of interaction between habitual PA and PM(2.5) exposure was found. Similar results were found for accelerometer-measured PA.

Losartan is the ARB that was chosen to be tested in this study. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 and mild hypoxia (receipt of  3 L/min O(2) by nasal cannula) admitted to three hospitals were randomized in a 1:1 ratio within 72 h of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing confirmation to prospectively receive standard of care (SOC) alone or SOC plus losartan 12.5 mg orally every 12 h for 10 days or until hospital discharge, with the option to titrate upward dependent on blood pressure tolerability. Primary composite endpoint was receipt of mechanical ventilation or death before receiving ventilation. Subjects were followed until discharge to home or until an endpoint was met in the hospital. RESULTS: Sixteen subjects received an ARB plus SOC and 15 subjects received SOC alone. The median age was 53 years for both groups. Median time from hospital admission to study enrollment was 2 days (range 1C6) for the ARB group and 2 days (range 1C4) for the SOC group. Mean Charlson comorbidity index was 2 for both groups. One subject in each group achieved the composite endpoint. CONCLUSION: This small prospective randomized open-label study showed no clinically significant impacts of ARB therapy in mildly hypoxemic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 early in the pandemic.

It is not known if this 'natural experiment' of shorter postpartum hospital stays resulted in increased risk for postpartum readmissions and other acute postpartum care utilization such as emergency room encounters. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to determine which clinical factors were associated with expedited postpartum discharge and whether the expedited postpartum discharge was associated with increased risk for acute postpartum care utilization. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated birth hospitalizations at affiliated hospitals during two periods: (i) the apex of the 'first wave' of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (3/22/20 to 4/30/20) and (ii) a historical control period of one year earlier (3/22/19 to 4/30/19). Routine postpartum discharge was defined as 2 d after vaginal birth and 3 d after cesarean birth. Expedited discharge was defined as <2 d after vaginal birth and <3 d after cesarean birth. Acute postpartum care utilization was defined as any emergency room visit, obstetric triage visit, or postpartum readmission 6 weeks after birth hospitalization discharge. Demographic and clinical variables were compared based on routine versus expedited postpartum discharge. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were performed to analyze factors associated with (i) expedited discharge and (ii) acute postpartum care utilization. Unadjusted (ORs) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% CIs were used as measures of association. Stratified analysis was performed restricted to patients with chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension. RESULTS: A total of 1,358 birth hospitalizations were included in the analysis, 715 (52.7%) from 2019 and 643 (47.3%) from 2020. Expedited discharge was more common in 2020 than in 2019 (60.3% versus 5.0% of deliveries, p < .01). For 2020, clinical factors significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of expedited discharge included hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.27-0.60), chronic hypertension (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06-0.29), and COVID-19 infection (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.77). Cesarean (OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.14-4.19) and term birth (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.03, 5.49) were associated with an increased likelihood of expedited discharge. Most of the associations retained significance in adjusted models. Expedited compared to routine discharge was not associated with significantly different odds of acute postpartum care utilization for 2020 deliveries (5.4% versus 5.9%; OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.47-1.82). Medicaid insurance (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.06-4.98) and HDP (OR 5.16, 95% CI: 2.60-10.26) were associated with a higher risk of acute postpartum care utilization and retained significance in adjusted analyses. In the stratified analysis restricted to women with hypertensive diagnoses, expedited discharge was associated with significantly increased risk for postpartum readmission (OR 6.09, 95% CI 2.14, 17.33) but not overall acute postpartum care utilization (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.00, 4.74).

RESULTS : We show the dynamics of paralytic cases as the virus spreads globally. We demonstrate the difficulty of eradication unless aggressive efforts begin soon after initial disease detection. Different poliovirus serotypes lead to different trajectories and burdens of disease. In the absence of aggressive measures, the virus would become globally endemic in 2-10 years, and cumulative paralytic cases would exceed 4-40 million depending on serotype, with the burden of disease shifting to younger ages.

METHODS: An international 1-day online surgical skills course consisting of lectures, pre-recorded virtual workshops, live demonstrations and along with surgical skills teaching in breakout rooms was organised. Based on existing learning theories, new methods were developed to deliver skills teaching online. Simultaneously, traditional in-person surgical skills teaching was also conducted and used as a benchmark. Skills development was assessed by trained demonstrators and self-reported competency scores were compared between the online and face-to-face event. RESULTS: 553 delegates from 20 different countries attended the online course. Of these, 64 were trained in breakout rooms with a 1:5 demonstrator-to-delegate ratio whilst the remaining 489 delegates participated in didactic skills development sessions. In a separate face-to-face course, 20 delegates were trained with traditional methods. Demonstrators rated the competency of delegates for suturing, tendon repair and vascular anastomosis. There was no significant difference in the competency ratings of delegates receiving online teaching or face-to-face teaching (p = 0.253, p = 0.084, p = 1.00, respectively). The development of the same skills to articulation were not different between formats (p = 0.841, p = 0.792, p = 1.00, respectively).

METHODS: Treatment protocols from North American healthcare facilities and recommendations from guideline-issuing bodies were collected. Qualitative data on treatment regimens and their applications were extracted using an adapted National Institutes of Health/US Food and Drug Administration experimental therapeutics framework. Structured data on risk factor and severity of illness scoring systems were extracted and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We extracted data from 105 independent protocols. Guideline-issuing organizations published recommendations after the initial peak of the pandemic in many regions and generally recommended clinical trial referral, with limited additional guidance. Facility-specific protocols favored offering some treatment (96.8%, N = 92 of 95), most commonly, hydroxychloroquine (90.5%), followed by remdesivir and interleukin-6 inhibitors. Recommendation for clinical trial enrollment was limited largely to academic medical centers (19 of 52 vs 9 of 43 community/Veterans Affairs [VA]), which were more likely to have access to research studies. Other themes identified included urgent protocol development, plans for rapid updates, contradictory statements, and entirely missing sections, with section headings but no content other than in process.

Initial screening for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) IgG revealed that 1.6% (2/126) and 4% (5/126) of ICU COVID-19 cases developed strong and moderate ANA levels, respectively. However, all the non-ICU cases (n = 273) were ANA negative. The high ANA level was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IFA) and large-scale autoantibody screening by phage immunoprecipitation-sequencing (PhIP-Seq). Indeed, the majority of the samples showed \\"speckled\\" ANA pattern by microscopy, and we demonstrate that samples of ICU patients with strong and moderate ANA levels contain autoantibody specificities that predominantly targeted proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction, metabolism, apoptotic processes, and cell death;further denoting reactivity to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens. Conclusion Our results further support the notion of routine screening for autoimmune responses in COVID-19 patients, which might help improve disease prognosis and patient management. Further, results provide compelling evidence that ANA-positive individuals should be excluded from being donors for convalescent plasma therapy in the context of Covid-19.","output":"Detection of antinuclear antibodies targeting intracellular signal transduction, metabolism, apoptotic processes and cell death in critical COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 19 is a pandemic affecting millions worldwide.

The U.S. government has a legal mechanism to overcome this conflict: government use of patented technologies at the cost of government paid compensation under 28 U.S.C.  1498. But while many have recognized the theoretical possibility of government patent use under that statute, there is today a conventional wisdom that  1498 is too exceptional, unpredictable, and dramatic for practical use, to the point that it ought to be invoked sparingly or not at all, even in extraordinary circumstances such as a pandemic.Yet that conventional wisdom is a recent one, and it conflicts with both history and theory. This Article considers the role of  1498 in the context of national crises and emergencies like COVID-19, a context so far not addressed substantially in the literature on the statute. We find that government patent use is not nearly as exceptional as it is commonly made out to be, and indeed has been not only used but expanded through statutory amendment over the last century. Review of the development and use of the statute during both world wars and the postCSeptember 11 period reveals widespread acceptance of government patent use as a tool for addressing imminent national problems, and it illuminates particular features of government patent use that become especially pertinent in times of crisis. In the United States, government patent use and national emergencies have a close and special relationship;each has shaped the other.Drawing from the lessons of history and analysis of the statute, we develop a novel framework for comparing  1498 to other policy tools, including prizes, research grants, and patent buyouts. Under this framework, four features of  1498 stand out: speed of invocation, flexibility in the scope of its use, post-crisis determination of compensation, and use of an impartial adjudicator.Whenever these four features are advantageous  which will be true in most national emergency situations, as we demonstrate  the U.S.government should strongly consider government patent use over patent buyouts and other policy tools. We show the advantages of these four features in a case study: government patent use to expand supply and access to the COVID-19 treatment remdesivir. Accordingly, and contrary to the conventional view of  1498, we conclude that government patent should be an ordinary tool of government policy.","output":"Whos Afraid of Section 1498?

Our objective was to identify structural and managerial factors associated with COVID-19 outbreaks in NHs. METHODS We conducted in July 2020 a retrospective study by questionnaire addressed to NH directors in the Brittany region of France. The questions related to structural characteristics of the establishment, human resources, and crisis management decisions. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 among residents between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. The secondary endpoint was total mortality during this period. We used multivariate regressions to identify factors associated with these outcomes. RESULTS Responses were collected from 231 NHs hosting 20,881 residents, representing a participation rate of 47%. In 24 (10%) NHs, at least one resident presented confirmed COVID-19. NHs often implemented stringent protective measures, with 65% of them choosing to confine residents to their rooms. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with a reduced risk of case occurrence were in-room meal service, early ban of family visits, and daily access to an outdoor space. No association was found between mortality and the factors studied. Our results show an early and strict implementation of lockdown measures, with good epidemiological results in a context of shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and non-vaccination. Nevertheless, it raises ethical questions concerning respect of residents' wellbeing and rights. CONCLUSION Cessation of communal dining seems to be the main measure likely to be effective in preventive terms.

The need for an approach specific to patients who exhibit symptoms associated with infection with COVID-19 is shown in the main fact that patients who develop medium and severe forms of this disease have oftentimes one or more diagnosis in the cardiorespiratory, oncology, renal, metabolic, etc. fields. Such treatment must be individualized, taking into account the conditions associated with the health state of the patient. The treatment is drafted by overlapping the efforts of a multidisciplinary team: physician, assistants, and physiotherapist, all of them having the same achieved goal: ensuring, at discharge from the hospital, a patient with improved signs and symptoms, able to continue their daily activities on their own. Early rehabilitation therapy for patients with COVID-19 with critical stages and average stages aims to decrease breathing difficulties, provide relief of symptoms, relieve anxiety and depression, and decrease the incidence of complications. The intervention process of early rehabilitation is applied after a general clinical assessment. The functional respiratory assessment (the evaluation of the activity of the thoracic cage, the amplitude of diaphragm activity, the pattern and breathing frequency), the heart status, the capacity to mobilize, and the ability to realize ADL must be highlighted. The rehabilitation therapy of the patients with COVID-19 includes mainly the posture management and respiratory physiotherapy. Change of posture can change the ratio of ventilation/perfusion and may lead to an improvement in the exchange of gases, but may lead to an unexpected worsening. It is recommended to use the pillows and auxiliary devices which permit a comfortable, stable position, without the need of any effort of the patient. The postural drainage can reduce the influence of sputum on the respiratory tract, which is particularly important to improve the ratio V/Q (ventilation/perfusion). The patients need to be educated to get themselves in a position that will allow gravity to assist in draining the excretions of the pulmonary lobes or the lung segments. Standing is the best position of the body for breathing in the state of rest. Physical exercises can completely expand the lungs and help in removing secretions in the lung alveoli and respiratory ways. Also the vital capacity increases and improves the respiratory function. The breathing exercises are based on deep and slow breathing (in inspiration the patient must move the diaphragm actively) and on thoracic expansion combined with the mobilization of the scapular girdle (the inspiration must be deep and slow, during the inspiration the thoracic cage is moving forward and with the raising of the upper limbs; in the expiration the thoracic cage is moving rear, and the upper limbs return to the initial position). The active cycle of the respiratory techniques is composed of three phases (control of breathing, the thoracic expansion, and the expiration). The modality of a breathing cycle must be developed regarding the patients health status. Even if it is estimated that at the current time approximately 80% of patients who contact the virus do not develop symptoms and will recover without having any special treatment, the given repercussions due to prolonged hospitalization or quarantine at home will represent the beginning regarding the establishment of a respiratory recovery program, which will have as objectives the improvement of the quality of life, combating a sedentary lifestyle, and bringing some benefits in the psychosocial sphere of the individual, etc. The early mobilizations and the return to an active life must be encouraged for patients with COVID-19. The prevention of the complications due to prolonged immobilization, the transfers (changing position from sitting in standing and vice versa), obtaining the static and dynamic balance, and the realization of ADL are very important.","output":"Physiotherapeutic management for patients with Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ranking countries via index-based league tables is now commonplace and is said by its proponents to provide countries with an ability to compare performance with their peers, spurring them to learn from others and make improvements The Human Development Index (HDI) is arguably one of the most influential indices of its type in terms of reporting within the media and influence on development policy and funding allocation It is often used as part of a suite of indices to assess sustainability The index was first published in the Human Development Report (HDR) of 1990 and has appeared in each of the HDRs published since then This paper reports the first research of its type designed to explore the impacts of methodological changes over 28 years (1991 to 2018) on the ranks of a sample of 135 countries appearing in the HDRs Results suggest that methodological changes in the HDI have had a statistically significant impact on the ranking of the majority (82%) of countries in the sample, and the ranks of countries that tend to appear towards the top, middle, or bottom of the HDI league table are just as likely to be influenced by changes in HDI methodology The paper suggests that after nearly 30 years of the HDI, there is an urgent need for independent and empirical research on the changes that it has helped bring about","output":"To Rank or Not to Rank with Indices?

With no effective treatment yet, vaccination seems to be the most effective method of prevention. Recently developed vaccines have been approved for emergency use only and are currently applied to large populations. Considering both the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases (AIIRDs) and the immunosuppressive drugs used in treatment, vaccination for COVID-19 deserves special attention in such patients. In this article, we aimed to give simple messages to the clinicians for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with AIIRDs based upon the current evidence regarding the use of other vaccines in this patient group. For this purpose, we conducted a \\"Pubmed search\\" using the following keywords: Influenza, Hepatitis B, Pneumococcal, and Shingles vaccines and the frequently used conventional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Likewise, an additional search was performed for the COVID-19 immunization in patients with AIIRDs and considering such drugs. In summary, patients with AIIRDs should also be vaccinated against COVID-19, preferably when disease activity is under control and when there is no concurrent infection. Low-degree immunosuppression does not appear to decrease antibody responses to vaccines. Ideally, vaccinations should be done before the initiation of any biological DMARDs. Patients receiving rituximab should be vaccinated at least 4 weeks before or 6 months after treatment. Since tofacitinib may also reduce antibody responses, especially in combination with methotrexate, it may be appropriate to discontinue this drug before vaccination and to restart after 14 days of immunization.

These adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) are at higher risk of experiencing mental health problems than those without; in Malawi, 18.9% have a depressive disorder. ALHIV can face numerous psychosocial challenges, but little is known about how ALHIV in Malawi perceive these stressors. Understanding psychosocial challenges of ALHIV is a key step in ensuring good mental health care. The aim of this study was to assess the psychosocial challenges faced by ALHIV attending adolescent-specific ART program in Zomba, Malawi. METHODS Between April and May 2019, we engaged a purposive sample of ALHIV ages 12-18 (n = 80) in a series of eight focus groups drawing from four Teen Clubs linked to an adolescent-specific ART program. Data were analyzed inductively and deductively to identify themes related to ALHIV psychosocial experiences. RESULTS Two themes that emerged from the study include: 1) stigma and discrimination within communities and families; 2) non-adherence to medications. HIV-related stigma was associated with increased psychological distress; physical and emotional/verbal abuse; low social support, isolation, and a feeling of rejection; and risky health behaviors such as medication hiding and non-adherence to ART. Discriminatory actions were manifested in a form of being given separate utensils for their meals and mistreatment at school. Furthermore, some parents did not allow their children to play with the participants out of fear that HIV transmission. CONCLUSIONS Stigma and discrimination are overlooked potential barriers to HIV treatment and care.

In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system. RESULTS: The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

In addition, this review aims to introduce strategies and policies that combat social inequalities and enable healthy living behaviors in LA countries. If LA countries do not work on public policies that decrease multi-morbidities and social inequalities, we will be unable to eliminate COVID-19, as well as possible other outbreaks that may arise in the future.","output":"COVID-19 seen from a syndemic perspective: Impact of unhealthy habits and future perspectives to combat these negative interactions in Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a growing public health crisis. Despite initial focus on the elderly population with comorbidities, it seems that large studies from the worst affected countries follow a sex-disaggregation pattern. Analysis of available data showed marked variations in reported cases between males and females among different countries with higher mortality in males. At this early stage of the pandemic, medical datasets at the individual level are not available; therefore, it is challenging to conclude how different factors have impacted COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, in the absence of patients' level data, we attempted to provide a theoretical description of how other determinants have affected COVID-19 susceptibility in males compared to females. In this article, we have identified and discussed possible biological and behavioral factors that could be responsible for the increased male susceptibility. Biological factors include - an absence of X-chromosomes (a powerhouse for immune-related genes), a high level of testosterone that inhibits antibody production, and the presence of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that facilitate viral replication. Similarly, behavioral factors constitute - higher smoking and alcohol consumptions, low level of handwashing practices, and high-risk behavior like non-adherence to health services and reluctance to follow public health measures in males.

Here, we examined the association between HK-II expression and radioresistance in laryngeal carcinoma and whether the inhibition of HK-II expression can enhance the radiosensitivity of these tumors. Methods: The effects of HK-II small interfering RNA (siRNA) on the radiosensitivity of Tu212 cells were examined in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model. Cells were irradiated using a 6-MV linear accelerator. The cell viability, cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of Tu212 cells were evaluated using trypan blue staining, colony formation assays, CCK-8 assays, and flow cytometry, respectively. Oxygen consumption, lactic acid production, glucose consumption, and the ATP level of Tu212 cells were also examined. The expression of glycolytic and regulatory enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle was assessed using Western blotting. Results: The HK-II siRNA and X-ray combination treatment led to a significantly greater reduction of cell viability, inhibition of cell survival and proliferation, increased apoptosis, and increased G2 phase arrest compared to either treatment alone (all, P<0.01). HK-II siRNA increased the oxygen consumption rate of cells, significantly inhibited lactic acid production and glucose consumption, and significantly suppressed the upregulation of HK-II, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), phosphofructokinase platelet (PFKP), lactate dehydrogenase (LD), and citrate synthase (CS) (all, P<0.01).

Objective: To use direct and indirect standardization for insights into the impact of age-specific under-reporting on between-country variability in CFR, and apparent size of COVID-19 epidemics. Design: Post-hoc secondary data analysis (case studies), and mathematical modeling. Setting: China, global. Interventions: None. Measurements: Data were extracted from a sentinel epidemiological study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC) that describes attack rates and CFR for COVID-19 in China prior to February 12, 2020. Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were used to impute missing cases and adjust CFR. Age-specific attack rates and CFR were applied to different countries with differing age structures (Italy, Japan, Indonesia, and Egypt), in order to generate estimates for CFR, apparent epidemic size, and time to outbreak recognition for identical age-specific attack rates. Results: SMR demonstrated that 50-70% of cases were likely missed during the Chinese epidemic. Adjustment for under-recognition of younger cases decreased CFR from 2.4% to 0.8% (assuming 50% case ascertainment in older individuals). Standardizing the Chinese epidemic to countries with older populations (Italy, and Japan) resulted in larger apparent epidemic sizes, higher CFR and earlier outbreak recognition. The opposite effect was demonstrated for countries with younger populations (Indonesia, and Egypt). Limitations: Secondary data analysis based on a single country at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no attempt to incorporate second order effects (ICU saturation) on CFR. Conclusion: Direct and indirect standardization are simple tools that provide key insights into between-country variation in the apparent size and severity of COVID-19 epidemics.","output":"Standardization and Age-Distribution of COVID-19: Implications for Variability in Case Fatality and Outbreak Identification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 many governments decided in 2020 to impose lockdowns.

A scalable method for calibration involves building an emulator after conducting an experiment on the simulation model. However, when the parameter space is large, meaning the parameters are quite uncertain prior to calibration, much of the parameter space can produce unstable or unrealistic simulator responses that drastically differ from the observed data. One solution to this problem is to simply discard, or filter out, the parameters that gave unreasonable responses and then build an emulator only on the remaining simulator responses. In this article, we demonstrate the key mechanics for an approach that emulates filtered responses but also avoids unstable and incorrect inference.

This study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of the laparoscopic transhiatal approach for Siewert type II AEG, and compare the short-term outcomes of LS versus OS for Siewert type II AEG. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 87 consecutive patients with Siewert type II AEG who underwent curative surgery from January 2008 to November 2016. Surgery-related short-term variables were analyzed in LS versus OS. RESULTS Forty-five patients underwent LS, and 42 underwent OS. Compared with OS, LS was associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss (11 vs. 408 ml, p < 0.001) and extended operation time (256 vs. 226 min, p = 0.001). There was no significant difference between LS and OS in postoperative hospitalization duration (9 vs. 10 days, p = 0.193) or rate of surgical morbidity (grade 3) for complications such as anastomotic leakage (4.4 vs. 4.8%, p = 1.000), or pancreatic leakage (4.4 vs. 9.5%, p = 0.423), and there were no pulmonary-associated complications in either group. There was no difference between groups in total number of harvested lymph nodes (24 vs. 29, p = 0.502), but the number of harvested mediastinum LNs was larger in LS (2 vs. 1, p = 0.002).

Backward methods, such as the quasi-reversibility method, pseudo-reversibility method, and regularized inverse matrix method, can be used to identify contaminant sources in an enclosed environment. However, these methods cannot be used to inversely design a desired indoor environment. Forward methods, such as the CFD-based adjoint method, CFD-based genetic algorithm method, and proper orthogonal decomposition method, show the promise in the inverse design of airflow and heat transfer in an enclosed environment. The CFD-based adjoint method is accurate and can handle many design parameters without increasing computing costs, but the method may find a locally optimal design that could meet the design objective with constrains. The CFD-based genetic algorithm method, on the other hand, can provide the global optimal design that can meet the design objective without constraints, but the computing cost can increase dramatically with the number of design parameters.

METHODS: Participants  55 years were recruited and their questionnaires and physical examination data were collected. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression were implemented to assess the hypertension risk. The non-liner dose-response relationships of bilirubin-hypertension were determined by restricted cubic spline (RCS) models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and multiple factors analysis (MFA) were performed to evaluate the predictive abilities. RESULTS: 1881 eligible participants (male 43.75%, female 56.25%) with the median age of 61.00 (59.00-66.00) were included. The hazard ratio (HR, 95% CI) of serum total bilirubin (STB) and unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) were 1.03 (1.01-1.05) and 1.05 (1.03-1.07), while conjugated bilirubin (CB) showed a weak protective effect with the HR of 0.96 (0.92-0.99), and the associations remained significant in all models.

However, there are few nongenetic methods for the installation of chemical modifications at a specific protein site in cells. Here we report a covalent ligand directed release (CoLDR) site-specific labeling strategy, which enables the installation of a variety of functional tags on a target protein while releasing the directing ligand. Using this approach, we were able to label various proteins such as BTK, K-Ras(G12C), and SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro) with different tags. For BTK we have shown selective labeling in cells of both alkyne and fluorophores tags. Protein labeling by traditional affinity methods often inhibits protein activity since the directing ligand permanently occupies the target binding pocket. We have shown that using CoLDR chemistry, modification of BTK by these probes in cells preserves its activity. We demonstrated several applications for this approach including determining the half-life of BTK in its native environment with minimal perturbation, as well as quantification of BTK degradation by a noncovalent proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) by in-gel fluorescence. Using an environment-sensitive turn-on fluorescent probe, we were able to monitor ligand binding to the active site of BTK.

We describe the epidemiology and outcomes of RVI in a cohort enrolling 3294 consecutive patients undergoing SOT from May 2008 to December 2015 in Switzerland. Patient and allograft outcomes, and RVI diagnosed during routine clinical practice were prospectively collected. Median follow-up was 3.4 years (interquartile range 1.61-5.56). Six-hundred-ninety-six RVI were diagnosed in 151/334 (45%) lung and 265/2960 (5%) non-lung transplant recipients. Cumulative incidence was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI] 53%-69%) in lung and 12% (95% CI 11%-14%) in non-lung transplant recipients. RVI led to 17.9 (95% CI 15.7-20.5) hospital admissions per 1000 patient-years. Intensive care unit admission was required in 4% (27/691) of cases. Thirty-day all-cause case fatality rate was 0.9% (6/696). Using proportional hazard models we found that RVI (adjusted-hazard ratio [aHR] 2.45; 95% CI 1.62-3.73), lower respiratory tract RVI (aHR 3.45; 95% CI 2.15-5.52), and influenza (aHR 3.57; 95% CI 1.75-7.26) were associated with graft failure or death.

However, weaker IgG-positive samples failed to similarly convert pools of 50 to a positive result. In contrast, a stronger individual positive sample converted all pools tested into positive outcomes.

In this study, we investigated the effect of NAFLD on satellite cell (SC) content and skeletal muscle repair. METHODS Male CD-1 mice fed a choline-deficient diet for 4 wk were used as an NAFLD model. We performed histologic and mRNA expression analyses, immunochemical staining with single muscle fibers to assess the effect of NAFLD on muscle Pax7+ SCs, and muscle regeneration by intramuscular injection of cardiotoxin. RESULTS We found that the total number of Pax7+ SCs in the extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior muscles of mice with NAFLD was significantly decreased when compared with that in the control group, in which the depletion of the SC pool possibly impaired muscle regeneration, as evidenced by the smaller size of the regenerating myofibers. Importantly, we found that NAFLD significantly impaired the differentiation ability of SCs, as shown by a decreased number of SCs expressing a myogenic marker, MyoD. Finally, this study indicated that molecular mechanisms underlying a decline in SC numbers may be attributed to the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor  [TNF]) and an oxidative stress marker (NADPH oxidase-2 [NOX2\\\\) in mice with NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS The findings demonstrate that a decrease in SC content in the skeletal muscle is an important factor that contributes to muscle wasting in NAFLD.

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Participants Patients aged 65 years and older hospitalized for a diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods Data from hospital admission was collected from the electronic medical records. Logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazard models were used to predict mortality, our primary outcome. Variables at hospital admission were categorized according to the following domains: demographics, clinical history, comorbidities, previous treatment, clinical status, vital signs, clinical scales and scores, routine laboratory analysis and imaging results. Results Of a total of 235 Caucasian patients, 43% were male, with a mean age of 86  6.5 years. Seventy-six patients (32%) died. Non-survivors had a shorter number of days from initial symptoms to hospitalization (p=0.007) and the length of stay in acute wards than survivors (p<0.001). Similarly, they had a higher prevalence of heart failure (p=0.044), peripheral artery disease (p=0.009), crackles at clinical status (p<0.001), respiratory rate (p=0.005), oxygen support needs (p<0.001), C-reactive protein (p<0.001), bilateral and peripheral infiltrates on chest radiographs (p=0.001) and a lower prevalence of headache (p=0.009). Furthermore, non-survivors were more often frail (p<0.001), with worse functional status (p<0.001), higher comorbidity burden (p<0.001) and delirium at admission (p=0.007). A multivariable Cox model showed that male sex (HR 4.00, 95% CI 2.08-7.71, p=0.0001), increased fraction of inspired oxygen (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09, p<0.0001) and crackles (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.15-6.06, p=0.0190) were the best predictors of mortality, while better functional status was protective (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, p=0.0013).

This study tests the power of messages as drivers of willingness to comply with physical distancing across religious minorities in Israel during the first wave of the COVID-19 from March till June 2020. METHODS: 896 Israeli Muslims, Druze, Bedouins, Jewish Orthodox, Christians, and Jewish Seculars participated in this conjoint-based experimental design. The size of the total sample and of the subgroups is consistent with the suggested size in conjoint analysis studies, particularly when aiming at stability of coefficients rather than stability of means. The dependent variable was willingness to comply. Independent variables were known contributors to compliance: perceived risk, practices of physical distancing, ways to assure compliance, and the agent communicating the policy. RESULTS: A regression analysis indicated minor differences in the power of messages across groups despite dramatic cultural differences amongst them. We identified three distinct mindsets that transcend religious cultures from the responses of the study subjects to various messages and named them pandemic observers, obedient followers, and sensitive interpreters. Compliance of \\"Pandemic Observers\\" (n = 306) may be improved by messages such as, Dangerous virus spreading wildly and Health experts suggest what to do but the government is reactive rather than proactive ( = 14, p < .005). Compliance of \\"Obedient Followers\\" (n = 242) may be driven by the messages Socialize and work only from home, using the internet, e.g. zoom/Skype and Everyone should stay 2 m. (6 ft.) apart ( = 16, p < .0050). Compliance of \\"Sensitive Interpreters\\" (n = 249) may be improved by messages such as, Only people who are 60 and over are to be allowed to buy groceries during first 2 h from opening and by using the media to publicize the official health policy ( = 8; p < .005). CONCLUSIONS: Mindset-assignment reflects how people think rather than their religious affiliation. A personal viewpoint identifier was developed to predict mindset-assignment and enable health authorities to enhance compliance through mindset-tailored messages for members of each mindset segment. We recommend that health authorities and policy makers consider these different personality types, which range across religious minorities and emphasize the messages that each type responds to in developing and implementing a communication plan to improve physical distancing as an important public health measure.","output":"Improving compliance with physical distancing across religious cultures in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents empirical evidence from Brazil on the bidirectional relationship between inequality and the Covid-19 crisis: Racial, regional and income inequalities have both aggravated the pandemic and been exacerbated by it.

Hospitals have deployed/incorporated indoor air purifiers with the hope to minimize the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the indoor air purifier in reducing the transmission risk remained unknown. This study uses computational fluid dynamics to model the dispersion of the aerosol particles exhaled from the patient under the influence of an air conditioner, exhaust fans and air purifier.

Multiple air purifiers placed at 1 meter above the floor and next to a patient can increase the total efficiency from 37.14 to 59.91% for weak exhalation and from 36.44% to 48.81% for medium exhalation.

To establish to what degree fUSI trial-by-trial signals reflect neural activity, we performed simultaneous fUSI and neural recordings with Neuropixels probes in awake mice. fUSI signals strongly correlated with the slow (<0.3 Hz) fluctuations in the local firing rate and were closely predicted by the smoothed firing rate of local neurons, particularly putative inhibitory neurons. The optimal smoothing filter had a width of 3 s, matched the hemodynamic response function of awake mice, was invariant across mice and stimulus conditions, and was similar in the cortex and hippocampus. fUSI signals also matched neural firing spatially: firing rates were as highly correlated across hemispheres as fUSI signals.

METHODS: Data are from a random 25 percent subsample of Health and Retirement Study (HRS) participants who completed a COVID-19 module introduced in June 2020. We estimated logistic regression models to predict each of five self-reported hardships during the pandemic. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that persons with three or more functional limitations were more likely to report both types of food insecurity, and difficulty paying regular and medical bills since the start of the pandemic, relative to those with no limitations. After controlling for health conditions, effects were no longer significant for paying medical bills, and attenuated yet remained statistically significant for other outcomes. Patterns did not differ significantly on the basis of the moderator variables. Job loss substantially increased the risk of economic insecurity but not food insecurity.

International society guidelines advise against the use of laparoscopy; however, the evidence on this topic is scant and recommendations are based on the perceived most cautious course of action. METHODS We conducted a narrative review of the existing literature surrounding the risks of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery and balance these risks against the benefits of minimally invasive approaches. We also propose mitigation measures to address these risks that we have adopted in our institution.

The degree to which these measures are adhered to in the US, however, may be influenced by access to outdoor resources such as green space, as well as mask mandates that may vary by state. Purpose To examine the association between the presence or absence of statewide mask mandates and green space exposure with COVID-19 cumulative incidence in the US. Methods In October 2020, COVID-19 case data for each US county was downloaded from USA Facts, in addition to statewide mask mandates from a database maintained by the American Association of Retired Persons. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from the US Geological Survey (USGS), was used as a measure of greenspace, while the 2016 National Land Cover Database was used to assess tree canopy exposure as an alternative measure of greenspace. We performed generalized linear regression to evaluate associations with COVID-19 incidence, adjusting for potential confounders such as other environmental factors (i.e., air pollution and climate) and socio-economic factors derived from the CDC social vulnerability index. In addition, we also performed spatial regression analyses to account for spatial autocorrelation across counties. Results Counties with mandatory mask-wearing policies had a lower cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (B = ?0.299, SE = 0.038). Among environmental factors, precipitation (B = 0.005, SE = 0.001) and PM 2.5 (B = 0.072, SE = 0.012) were associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19, while tree canopy (B = ?0.501, SE = 0.129) was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19. COVID-19 incidence was higher in counties with socially vulnerable populations regarding socioeconomic status, minority status, and housing and transportation. Conclusion Mandatory mask regulation, exposure to green space, and reduced exposure to air pollution may reduce COVID-19 incidence in the US.

A total of 237 medical students participated. The first survey was conducted at the time of initiation of online mode of teaching, during May 1C7, 2020, and second, after completion of 6 months of regular online teaching, during November 1C7, 2020. The questionnaire comprised initial section on demographic details and consent followed by 27 and 30 sets of statements pertaining to online medical education experience in the first and second questionnaires, respectively. A 5-point Likert scale was used. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 24.0. Chi-square test was applied for association, and P  0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 237 students participated in the study. The response rate was 52.7%. Majority of respondents had suitable devices (89.1%) and Internet facilities (62%) for online classes. The students accepted the new method of teaching very well, but for practical sessions and clinics, traditional classes were necessary. Long screen time, lack of studentCteacher interaction, and interaction with peers were major concerns of students. However, over the study period, the availability of resources, friendliness toward technology, and inclination toward virtual classes increased. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has introduced to a new normal where online teaching cannot be ignored. Despite challenges faced during online learning, 65.5% of students preferred hybrid teaching in future for delivering medical education. Acceptance for online education by students increased over time in the study.","output":"Medical students perspective on online teaching during pandemic: Experience from a Government Medical College in Uttarakhand, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, a medical system based on Deep Learning (DL) which we called COVIDetection-Net is proposed for automatic detection of new corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection from chest radiography images (CRIs).

Over exposure to metal/metalloid elements has been proposed as associated with reproductive impairment. However, the hazard profile remained unclear in general public experiencing low-level and combined metal exposure. METHODS: Based on the MARHCS cohort in Chongqing, China, 796 college students were recruited from June 2013 and 666 subjects were followed up next year. At each phase, semen and blood samples were collected for an assessment of semen quality and six sex hormones levels. Eighteen urinary metal/metalloid elements were quantified by ICP-MS as internal exposure biomarkers. Cluster analysis was conducted to characterize reproductive outcomes in the subgroups for different overall estimated exposure levels. Effects of each metal/metalloid element were analyzed using multiple statistical strategies: single-element mixed model, multiple-elements model and self before-after comparison design. RESULTS: The urine concentration for 18 metal/metalloid elements was at a typically lower level (far away from the exposure limits) and positively associated with each other. After adjustment of the potential confounders, a decrease of 11.53% (95% CI: -18.61, -3.84%) and 10.84% (95% CI: -17.93, -3.14%) in spermatid morphology was observed in the highest quantile groups of vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni), respectively. Urinary silver (Ag) was dose-dependent associated with an increase in total sperm number (6.91%, 95% CI: 1.14, 13.00%), sperm concentration (16.38%, 95% CI: 5.15, 28.81%) and semen volume (23.73%, 95% CI: 10.46, 38.60%). Further, hormone testosterone presented a significant decrease in subgroup with higher overall estimated exposure and a stable negative association with lithium (Li). The above relationships remained significant across different statistical strategies (all p values <0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study provided new evidences that exposure to metal/metalloid elements potentially exert bidirectional influences on semen quality at a relatively low level.

DATA SOURCES: Seven databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wangfang, VIP, and China Biology Medicine disc databases) were systematically searched from the database inception through May 18, 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared acupuncture or exercise with a sham control or usual care for the treatment of aromatase inhibitors (AIs)-related psychosomatic symptoms and QOL. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were screened and extracted independently using predesigned forms. The quality of RCTs was assessed with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The effect size was calculated via random-effects modeling. The quality of evidence was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The score of pain was measured with BPI scale and Western Ontario and the McMaster Universities Index (WOMAC) scale. Emotional state was measured with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A), and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue). The QOL score was measured by self-reported measurements, including the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale and 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) scale. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs (with 830 patients) were included in the systematic review, and data from 10 RCTs (with 798 patients) were used in the meta-analysis. Results showed acupuncture significantly reduced worst pain scores (P < 0.00001, I (2) = 83.5%) [SMD = ?0.81, 95% CI (?1.51, ?0.11)], but the effect of exercise therapies was not significant in overall change in worst pain scores (P =0.006, I (2) = 72.3%) [SMD = ?0.30, 95% CI (?0.76, 0.16)]. Both acupuncture and exercise resulted in little to no difference in overall change in HADS-A subscale (P = 0.026<0.05, I (2) = 79.8%) [WMD = ?0.21, 95% CI (?3.44, 3.03)], PSQI subscale (P = 0.488, I (2) = 0%) [WMD = 0.98, 95% CI (?0.57, 2.53)], and FACIT-Fatigue subscale (P = 0.022<0.05, I (2) = 81.0%) [WMD = 1.6, 95% CI (?5.75, 8.94)]. Exercise (compared with usual care) was associated with improving overall change in health-related QOL (subscales of SF-36 tool) (P = 0, I (2) = 72.1%) [WMD = 7.97, 95% CI (5.68, 10.25)] and cancer-specific QOL (subscales of FACT-G tool) (P = 0.304, I (2) = 16%) [WMD = 1.16, 95% CI (0.34, 1.97)]. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that based on moderate-level evidence, acupuncture was associated with significant reductions in pain intensity, and exercise might improve QOL in breast cancer patients treated with AIs. However, in psychosomatic symptoms such as anxiety, sleep disturbance, and fatigue, acupuncture and exercise training did not result in significant improvements.","output":"Physical Therapies for Psychosomatic Symptoms and Quality of Life Induced by Aromatase Inhibitors in Breast Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predictive factors for adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 are urgently needed. Data related to the applicability of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) for risk stratification in patients with COVID-19 are currently lacking.

In total, 42 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the University Medical Center Mainz between March 3 and April 15 2020 were included into this validation study and data were retrospectively analyzed. CFS was assessed at admission in all patients. Patients were followed for need for mechanical ventilation and time to hospital discharge. At admission, the median CFS was 3 (range: 1-7) and 14 (33.3%) patients were considered as at least pre-frail (CFS >3). 24 (57.1%) patients were discharged from hospital after a median time of 7 days (IQR 4-8). 12 (28.6%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation. In multivariable Cox regression analyses, higher CFS scores (HR 1.659, 95% CI 1.090 to 2.525, p=0.018) were an independent predictor for a higher risk of mechanical ventilation after adjusting for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index and quick sepsis-related organ failure score. Additionally, lower CFS scores (HR 0.554, 95% CI 0.312 to 0.983, p=0.043) were associated with earlier discharge from hospital.

In health, feedback loops are imperative in homeostatic mechanisms. However, in the unnatural cycle the feedback loops serve to reinforce (and in some cases amplify) negative problems.

The binding process is initiated when the receptor binding domain (RBD) of at least one protomer switches from a \\"down\\" (closed) to an \\"up\\" (open) state. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and two-dimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling calculations to investigate the transition between the two S-protein conformations with and without glycosylation. We show that the glycosylated spike has a higher barrier to opening than the non-glycosylated one with comparable populations of the down and up states. In contrast, we observed that the up conformation is favored without glycans. Analysis of the S-protein opening pathway reveals that glycans at N165 and N122 interfere with hydrogen bonds between the RBD and the N-terminal domain in the up state. We also identify roles for glycans at N165 and N343 in stabilizing the down and up states. Finally we estimate how epitope exposure for several known antibodies changes along the opening path.

The larger these fluctuations, the more annoying a sound is generally perceived. Many algorithms have been implemented to quantify these fluctuations and identify noise events, either by looking at transients in the sound level time history, such as exceedances above a fixed or time adaptive threshold, or focusing on the hearing perception process of such events. In this paper, four criteria to detect sound were applied to the acoustic monitoring data collected in two urban areas, namely Andorra la Vella, Principality of Andorra, and Milan, Italy. At each site, the 1 s A-weighted short LAeq,1s time history, 10 min long, was available for each hour from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. The resulting 92-time histories cover a reasonable range of urban environmental noise time patterns. The considered criteria to detect noise events are based on: (i) noise levels exceeding by +3 dB the continuous equivalent level LAeqT referred to the measurement time (T), criteria used in the definition of the Intermittency Ratio (IR) to detect noise events;(ii) noise levels exceeding by +3 dB the running continuous equivalent noise level;(iii) noise levels exceeding by +10 dB the 50th noise level percentile;(iv) progressive positive increments of noise levels greater than 10 dB from the event start time. Algorithms (iii) and (iv) appear suitable for notice-event detection;that is, those that (for their features) are clearly perceived and potentially annoy exposed people. The noise events detected by the above four algorithms were also evaluated by the available anomalous noise event detection (ANED) procedure to classify them as produced by road traffic noise or something else. Moreover, the assessment of the sonic environment by the Harmonica index was correlated with the single event level (SEL) of each event detected by the four algorithms. The threshold value of 8 for the Harmonica index, separating the noisy from the very noisy environments, corresponds to lower SEL levels for notice-events as identified by (iii) and (iv) algorithms (about 88C89 dB(A)) against those identified by (i) and (ii) criteria (92 dB(A)).","output":"Methods for Noise Event Detection and Assessment of the Sonic Environment by the Harmonica Index"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tension in the supply of highly consumed drugs for patients with COVID-19 (propofol, midazolam, curares) led the French government to set up a centralized supply of hospitals with distribution based on the number of resuscitation beds in March 2020.

METHODS: National declarative survey among pharmacists, via an online form (SurveyMonkey?), was conducted in April and May 2020. The analysis focused on quantities dispensed during the whole year 2019, and March and April of year 2019 and 2020 for the drugs subject to quota, and on their distribution in CCU and operating theaters. RESULTS: For the 358 establishments (47% public, 53% private), dispensations in CCU in March 2020 compared to March 2019 increased, respectively: propofol (+81%), midazolam (+125%), cisatracurium (+311%), atracurium (+138%), rocuronium (+119%); and decreased for anaesthesia: propofol (?27%), midazolam (-10%), cisatracurium (?19%), atracurium (?27%), rocuronium (+16%). CONCLUSIONS: Variation of dispensations between CCU and others was directly related to the increase of COVID patients in CCU and the decrease in surgical activity.

The project included a formative qualitative research study with 31 in-depth interviews with orthopaedic surgeons that was based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and an intervention that was developed to following the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) in a knowledge co-production workshop with ten public health experts that ensured that the theory based intervention was a culturally acceptable, practical and implementable intervention. The prescription of surgical prophylaxis was influenced by eight TDF domains from which workshop participants selected five to be included in the behaviour change intervention including, knowledge, belief in consequences (mistrust towards infection prevention and control measures), environmental factors (lack of prescription guidelines), professional role and reinforcement (a lack of appropriate follow up actions influenced prescription of surgical prophylaxis).

Several studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor that increases mortality and other adverse outcomes of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may bind dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) for entering cells of the respiratory tract. Besides, DPP4 takes part in immune system regulation. Thus, DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) may play a role against COVID-19. METHODS: We focused on the impact of DPP4i treatment on COVID-19-related outcomes in people with DM. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence on this topic. RESULTS: Retrospective observational studies provide inconsistent results on the association between use of DPP4i and outcomes of COVID-19. While two studies reported significantly lower mortality rates among patients with DM who received DPP4i versus those who did not, a series of other studies showed no effect of DPP4i or even worse outcomes. A meta-analysis of 7 studies yielded a neutral estimate of the risk ratio of COVID-19-related mortality among users of DPP4i (0.81; 95% CI 0.57C1.15). CONCLUSION: In the absence of randomized controlled trials, observational research available so far provides inconclusive results and insufficient evidence to recommend use of DPP4i against COVID-19.","output":"Disentangling conflicting evidence on DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19: narrative review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Future air quality will be driven by changes in air pollutant emissions, but also changes in climate. Here, we review the recent literature on future air quality scenarios and projected changes in effects on human health, crops and ecosystems. While there is overlap in the scenarios and models used for future projections of air quality and climate effects on human health and crops, similar efforts have not been widely conducted for ecosystems. Few studies have conducted joint assessments across more than one sector. Improvements in future air quality effects on human health are seen in emission reduction scenarios that are more ambitious than current legislation. Larger impacts result from changing particulate matter (PM) abundances than ozone burdens. Future global health burdens are dominated by changes in the Asian region. Expected future reductions in ozone outside of Asia will allow for increased crop production. Reductions in PM, although associated with much higher uncertainty, could offset some of this benefit. The responses of ecosystems to air pollution and climate change are long-term, complex, and interactive, and vary widely across biomes and over space and time.

The goal of this tutorial is to provide an overview of statistical considerations for analyzing observational data arising from EMA studies. METHOD: EMA data are collected in a variety of ways, complicating the statistical analysis. We focus on fundamental statistical characteristics of the data and general purpose statistical approaches to analyzing EMA data. We implement those statistical approaches using a recent study involving EMA. RESULTS: The linear or generalized linear mixed-model statistical approach can adequately capture the challenges resulting from EMA collected data if properly set up. Additionally, while sample size depends on both the number of participants and the number of survey responses per participant, having more participants is more important than the number of responses per participant. CONCLUSION: Using modern statistical methods when analyzing EMA data and adequately considering all of the statistical assumptions being used can lead to interesting and important findings when using EMA.

There is limited evidence about SARS-CoV-2 viral load in placenta. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load in placenta and clinical development of HDP after COVID-19 throughout different periods of gestation. MethodsThis was a case-control study in women with and without gestational hypertensive disorders (HDP) after SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed by RT-PCR during pregnancy. Patients were matched by gestational age at the moment of COVID-19 diagnosis. We performed an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in placenta. ResultsA total of 28 women were enrolled. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the third trimester and the remaining twelve patients in the others trimesters. Ten placentas (35.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, nine of them (90%) belonged to the HDP group versus one (10%) in control group (p=0.009). Those cases with the highest loads of viral RNA developed severe-preeclampsia. ConclusionThe presence of SARS-CoV-2 was more frequent in placentas of patients with HDP after COVID-19. There seems to be a relationship between high viral load in the placenta and the development of hypertensive disorders. We found SARS-CoV-2 viral load in placenta after birth in mothers infected at the first half of pregnancy, but with negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR at delivery.

Community pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare practitioners, which is further proven during the pandemic as they continued to provide direct patient care despite restrictions imposed by the government due to the pandemic. Due to the inaccessibility of other healthcare practitioners during this time, community pharmacists have reduced the burden on the healthcare system by diverting the influx of patients away from hospitals through triaging and screening patients. Community pharmacists have played various roles in supporting the healthcare system during COVID-19: delivering medications to patients, educating patients on telehealth services, assessing patients for renewal of chronic medications, performing consultations on minor ailments, clarifying misconceptions about COVID-19 treatments, and contributing to COVID-19 screening. Alongside ICU nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists, hospital pharmacists have been part of the COVID-19 efforts and their roles include management of drug shortages, development of treatment protocols, participation of patient rounds, interpretation of lab results for COVID-19, participant recruitment for clinical trials, exploration of new drugs, medication management advice, and antimicrobial stewardship.

This review aims to summarize the current standard therapies and the molecular properties of uLMS for novel molecular-targeted therapies. Although 65% of uLMS cases are diagnosed in stage I, the 5-year overall survival rate is less than 60%. The only effective treatment for uLMS is complete and early resection, and chemotherapy is the main treatment for unresectable advanced or recurrent cases. No chemotherapy regimen has surpassed doxorubicin monotherapy as the first-line chemotherapy for unresectable advanced or recurrent cases in terms of overall survival in phase 3 trials. As a second-line treatment, pazopanib, trabectedin, and eribulin are used, but their therapeutic effects are not sufficient, highlighting the urgent need for development of novel treatments. Recent developments in gene analysis have revealed that homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), including breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) mutations, are frequently observed in uLMS. In preclinical studies and several case series, poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase inhibitors showed antitumor effects on uLMS cell lines with BRCA2 mutations or HRD and in recurrent or persistent cases of uLMS with BRCA2 mutations.

Otolaryngological symptoms as nasal obstruction, loss of smell, taste dysfunction, sore throat, sticky mucus, and dysphagia are common in COVID-19 patients. Other vocal symptoms as dysphonia and phonesthenia are common in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study is to detect the occurrence of vocal symptoms in COVID-19 patients in Egypt and to investigate the videolaryngoscopic findings associated with these symptoms. A total number of 106 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were randomly assessed for vocal symptoms. The following epidemiological and clinical data were collected: age, gender, smoking consumption, general symptoms, otolaryngological and vocal symptoms as dysphonia and phonesthenia. Auditory perceptual assessment of voice and videolaryngoscopic examination were done. The occurrence of dysphonia and phonesthenia were observed in COVID -19 patients. Of the 106 patients, 84 patients (79%) were dysphonic, 20 (18.8%) patients were phonesthenic. The correlation of the different otolaryngological symptoms with dysphonia and phonesthenia were reported. A significant correlation was found between dysphonic patients and rhinorrhea, taste dysfunction, sore throat, and cough.

Despite their effectiveness in delivering services and improving outcomes for different chronic conditions, there is a dearth of understanding regarding CHW management of IPV. The purpose of this study is to examine knowledge, attitudes, practices, and readiness to manage IPV among a sample of CHWs (n = 152). Participants completed an online version of the Physician Readiness to Manage Intimate Partner Violence Survey (PREMIS), which was modified for CHW practice. Psychometrics of the newly adapted tool, along with empirical relationships between knowledge, attitudes, and readiness to manage IPV were examined. Most sub-scales yielded moderate to high reliability (0.70 < s < 0.97), some sub-scales had low reliability (0.57 < s < 0.64), and construct validity was established for several of the subscales. On average, many CHWs had low scores on objective knowledge of IPV (mean = 15.4 out of 26), perceived preparation to manage IPV (mean = 3.8 out of 7), and perceived knowledge of IPV (mean = 3.7 out of 7). About 56% of CHWs indicated having no previous IPV training, 34% did not screen for IPV, and 65% were in the contemplation stage of behavior change.

Allergy to PEGs is rare. Skin testing and graded challenge carries a high risk of inducing systemic reactions. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated skin prick test (SPT) results and in vitro reactivity over time to different MW PEGs and assessed cross-sensitization patterns in PEG allergy. METHODS: Ten patients with previously diagnosed PEG allergy underwent SPT twice with PEGs 26 months apart. Lower MW (PEG 300, 3000, 6000) were tested, followed by PEG 20,000, in stepwise, increasing concentrations. Cross-sensitization to polysorbate 80 and poloxamer 407 was assessed. SPT was performed in 16 healthy controls. In vitro basophil histamine release (HR) test and passive sensitization HR test were performed in patients and controls. RESULTS: Patients previously testing positive on SPT to PEG 3000 and/or 6000 also tested positive to PEG 20,000. Patients with a longer interval since diagnosis tested negative to lower MW PEGs and positive mainly to higher concentrations of PEG 20,000. Three patients developed systemic urticaria during SPT. Eight patients showed cross-sensitization to poloxamer 407 and 3 to polysorbate 80. All controls tested negative. In vitro tests showed limited usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: Skin test reactivity to PEG can decrease over time, but titrated SPT with increasing concentrations of PEG 20,000 can be diagnostic when lower MW PEGs test negative. To avoid systemic reactions, stepwise SPT is mandatory.","output":"Optimizing investigation of suspected allergy to polyethylene glycols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Saliva omics has immense potential for non-invasive diagnostics, including monitoring very young or elderly populations, or individuals in remote locations.

The purpose of the present study was to explore the potential mental health impact of this forced quarantine and widespread shutdown among small business owners and the self-employed. A semi-structured interview was employed among 14 participants from three different cities in China. Grounded Theory was employed to analyze the data using Nvivo11 plus. Based on a qualitative analysis, 9 categories of responses emerged to describe the experience and actions of participants towards the quarantine: enjoyment of life, emotional disturbance, hope, comparisons to others, social support, patriotism, making changes, and obedience. Further analysis suggested that the mental state of participants was either positive or negative depending on enjoyment of life, loss, emotional disturbance, and hope, and that these were impacted by intervening conditions (national measures, social support, patriotism), personal strategies (exercising, studying, comparisons to others), and personal consequences (making change, obedience). Rather than observing a linear pattern of negative outcomes, mental state was found to be variable in that positive outcomes were experienced earlier in the quarantine (making connections with family), negative states were encountered midway through the quarantine (fear of financial loss, anxiety), and more positive mental states (hope) emerged towards the end of the quarantine depending on intervening conditions, personal strategies, and consequences.

Methods: : A stepped wedge cluster randomized control trial will be conducted in three selected cities of China: Wuhan, Suzhou, and Shenzhen. Two districts have been randomly selected in each city, yielding a total of 24 registered hospitals. This study will conduct a rollout in these hospitals every 3 months. The 24 hospitals will be randomly assigned to four clusters, and each cluster will commence the intervention (optimized QI initiatives) at one of the four steps. We will conduct hospital-based assessments, questionnaire surveys among health care providers, community-based household surveys, and key informant interviews during the trial.

As such, chemokines play an important role in mediating pathophysiological events during microbial infection. In particular, CXCL9, 10 and 11 and their cognate receptor CXCR3 have been associated with the clinical course of several infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza. While CXCL9, 10 and 11 share the same receptor and have overlapping functions, each can also have unique activity in host defense. The lack of a preferred characterized animal model for SARS has brought our attention to ferrets, which have been used for years in influenza studies. The lack of immunological reagents for ferrets prompted us to clone CXCL9, 10, 11 and CXCR3 and, in the case of CXCL10, to express the gene as a recombinant protein. In this study we demonstrate that endogenous ferret CXCL10 exhibits similar mRNA expression patterns in the lungs of deceased SARS patients and ferrets experimentally infected with SARS coronavirus. This study therefore represents an important step towards development of the ferret as a model for the role of CXCL9, 10 and 11:CXCR3 axis in severe viral infections.","output":"Cloning, expression and characterization of ferret CXCL10"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ACE2 is a membrane protein that regulates the cardiovascular system. Additionally, ACE2 acts as a receptor for host cell infection by human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that emerged as the cause of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and has brought unprecedented burden to economy and health. ACE2 binds the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity and shows little variation in amino acid sequence meaning natural resistance is rare. The discovery of a novel short ACE2 isoform (deltaACE2) provides evidence for inter-individual differences in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity, and likelihood of developing subsequent Long COVID. Critically, deltaACE2 loses SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding sites in the extracellular domain, and is predicted to confer reduced susceptibility to viral infection. We aimed to assess the differential expression of full-length ACE2 versus deltaACE2 in a panel of human tissues (kidney, heart, lung, and liver) that are implicated in COVID-19, and confirm ACE2 protein in these tissues. Using dual antibody staining, we show that deltaACE2 localises, and is enriched, in lung airway epithelia and bile duct epithelia in the liver. Finally, we also confirm that a fluorescently tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike protein monomer shows low binding at lung and bile duct epithelia where dACE2 is enriched.","output":"Differential expression in humans of the viral entry receptor ACE2 compared with the short deltaACE2 isoform lacking SARS-CoV-2 binding sites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detection of small particles, including viruses and particulate matter (PM), has been attracting much attention in light of increasing need for environmental monitoring. Owing to their high versatility, a nanomechanical sensor is one of the most promising sensors which can be adapted to various monitoring systems. In this study, we present an optimization strategy to efficiently detect small particles with nanomechanical sensors. Adsorption of particles on the receptor layer of nanomechanical sensors and the resultant signal are analyzed using finite element analysis (FEA). We investigate the effect of structural parameters (e.g., adsorption position and embedded depth of a particle and thickness of the receptor layer) and elastic properties of the receptor layer (e.g., Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) on the sensitivity.

Methods: This is a retrospective study of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected HCWs and was conducted from 2 March to 31 December 2020. Data related to the presence of COVID-19 symptoms, mode of transmission, hospitalization, and mortality were collected from the patients medical records. Results: Of the 4462 patients tested for COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 203 (4.5%) HCWs were positive; of these, 125 (61.6%) were males, and the most common age group was <40 years. The most commonly encountered health professionals were nurses (74, 36.4%), followed by therapists/technicians (48, 23.6%), housekeepers (25, 12.3%), and physicians (21, 10.4%). The majority (184, 90.6%) of the HCWs contracted COVID-19 in the community, and only 19 (9.4%) were healthcare-associated infections. Of the infected HCWs, 169 (83.3%) had mild symptoms and were managed in home isolation. The most common symptoms were fever (128, 63.1%), body ache (124, 61.8%), headache (113, 55.7%), dry cough (123, 60.6%), sore throat (97, 47.8%), body weakness (97, 47.8%), and fatigue (94, 46.3%). Comparing males and females, there was a significantly higher number of female nurses; in contrast, there was a higher number of male physicians, housekeepers, therapists/technicians, and other specialty HCWs. A significantly lower number of nurses, therapists/technicians were infected in the 40 years age group compared to <40 years. Furthermore, a significantly higher difference was observed among non-Saudi nurses compared to Saudi nurses. No mortality was documented among the included HCWs. Conclusions: In the largest tertiary cardiac center in KSA, most HCWs who contracted COVID-19 developed mild symptoms; nurses and those aged <40 years were most commonly infected, and most infections were acquired in the community. HCWs adherence to mitigation measures outside of the workplace is vital to curb the current pandemic and decrease nosocomial transmission risk.","output":"COVID-19 Community Transmission among Healthcare Workers at a Tertiary Care Cardiac Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Vaccines against COVID-19 have the potential to protect people before they are exposed to the infective form of the virus. However, because of the involvement of pathogenic immune processes in many severe presentations of COVID-19, eliciting an immune response with a vaccine must strike a delicate balance to achieve viral clearance without also inducing immune-mediated harm. This Outlook synthesizes current laboratory findings to define which parts of the immune system help with recovery from and protection against the virus and which can lead to adverse outcomes. To inform our understanding, we analyze research about the immune mechanisms implicated in SARS-CoV, from the 2003 outbreak, and SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. The impact of how innate immunity, humoral immunity, and cell-mediated immunity play a role in a harmful versus helpful response is discussed, establishing principles to guide the development and evaluation of a safe but effective COVID-19 vaccine. The principles derived include (i) targeting the appropriate specificity and effector function of the humoral response, (ii) eliciting a T cell response, especially a cytotoxic T cell response, to achieve safe, yet effective, immune protection from COVID-19, and (iii) monitoring for the possibility of acute lung injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection post-vaccination in preclinical and clinical studies.

Small animal models that reproduce key elements of SARS-CoV-2 human infections are needed to rigorously screen candidate drugs to mitigate severe disease and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have reported that transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) viral receptor under the control of the Keratin 18 (K18) promoter develop severe and lethal respiratory disease subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge. Here we report that some infected mice that survive challenge have residual pulmonary damages and persistent brain infection on day 28 post-infection despite the presence of anti-SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Because of the hypersensitivity of K18-hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 and the propensity of virus to infect the brain, we sought to determine if anti-infective biologics could protect against disease in this model system. We demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma protects K18-hACE2 against severe disease. All control mice succumbed to disease by day 7; however, all treated mice survived infection without observable signs of disease. In marked contrast to control mice, viral antigen and lesions were reduced or absent from lungs and absent in brains of antibody-treated mice. Our findings support the use of K18-hACE2 mice for protective efficacy studies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 medical countermeasures (MCMs).

OBJECTIVES This study sought to determine the rates and clinical relevance of PMI using different definitions in patients with left main coronary artery disease randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in the EXCEL (Evaluation of XIENCE versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) trial. METHODS The pre-specified protocol definition of PMI (PMIProt) required a large elevation of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), with identical threshold for both procedures. The Third Universal Definition of MI (types 4a and 5) (PMIUD) required lesser biomarker elevations but with supporting evidence of myocardial ischemia, different after PCI and CABG. For the PMIUD, troponins were used preferentially (available in 49.5% of patients), CK-MB otherwise. The multivariable relationship between each PMI type and 5-year mortality was determined. RESULTS PMIProt occurred in 34 of 935 (3.6%) patients after PCI and 56 of 923 (6.1%) patients after CABG (difference -2.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.4% to -0.5%; p = 0.015). The corresponding rates of PMIUD were 37 (4.0%) and 20 (2.2%), respectively (difference 1.8%; 95% CI: 0.2% to 3.4%; p = 0.025). Both PMIProt and PMIUD were associated with 5-year cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.18 [95% CI: 1.13 to 4.23] and 2.87 [95% CI: 1.44 to 5.73], respectively). PMIProt was associated with a consistent hazard of cardiovascular mortality after both PCI and CABG (pinteraction = 0.86). Conversely, PMIUD was strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality after CABG (adjusted HR: 11.94; 95% CI: 4.84 to 29.47) but not after PCI (adjusted HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.35 to 3.67) (pinteraction = 0.004). Results were similar for all-cause mortality and with varying PMIUD biomarker definitions. Only large biomarker elevations (CK-MB 10 upper reference limit and troponin 70 upper reference limit) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS The rates of PMI after PCI and CABG vary greatly with different definitions. In the EXCEL trial, the pre-specified PMIProt was associated with similar hazard after PCI and CABG, whereas PMIUD was strongly associated with mortality after CABG but not after PCI.

This meant service users detained under the Mental Health Act were discharged at a higher rate than normal. We analysed whether this decision compromised the safety of this vulnerable group of service users. METHODS: We utilised a cohort study design and allocated service users to either the pre-rapid discharge, rapid discharge or post-rapid discharge group. We conducted a recurrent event analysis to assess group differences in the risk of experiencing negative outcomes during the 61 days post-discharge. We defined negative outcomes as crisis service use, re-admission to a psychiatric ward, community incidents of violence or self-harm and death by suicide. RESULTS: The pre-rapid discharge cohort included 258 service users, the rapid discharge cohort 127 and the post-rapid discharge cohort 76. We found no statistical association between being in the rapid discharge cohort and the risk of experiencing negative outcomes (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.72C1.8, p = 0.58) but a trend towards statistical significance for service users in the post-rapid discharge cohort (HR: 1.61, 95% CI: 0.91C2.83, p = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence that service users rapidly discharged from section experienced poorer outcomes. This raises the possibility that the Mental Health Act is applied in an overly restrictive manner, meaning that sections for some formally detained service users could be ended earlier without compromising safety.","output":"The effect of rapidly discharging psychiatric inpatients from Mental Health Act section during COVID-19: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report for patients with encephalitis treated with plasma exchange (PE) and fosphenytoin.

Consequently, an updated microscopic view of traffic shares is needed to understand how the Internet is evolving to capture both such shorter- and longer-term events. Toward this end, we observe traffic composition at a research network in Japan and a Tier-1 ISP in the USA. We analyze the traffic traces passively captured at two inter-domain links: MAWI (Japan) and CAIDA (New York-Sao Paulo), which cover 100GB of data for MAWI traces and 4TB of data for CAIDA traces in total. We begin by studying the impact of COVID-19 on the MAWI link: We find a substantial increase in the traffic volume of OpenVPN and rsync, as well as increases in traffic volume from cloud storage and video conferencing services, which shows that clients shift to remote work during the pandemic. For traffic traces between March 2018 to December 2018, we find that the use of IPv6 is increasing quickly on the CAIDA monitor: The IPv6 traffic volume increases from 1.1% in March 2018 to 6.1% in December 2018, while the IPv6 traffic share remains stable in the MAWI dataset at around 9% of the traffic volume.

Despite implementation of work-hour restrictions, residency remains a balancing act between patient care, surgical and clinical education, medical record documentation, and research endeavors. The added challenge of balancing these duties with life outside of the hospital further complicates the situation. Multiple studies have documented the stress associated with residency training, highlighting the prevalence of emotional exhaustion, detachment from people both in and out of the hospital, and a concerning rate of clinical depression among residents. Moreover, this emotional exhaustion has been shown to directly correlate with residents' clinical performance and abilities to carry out academic duties. More recently, feelings of isolation and detachment have been exacerbated by the necessity of COVID-19 precautions and change in clinical duties. The Accreditation for Graduate Medical Education (ACGM) now requires all residencies to include programming that focuses on resident well-being. Programs have implemented various strategies in an effort to help their trainees cope with the stress associated with residency and beyond. Despite the variety in approaches of programs, these initiatives have the similar objective of teaching resilience and the ability to navigate stressors in a healthy and effective manner.

The neurobiological mechanisms behind these are beginning to emerge, however the neurotropic hypothesis is not strongly supported by clinical data. The inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be responsible for delirium and other common acute neuropsychiatric manifestations. Vascular abnormalities such as endotheliopathies contribute to stroke and cerebral microbleeds, with their attendant neuropsychiatric sequelae. Longer-term neuropsychiatric syndromes fall into two broad categories: neuropsychiatric deficits occurring after severe (hospitalised) COVID-19, and long COVID, which occurs in many patients with a milder acute COVID-19 illness.","output":"Emerging Knowledge of the Neurobiology of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased psychological distress on a global scale, particularly for vulnerable people, including new and expecting mothers. We are still determining the magnitude of the toll on parents and their children. Methods: 516 pregnant people completed online questionnaires during the spring of 2020 (T1);296 of these people completed additional questionnaires approximately one year postpartum (T2). Participants reported on mental health, coping behaviors, and infant temperament. A principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to identify coping factors. Linear regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations among coping factors, maternal depressive symptoms, and infant temperament. Results: PCA revealed three factors explaining 40.53% of the variance in coping behaviors. The first factor included self-care behaviors (e.g., exercise, mediation);the second, numbing behaviors (e.g., increased screen time, eating comfort foods);and the third, reaching out for help behaviors (e.g., talking to a therapist or other parents). Engaging in reaching out for help coping behaviors was associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms from T1 to T2 (adjusted R2=.03, p=.02). This was most pronounced in participants who reported greater emotion regulation difficulties (R2=.07, p=.04). Further, increases in depressive symptoms from T1 to T2 were associated with higher levels of infant negative affect (R2=.08, p=.004). Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of providing socially focused coping and mental health services for pregnant people to ensure the well-being of new mothers and their children. Future work should evaluate trajectories of emotional development of children who were in utero during the pandemic.

In addition to worries about physical health, it also causes concerns about psychological and mental health. This research aims to explore predictors affecting psychological well-being during the pandemic using the 2018 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) RAND longitudinal data (N = 42,233) and the 2020 HRS COVID-19 module (N = 3,266). Demographics (i.e., gender, age, and education), psychosocial (i.e., personality traits), and health (i.e., comorbidity) variables were included in multivariate logistic and ordinary least square regression analyses predicting feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and lonely during the pandemic. Our results indicated that neuroticism was positively associated with all outcomes. Women were more likely to feel overwhelmed, stressed, and lonely compared to men. Age negatively predicted the overwhelmed and stressed feelings. Furthermore, the effect of depressive symptoms in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 on psychological well-being was assessed by conducting a latent growth curve model. Findings indicate that initial level and increasing change of depressive symptoms over four-time points (waves 11-14) were positively related to psychological feelings. A higher level of depressive symptoms at the initial level of 2012 and increasing reports of depression symptoms predicted higher rates of being stressed, feeling overwhelmed, and lonely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

PRA in the Lhasa Apso (LA) dog has not previously been clinically characterised or described in the literature, but owners in the UK are advised to have their dog examined through the British Veterinary Association/ Kennel Club/ International Sheep Dog Society (BVA/KC/ISDS) eye scheme annually, and similar schemes that are in operation in other countries. After the exclusion of 25 previously reported canine retinal mutations in LA PRA-affected dogs, we sought to identify the genetic cause of PRA in this breed. RESULTS: Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data of three PRA-affected LA and three LA without signs of PRA did not identify any exonic or splice site variants, suggesting the causal variant was non-exonic. We subsequently undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS), which identified a 1.3 Mb disease-associated region on canine chromosome 33, followed by whole-genome sequencing analysis that revealed a long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) insertion upstream of the IMPG2 gene. IMPG2 has previously been implicated in human retinal disease; however, until now no canine PRAs have been associated with this gene. The identification of this PRA-associated variant has enabled the development of a DNA test for this form of PRA in the breed, here termed PRA4 to distinguish it from other forms of PRA described in other breeds. This test has been used to determine the genotypes of over 900 LA dogs. A large cohort of genotyped dogs was used to estimate the allele frequency as between 0.07-0.1 in the UK LA population. CONCLUSIONS: Through the use of GWAS and subsequent sequencing of a PRA case, we have identified a LINE-1 insertion in the retinal candidate gene IMPG2 that is associated with a form of PRA in the LA dog. Validation of this variant in 447 dogs of 123 breeds determined it was private to LA dogs. We envisage that, over time, the developed DNA test will offer breeders the opportunity to avoid producing dogs affected with this form of PRA.","output":"A LINE-1 insertion situated in the promoter of IMPG2 is associated with autosomal recessive progressive retinal atrophy in Lhasa Apso dogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak resulted in severe health impact with the loss of many lives across the world. Pulmonary parenchyma suffers most from the brunt of the infection. However, evidence suggested a systemic involvement during the course of illness. Information on morphological changes of liver is sparse in the literature. We aimed to evaluate the pathological findings in liver by minimally invasive autopsies. METHODS: Post-mortem core biopsies of the liver obtained from patients who succumbed to (coronavirus disease 2019) COVID-19 disease were studied. Demographic findings, comorbidities and relevant laboratory tests were collected. Detailed histopathological changes were assessed. RESULTS: Liver function tests(LFTs) were available in 40 cases, and it was deranged in 80% cases. A spectrum of histological changes was observed. Macrovesicular steatosis and non-specific portal inflammation of mild degree were the common morphological changes. Features suggestive of vascular alteration were noted in more than half of the cases. These included increased portal vein branches, irregular luminal dilation and herniation of portal veins into the periportal hepatocytes. Additionally, we observed morphological changes attributed to terminal shock-related changes. CONCLUSION: The present study results highlight that liver parenchyma changes may be related to multiple pathogenic mechanisms. The presence of vascular alteration in portal tracts suggests derangement of hepatic vasculature related to systemic hypercoagulable state induced by the viral infection. It remains to establish if the histological changes are related to direct viral insult or to the systemic response caused by the viral attack.","output":"Evaluation of liver histopathological findings of COVID-19 by minimally invasive autopsies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Physical activity promotes healthy ageing in older people. Accurate measurement of physical activity in free-living environment is important in evaluating physical activity interventions. RESEARCH QUESTION What is the criterion validity of 1)an ActiGraph to identify physical activity at different intensity levels and 2)an ActiGraph and a smartphone to measure step rate? METHODS Community-dwelling older people aged60 were recruited. The index tests were using ActiGraph worn in different positions (i.e.,both wrists and hip) to measure physical activity intensity and step rate and using smartphone (i.e., Samsung J2 pro and Google Fit) worn in different positions (i.e.,trousers pocket and waist pouch) to measure the step rate. The reference standards were using indirect calorimetry (i.e.,CosMedK4b 2) to measure physical activity intensity and using direct observation for step rate. Subjects were exposed in different physical activity intensity levels (i.e.,sedentary:MET < 1.5,light: MET = 1.5-2.99, moderate:MET = 3.0-6.0, vigorous:MET>6) and step rates through walking on a treadmill at different speeds (i.e.,2-8 km) for approximately 30 min. Spearman's rho, ROC analysis, and percentage error were employed to report the criterion validity. RESULTS 31 participants completed the tests. ActiGraphs worn in different body positions could significantly differentiate physical activity intensity at the levels of \\"light- or-above\\" (VM cut-off = 279.5-1959.1,AUC = 0.932-0.954), \\"moderate-or-above\\" (VM cut- off = 1051.0-4212.9,AUC = 0.918-0.932), and \\"vigorous\\" (VM cut-off = 3335.4-5093.0, AUC = 0.890-0.907) well with different cut-off points identified. The step rate measured by direct observation correlated significantly with ActiGraph and smartphone (rho = 0.415-0.791). Both ActiGraph and smartphone at different positions generally underestimated the step rate (%error= -20.5,-30.3). SIGNIFICANCE A wrist-worn ActiGraph can accurately identify different physical activity intensity levels in older people, but lower cut-off points in older people should be adopted. To measure step rate, a hip-mounted ActiGraph is preferable than a wrist- worn one. A smartphone employing Google Fit generally underestimates step rate but it gives a relatively more accurate estimation of step rate when the older people walk at a speed of 4-8 km/h.","output":"A validation study of the use of smartphones and wrist-worn ActiGraphs to measure physical activity at different levels of intensity and step rates in older people."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even if European Union (EU) Member States are obliged to implement EU Directives 2000/54/EC on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work, national biosafety regulations and practices varied from country to country.

Continued feeding of milk or milk replacer to diarrhoeic calves is important, to prevent malnourishment and weight loss in affected calves. Indiscriminative antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated diarrhoea is discouraged, whereas systemically ill calves can benefit from systemic antibiotic treatment for the prevention of septicaemia or concurrent diseases. Ancillary treatments and specific preventive measures are discussed. Eimeriosis has a high economic impact on the farming industries due to direct cost of treatment and calf losses, but especially due to decreased performance of clinically as well as sub-clinically affected animals.

Many surgeons who provide these treatments belong to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgeons (ISHRS). AIMS: To investigate trends in surgical hair restoration treatment from both the surgeon and patient perspectives. METHODS: Patient epidemiological and surgical data from the ISHRS were combined with search trend data from Google to analyze changing trends in surgical hair restoration treatment. RESULTS: Worldwide Internet searches for \\"hair transplant\\" have increased from 2004 to the present. Follicular unit excision (FUE) has supplanted follicular unit transplant (FUT) as the most popular hair transplant performed.

Still, the genetic factors that facilitate their adaptation to a diverse array of hosts and vectors remain poorly understood. Mutations in the virus genome may confer a selective advantage for essential functions, such as transmission, replication, evading host responses, and movement within the host. Therefore, genetic variation is vital to virus evolution and, in response to selection pressure, is demonstrated as the emergence of new strains and species adapted to diverse hosts or with unique pathogenicity.

Thus, there is the need for robust detection and classification of emerging virus strains to ensure that humanity is prepared in terms of vaccine and drug developments. A point or stand-off biosensor that can detect and classify viruses from indoor and outdoor environments would be suited for viral surveillance.

However, to which extent RDV is able to modify various types of membrane ion currents remains largely uncertain. In this study, we hence intended to explore the possible perturbations of RDV on ionic currents endogenous in pituitary GH 3cells and Jurkat T-lymphocytes. The whole-cell current recordings of ours disclosed that upon membrane depolarization in GH 3cells the exposure to RDV concentration-dependently depressed the peak or late components of I K(DR)elicitation with effective IC 50values of 10.1 or 2.8 M, respectively; meanwhile, the value of dissociation constant of RDV-induced blockage of I K(DR)on the basis of the first-order reaction was yielded to be 3.04 M. Upon the existence of RDV, the steady-state inactivation curve of I K(DR)was established in the RDV presence; moreover, the recovery became slowed. However, RDV-induced blockage of I K(DR)failed to be overcome by further addition of either ,-methylene ATP or cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. The RDV addition also lessened the strength of M-type K +current with the IC 50value of 2.5 M.

Although the news media play a crucial role in shaping the publics notion of feminicides, empirical studies on the medias portrayal of feminicides in Colombia are scarce. The present study involved a quantitative content analysis of articles published in four Colombian newspapers to determine how they reported on feminicides from August 2019 to July 2020 (sample size: 139 articles, comprising 1798 paragraphs). The period under investigation allowed for a comparison of news coverage before and during the lockdown. By means of hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified four frames: gender-based inequalities and discrimination against women, perpetrators in front of the court, prehistory and course of events of the feminicide, and reactions of neighbors, eyewitnesses, and villagers to the feminicide. Our findings suggest that the four newspapers under investigation paint rather similar pictures of feminicides.

ESSs are designed to impart an electrostatic charge to the spray droplets with the goal of increasing deposition of the droplets onto surfaces, thereby promoting more efficient use of the disinfectant. The purpose of this research was to evaluate several spray parameters for different types of sprayers and foggers, as they relate to the application of disinfectants. Some of the parameters evaluated included the spray droplet size distribution, the electrostatic charge, the ability of the spray to wrap around objects, and the loss of disinfectant chemical active ingredient due to the spray process. The results show that most of the devices evaluated for droplet size distribution had an average volume median diameter  40 microns, and that four out of the six ESS tested for charge/mass produced sprays of at least 0.1 mC/kg. A minimal wrap-around effect of the spray deposition onto a cylindrical object was observed. The loss of disinfectant active ingredient to the air due to spraying was minimal for the two disinfectants tested, and concurrently, the active ingredient concentrations of the liquid disinfectants sprayed and collected 3 feet (1 meter) away from the spray nozzle do not decrease.","output":"Evaluation of electrostatic sprayers and foggers for the application of disinfectants in the era of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spectrum of childhood symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-2) infection is widening.

Methods: A questionnaire on the perception risk of physical subhealth was developed. Using a random sampling method, 785 people in the Anhui provincial physical examination centre were selected as the research participants. Of the questionnaires returned, 770 were valid, giving an effective rate of 98%. Firstly, the Pearson correlation coefficient method was used to study the correlation of 35 items in the initial scale, and then, polychoric factor structure analysis was carried out by using the Pratt D matrix to optimize the item structure. The Cronbach' coefficient method was used to test the internal consistency reliability, and a structural equation model was used to explore the construct validity of the scale. The discriminant validity of the scale was obtained by factor analysis. A general linear model was used to analyse the relationship between the clinical manifestations of physical subhealth and the level of risk perception, and the convergent validity of the scale was evaluated. Results: All the data of 35 items were significantly correlated at the 0.01 level. The correlation coefficients between a1 and a2, a3 and a4, b1 and b2, b2 and b3, c4 and c5, c5 and c6, c6 and c7, c8 and c9, d1 and d2, d2 and d3, e5 and e6, g1 and g2, g2 and g3, and g2 and g4 were greater than 0.6. The items with correlation coefficients greater than 0.6 were reduced by a Pratt D matrix. The resulting physical subhealth risk perception scale covers five factors with a total of 18 items. The Cronbach' coefficient of the scale was 0.889, and the Cronbach' coefficients of the five factors F1-F5 were 0.780, 0.825, 0.801, 0.736, and 0.704, respectively. Structural equation model analysis showed that  2/df = 3.43, p < 0.001, RMSEA = 0.08, GFI = 0.88, NFI = 0.84, AGFI = 0.84, and CFI = 0.88. Factor analysis showed that factors F1-F5 had significant correlations (p < 0.01), and the correlation coefficients were less than the corresponding square root value of AVE.

Conclusions: We propose a physical subhealth risk perception scale amounting to 18 items, which includes five dimensions: health knowledge (2 items), risk perception (5 items), trust selection (4 items), information channel (4 items), and social groups (3 items).

The study objective was to examine associations between teamwork and leadership factors and clinician burnout as the care burden increased over 8 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Across two California hospitals, cross-sectional surveys were administered to emergency department (ED) personnel in July and December 2020 (N1 = 328 & N2 = 356). Overall burnout (Overall, based on your definition of burnout, how would you rate your level of burnout?) and worsening burnout during the crisis (Compared to your level of burnout prior to COVID, to what extent is your current level of burnout worse, improved or the same?) were measured on a 5-point Likert scale and analyzed as binary variables. Burnout was defined as having at least some burnout (ie, reporting at least definitely burning out). Worsening burnout was defined as either burnout that had gotten much worse or gotten a little worse since before the COVID-19 crisis. These outcomes were assessed in relation to joint problem-solving (JPS), clear process and leader inclusiveness using logistic regressions. Models controlled for age, sex, race, location, tenure and shift, as well as county COVID-19 case burden using open-access data from John Hopkins Universitys Coronavirus Resource Center. Results: The sample across both waves consisted of 75 attendings (14.79%), 50 residents/fellows (9.89%), 38 advance practice providers (5.56%), 254 registered nurses (37.13%) and 90 other ED personnel (therapists, social workers, etc.) (13.16%). Burnout increased over time, where 32.22% reported burnout in wave 1 and 56.51% in wave 2. Worsening burnout also increased over time, 57.32% to 80.52% respectively. Clear process and leader inclusiveness were significantly associated with lower odds of burnout across both time points, 0.28 (p < 0.001) and 0.45 (p < 0.05) in wave 1 and 0.30 (p <0.01) and 0.35 (p < 0.01) in wave 2, respectively (Figure 1). Joint-problem solving was significantly associated with lower odds of burnout in wave 2 only, 0.60 (p-value < 0.01). All factors were significantly associated with lower odds of worsening burnout in wave 2 only, 0.45 (p < 0.01) for JPS, 0.29 (p < 0.01) for clear process and 0.37 (p < 0.05) for leader inclusiveness (Figure 1). Conclusions: During a prolonged crisis, communicating a clear process to ED personnel, and encouraging leaders to include staff in decisions may do more to reduce burnout early on. However, solving problems together and relying on staff interchangeably may continue to prevent burnout as time goes on and the burden of disease increases. When managing burnout among ED personnel, leaders should focus initially on providing structure, and then, reinforce strong teamwork to help their staff continue on.

This empiric prescription is based on historic trials that were comprised of mostly prevalent patients. Incremental hemodialysis is the process of performing <3 sessions of dialysis per week or limiting dialysis dose by duration at the initial onset of treatment to provide a more gradual transition, mimicking the progressive nature of kidney disease. Adding clearance contributions from residual kidney function is the standard of care with peritoneal dialysis but has not routinely been employed with hemodialysis. Accounting for residual kidney function accompanied by improvement in adjuvant pharmacotherapy, such as newer potassium binding agents and dietary modification, can augment dialytic clearances and allow for an incremental approach. Utilizing incremental dialysis has been associated with both preserving residual kidney function as well as improving patient quality of life. Barriers to this approach include concerns regarding patient acceptance of dialysis prescription changes, adherence to therapy, and provider factors that would require a restructuring of the current thrice weekly hemodialysis rubric. Candidacy for incremental therapy has shown the best outcomes when urea clearances exceed 3 mL/min and urine volumes are >500 mL/day, although these measures have been deemed conservative. A significant amount of retrospective and registry data has been supportive of initiating incremental hemodialysis and several pilot studies have shown the feasibility of implementing such an approach.

Results: : We performed longitudinal stool multi-omics profiling to systemically investigate the molecular phenomics alterations of gut ecosystem in COVID-19. Gut proteomes of COVID-19 were characterized by disturbed immune, proteolysis and redox homeostasis. The expression and glycosylation of proteins involved in neutrophil degranulation and migration were suppressed, while those of proteases were upregulated. The variable domains of Ig heavy chains were downregulated and the overall glycosylation of IgA heavy chain constant regions, IgGFc-binding protein, and J chain were suppressed with glycan-specific variations.

Its definitive diagnosis is made by PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. However, this diagnostic test has low sensitivity with delayed results. Hence, thoracic computed tomography represents an interesting alternative. The aims of this study were to assess the frequency of computed tomography (CT) lesions suggestive of COVID-19 and to compare the results of CT and PCR test. METHODS: a prospective study carried out over15 working days and involved 47 patients. These patients were recruited based on the presence of at least 2 clinical signs of COVID-19. Chest CT without contrast according to the LOW-DOSE protocol was performed. A PCR test on nasopharyngeal swabs was done in patients with signs suggestive of COVID on CT. A serological test was performed in case of a discrepancy between the CT and PCR results. RESULTS: thoracic CT was abnormal in 38 patients and normal in 9 patients. Lesions suggestive of COVID-19 have been identified in 32 patients. Two patients had lesions of non-specific pneumonia. Tuberculosis lesions were visualized in 3 patients. One patient had lesions of interstitial pneumonia. The mean DLP was 59 mGy.cm with extremes of 25 and 95 mGy.cm. Ground-glass opacity was present in 100% of COVID-19 suspects on CT. The results of the PCR test were the same than CT in 12 patients. The positive predictive value for CT was 37.5%. In 20 patients with COVID lesions on CT, the PCR test was negative with a false positive rate of 62.5%. In the patients with negative PCR test, 4 had a serological test for COVID-19 and this test was positive in 3. CONCLUSION: low-dose chest CT can reduce radiation exposure in COVID-19 patients who are at risk of cumulative dose due to repetitive exam. CT can identify lesions suggestive of COVID-19. It also enables the triage of patients by identifying other diagnoses.","output":"Tri et dtection du COVID-19 par TDM thoracique low-dose chez des patients tout-venant au service de radiologie de lh?pital de Fann (Dakar-Sngal)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Low rectal surgery remains challenging. New surgical stapler devices have been developed to counteract problems of impaired visibility and inability to get low into the pelvis. One of them is the Radial Reload (RR) with Tri-staple(?) Technology (Covidien, New Haven, CT, USA). The aim of this study was to assess the first impressions and experiences regarding handling of this new stapler device in low anterior resection procedures in living humans. METHODS A questionnaire, consisting of 27 statements concerning accessibility, maneuverability and visibility, was sent to 35 surgeons worldwide. RESULTS A total of 85 rectal surgical procedures, both open and laparoscopic, were assessed by 31 surgeons. In 97% of the procedures the surgeons agreed that the RR stapler device facilitated access in the low pelvis. The first stapler device firing achieved complete transection in 54% of the procedures. According to the surgeons' assessments, in 91% percent of the procedures the RR stapler device enabled creation of adequate margins. Visualization of the pelvic floor was reported in 93% of the procedures. In the surgeons' opinion, the RR stapler device was considered clinically acceptable in 93% of the procedures. In 79% of the procedures the surgeon preferred the RR stapler device over the stapler device they normally used. CONCLUSION This study showed that the first experiences with the RR stapler device of 33 surgeons in 85 low rectal procedures are positive.

Due to its invasive nature and risk of contamination for health care workers who collect the sample, non-invasive and safe sampling methods like saliva, can be used alternatively. Methods: A rapid systematic search was performed in PubMed and medRxiv, with the last retrieval on June 6th, 2020. Studies were included if they compared saliva with nasopharyngeal sampling for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the same RT-qPCR applied on both types of samples. The primary outcome of interest was the relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples (used as the comparator test). A secondary outcome was the proportion of nasopharyngeal-positive patients that tested also positive on a saliva sample. Results: Eight studies were included comprising 1070 saliva-nasopharyngeal sample pairs allowing assessment of the first outcome. The relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples was 0.97 (95% CI=0.92-1.02). The second outcome incorporated patient data (n=257) from four other studies (n=97 patients) pooled with four studies from the first outcome (n=160 patients). This resulted in a pooled proportion of nasopharyngeal positive cases that was also positive on saliva of 86% (95% CI=77-93%). Discussion: Saliva could potentially be considered as an alternative sampling method when compared to nasopharyngeal swabs. However, studies included in this review often were small and involved inclusion of subjects with insufficient information on clinical covariates. Most studies included patients who were symptomatic (78%, 911/1167). Therefore, additional and larger studies should be performed to verify the relative performance of saliva in the context of screening of asymptomatic populations and contact-tracing.","output":"Rapid systematic review of the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing on saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swabs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide in 2020. Notably, in the countries dealing with massive casualties, clinicians have worked in new conditions characterized by a heavy workload and a high risk of being infected. The issue of clinician burnout during the pandemic has attracted considerable attention in health care research. Electronic health records (EHRs) provide health care workers with several features to meet a health systems clinical needs. OBJECTIVE: We aim to examine how the use of EHR features affects the burnout of clinicians working in hospitals that have special wards for confirmed COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Using an online survey, we collected data from 368 physicians, physician assistants, and nurses working in six hospitals that have implemented EHRs in the city of Tehran in Iran. We used logistic regression to assess the association between burnout and awareness of EHR features, EHR system usability, concerns about COVID-19, technology solutions, hospital technology interventions, hospital preparedness, and professional efficacy adjusted for demographic and practice characteristics. RESULTS: The primary outcome of our study was self-reported burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 368 respondents, 36% (n=134) reported having at least one symptom of burnout. Participants indicated that the leading cause of EHR-related stress is inadequate training for using technology (n=159, 43%), followed by having less face-to-face time with patients (n=140, 38%). Positive perceptions about the EHRs ease of use were associated with lower odds of burnout symptoms. More interventions, such as clear communication of regulations; transparency in policies, expectations, and goals regarding the use of technology in the clinical workflow; and hospital preparedness to cope with the challenges of the pandemic, were associated with lower odds of burnout. CONCLUSIONS: The use of EHR applications, hospital pandemic preparation programs, and transparent technology-related policies and procedures throughout the epidemic can be substantial mitigators of technology-based stress and clinician burnout. Hospitals will then be better positioned to devise or modify technology-related policies and procedures to support physicians and nurses well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Training programs, transparency in communications of regulations, and developing a clear channel for informing clinicians of changes in policies may help reduce burnout symptoms among physicians and nurses during a pandemic. Providing easily accessible mentorship through teleconsultation and 24-hour available information technology support may also help to mitigate the odds of burnout.","output":"Using Electronic Health Records to Mitigate Workplace Burnout Among Clinicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Field Study in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first COVID-19 patient in New York (NY) was reported on March 1, 2020 Since then NY has become one of the largest epicenters in the world where the disease has been overwhelming the healthcare system Here I report how rapidly COVID-19 spread, and how the community responded during the first 30 days in NY Gathering reliable information quickly was important in the evolving situation Shortage of beds, personal protective equipment, ventilators, and staffing was observed Reducing the number of infections and increasing the efficiency of medical resource allocation have been two major strategies taken in NY It is important for Japan to accurately analyze the current situation, refer to answers in other parts of the world, and quickly establish strategy for clear goals that will lead to a \\"New Normal\\"","output":"Rapid spread of COVID-19 in New York and the response of the community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Given the unpredictability of a global pandemic and its rapid evolution, in March 2020 our 200- bed children's hospital began surge preparations, which would require rapid review and implementation across the system Our institution is the only quaternary children's hospital within an organization of 26 hospitals across the state and 47 nationwide We describe our process for rapid implementation of evolving guidelines in our system METHODS: A group of leaders within pediatric hospital medicine, critical care, neonatology, nursing, pharmacy and respiratory therapy organized a COVID-19 pediatric surge response team with executive leadership support This multidisciplinary team became known as the ?COVID Busters ?

In the absence of effective antiviral therapies, other host immunomodulatory therapies such as targeting inflammatory response are currently being used without clear evidence of their effectiveness. Because inflammation is an essential component of host antiviral mechanisms, therapies targeting inflammation may adversely affect viral clearance and disease outcome. OBJECTIVE: To understand whether the persistent presence of the virus is a key determinant in the disease severity during COVID-19 and to determine whether the viral reactivation in some patients is associated with infectious viral particles. METHODS: The data for patients were available including the onset of the disease, duration of viral persistence, measurements of inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and C-reactive protein, chest imaging, disease symptoms, and their durations among others. Follow-up tests were performed to determine whether the viral negative status persists after their recovery. RESULTS: Our data show that patients with persistent viral presence (>16 days) have more severe disease outcomes including extensive lung involvement and requirement of respiratory support. Two patients who died of COVID-19 were virus-positive at the time of their death. Four patients demonstrated virus-positive status on the follow-up tests, and these patient samples were sent to viral culture facility where virus culture could not be established.

As in many countries with restricted abortion access, women frequently seek abortions informally from pharmacies. METHODS We conducted 16 in-depth interviews in 2019 to understand the experiences and motivations of pharmacy workers who sell medication abortion (MA) drugs in Lusaka. RESULTS We found that pharmacy staff reluctantly assume a gatekeeper role for MA due to competing pressures from clients and from regulatory constraints. Pharmacy staff often decide to provide MA, motivated by their duty of care and desire to help clients, as well as financial interests. However, pharmacy workers' motivation to protect themselves from legal and business risk perpetuates inequalities in abortion access, as pharmacy workers improvise additional eligibility criteria based on personal risk and values such as age, partner approval, reason for abortion, and level of desperation. CONCLUSION These findings highlight how pharmacy staff informally determine women's abortion access when laws and policies prevent comprehensive access to safe abortion. Reform of clinical guidelines, public education, strengthened public sector availability, task sharing, and improved access to prescription services are needed to ensure women can legally access safe abortion.","output":"Treading the Thin Line: Pharmacy Workers' Perspectives on Medication Abortion Provision in Lusaka, Zambia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of goal-oriented behavior has caused many tech-industry leaders to invest considerable efforts into task-oriented dialog systems.

We investigated this in the UK Biobank study. METHODS: The UK Biobank study recruited 40-70-year-olds in 2006-2010 from the general population, collecting information about self-defined ethnicity and socioeconomic variables (including area-level socioeconomic deprivation and educational attainment). SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England were linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to assess risk ratios (RRs) between the exposures and dichotomous variables for being tested, having a positive test and testing positive in hospital. We also investigated whether ethnicity and socioeconomic position were associated with having a positive test amongst those tested. We adjusted for covariates including age, sex, social variables (including healthcare work and household size), behavioural risk factors and baseline health. RESULTS: Amongst 392,116 participants in England, 2658 had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 948 tested positive (726 in hospital) between 16 March and 3 May 2020. Black and south Asian groups were more likely to test positive (RR 3.35 (95% CI 2.48-4.53) and RR 2.42 (95% CI 1.75-3.36) respectively), with Pakistani ethnicity at highest risk within the south Asian group (RR 3.24 (95% CI 1.73-6.07)). These ethnic groups were more likely to be hospital cases compared to the white British. Adjustment for baseline health and behavioural risk factors led to little change, with only modest attenuation when accounting for socioeconomic variables. Socioeconomic deprivation and having no qualifications were consistently associated with a higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 2.19 for most deprived quartile vs least (95% CI 1.80-2.66) and RR 2.00 for no qualifications vs degree (95% CI 1.66-2.42)). CONCLUSIONS: Some minority ethnic groups have a higher risk of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK Biobank study, which was not accounted for by differences in socioeconomic conditions, baseline self-reported health or behavioural risk factors. An urgent response to addressing these elevated risks is required.","output":"Ethnic and socioeconomic differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection: prospective cohort study using UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Introduccin: La infeccin por coranvirus-2 causa la enfermedad conocida como COVID-19, que afecta el sistema ocular Objetivo: Ofrecer un referente terico en relacin con la influencia de la infeccin por coronavirus-2 sobre el sistema ocular Mtodo: En la Universidad de Ciencias Mdicas Guantnamo durante el primer semestre de 2020 se realiz una revisin bibliogrfica, donde se ejecut el anlisis de artculos originales y revisiones sistemticas que incluan informacin en relacin con la COVID-19 y el sistema ocular La bsqueda se efectu consultando las bases de datos Pubmed, Infomed y SciELO, sin restriccin de fecha, en los idiomas espa?ol e ingls Se utiliz el buscador Google Scholar y las palabras clave y conectores: COVID-19 AND ophthalmology disease;SARS-CoV-2 AND ocular damage, y los trminos en espa?ol La extraccin de datos se realiz segn una planilla que resumi las preguntas de inters de acuerdo al objetivo de la revisin Resultados: Se desarroll un texto dividido en los siguientes acpites: aspectos generales de la COVID-19, el ojo en la transmisin de la COVID-19, posible fisiopatologa del da?o ocular, manifestaciones oculares, historia natural del paciente con COVID-19 desde la perspectiva oftalmolgica, la teraputica de la COVID-19 y las manifestaciones oculares de la enfermedad, y el da?o biopsicosocial de la COVID-19 Conclusiones: Es posible la transmisin de la COVID-19 a travs de secreciones oculares, y durante sta se presentan sntomas y signos oftalmolgicos ABSTRACT Introduction: The infection of coronavirus-2 causes the disease known as COVID-19, which also affects the ocular system Objective: To offer a theoretical reference related to the influence of the infection with coronavirus-2 in the ocular system Method: A bibliographical review was made during the first semester of 2020 in the Universidad de Ciencias Mdicas in Guantanamo, where an analysis of originals articles and systematic reviews was carried out, all of them including information related to COVID-19 and the ocular system The search went through the consultation of the databases Pubmed, Infomed and SciELO, in English and Spanish, with no restriction on the entry dates The following key words and connectors were used in the Google Scholar search engine: COVID-19 and ophthalmic disease, SARS-CoV-2 and ocular damage, and its equivalent terms in Spanish The compilation of data was made according to a form that summed up the most important questions related to the purpose of the review Results: A text was written, divided in the following sections: general aspects of COVID-19, the role of the eyes in the transmission of COVID-19, possible pathophysiology of eye damage, symptoms, ophthalmological records in patients with COVID-19, treatment of COVID-19 and ocular symptoms of the disease, and the biopsychosocial damage of COVID-19 Conclusions: The transition of COVID-19 through the eye discharges is possible, and ocular symptoms during the infection can be observed","output":"COVID-19 and its consequences in the ocular system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe long-term care services and supports (LTSS) in the United States, note their limitations in serving older adults post-incarceration, and offer potential solutions, with special consideration for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic.

RESULTS: Skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, assisted living, adult foster homes, and informal care from family and friends compose LTSS for older adults, but their utilization suffers from access and payment complexities, especially for older adults post-incarceration. A combination of public-private partnerships, utilization of health professional trainees, and unique approaches to informal caregiver support, including direct compensation to caregivers, could help older adults reentering our communities following prison. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Long-standing gaps in US LTSS are revealed by the coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic. Older adults entering our communities from prison are particularly vulnerable and need unique solutions to aging care as they face stigma and access challenges not typically encountered by the general population.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome has the capability of gaining rapid mutations as the virus spreads. Whole-genome sequencing data offers a wide range of opportunities to study mutation dynamics. The advantage of an increasing amount of whole-genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 intrigued us to explore the mutation profile across the genome, to check the genome diversity, and to investigate the implications of those mutations in protein stability and viral transmission. We have identified frequently mutated residues by aligning ~660 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and validated in 10,000 datasets available in GISAID Nextstrain. We further evaluated the potential of these frequently mutated residues in protein structure stability of spike glycoprotein and their possible functional consequences in other proteins. Among the 11 genes, surface glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, ORF1ab, and ORF8 showed frequent mutations, while envelop, membrane, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF7b showed conservation in terms of amino acid substitutions. Combined analysis with the frequently mutated residues identified 20 viral variants, among which 12 specific combinations comprised more than 97% of the isolates considered for the analysis. Some of the mutations across different proteins showed co-occurrences, suggesting their structural and/or functional interaction among different SARS-COV-2 proteins, and their involvement in adaptability and viral transmission. Analysis of protein structure stability of surface glycoprotein mutants indicated the viability of specific variants and are more prone to be temporally and spatially distributed across the globe. A similar empirical analysis of other proteins indicated the existence of important functional implications of several variants. Identification of frequently mutated variants among COVID-19 patients might be useful for better clinical management, contact tracing, and containment of the disease.","output":"Characterizations of SARS-CoV-2 mutational profile, spike protein stability and viral transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a global public health crisis. Vital to the development of informed treatments for this disease is a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions involved in disease pathology. One lens through which we can better understand this pathology is through the network of protein-protein interactions between its viral agent, SARS-CoV-2, and its human host. For instance, increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV can be explained by rapid evolution along the interface between the Spike protein and its human receptor (ACE2) leading to increased binding affinity. Sequence divergences that modulate other protein-protein interactions may further explain differences in transmission and virulence in this novel coronavirus. To facilitate these comparisons, we combined homology-based structural modeling with the ECLAIR pipeline for interface prediction at residue resolution, and molecular docking with PyRosetta. This enabled us to compile a novel 3D structural interactome meta-analysis for the published interactome network between SARS-CoV-2 and human. This resource includes docked structures for all interactions with protein structures, enrichment analysis of variation along interfaces, predicted G between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants for each interaction, predicted impact of natural human population variation on binding affinity, and a further prioritized set of drug repurposing candidates predicted to overlap with protein interfaces?.

Here, we established two assays for screening PLpro inhibitors according to protease and anti-ISGylation activities, respectively. Application of the two screening techniques to the library of clinically approved drugs led to the discovery of tanshinone IIA sulfonate sodium and chloroxine with their IC50 values of lower than 10 M.

Utilisation of banana waste can mitigate the dwindling welfare of banana farmers in Kakamega County. Unlike India's preferred processing approach, on-farm management of banana waste was a cost-effective strategy compatible to Kenya given the Climate change and Covid-19 pandemics. Unfortunately, knowledge on fitting 7Rs denoted by reducing, rethinking, refusing, recycling, reusing, repairing and refilling strategy onto the banana waste generated;banana waste utilisation technologies;and challenges of on-farm banana waste management was scanty in Kakamega County. Therefore, this paper examined the influence of cost-effective banana waste management on the welfare of banana farmers in Kakamega County, Kenya. It particularly established the: on-farm and off-farm weight of banana waste;appropriate innovative on-farm banana waste utilisation;and on-farm banana waste management challenges experienced in Kakamega County, Kenya. Across sectional design was adopted. A purposive sample of 150 from 600 banana farmers with at least 100 banana plants was studied. Frequency tables and plates were used to analyse data Kakamega County. Primary data was complemented by Key informants and secondary sources. The results revealed that out of the 7Rs, reuse, reduce and refill (3Rs) facilitated banana waste management. The weights of peeled banana fruit and waste were 10.1% and 89.9% of the entire banana plant respectively. Banana waste was the driver of integrated organic innovative crop farming, animal husbandry and agro-forestry. Dogmatic beliefs and low agricultural innovation adoption rate hindered banana waste utilization. It is concluded that 7Rs minimized the quantity;enhanced utilization;and mitigated challenges of banana waste, culminating to the improved welfare of banana farmers. Adoption of optimal innovative cleaner banana production technologies to streamline the 7Rs was recommended to achieve sustainable banana waste management and improve livelihoods in Kenya.","output":"Cost-effective banana (Musa paradisiaca) waste management and the welfare of banana farmers in Kakamega county Kenya.

The purpose was to assess and triage potential COVID-19 symptoms and to reduce the number of calls to public health-care helplines. The device was used almost 150,000 times in a few weeks and was described by politicians and administrators as a solution and success. However, high usage cannot serve as the sole criterion of success. What might be adequate criteria? And should digital triage for citizens by default be considered low risk? METHODS: This paper reflects on the uncertain aspects of the performance, risks and issues of accountability pertaining to the digital diagnostic device in order to draw lessons for future improvements. The analysis is based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the EU and US regulations of medical devices and the taxonomy of uncertainty in health care by Han et al. RESULTS: Lessons for future digital devices are (a) the need for clear criteria of success, (b) the importance of awareness of other severe diseases when triaging, (c) the priority of designing the device to collect data for evaluation and (d) clear allocation of responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS: A device meant to substitute triage for citizens according to its own criteria of success should not by default be considered as low risk. In a pandemic age dependent on digitalisation, it is therefore important not to abandon the ethos of EBM, but instead to prepare the ground for new ways of building evidence of effect.","output":"You should see a doctor, said the robot: Reflections on a digital diagnostic device in a pandemic age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, data has shown that age-adjusted overdose death rates involving synthetic opioids, psychostimulants, cocaine, and heroin have been increasing, including prescription opioid deaths, which were declining, but, recently, reversing the trends. Contrary to widely held perceptions, the problem of misuse, abuse, and diversion of prescription opioids has been the least of all the factors in recent years. Consequently, it is important to properly distinguish between the role of illicit and prescription opioids in the current opioid crisis. Multiple efforts have been based on consensus on administrative policies for certain harm reduction strategies for individuals actively using illicit drugs and reducing opioid prescriptions leading to curbing of medically needed opioids, which have been ineffective. While there is no denial that prescription opioids can be misused, abused, and diverted, the policies have oversimplified the issue by curbing prescription opioids and the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of severely limiting prescription opioids, without acknowledgement that opioids have legitimate uses for persons suffering from chronic pain. Similar to the opioid crisis, interventional pain management procedures have been affected by various policies being applied to reduce overuse, abuse, and finally utilization. Medical policies have been becoming more restrictive with reduction of access to certain procedures, with the pendulum swinging too far in the direction of limiting interventional techniques. Recent utilization assessments have shown a consistent decline for most interventional techniques, with a 18.7% decrease from 2019 to 2020. The causes for these dynamic changes are multifactorial likely including the misapplication of the 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, the relative ease of access to illicit synthetic opioids and more recently issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, recent publications have shown association of dose tapering with overdose or mental health crisis among patients prescribed long-term opioids. These findings are leading to the hypothesis that federal guidelines may inadvertently be contributing to an increase in overall opioid deaths and diminished access to interventional techniques. Together, these have resulted in a fourth wave of the opioid epidemic. METHODS A narrative review. RESULTS The fourth wave results from a confluence of multiple factors, including misapplication of CDC guidelines, the increased availability of illicit drugs, the COVID-19 pandemic, and policies reducing access to interventional procedures. The CDC guidelines and subsequent regulatory atmosphere have led to aggressive tapering up to and including, at times, the overall reduction or stoppage of opioid prescriptions. Forced tapering has been linked to an increase of 69% for overdoses and 130% for mental health crisis. The data thus suggests that the diminution in access to opioid prescriptions may be occurring simultaneously with an increase in illicit narcotic use.Combined with CDC guidelines, the curbing of opioid prescriptions to medically needed individuals, among non-opioid treatments, interventional techniques have been affected with declining utilization rates and medical policies reducing access to such modalities. CONCLUSION The opioid overdose waves over the past three decades have resulted from different etiologies. Wave one was associated with prescription opioid overdose deaths and wave two with the rise in heroin and overdose deaths from 1999 to 2013. Wave three was associated with a rise in synthetic opioid overdose deaths. Sadly, wave four continues to escalate with increasing number of deaths as a confluence of factors including the CDC guidelines, the COVID pandemic, increased availability of illicit synthetic opioids and the reduction of access to interventional techniques, which leads patients to seek remedies on their own.","output":"Fourth Wave of Opioid (Illicit Drug) Overdose Deaths and Diminishing Access to Prescription Opioids and Interventional Techniques: Cause and Effect."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Selective elimination of respiratory motor neurons using intrapleural injections of cholera toxin B fragment conjugated to saporin (CTB-SAP) mimics motor neuron death and respiratory deficits observed in rat models of neuromuscular diseases. This CTB-SAP model allows us to study the impact of motor neuron death on the output of surviving phrenic motor neurons. After 7(d) days of CTB-SAP, phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF, a form of respiratory plasticity) is enhanced, but returns towards control levels at 28d. However, the mechanism responsible for this difference in magnitude of pLTF is unknown. In na?ve rats, pLTF predominately requires 5-HT2 receptors, the new synthesis of BDNF, and MEK/ERK signaling; however, pLTF can alternatively be induced via A2A receptors, the new synthesis of TrkB, and PI3K/Akt signaling. Since A2A receptor-dependent pLTF is enhanced in na?ve rats, we suggest that 7d CTB-SAP treated rats utilize the alternative mechanism for pLTF. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pLTF following CTB-SAP is: 1) TrkB and PI3K/Akt, not BDNF and MEK/ERK, dependent at 7d; and 2) BDNF and MEK/ERK, not TrkB and PI3K/Akt, dependent at 28d. Adult Sprague Dawley male rats were anesthetized, paralyzed, ventilated, and were exposed to acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH; 3, 5 min bouts of 10.5% O2) following bilateral, intrapleural injections at 7d and 28d of: 1) CTB-SAP (25 g), or 2) un-conjugated CTB and SAP (control). Intrathecal C4 delivery included either: 1) small interfering RNA that targeted BDNF or TrkB mRNA; 2) UO126 (MEK/ERK inhibitor); or 3) PI828 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor). Our data suggest that pLTF in 7d CTB-SAP treated rats is elicited primarily through TrkB and PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanisms, whereas BDNF and MEK/ERK-dependent mechanisms induce pLTF in 28d CTB-SAP treated rats.

Home-based telerehabilitation (TR) can address these issues. The current study evaluated the feasibility of an expanded TR program. Methods: Under the supervision of a licensed therapist, adults with stroke and limb weakness received home-based TR (1 h/day, 6 days/week) delivered using games and exercises. New features examined include extending therapy to 12 weeks duration, treating both arm and leg motor deficits, patient assessments performed with no therapist supervision, adding sensors to real objects, ingesting a daily experimental (placebo) pill, and generating automated actionable reports. Results: Enrollees (n = 13) were median age 61 (IQR 52C65.5), and 129 (52C486) days post-stroke. Patients initiated therapy on 79.9% of assigned days and completed therapy on 65.7% of days; median therapy dose was 50.4 (33.3C56.7) h. Non-compliance doubled during weeks 7C12. Modified Rankin scores improved in 6/13 patients, 3 of whom were >3 months post-stroke. Fugl-Meyer motor scores increased by 6 (2.5C12.5) points in the arm and 1 (?0.5 to 5) point in the leg. Assessments spanning numerous dimensions of stroke outcomes were successfully implemented; some, including a weekly measure that documented a decline in fatigue (p = 0.004), were successfully scored without therapist supervision. Using data from an attached sensor, real objects could be used to drive game play. The experimental pill was taken on 90.9% of therapy days. Automatic actionable reports reliably notified study personnel when critical values were reached. Conclusions: Several new features performed well, and useful insights were obtained for those that did not. A home-based telehealth system supports a holistic approach to rehabilitation care, including intensive rehabilitation therapy, secondary stroke prevention, screening for complications of stroke, and daily ingestion of a pill.

Objective: We investigated whether self-isolation due to COVID-19 and using cannabis to cope with depression were unique and/or interactive predictors of cannabis use during the pandemic, after controlling for pre-pandemic levels of cannabis use. Method: A sample of 70 emerging adults (mean age = 23.03; 34.3% male) who used both alcohol and cannabis pre-pandemic completed measures of cannabis use (i.e., quantity x frequency) and a novel COVID-19 questionnaire between March 23 and June 15, 2020. Pre-pandemic cannabis use levels had been collected four months earlier. Results: Linear regressions indicated self-isolation and coping with depression motives for cannabis use during the pandemic were significant predictors of pandemic cannabis use levels after accounting for pre-pandemic use levels. There was no interaction between coping with depression motives and self-isolation on cannabis use during the pandemic. Conclusions: Those who engaged in self-isolation were found to use 20% more cannabis during the pandemic than those who did not. Our results suggest that self-isolation is a unique risk factor for escalating cannabis use levels during the pandemic. Thus, self-isolation may inadvertently lead to adverse public health consequences in the form of increased cannabis use.","output":"Self-isolation: A significant contributor to cannabis use during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been established.

We compared clinical course and outcomes based on the presence or absence of thrombosis and then, specifically, cardiac thrombosis. The cohort included 11,537 COVID-19-positive admitted patients. Of these patients, 1,248 had non-cardiac thrombotic events and 1,009 had cardiac thrombosis (myocardial infarction) during their hospital admission. Of the non-cardiac thrombotic events, 562 (45.0%) were pulmonary embolism, 480 (38.5%) were deep venous thromboembolism, and 347 (27.8%) were stroke. In the thrombosis arm, the cohort's mean age was 64.5  15.3 years, 53.3% were men, and a majority were African American (64.9%). Patients with thrombosis tended to be older, with more co-morbidities.

Despite the wealth of technological progress at the time of the crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus: Virus that causes current Pandemic situation (COVID-19), the global population had long been exposed beforehand to an acute absence of essential medical devices. As a response, a new type of composite materials intended for rapid prototyping, based on layered silicate saponite (Sap), antimicrobial dye phloxine B (PhB) and thermoplastics, has been recently developed. Design/methodology/approach: Sap was modified with a cationic surfactant and subsequently functionalized with PhB. The hybrid material in powder form was then grounded with polyethylene terephthalate-glycol (PETG) or polylactic acid (PLA) in a precisely defined weight ratio and extruded into printing filaments. The stability and level of cytotoxicity of these materials in various physiological environments simulating the human body have been studied. The applicability of these materials in bacteria and a yeast-infected environment was evaluated. Findings: Ideal content of the hybrid material, with respect to thermoplastic, was 15 weight %. Optimal printing temperature and speed, with respect to maintaining antimicrobial activity of the prepared materials, were T = 215C at 50 mm/s for PETG/SapPhB and T = 230C at 40 mm/s for PLA/SapPhB. 3 D-printed air filters made of these materials could keep inner air flow at 63.5% and 76.8% of the original value for the PLA/SapPhB and PETG/SapPhB, respectively, whereas the same components made without PhB had a 100% reduction of airflow.

A key best practice to prevent and treat pressure injuries is to minimize prolonged tissue deformation by ensuring at-risk individuals are repositioned regularly (typically every 2 hours). However, adherence to repositioning is poor in clinical settings and expected to be even worse in homecare settings. Our team has designed a position detection system for home use that uses machine learning approaches to predict a patient's position in bed using data from load cells under the bed legs. The system predicts the patient's position as one of three position categories: left-side lying, right-side lying, or supine. The objectives of this project were to: i) determine if measuring ground truth patient position with an inertial measurement unit can improve our system accuracy (predicting left-side lying, right-side lying, or supine) ii) to determine the range of transverse pelvis angles (TPA) that fully offloaded each of the great trochanters and sacrum and iii) evaluate the potential benefit of being able to predict the individual's position with higher precision (classifying position into more than three categories) by taking into account a potential drop in prediction accuracy as well as the range of TPA for which the greater trochanters and sacrum were fully offloaded. Data from 18 participants was combined with previous data sets to train and evaluate classifiers to predict the participants' TPA using four different position bin sizes (~70{degrees}), 45{degrees}, ~30{degrees}, and 15{degrees}) and the effects of increasing precision on performance, where patients are left side-lying at -90{degrees}, right side-lying at 90{degrees} and supine at 0{degrees}). A leave-one-participant-out cross validation approach was used to select the best performing classifier, which was found to have an accuracy of 84.03% with an F1 score of 0.8399. Skin-bed interface forces were measured using force sensitive resistors placed on the greater trochanters and sacrum. Complete offloading for the sacrum was only achieved for the positions with TPA angles <-90{degrees} or >90{degrees}, indicating there was no benefit to predicting with greater precision than with three categories: left, right, and supine.","output":"Detecting Patient Position Using Bed-Reaction Forces and Monitoring Skin-Bed Interface Forces for Pressure Injury Prevention and Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the spring of 2020, the novel Coronavirus upended life in New Jersey, US, precipitating an unprecedented state lockdown of 9 million residents.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed a prospective, single-center aneurysm database to identify all patients who underwent endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms using the PED with the Navien distal intracranial catheter access platform. Cases requiring PED deployment within the Navien catheter were reviewed. Data was collected for patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, and technical details of the interventional procedure. RESULTS Eleven PED neurointerventions requiring intra-Navien PED deployment to fully open the PED were identified. Mean patient age was 55.59.9 years (range 37-76 years). Mean aneurysm size was 12.5 mm4.9 mm (range 2-42 mm). All aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation (anterior cerebral artery, n=1; supraclinoid, n=1; ophthalmic/paraophthalmic, n=6; cavernous, n=3; petrocervical, n=1).

In order to provide prophylactic prevention from the emerging and re-emerging viruses, vaccine is suggested as the most efficient way to prevent individuals from the threat of viral infection. Nonetheless, the highly pathogenic viruses need to be handled in a high level of biosafety containment, which hinders vaccine development. To shorten the timeframe of vaccine development, the pseudovirus system has been widely applied to examine vaccine efficacy or immunogenicity in the emerging and re-emerging viruses. METHODS: We developed pseudovirus systems for emerging SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and re-emerging avian influenza virus H5 subtypes which can be handled in the biosafety level 2 facility. Through the generated pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza virus H5 subtypes, we successfully established a neutralization assay to quantify the neutralizing activity of antisera against the viruses. RESULTS: The result of re-emerging avian influenza virus H5Nx pseudoviruses provided valuable information for antigenic evolution and immunogenicity analysis in vaccine candidate selection. Together, our study assessed the potency of pseudovirus systems in vaccine efficacy, antigenic analysis, and immunogenicity in the vaccine development of emerging and re-emerging viruses.

We investigate patients ability to discriminate COVID-19 fact from fiction from their news sources, as well as general COVID-19 knowledge, perceptions, public health practices, and their primary news sources in 258 adult patients at a primary health clinic in rural Michigan. Most of the population surveyed was able to correctly differentiate reliable COVID-19 public health information from fabricated information. However, only 55.4% of participants reported that they would be somewhat or extremely likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The most reported news source was mainstream broadcast television channels such as CBS and ABC. Our data support those older participants are better informed and more likely to practice safe public health practices than younger participants. Based on our data, we offer strategies for public health campaigns in rural communities, such as targeted interventions towards younger people and utilizing local television stations and community institutions to disseminate public health communications and health promotions. Public health interventions beyond education should be considered to mitigate the gap between COVID-19 knowledge and prevention behaviors.

In 2021, after deliberations between the ministries of health and of finance Covid-19 vaccines (administered from the beginning of the campaign on December 20, 2020 and up to December 21, 2022) were included within the compensation law. The current study aims to examine the objectives of Israels Vaccine Injury Compensation Law, at the time of its enactment, and to explore barriers to their fulfillment. These issues are especially relevant in light of the discussions held on the option for liability exemption which excludes the possibility of redress from the Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers in case of injury attributed to the vaccine, and considering the heavy burden of proof required in standard tort law. METHODS: The study employed a qualitative methodology which made use of both content analysis of relevant documents and in-depth interviews. RESULTS: In passing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Law, legislators sought to assist vaccine recipients who had suffered injuries by both lowering their burden of proof as well as establishing a short and efficient procedure for deliberating their claims. Furthermore, legislators believed that the assurance of compensation to vaccine recipients who had suffered injuries would help to encourage a high rate of vaccination compliance. An examination of the laws implementation over time revealed that the aforementioned goals were not attained. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the law since its enactment missed the opportunity to fulfill its original purposes to promote public health fundamental principles of fairness and solidarity. In addition, the adversarial proceedings as well as some of the laws provisions have the potential to undermine public trust in the States willingness to grant compensation for injuries that are attributed to vaccines and thereby subvert the laws pivotal objective of promoting trust and vaccine compliance. We suggest that allowing circumstantial evidence as to an association between vaccine and an injury, transitioning to administrative deliberation, making available to the public details of cases where compensation was awarded, as well as other possible emendations would help it better reflect the values of fairness and solidarity that underlying the law's purpose. These would also promote the level of trust in healthcare authorities which is essential to preserving high vaccine coverage.","output":"Vaccine injury compensation: the Israeli case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The current Coronavirus crisis is having disastrous effects for most B2B firms around the world.

This study aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 on sports and on daily activities in an Italian cohort of school children signed up in a football school. Methods: A total of 44 children from an Italian football school were enrolled. An online survey was distributed to these children and their parents in May 2020. The questionnaire collected information on the daily use of electronic devices and on the number of hours per week spent in activities regarding nonsport activities, highlighting the differences between those who interrupted sports and those who continued driven remotely by their instructors during the lockdown. Results: A total of 26 players continued practicing sports during the COVID-19 quarantine, while 18 players suspended their sports. Daily time spent on electronic devices increased significantly in both groups during the pandemic (p <.0001), regardless of whether they continued to practice sports (p >.05). On the other hand, in the group of children who interrupted sports, the time spent on activities regarding nonsport physical activity significantly changed during pandemic, with a 50% decrease (p =.0027) of those who spent more than 3 hr per week before the quarantine in favor of those who spent less than 3 hr per week. Conclusion: Quarantine increases screen time, which is a sedentary behavior that represents a risk factor for the health of children. Maintaining regular physical activity during quarantine due to COVID-19 was important to preserve some aspects of a healthy lifestyle in children, such as physical activity regardless of sport. While reducing physical activity and adapting it remotely, it is desirable that it be encouraged by experienced instructors in order to limit potential physical and psychological harm to children.

We conducted a survey in the US on food insecurity among low-income Americans during the early months of the pandemic. While we cannot estimate causal effects, we are able to show important associations between food insecurity and nutritional and economic assistance that highlight the need to ensure that those newly at risk for food insecurity are able to connect to resources. For example, our results indicate that those who lost jobs due to the pandemic reported the highest level of food insecurity and also the lowest engagement with food assistance programs. The SNAP expansion appears to be important only among groups with higher levels of income stability including non-minority households and those not experiencing a job loss. Thus, the SNAP expansion may not have had a meaningful impact on those most at risk for food insecurity. Finally, our data highlight the importance of school meal programs during normal times. Those who took advantage of school meals before the outbreak are more likely to have experienced food insecurity during the pandemic-related school closures.","output":"Food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from a survey of low-income Americans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: From the first report of the respiratory disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 towards the end of 2019, in Wuhan, China, to June 8, 2020, 6,931,000 people had been affected in the world, and 113,619 in Mexico, where there is a lack of literature describing the tomographic behavior of this disease throughout its evolution and its correlation with patient clinical data.

By 2020, COVID-19 becomes a major health problem all around the world. Due to the battle against COVID-19, there are some adversities that are encountered with. The most significant difficulty is the lack of equipment for the COVID-19 battle. Lately, there is not sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital workers on the front lines in this terrifying time. All around the world, hospitals are overwhelmed by the volume of patients and the lack of personal protective equipment including face masks, gloves, eye protection and clothing. In addition, the lack of nasal swabs, which are necessary components, that are used for testing is another issue that is being faced. There are a small number of respirators, which are emergency devices that help patients breathe for a short period of time.

However, first-line antidepressants are only fully effective for 33%, and only 40% of those offered psychological treatment attend for two sessions or more. Views gained from patients and primary care professionals are that greater treatment uptake might be achieved if people with depression could be offered alternative and more accessible treatment options. Although there is evidence that the Alpha-Stim Anxiety Insomnia and Depression (AID) device is safe and effective for anxiety and depression symptoms in people with anxiety disorders, there is much less evidence of efficacy in major depression without anxiety. This study investigates the effectiveness of the Alpha-Stim AID device, a cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) treatment that people can safely use independently at home. The device provides CES which has been shown to increase alpha oscillatory brain activity, associated with relaxation. METHODS: The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Alpha-Stim AID in treatment-seeking patients (aged 16 years upwards) with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms in primary care. The study is a multi-centre parallel-group, double-blind, non-commercial, randomised controlled superiority trial. The primary objective of the study is to examine the clinical efficacy of active daily use of 8 weeks of Alpha-Stim AID versus sham Alpha-Stim AID on depression symptoms at 16 weeks (8 weeks after the end of treatment) in people with moderate severity depression. The primary outcome is the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at 16 weeks. All trial and treatment procedures are carried out remotely using videoconferencing, telephone and postal delivery considering the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. DISCUSSION: This study is investigating whether participants using the Alpha-Stim AID device display a reduction in depressive symptoms that can be maintained over 8 weeks post-treatment.

METHODS: Individuals aged 18 years and older, diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM), and attended an ambulatory DM clinic formed the sample frame. They were invited to complete an electronic musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions and symptoms questionnaire booklet using a secured electronic email system. Individuals whose secured email box was not active at the time were discarded. Using the Central Person Registry number, a unique number assigned to all Danish residents, we linked the sample frame to different registries to learn more about non-responders. Non-responders were either individuals who did not respond to a single question and those who responded No to the first question about willing to participate. We calculated descriptive statistics for each characteristic. Univariate logistic regression models were conducted to determine the relationship between each characteristic and non-responder status. RESULTS: The response rate was 36% (n = 3812). Individuals with type 2 DM (OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.8C2.2)), secondary DM (1.9 (1.3C2.8)) or unspecified DM (2.1 (1.8C2.4)) were more likely to be non-responders than individuals with Type 1 DM. Also, individuals aged 70C79 (1.3 (1.1C1.6)) and 80 years and older (5.9 (4.5C7.7)) were more likely to be non-responders than 18C29 years old individuals.

A total of 1110 patients were studied from a publicly available dataset with 4-class severity scoring performed by a radiologist (based on CT images and clinical features). CT scans were preprocessed with bin discretization and resized, followed by segmentation of the entire lung and extraction of radiomics features. We utilized two feature selection algorithms, namely Bagging Random Forest (BRF) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), each coupled to a classifier, namely multinomial logistic regression (MLR), to construct multiclass classification models. Subsequently, 10-fold cross-validation with bootstrapping (n=1000) was performed to validate the classification results. The performance of multi-class models was assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy based on the 4x4 confusion matrices. In addition, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUCs) for multi-class classifications were calculated and compared for both models using \\"multiROC\\" and \\"pROC\\" R packages. Using BRF, 19 radiomics features were selected, 9 from first-order, 6 from GLCM, 1 from GLDM, 1 from shape, 1 from NGTDM, and 1 from GLSZM radiomics features. Ten features were selected using the MARS algorithm, namely 2 from first-order, 1 from GLDM, 2 from GLRLM, 2 from GLSZM, and 3 from GLCM features. The Mean Absolute Deviation and Median from first-order, Small Area Emphasis from GLSZM, and Correlation from GLCM features were selected by both BRF and MARS algorithms. Except for the Inverse Variance feature from GLCM, all selected features by BRF or MARS were significantly associated with four-class outcomes as assessed within MLR (All p-values<0.05). BRF+MLR and MARS+MLR resulted in pseudo-R2 prediction performances of 0.295 and 0.256, respectively. Meanwhile, there were no significant differences between the feature selection models when using a likelihood ratio test (p-value =0.319). Based on confusion matrices for BRF+MLR and MARS+MLR algorithms, the precision was 0.861 and 0.825, the recall was 0.844 and 0.793, whereas the accuracy was 0.933 and 0.922, respectively. AUCs (95% CI)) for multi-class classification were 0.823 (0.795-0.852) and 0.816 (0.788-0.844) for BRF+MLR and MARS+MLR algorithms, respectively. Our models based on the utilization of radiomics features, coupled with machine learning, were able to accurately classify patients according to the severity of pneumonia, thus highlighting the potential of this emerging paradigm in the prognostication and management of COVID-19 patients.","output":"High-Dimensional Multinomial Multiclass Severity Scoring of COVID-19 Pneumonia Using CT Radiomics Features and Machine Learning Algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Schistosoma antigen detection in urine is a valuable diagnostic approach for schistosomiasis control programmes because of the higher sensitivity compared to parasitological methods and preferred sampling of urine over stool. Highly accurate diagnostics are important in low Schistosoma transmission areas. Pregnant women and young children could particularly benefit from antigen testing as praziquantel (PZQ) can be given to only confirmed Schistosoma cases. This prevents the unborn baby from unnecessary exposure to PZQ. We present here the protocol of a diagnostic study that forms part of the freeBILy project. The aim is to evaluate the accuracy of circulating anodic antigen (CAA) detection for diagnosis of Schistosoma haematobium infections in pregnant women and to validate CAA as an endpoint measure for anti-Schistosoma drug efficacy. The study will also investigate Schistosoma infections in infants. METHODS: A set of three interlinked prospective, observational studies is conducted in Gabon. The upconverting phosphor lateral flow (UCP-LF) CAA test is the index diagnostic test that will be evaluated. The core trial, sub-study A, comprehensively evaluates the accuracy of the UCP-LF CAA urine test against a set of other Schistosoma diagnostics in a cross-sectional trial design. Women positive for S. haematobium will proceed with sub-study B and will be randomised to receive PZQ treatment immediately or after delivery followed by weekly sample collection. This approach includes comparative monitoring of CAA levels following PZQ intake and will also contribute further data for safety of PZQ administration during pregnancy. Sub-study C is a longitudinal study to determine the incidence of S. haematobium infection as well as the age for first infection in life-time. DISCUSSION: The freeBILy trial in Gabon will generate a comprehensive set of data on the accuracy of the UCP-LF CAA test for the detection of S. haematobium infection in pregnant women and newborn babies and for the use of CAA as a marker to determine PZQ efficacy. Furthermore, incidence of Schistosoma infection in infants will be reported. Using the ultrasensitive diagnostics, this information will be highly relevant for Schistosoma prevalence monitoring by national control programs as well as for the development of medicaments and vaccines.

Interviews and surveys were conducted from 6/17/2020 to 11/24/2020. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Qualitative themes were identified using thematic analysis. Frequencies were calculated to assess levels of depression and anxiety using the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) and types of information-seeking behaviors. RESULTS: Seven themes and 16 subthemes emerged. Themes of commonly reported stressors include postponing medical visits, decreased accessibility of getting medication, difficulty in receiving up-to-date patient focused health information and receiving dialysis supplies, and delays in medical appointments. Other stressors include losses of health insurance and income, and increased vigilance in behaviors to avoid contracting COVID-19. Fifteen participants had moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms and reported more frequent and severe panic attacks post-COVID. Participants sought emotional support from family, friends, and faith communities. They also commonly obtained information from news media and reported needing more transplant-specific updates about COVID-19, and frequent communication from their kidney and transplant specialists. LIMITATIONS: This convenience sample of individuals willing to share their experiences through a telephone hotline may not generalize to all dialysis and transplant patients; stressors related to COVID-19 for these patients continue to change. CONCLUSIONS: As the impact of the pandemic continues, needs-based interventions tailored for the kidney and transplant community including access to mental health resources, education, and support for care transitions should continue.","output":"Stressors and Information-Seeking by Dialysis and Transplant Patients During COVID-19 Reported on a Telephone Hotline: A Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In June 2019, a new epidemic spread throughout the United States with thousands of adolescents and young adults hospitalized with lung injury following e-cigarette use.

Despite this, clinical definitions of ILI play an important role in influenza surveillance. This study aims to identify clinical predictors of influenza infection in children 5 years old from which age-specific ILI definitions are then constructed. METHODS: Children aged 6C59 months with a history of fever and acute respiratory symptoms were recruited in the Western Australia Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (WAIVE) Study. Clinical data and per-nasal specimens were obtained from all children. Logistic regression identified significant predictors of influenza infection. Different ILI definitions were compared for diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Children were recruited from 2 winter influenza seasons (2008C2009; n = 944). Of 919 eligible children, 179 (19.5%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Predictors of infection included increasing age, lack of influenza vaccination, lower birth weight, fever, cough, and absence of wheeze. An ILI definition comprising fever 38C, cough, and no wheeze had 58% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 50C66), 60% specificity (95% CI, 56C64), 26% positive predictive value (95% CI, 21C31), and 86% negative predictive value (95% CI, 82C89). The addition of other symptoms or higher fever thresholds to ILI definition had little impact. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of ILI (presence of fever [37.8C] and cough and/or sore throat) was sensitive (92%; 95% CI, 86C95), yet lacked specificity (10%; 95% CI, 8C13) in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza-like illness is a poor predictor of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in young children but can be improved using age-specific data. Incorporating age-specific ILI definitions and/or diagnostic testing into influenza surveillance systems will improve the accuracy of epidemiological data.","output":"Clinical Predictors of Influenza in Young Children: The Limitations of Influenza-Like Illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The recent appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on the general population. Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable. We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020. It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes. It is an online registry. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact acquainted with another patient. RESULTS: As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities. The most represented form of RRT is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients. Symptoms are similar to the general population. A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units. The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids. Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids. Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.","output":"Situacin de la infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 en pacientes en tratamiento renal sustitutivo.

Preliminary data shows a rather fluctuating course of the disease from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to maternal death. However, it is not clear whether the disease increases the risk of pregnancy-related complications. The aim of the study is to describe the maternal and neonatal clinical characteristics and outcome of pregnancies with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: In this retrospective national-based study, we analyzed the medical records of all pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra Hospital (NJH), Kuwait, between March 15th 2020 and May 31st 2020. During the study period and as part of the public health measures, a total of 185 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, were hospitalized at NJH, and were included. Maternal and neonatal clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and treatments were collected. The outcomes of pregnancies included miscarriage, intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), preterm birth and live birth were assessed until the end date of the outcomes follow-up (November 10th 2020). RESULTS: A total of 185 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, IQR: 27.5-34), and median gestational age at diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection was 29 weeks (IQR: 18-34). The majority (88%) of these women had mild symptoms, with fever (58%) being the most common presenting symptom followed by cough (50.6%). At the time of the analysis, out of the 185, 3 (1.6%) of the pregnant women had a miscarriage, 1 (0.54%) had IUFD which was not related to COVID-19, 16 (8.6%) had ongoing pregnancies and 165 (89%) had a live birth. Only 2 (1.1%) of these women developed severe pneumonia and required intensive care. A total of 167 neonates with two sets of twins were born with median gestational age at birth was 38 (IQR: 36-39) weeks. Most of the neonates were asymptomatic, and only 2 of them tested positive on day 5 by nasopharyngeal swab testing. CONCLUSIONS: In this national-based study, most of the pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed mild symptoms. Although mother-to-child vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible, COVID-19 infection during pregnancy may not lead to unfavorable maternal and neonatal outcomes.","output":"Maternal and perinatal characteristics and outcomes of pregnancies complicated with COVID-19 in Kuwait"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to evaluate the activity, resistance, clonality of MIC distribution, and the correlation between virulence and resistance genes and biofilm formation of omadacycline (OMC) in clinics for Streptococcus agalactiae isolates from China. 162 isolates were collected retrospectively in China.

Two-week repeated and 13-week subchronic inhalation exposures of F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice to ADA were conducted to determine the toxicity of inhaled ADA. The mean air concentrations of ADA in the 2-week studies were 207, 102, 52, 9.4, or 2.0 mg/m3. No exposure-related mortality nor abnormal clinical signs were observed in rats or mice during or after exposure. The terminal body weights were slightly depressed in the highest exposure group. Liver weights were lower in male rats exposed to 200 mg ADA/m3. No significant lesions were noted on either gross or histologic evaluation of rats or mice. In the 13-week subchronic study, the mean air concentrations of ADA were 204, 100, or 50 mg/m3. No mortality or clinical signs related to exposure were observed. The terminal body weights of exposed rats were not significantly different from those of control rats but were significantly depressed in mice exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. No histopathological lesions were noted in mice. Lung weights were increased and enlarged mediastinal and/or tracheobronchial lymph nodes were noted in rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3. No exposure-related lesions were observed microscopically in rats exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. All rats in the 50 mg DNA/m3 exposure group only had lung lesions that consisted of perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes and a multifocal type II cell hyperplasia, suggesting a possible immune reaction to an antigen in the lung. Viral titers for rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3 were negative for Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice, which produce similar lesions. The possibility of an unknown viral antigen causing this lesion cannot be eliminated. Lung tissue from male rats was analyzed for ADA and biurea, the major metabolite of ADA. No ADA was detected. The amount of biurea in the lungs increased nonlinearly with increasing exposure concentration, suggesting that clearance was somewhat impaired with repeated exposures. However, even at the highest exposure concentration, this amount of biurea was less than 1% of the estimated total ADA deposited over the exposure period. In summary, ADA is rapidly cleared from the lungs, even when inhaled at concentrations up to 200 mg/m3. Exposure to ADA for up to 13 weeks did not appear to be toxic to rodents.","output":"Effect of inhaled azodicarbonamide on F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice with 2-week and 13-week inhalation exposures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is a disease characterized by a range of clinical syndromes including variable degrees of respiratory symptoms from mild respiratory illness and severe interstitial pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, coagulopathies, and multiorgan dysfunction. This virus carries the potential to manifest in a wide range of pulmonary findings and hypoxemias, from mild respiratory symptoms to more severe syndromes, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. The rapid accumulation of evidence and persistent gaps in knowledge related to the virus presents a host of challenges for clinicians. This creates a complex environment for clinical decision-making. OBJECTIVE: To examine oxygenation strategies in critically ill patients with hypoxia who are hospitalized with COVID-19. DISCUSSION: These proposed strategies may help to improve the respiratory status and oxygenation of those affected by COVID-19. However, additional high-quality research is needed to provide further evidence for improved respiratory management strategies. Areas of future research should focus on improving understanding of the inflammatory and clotting processes associated with the virus, particularly in the lungs. High-level evidence and randomized controlled trials should target the most effective strategies for improving oxygenation, time requiring mechanical ventilation, and survival for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 presenting with hypoxemia.","output":"Oxygenation Strategies in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The opioid overdose epidemic in Canada and the United States has become a public health crisis - with exponential increases in opioid-related morbidity and mortality. Recently, there has been an increasing body of evidence focusing on the opioid-sparing effects of medical cannabis use (reduction of opioid use and reliance), and medical cannabis as a potential alternative treatment for chronic pain. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of medical cannabis authorization on opioid use (oral morphine equivalent; OME) between 2013 and 2018 in Alberta, Canada. METHODS: All adult patients defined as chronic opioid users who were authorized medical cannabis by their health care provider in Alberta, Canada from 2013 to 2018 were propensity score matched to non-authorized chronic opioid using controls. A total of 5373 medical cannabis patients were matched to controls, who were all chronic opioid users. The change in the weekly average OME of opioid drugs for medical cannabis patients relative to controls was measured. Interrupted time series (ITS) analyses was used to assess the trend change in OME during the 26 weeks (6 months) before and 52 weeks (1 year) after the authorization of medical cannabis among adult chronic opioid users. RESULTS: Average age was 52 years and 54% were female. Patients on low dose opioids (< 50 OME) had an increase in their weekly OME per week (absolute increase of 112.1 OME, 95% CI: 104.1 to 120.3); whereas higher dose users (OME > 100), showed a significant decrease over 6 months (? 435.5, 95% CI: ? 596.8 to ? 274.2) compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: This short-term study found that medical cannabis authorization showed intermediate effects on opioid use, which was dependent on initial opioid use. Greater observations of changes in OME appear to be in those patients who were on a high dosage of opioids (OME > 100); however, continued surveillance of patients utilizing both opioids and medical cannabis is warranted by clinicians to understand the long-term potential benefits and any harms of ongoing use.

This prospective observational study sought to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a standardised cadaveric emergency urology simulation course aimed at improving operative confidence and competence prior to independent on-call practice in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A two-day cadaveric emergency urology simulation course supported by the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) was implemented at two pilot centres. All delegates that undertook one of the initial series of courses were invited to complete online pre- and post-course questionnaires relating to prior operative experience, documented competence and perceived confidence in being able to perform specific emergency procedures independently. Primary outcome was a self-reported confidence score selected from a linear numeric scale ranging from 1 (not at all confident to perform a given procedure independently) to 10 (fully confident). Statistical analysis was undertaken using SPSS Statistics for Mac Version 25 and the paired students t-test used to compare mean pre- and post-course scores. RESULTS: One hundred and four delegates undertook the course during the study period. Of these, 85 (81.7%) completed the pre-course survey and 67 (64.4%) completed the post-course survey, with 61 (58.7%) completing both.

There has been an outbreak of PDCoV in worldwide since 2014, causing significant economic losses in the pig industry. The interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral response is an important component of virus-host interactions and plays an essential role in inhibiting virus infection. However, the mechanism of PDCoV escaping the porcine immune surveillance is unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that the PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein antagonizes porcine IFN- production after vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection or poly(I:C) stimulation. PDCoV N protein also suppressed the activation of porcine IFN- promoter when it was stimulated by porcine RLR signaling molecules. PDCoV N protein targeted porcine retinoic acid-inducible gene I (pRIG-I) and porcine TNF receptor associated factor 3 (pTRAF3) by directly interacting with them. The N-terminal region (1C246 aa) of PDCoV N protein was important for interacting with pRIG-I and interfere its function. We confirmed that PDCoV N antagonizes IFN- production by associating with pRIG-I to impede it from binding double-stranded RNA. Furthermore, porcine Riplet (pRiplet) was an important activator for pRIG-I by mediating the K63-linked polyubiquitination. However, PDCoV N protein restrained the pRiplet binding pRIG-I to inhibit pRIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination. Taken together, our results revealed a novel mechanism by which PDCoV N protein interferes with the early activation of pRIG-I in the host antiviral response.

In addition, the design that is used in this study is A Case Study with Qualitative Approach and the research subjects are lectures and students who are involved in online learning process. Moreover, the results of this study showed that it has been found that there are five (5) sub themes that bring on two (2) main themes that is the limitation within the implementation of Emergency Nursing Clinical Practice and the alternative solutions during online -based learning of Emergency Nursing. In summary, the students feel unsatisfied and a little disappointed towards the subject of clinical practice through online learning. The efforts and modifications are needed in order to anticipate the problems that might be occur during the online learning processes. A good cooperation and coordination are needed among teacher and students so that it can maximize the process of online learning.","output":"Problem Solving in the Limitations of the Implementation of Online-Based Emergency Nursing Clinical Practice: A Phenomenological Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that causes coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there is no evidence that pregnant women are more vulnerable to COVID-19. All concerns and anticipated risks are related to the potential impact of COVID-19 on perinatal outcomes, so pregnant women require special attention in relation to the preventive measures, diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus disease. Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) belong to the group of high perinatal risk and need timely medical assistance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a necessity in temporary changes of approaches to diagnosing GSD and pregnancy care before and after delivery in women with GSD. The purpose of our review is to present and analyze all available GSD screening recommendations, updated and published in various countries in response to the coronavirus pandemic, at the time of publication of this article. It seems that there is no single universal strategy to achieve a reasonable balance. In this regard, it is necessary to develop new national algorithms for GSD screening, taking into account both demographic factors and the features and capabilities of our health system. We believe that the knowledge and experience achieved as a result of these changes will lead to the revision and improvement of national and international recommendations.","output":"[Screening for gestational diabetes due to of the COVID-19 pandemic]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of December 31, 2019, initial reports circulated internationally of an unusual cluster of pneumonia of unknown cause in China.

Intensive contact tracing and infection control measures contained the first two clusters in the country. However, the dynamic of the first wave gained momentum as of March, and by mid-June 2020 over 190,000 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported to the Robert Koch Institute. This article examines these cases as part of a retrospective descriptive analysis focused on disease severity. Most cases (80%) were mild and two thirds of the cases were younger than 60 years (median age: 50 years). Severe cases were primarily reported among men aged 60 or over who had at least one risk factor (particularly cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurological disorders and/or lung diseases). Cases between the ages of 40 and 59 years had the longest interval between symptom onset and hospitalisation (median: six days) and C if admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) C also the longest ICU stay (median: eleven days).

Analyses of TCR repertoires via deep learning (DL) methods have successfully diagnosed cancers and infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019. However, few studies have used DL to analyze BCR repertoires. In this study, we collected IgG H chain Ab repertoires from 276 healthy control subjects and 326 patients with various infections. We then extracted a comprehensive feature set consisting of 10 subsets of repertoire-level features and 160 sequence-level features and tested whether these features can distinguish between infected individuals and healthy control subjects. Finally, we developed an ensemble DL model, namely, DL method for infection diagnosis (https://github.com/chenyuan0510/DeepID), and used this model to differentiate between the infected and healthy individuals. Four subsets of repertoire-level features and four sequence-level features were selected because of their excellent predictive performance. The DL method for infection diagnosis outperformed traditional machine learning methods in distinguishing between healthy and infected samples (area under the curve = 0.9883) and achieved a multiclassification accuracy of 0.9104. We also observed differences between the healthy and infected groups in V genes usage, clonal expansion, the complexity of reads within clone, the physical properties in the  region, and the local flexibility of the CDR3 amino acid sequence.

To apply the technology, either quarantine authorities should provide the location history of patients with COVID-19, or all users should provide their own location history. This inevitably exposes either the patients location history or the personal location history of other users. Thus, a privacy issue arises where the public good (via information release) comes in conflict with privacy exposure risks. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing system that does not expose the location information of the patient with COVID-19 to other users of the system, or the location information of the users to the quarantine authorities. METHODS: We propose a new protocol called PRivacy Oriented Technique for Epidemic Contact Tracing (PROTECT) that securely shares location information of patients with users by using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren homomorphic encryption scheme, along with a new, secure proximity computation method. RESULTS: We developed a mobile app for the end-user and a web service for the quarantine authorities by applying the proposed method, and we verified their effectiveness. The proposed app and web service compute the existence of intersections between the encrypted location history of patients with COVID-19 released by the quarantine authorities and that of the user saved on the users local device. We also found that this contact tracing smartphone app can identify whether the user has been in contact with such patients within a reasonable time. CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed method for contact tracing shares location information by using homomorphic encryption, without exposing the location information of patients with COVID-19 and other users. Homomorphic encryption is challenging to apply to practical issues despite its high security value. In this study, however, we have designed a system using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren scheme that is applicable to a reasonable size and developed it to an operable format. The developed app and web service can help contact tracing for not only the COVID-19 pandemic but also other epidemics.","output":"Privacy-Oriented Technique for COVID-19 Contact Tracing (PROTECT) Using Homomorphic Encryption: Design and Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the SEIR model is modified.

The paper offers two additional harm-based arguments that, together with the herd immunity argument, consolidates our moral obligation. First, we argue that individuals should themselves aim not to expose others to risk of harm, and that this consideration becomes stronger the more non-vaccinated people there are, i.e., the further we are below herd immunity. Second, we elaborate on two pragmatic reasons to vaccinate beyond the realization of herd immunity, pertaining to instability of vaccination rates and population heterogeneity, and argue that vaccinating above the threshold should serve as a precautionary measure for buttressing herd immunity. We also show that considerations of harm have normative primacy in establishing this obligation over considerations of fairness.

Most of the virus was neutralized in the first 2C3 min of a reversible reaction, which was followed by a second phase with a decreased neutralization rate and, in some cases, by a persistent fraction, which was a function of the MAb and of the antibody-to-virus ratio. Neutralization of TGEV is a specific event that requires the location of the epitope involved in the neutralization in the appropriate structural context, which is present in the wild-type virus but not in certain MAb escaping mutants. In neutralization of TGEV by binary combinations of MAbs specific for the same or for different antigenic sites, either no cooperation or a synergistic effect, respectively, was observed. Mechanisms of TGEV neutralization by MAbs were characterized at high, intermediate, and low antibody-to-virus ratios. Under these conditions, mainly three steps of the replication cycle were inhibited: binding of virus to the cell, internalization, and a step that takes place after internalization. In addition, virus aggregation could be responsible for the neutralization of 10 to 20% of virus infectivity.","output":"Mechanisms of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus neutralization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background This study aimed to describe the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from Wuhan to rural villages in the Hubei Province Methods The analysis revealed the following: (1) COVID-19 spread from Wuhan to other cities and rural areas in Hubei, but the disease did not become widespread in rural villages because of strict prevention measures and urbanization;(2) according to the fluctuation in the number of confirmed cases reported in Hubei after January 23, 2020, we inferred that the infected patients on the same day will become ill during the next 20 days;(3) the advanced traffic system facilitates the direct spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan to counties, towns, and villages in the Hubei Province Results There is a low possibility of COVID-19 spread from prefecture-level cities to rural areas Conclusions The findings imply that the government should limit the travelers from the cities to the rural areas, pay more attention to the prevention and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in cities, and appropriately prolong the isolated observation period of travelers ?

Similarly, long-term management practices for patients with CeD are also unknown in this region. AIMS: This study aimed to explore the perceptions and practices of Australasian pediatric gastroenterologists in diagnosing and managing patients with CeD. METHODS: Australasian pediatric gastroenterologists and trainees were invited to complete an anonymous online survey over a 3-week period. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 28 respondents, 24 from Australia and four from New Zealand. Tissue transglutaminase antibody IgA was the most frequently ordered initial serologic test. Fifteen (54%) respondents relied on duodenal biopsies for the confirmation of CeD, six (21%) followed the ESPGHAN guidelines and the remaining seven offered either biopsy confirmation or no-biopsy diagnosis according to the parents' wishes. Following diagnosis, five (18%) respondents discharged patients from care, three (11%) discharged patients after one follow-up visit, one (4%) reviewed patients for 12 months, six (21%) reviewed patients until celiac antibodies normalized and children were clinically asymptomatic, and 13 (46%) reviewed patients until transition to adult care. CONCLUSION: Tissue transglutaminase antibody IgA was the most common initial serologic test ordered by this group of Australasian pediatric gastroenterologists.

Methods: COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests, case age distribution, and the difference between 2020 all-cause mortality and the average mortality of the previous 5 years were compared across nations. Patterns in cell phone mobility data, testing strategies, and seniors care home deaths were also compared. Data for each nation were based on publicly available sources as of July 31, 2020. Results: Compared with its Nordic peers, Sweden had a higher incidence rate across all ages, a higher COVID-19-related death rate only partially explained by population demographics, a higher death rate in seniors care, and higher all-cause mortality. Sweden had approximately half as much mobility change as its Nordic neighbours until April and followed similar rates as its neighbours from April to July. Denmark led its Nordic peers in testing rates, while Sweden had the highest cumulative test-positivity rate continuously from mid-March. Conclusions: COVID-19 pushed Swedens health system to its capacity, exposed systemic weaknesses in the seniors care system, and revealed challenges with implementing effective contact tracing and testing strategies while experiencing a high case burden. Looser government restrictions at the beginning of the outbreak are likely to have played a role in the impact of COVID-19 in Sweden.

Even though there is scientific evidence that the subcutaneous injection of modified tumescent solution reduces blood loss during burn surgery, the technique has not been unanimously adapted because of, in part, fear of healing retardation. This study prospectively examines the effect of tumescent injection on donor site perfusion, healing, and pain. Ten burn patients in need of grafting with a need for two distinctly different donor sites were included. During the grafting procedure, the two donor areas were randomly assigned to receive either modified tumescent solution or warm sterile saline solution subcutaneously before skin graft harvest with a dermatome. Perfusion, pain, pruritus, and donor site healing were measured, and a follow-up evaluation on scar quality was performed. Baseline perfusion on day 1 was significantly less in the donor site injected with modified tumescent solution (62.26 vs 95.71 perfusion units; P = .031), whereas the response to heat was similar in both sites. The physiologic response to injury (hyperemia) on days 2 and 3 was not suppressed in the modified tumescent group. Pain reported on day 1 was 2.38/10 in the tumescent site and 3.38/10 in the saline site (P = .21). On all other days, measurements showed no difference between the two sites. Donor sites healed in an average of 16.1 days with modified tumescent solution and in 16.4 days with saline. Late follow-up showed no difference in scar quality. The subcutaneous injection of modified tumescent solution before split-thickness donor site harvest has no adverse effect on donor site perfusion past day 1 or donor site healing. The addition of a local anesthetic may decrease pain for 24 hours postoperatively, but the difference in this study group was not significant.

Natural infection is most commonly reported in northeast Thailand and northern Australia but also occurs in other parts of Asia, South America, and the Caribbean. Melioidosis develops after bacterial inoculation or inhalation, often in relation to occupational exposure in areas where the disease is endemic. Clinical infection has a peak incidence between the fourth and fifth decades; with diabetes mellitus, excess alcohol consumption, chronic renal failure, and chronic lung disease acting as independent risk factors. Most affected adults ( approximately 80%) in northeast Thailand, northern Australia, and Malaysia have >/=1 underlying diseases. Symptoms of melioidosis may be exhibited many years after exposure, commonly in association with an alteration in immune status. Manifestations of disease are extremely broad ranging and form a spectrum from rapidly life-threatening sepsis to chronic low-grade infection. A common clinical picture is that of sepsis associated with bacterial dissemination to distant sites, frequently causing concomitant pneumonia and liver and splenic abscesses. Infection may also occur in bone, joints, skin, soft tissue, or the prostate. The clinical symptoms of melioidosis mimic those of many other diseases; thus, differentiating between melioidosis and other acute and chronic bacterial infections, including tuberculosis, is often impossible. Confirmation of the diagnosis relies on good practices for specimen collection, laboratory culture, and isolation of B. pseudomallei. The overall mortality rate of infected persons is 50% in northeast Thailand (35% in children) and 19% in Australia.","output":"Management of accidental laboratory exposure to Burkholderia pseudomallei and B. mallei."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peptide triazole thiols (PTTs) have been found previously to bind to HIV-1 Env spike gp120 and cause irreversible virus inactivation by shedding gp120 and lytically releasing luminal capsid protein p24. Since the virions remain visually intact, lysis appears to occur via limited membrane destabilization. To better understand the PTT-triggered membrane transformation involved, we investigated the role of envelope cholesterol on p24 release by measuring the effect of cholesterol depletion using methyl beta-cyclodextrin (MCD). An unexpected bell-shaped response of PTT-induced lysis to [MCD] was observed, involving lysis enhancement at low [MCD] vs loss of function at high [MCD]. The impact of cholesterol depletion on PTT-induced lysis was reversed by adding exogenous cholesterol and other sterols that support membrane rafts, while sterols that do not support rafts induced only limited reversal. Cholesterol depletion appears to cause a reduced energy barrier to lysis as judged by decreased temperature dependence with MCD. Enhancement/replenishment responses to [MCD] also were observed for HIV-1 infectivity, consistent with a similar energy barrier effect in the membrane transformation of virus cell fusion. Overall, the results argue that cholesterol in the HIV-1 envelope is important for balancing virus stability and membrane transformation, and that partial depletion, while increasing infectivity, also makes the virus more fragile. The results also reinforce the argument that the lytic inactivation and infectivity processes are mechanistically related and that membrane transformations occurring during lysis can provide an experimental window to investigate membrane and protein factors important for HIV-1 cell entry.","output":"Impact of HIV-1 Membrane Cholesterol on Cell-Independent Lytic Inactivation and Cellular Infectivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As compared to using randomly generated sensing matrices, optimizing the sensing matrix w.r.t. a carefully designed criterion is known to lead to better quality signal recovery given a set of compressive measurements.

We term these generalizations as bi-coherence or tri-coherence and they are based on a criterion that discourages any one column of the sensing matrix from being close to a sparse linear combination of other columns. We also incorporate training data to further improve the sensing matrices through weighted coherence, weighted bi-coherence, or weighted tri-coherence criteria, which assign weights to sensing matrix columns as per their importance.

A key aspect of LCA studies of waste management systems where recycling activities are present is to account for resource recovery and the related substitution effects. Although multiple scientific papers assume a 1:1 substitution ratio between similar materials/products, this is often incorrect as the actual ratio is likely to vary. The focus of this paper is on the calculation of the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials based on technical characteristics. A state of the art literature review showed that many different calculation procedures were applied, which led to a wide variety of substitutability coefficients (sometimes provided under different terminology). In this perspective, the objective of this paper is to provide guidelines on the procedure to be followed to calculate the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials, based on technical characteristics. These guidelines are then applied to two waste management case studies, one dealing with bottom ashes from incineration and the other with plastic waste. In total, sixteen technical substitutability coefficients are given for ten secondary materials, based on state of the art and presented case studies. The paper thus represents a step forward in quantifying the substitutability of secondary materials in waste management LCA studies. The guidelines presented may allow other case studies to enrich the list of coefficients, useful for all LCA practitioners in a harmonized way allowing a more correct evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with recycling activities.","output":"A step forward in quantifying the substitutability of secondary materials in waste management life cycle assessment studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 or coronavirus is a newly emerged infectious disease that started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and spread worldwide very quickly Although the recovery rate is greater than the death rate, the COVID-19 infection is becoming very harmful for the human community and causing financial loses to their economy No proper vaccine for this infection has been introduced in the market in order to treat the infected people Various approaches have been implemented recently to study the dynamics of this novel infection Mathematical models are one of the effective tools in this regard to understand the transmission patterns of COVID-19 In the present paper, we formulate a fractional epidemic model in the Caputo sense with the consideration of quarantine, isolation, and environmental impacts to examine the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak The fractional models are quite useful for understanding better the disease epidemics as well as capture the memory and nonlocality effects First, we construct the model in ordinary differential equations and further consider the Caputo operator to formulate its fractional derivative We present some of the necessary mathematical analysis for the fractional model Furthermore, the model is fitted to the reported cases in Pakistan, one of the epicenters of COVID-19 in Asia The estimated value of the important threshold parameter of the model, known as the basic reproduction number, is evaluated theoretically and numerically Based on the real fitted parameters, we obtained R01 50 Finally, an efficient numerical scheme of AdamsCMoulton type is used in order to simulate the fractional model The impact of some of the key model parameters on the disease dynamics and its elimination are shown graphically for various values of noninteger order of the Caputo derivative We conclude that the use of fractional epidemic model provides a better understanding and biologically more insights about the disease dynamics","output":"A fractional order mathematical model for COVID-19 dynamics with quarantine, isolation, and environmental viral load"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, not encountered before by humans.

In order to understand the basis of the protective immune response in COVID-19, we performed a longitudinal follow-up, flow-cytometric and serological analysis of innate and adaptive immunity in 64 adults with a spectrum of clinical presentations: 28 healthy SARS-CoV-2-negative contacts of COVID-19 cases; 20 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected cases; eight patients with Mild COVID-19 disease and eight cases of Severe COVID-19 disease. Our data show that high frequency of NK cells and early and transient increase of specific IgA, IgM and, to a lower extent, IgG are associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. By contrast, monocyte expansion and high and persistent levels of IgA and IgG, produced relatively late in the course of the infection, characterize severe disease. Modest increase of monocytes and different kinetics of antibodies are detected in mild COVID-19. The importance of innate NK cells and the short-lived antibody response of asymptomatic individuals and patients with mild disease suggest that only severe COVID-19 may result in protective memory established by the adaptive immune response.","output":"Different Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Asymptomatic, Mild, and Severe Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laboratory-acquired infections due to a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites have been described.

Helmets are important and the most popular means of head protection for cyclists. However, a debate about the effectiveness of helmets in protecting a cyclist's head from injury continues. METHOD: We employed computational biomechanics methods to analyze the head protection effectiveness of nine off-the-shelf-helmets for two typical impact scenarios that occur in cycling accidents: cyclist's head impacting a kerb (kerb-impact) and cyclist skidding (skidding impact) on the road surface. We conducted drop tests for all nine analyzed helmets, and used the test data for validation of the corresponding helmet finite element (FE) models created in this study. The validated helmet models were then used in the full-scale computer simulations (FE analysis for the skull, brain and helmet, and multibody dynamics for the remaining segments of the cyclist's body) of the cycling accidents for cyclists wearing a helmet and without a helmet. RESULTS: The results indicate that helmets can reduce both the peak linear acceleration of the cyclist head center of gravity (COG) and the risk of cyclist skull fracture. However, higher rotational acceleration of the head COG was predicted for cyclists wearing helmets. The results obtained using the injury criteria that rely on the brain deformations (maximum shear strain MPS and cumulative strain damage measure CSDM) suggest that helmets may offer protection in all the analyzed cyclist impact scenarios. However, the predicted level of protection varies for different helmets and impact scenarios with appreciable variations in the predictions obtained using different injury criteria. Reduction in the maximum principal strain (MPS0.98) for helmeted cyclists was predicted for both impact scenarios. In contrast, wearing the helmet reduced the CSDM only for the skidding impact scenario. For the kerb-impact scenario, no clear influence of the helmet on the predicted CSDM was observed.","output":"Evaluation of the head protection effectiveness of cyclist helmets using full-scale computational biomechanics modelling of cycling accidents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we will discuss prediction methods to restrict the spread of the disease by tracking contact individuals via mobile application to individuals infected with the COVID-19 virus We will track individuals using bluetooth technology and then we will save information in the central database when they are in touch Monitoring cases and avoiding the infected person help with social distance We also propose that sensors used by people to obtain blood oxygen saturation level and their body temperature will be used besides bluetooth monitoring The estimation of the frequency of the disease is based on the data entered by the patient and also on the data gathered from the users who entered the program on the state of the disease In this study, we will also propose the best way to restrict the spread of COVID-19 by using methods of artificial intelligence to predict the disease in Jordan using Tensorflow ? 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company","output":"Analysing and predicting COVID-19 AI tracking using artificial intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In France, in June 2021, the daily number of first doses of COVID-19 vaccines is decreasing and vaccine coverage might be insufficient to achieve herd immunity.

OBJECTIVE: This article aims to describe the histologic features of selected infectious diseases of the colon. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Existing reports on histopathologic and clinical aspects of colonic infectious agents were reviewed. RESULTS: While histology alone may not be as sensitive as current microbiologic methods, tissue identification of infectious agents still plays an important role in patient care. Infectious colitis can have a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from strongyloidiasis, which can cause a smoldering, subclinical infection for decades, to syphilis, which can clinically mimic cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, the histopathologic identification of infection as the cause of a patients colitis has a considerable impact on treatment decisions. Morphologic overlap can occur between infection and other diseases, however. Moreover, some infections can elicit various tissue responses beyond acute colitis. Immunosuppressed patients may not mount an inflammatory response to pathogens such as cytomegalovirus or adenovirus. Sexually transmitted proctocolitis can cause plasma-cell-rich inflammation. Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis is more likely to cause diffuse histiocyte infiltration rather than the expected granuloma formation. In some cases, ancillary tests are useful, but equivocal results can cause diagnostic dilemmas.

Existing disinfection techniques using either ultraviolet light or harsh chemicals pose safety risks and are not suitable for use in the presence of humans.

Within this cohort, 83.1% of the women expressed high levels of worry (41.9% very worried and 41.3% worried) about contracting COVID-19 during pregnancy, 70.5% believed that maternal COVID-19 could cause intrauterine infection of their fetuses, and 84.3% objected to banning husbands from accompanying wives during labour and delivery. Most women (80.6%) agreed with universal screening for COVID-19 at certain points during pregnancy. Logistic regression modelling showed that women who were very worried about contracting COVID-19 (P=0.005) and women in their third trimester of pregnancy (P=0.009) were more likely to agree with universal screening during pregnancy; women with higher income (P=0.017) and women who planned to deliver in a private hospital (P=0.024) were more likely to disagree with such screening. CONCLUSION Pregnant women expressed high levels of worry about contracting COVID-19 during pregnancy; universal screening during pregnancy was acceptable to a large proportion of our participants. Efforts should be made to specifically include pregnant women when launching any population screening programme for COVID-19.","output":"Knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours of pregnant women towards COVID-19: a cross-sectional survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the economic burden of influenza infection is well described among adults aged 65 and older, less is known about younger adults. A systematic literature review was conducted to describe the economic burden of seasonal influenza in adults aged 18 to 64 years, to identify the main determinants of direct and indirect costs, and to highlight any gaps in the existing published evidence. MEDLINE and Embase were searched from 2007 to February 7, 2020, for studies reporting primary influenza\\\\related cost data (direct or indirect) or absenteeism data. Of the 2613 publications screened, 51 studies were included in this review. Half of them were conducted in the United States, and 71% of them described patients with influenza\\\\like illness rather than laboratory\\\\confirmed disease. Only 12 studies reported cost data specifically for at\\\\risk populations. Extracted data highlighted that within the 18\\\\ to 64\\\\year\\\\old group, up to 88% of the economic burden of influenza was attributable to indirect costs, and up to 75% of overall direct costs were attributable to hospitalizations. Furthermore, within the 18\\\\ to 64\\\\year\\\\old group, influenza\\\\related costs increased with age and underlying medical conditions. The reported cost of influenza\\\\related hospitalizations was found to be up to 2.5 times higher among at\\\\risk populations compared with not\\\\at\\\\risk populations. This review documents the considerable economic impact of influenza among adults aged 18 to 64. In this age group, most of the influenza costs are indirect, which are generally not recognized by decision makers.

Over the last decade, intensive research has been conducted worldwide to automate this task and to obtain real-time measurements. The aim of this study was to evaluate such an automated biomonitoring system vs. the conventional gold-standard Hirst-type technique, attempting to assess which may more accurately provide the genuine exposure to airborne pollen. Airborne pollen was monitored in Augsburg since 2015 with two different methods, a novel automatic Bio-Aerosol Analyser, and with the conventional 7-day recording Hirst-type volumetric trap, in two different sites. The reliability, performance, accuracy, and comparability of the BAA500 Pollen Monitor (PoMo) vs. the conventional device were investigated, by use of approximately 2.5 million particles sampled during the study period. The observations made by the automated PoMo showed an average accuracy of approximately 85%. However, it also exhibited reliability problems, with information gaps within the main pollen season of between 17 to 19 days. The PoMo automated algorithm had identification issues, mainly confusing the taxa of Populus, Salix and Tilia. Hirst-type measurements consistently exhibited lower pollen abundances (median of annual pollen integral: 2080), however, seasonal traits were more comparable, with the PoMo pollen season starting slightly later (median: 3 days), peaking later (median: 5 days) but also ending later (median: 14 days). Daily pollen concentrations reported by Hirst-type traps vs. PoMo were significantly, but not closely, correlated (r = 0.53C0.55), even after manual classification. Automatic pollen monitoring has already shown signs of efficiency and accuracy, despite its young age; here it is suggested that automatic pollen monitoring systems may be more effective in capturing a larger proportion of the airborne pollen diversity. Even though reliability issues still exist, we expect that this new generation of automated bioaerosol monitoring will eventually change the aerobiological era, as known for almost 70 years now.","output":"Detecting Airborne Pollen Using an Automatic, Real-Time Monitoring System: Evidence from Two Sites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older adults have diminished immune responses that lead to increased susceptibility and severity of infectious diseases. Influenza is a leading killer of older adults despite the availability of seasonal influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccines are strain specific, and their efficacy varies greatly year to year based on how well the vaccine virus matches the circulating strains. Additionally, older adults have reduced vaccination responses. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the increased mortality rate in older adults for infectious disease, and brought vaccine development to the forefront. The speed of vaccine development was met with an equally impressive vaccine efficacy. Interestingly, both mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines currently available have shown similar efficacy in both young and older adults. mRNA vaccine production has significantly reduced the production timeline compared to current influenza vaccines, making them particularly attractive for influenza vaccine development. Faster production coupled with improved efficacy would be a tremendous advancement in protecting older adults from influenza morbidity and mortality.","output":"Better, Faster, Stronger: mRNA Vaccines Show Promise for Influenza Vaccination in Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses the value of studying past social and psychological responses to pandemics and natural disasters in understanding reactions to coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).

The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of the prevention strategy among ACFs in Kyoto City during the third and fifth waves of the pandemic. METHODS: During the study period, the following measures were adopted as the prevention strategy in all ACFs: (1) active polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mass testing and facility\\\\wide testing when a single case was identified, (2) implementation of strategies to prevent transmission within a facility, and (3) vaccination program for ACFs. RESULTS: Of the 1,144 facilities subjected to the mass testing, 71.0% participated in the whole program including active PCR testing. The remainder participated in the rest of the programs. The prevalence of ACF\\\\related COVID\\\\19 cases among total COVID\\\\19 cases in Kyoto City decreased from 7.9% in the third wave to 4.1% in the fourth wave and 2.1% in the fifth wave.

Only a few and mostly small randomized trials have studied antihypertensive treatments in people of African descent living in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this open-label, three-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial conducted at two rural hospitals in Lesotho and Tanzania, we compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of three antihypertensive treatment strategies among participants aged  18 years. The study includes patients with untreated uncomplicated arterial hypertension diagnosed by a standardized office blood pressure  140/90 mmHg. The trial encompasses a superiority comparison between a triple low-dose antihypertensive drug combination versus the current standard of care (monotherapy followed by dual treatment), as well as a non-inferiority comparison for a dual drug combination versus standard of care with optional dose titration after 4 and 8 weeks for participants not reaching the target blood pressure. The sample size is 1268 participants with parallel allocation and a randomization ratio of 2:1:2 for the dual, triple and control arms, respectively. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants reaching a target blood pressure at 12 weeks of  130/80 mmHg and  140/90 mmHg among those aged < 65 years and  65 years, respectively. Clinical manifestations of end-organ damage and cost-effectiveness at 6 months are secondary endpoints.

Three open-ended questions were analyzed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 78 managers out of 168 responded to the survey (response rate 46%). Managers helped promote HH practices by enabling the proper environment for adherence to good HH, visible commitment, and using various means to instruct staff about HH. Challenges included the acute hospital setting and practical problems related to the managers' numerous responsibilities. Developmental ideas included information communication technology (ICT) applications for monitoring HH as an indicator of the quality of care, versatile responses to HH audits, and clarifying the roles of different management levels. CONCLUSIONS: Managers are committed to and use various methods to promote HH.

Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently, there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19 segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven collaborative learning model to exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung infection segmentation. The model consists of a general encoder to capture general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, and a target encoder to focus on task-specific features based on COVID-19 infections. We develop a collaborative learning scheme to regularize feature-level relation consistency of given input and encourage the model to learn more general and discriminative representation of COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that trained with limited COVID-19 data, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions can further improve state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.0% in dice similarity coefficient and 4.2% in normalized surface dice. In addition, experimental results on large scale 2D dataset with CT slices show that our method significantly outperforms cutting-edge segmentation methods metrics. Our method promotes new insights into annotation-efficient deep learning and illustrates strong potential for real-world applications in the global fight against COVID-19 in the absence of sufficient high-quality annotations.","output":"Exploiting Shared Knowledge From Non-COVID Lesions for Annotation-Efficient COVID-19 CT Lung Infection Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Article Title and Bibliographic Information Taste and smell as chemosensory dysfunctions in COVID-19 infection Passarelli PC, Lopez MA, Mastandrea Bonaviri GN, Garcia-Godoy F, D'Addona A Am J Dent 2020;33(3):135-137 Source of Funding Information not available Type of Study/Design Systematic review","output":"Acute Loss of Smell or Taste Without Nasal Blockage Should Raise Suspicion for COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To evaluate whether soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) can be used as an early predictor of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: Ventilated neonatal patients admitted into the neonatology department between January 2017 and January 2018 were divided into VAP (n = 30) and non-VAP (n = 30) groups. Serum sTREM, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels were measured at 0, 24, 72, and 120 h after initiation of mechanical ventilation (MV). Correlations between blood biomarker concentrations and VAP occurrence were analyzed. Predictive factors for VAP were identified by logistic regression analysis and Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and the predictive value of sTREM-1 and biomarker combinations for VAP was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: The serum sTREM-1 concentration was significantly higher in the VAP group than in the non-VAP group after 72 and 120 h of MV (72 h: 289.5 (179.6C427.0) vs 202.9 (154.8C279.6) pg/ml, P < 0.001; 120 h: 183.9 (119.8C232.1) vs 141.3 (99.8C179.1) pg/ml, P = 0.042). The area under the curve (AUC) for sTREM-1 at 72 h was 0.902 with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 77% for the optimal cut-off value of 165.05 pg/ml.

Forgoing healthcare characterizes situations in which people do not initiate or interrupt a care process, even though they perceive the need for it, whether or not this need is medically proven. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence and the determinants of patients who forego healthcare. The second aim was to compare the characteristics of patients who gave up healthcare during the French lockdown due to COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted two multicenter cross-sectional studies in 2017 and 2020 carried out in French patients presenting to the emergency departments. Patients who gave their consent to participate were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire. It consisted of two parts: epidemiological characteristics and health care refusal. A third part concerning the renunciation of care during the COVID-19 period was added to the second study period. RESULTS: A total of 1878 patients had completed the questionnaire during the interview with the physicians, 900 during the first period in 2017 (47.9%) and 978 (52.1%) during the second period. A total of 401/1878 patients reported not seeking care in the last 12 months (21.4% [95%CI: 19.5C23.3%]).
