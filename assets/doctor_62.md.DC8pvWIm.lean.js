One approach involves the switch from operating under general to local anaesthetic. We assess whether diluational local anaesthetic is as effective as the current standard approach. METHODS: Postoperative pain was recorded in prospective, consecutive patients undergoing wide local excision under dilutional local anaesthetic (concentration < 1mg/ml). Pain scores were documented at 0, 30 and 60 minutes and compared to a control group consisting of combined general with local anaesthetic. RESULTS: Pain significantly increased in the control group during the postoperative recovery. This was not seen in the dilutional local anaesthetic group that was non-inferior to the standard approach at 0, 30 and 60 minutes. CONCLUSION: Dilutional local anaesthetic provides a safe and effective alternative approach to operating on breast cancer patients whilst avoiding risky general anaesthetic in a COVID-19 pandemic environment.","output":"Dilutional local anaesthetic techniques in oncoplastic breast surgery and potential benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Long COVID is characterised by a range of potentially debilitating symptoms which develop in at least 10% of people who have recovered from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study has quantified corneal sub-basal nerve plexus morphology and dendritic cell (DC) density in patients with and without long COVID. METHODS: Forty subjects who had recovered from COVID-19 and 30 control participants were included in this cross-sectional comparative study undertaken at a university hospital. All patients underwent assessment with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) long COVID, Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) and Fibromyalgia questionnaires, and corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) to quantify corneal nerve fibre density (CNFD), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), corneal nerve fibre length (CNFL), and total, mature and immature DC density. RESULTS: The mean time after the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 3.71.5 months. Patients with neurological symptoms 4 weeks after acute COVID-19 had a lower CNFD (p=0.032), CNBD (p=0.020), and CNFL (p=0.012), and increased DC density (p=0.046) compared with controls, while patients without neurological symptoms had comparable corneal nerve parameters, but increased DC density (p=0.003).

Through literature research and review it has become apparent to the author that the lymphatic system is a vital, somewhat overlooked, missing link in the treatment of COVID-19 pulmonary infection. The major challenges the whole world is facing now have been a shortage of supplies such as PPE, or personal protective equipment, and intensive care facilities to treat the overwhelming numbers of COVID-19 cases, in under-developed countries as well as developed countries. Osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) and osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) have been proven, for over a century, to be very effective in the treatment of pulmonary diseases and previous pandemics. Osteopathic professionals must challenge the present paradigm of modern medicine which, only too often, relies less on the body's own capacity to regulate itself, to compensate, and to heal, and more on outside intervention such as medications and vaccinations. Osteopathic physicians are needed to step forward and discuss, explain, teach and train the importance of the lymphatic system as a major component of the circulatory as well as the immune system which plays a vital, pivotal, role in fighting diseases such as the COVID-19 coronavirus. A \\"viral infection protocol\\" (VIP), as discussed in this article, needs to be promoted as a mainstream adjunct, along with all of the other modalities of modern medicine, to health professionals and the public, in the event that the health care systems are overwhelmed. The VIP treatment is easy to train and to certify practitioners, with proven results in other pulmonary infections and epidemics.

Moreover, there have been limited evaluations to date of the impact of these sociodemographic factors on the use of telephone versus video visits. Such assessments are crucial to identify, understand, and address differences in care delivery across patient populations, particularly those that could affect access to or quality of care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine changes in ambulatory visit volume and type (ie, in-person vs virtual and telephone vs video visits) by patient sociodemographics during the COVID-19 pandemic at one urban academic medical center. METHODS: We compared volumes and patient sociodemographics (age, sex, race, insurance) for visits during the first 11 weeks following the COVID-19 national emergency declaration (March 15 to May 31, 2020) to visits in the corresponding weeks in 2019. Additionally, for visits during the COVID-19 study period, we examined differences in visit type (ie, in-person versus virtual, and telephone versus video visits) by sociodemographics using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Total visit volumes in the COVID-19 study period comprised 51.4% of the corresponding weeks in 2019 (n=80,081 vs n=155,884 visits). Although patient sociodemographics between the COVID-19 study period in 2020 and the corresponding weeks in 2019 were similar, 60.5% (n=48,475) of the visits were virtual, compared to 0% in 2019. Of the virtual visits, 61.2% (n=29,661) were video based, and 38.8% (n=18,814) were telephone based. In the COVID-19 study period, virtual (vs in-person) visits were more likely among patients with race categorized as other (vs White) and patients with Medicare (vs commercial) insurance and less likely for men, patients aged 0-17 years, 65-74 years, or 75 years (compared to patients aged 18-45 years), and patients with Medicaid insurance or insurance categorized as other. Among virtual visits, compared to telephone visits, video visits were more likely to be adopted by patients aged 0-17 years (vs 18-45 years), but less likely for all other age groups, men, Black (vs White) patients, and patients with Medicare or Medicaid (vs commercial) insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual visits comprised the majority of ambulatory visits during the COVID-19 study period, of which a majority were by video. Sociodemographic differences existed in the use of virtual versus in-person and video versus telephone visits.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility data to predict daily new cases at both the state and county level in South Carolina. METHODS: This longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020, in South Carolina and its five counties with the largest number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases. Population mobility was assessed based on the number of Twitter users with a travel distance greater than 0.5 miles. A Poisson count time series model was employed for COVID-19 forecasting. RESULTS: Population mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19 incidence as well as incidence in the top five counties (ie, Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland). At the state level, the final model with a time window within the last 7 days had the smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6% for the next 3, 7, and 14 days, respectively.

There is less reliance on explicit driver- or vehicle-based messages, such as hand/head movements, or flashing lights/beeping horns. With the impending deployment of Automated Vehicles (AV), especially those at SAE Level 4 and 5, where the driver is no longer in control of the vehicle, there has been a surge in interest in the value of new forms of communication for AVs, for example, via different types of external Human Machine Interfaces (eHMIs). However, there is still much to be understood about how quickly a novel eHMI affects pedestrian crossing decisions, and whether it provides any additional aid, above and beyond implicit/kinematic information from the vehicle. The aim of this between-participant study, funded by the H2020 interACT project, was to investigate how the combination of kinematic information from a vehicle (e.g., Speed and Deceleration), and eHMI designs, play a role in assisting the crossing decision of pedestrians in a cave-based pedestrian simulator. METHOD Using an existing, well-recognized, message for yielding (Flashing Headlights - FH) as a benchmark, this study also investigated how quickly a novel eHMI (Slow Pulsing Light Band - SPLB) was learned. To investigate the effect of eHMI visibility on crossing decisions, the distance at which each eHMI was perceivable was also measured. RESULTS Results showed that, compared to SPLB, the FH led to earlier crossings during vehicle deceleration, especially at lower approaching speeds, and smaller time gaps. However, although FH was visible earlier than SPLB, this visibility does not appear to be the only reason for earlier crossings, with message familiarity thought to play a role. Participants were found to learn the meaning conveyed by FH relatively quickly, crossing around 1 second earlier in its presence (compared to the no eHMI condition), across the three blocks of trials. On the other hand, it took participants at least one block of 12 trials for the new SPLB signal to affect crossing, which only accelerated crossing initiations by around 200 ms, compared to the no eHMI condition. The role of comprehension, long-term exposure, and familiarity of novel messages in this context is therefore important, if AVs are to provide safe, trustworthy communication messages, which will enhance traffic flow and efficiency.","output":"Learning to interpret novel eHMI: The effect of vehicle kinematics and eHMI familiarity on pedestrian' crossing behavior."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main aim of this paper was two-fold: first, to design a participative methodology that facilitates lean management implementation in healthcare by adopting the action research approach; second, to illustrate the usefulness of this methodology by applying it to the sleep unit of a public hospital in Spain.

It further draws laterally upon design science to offer a novel design model for governing complex systems, with broad application across global policy domains. A case study of the COVID-19 pandemic response illustrates the importance of supplementing inherited complicated governance system design and practices with design principles explicitly oriented to working with complexity, rather than against it.

METHODS: This COVID-19 specialized single-center cohort study of 1888 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the Enfermera Isabel Zendal Emergencies Hospital (HEEIZ), Madrid (Spain) was performed between July 1 and September 30, 2021. It compared the results of 1327 hospitalized unvaccinated patients to 209 hospitalized fully vaccinated and 352 hospitalized partially vaccinated patients. The four different COVID-19 vaccines authorized in Spain during the time-period studied were: BNT162b2 (Pfizer); ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), mRNA-1273 (Moderna); Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen). FINDINGS: Hospitalized patients median age was 41 years (IQR 33C50) for the unvaccinated and 61 years (IQR 53C67) for the fully vaccinated ones. The main comorbidities were obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 20% of unvaccinated patients (266) required noninvasive respiratory care, as did 14% (51) of partially and 14% (30) of fully vaccinated; 6% (78) of the unvaccinated patients also needed invasive respiratory care, as did 5% (16) of partially and 11 (5%) fully vaccinated. INTERPRETATION: Fully vaccinated patients were 84% (95% CI: 82C86%) less likely to be admitted to hospital, and protection rose for those aged <50 years. Once hospitalized, vaccinated patients displayed more protection against requiring respiratory care than unvaccinated ones, despite being older and having more comorbidities. No differences appeared for the four studied COVID-19 vaccines and complying with vaccination recommendations proved relevant.

In low income countries such as Malawi, with significant health challenges, stakeholder inclusion is particularly important to improve performance and service delivery. The 2017 National Health Plan II (NHP II) and accompanying Health Sector Strategic Plan II (HSSP II) aimed to improve the functioning of the healthcare system. The Ministry of Health for Malawi intended to involve all key health sector stakeholders in their development. This study explores the extent of stakeholder engagement in the health policy process through local level stakeholders perceptions of their involvement in the NHP II and HSSP II. METHODS: A qualitative study design was used. Interviews were conducted with 19 representatives of organisations operating at the local level, such as CSOs and local government. Open questions were asked about experiences and perceptions of the development of the NHP II and HSSP II. Inductive content analysis was performed. RESULTS: Stakeholders perceived barriers to inclusive and meaningful engagement in the health policy process. Five categories were identified: tokenistic involvement; stakeholder hierarchy; mutual distrust; preferred stakeholders; no culture of engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Serious challenges to the meaningful and equitable engagement of local level stakeholder groups in the health policy process were identified. Issues of trust, accountability and hierarchy in donor-citizen-government relations must be addressed to support stakeholder engagement. Engagement must go beyond tokenism to embed a range of stakeholders in the process with feedback mechanisms to ensure impact from their contributions. Local level stakeholders can be empowered to advocate for and participate in consultation exercises alongside greater top-down efforts to engage stakeholders via diverse and inclusive methods.

Clarification of the immunopathogenesis of different emerging viral infections can provide a plan for the crisis management and prevention of emerging infections.

We classified immunopathogenesis of common emerging viral infections into 4 categories: 1) deficient immunity with disseminated viremia (e.g., Ebola); 2) pneumocytotropism with/without later hyperinflammation (e.g., COVID-19); 3) augmented immunopathology (e.g., Hanta); and 4) antibody-dependent enhancement of infection with altered immunity (e.g., Dengue). A practical guide to early blocking of viral evasion, limiting viral load and identifying the fatal mechanism of an emerging viral infection is provided to prevent and reduce the transmission, and to do rapid diagnoses followed by the early treatment of virus neutralization for reduction of morbidity and mortality of an emerging viral infection such as COVID-19.","output":"Immunopathogenesis of Different Emerging Viral Infections: Evasion, Fatal Mechanism, and Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence (AI) can help to address coronavirus if applied creatively Artificial intelligence training models to deal with COVID-19 are having challenges as historical data is still not available Drones and robots equipped with IoT devices provide raw data that needs computing analysis to make that data meaningful and actionable without human involvement The power of AI and edge computing lies in its ability to process a massive amount of data at breakneck speed and improving efficiency It enables big data analytics and deployment of algorithm and transmission of data across edge and cloud This chapter presents how current artificial intelligence enables robotic drone applications and network connectivity is used to improve their performance and increase efficiency in various situations to fight COVID-19 Further, it provides an in-depth review and analysis of literature on related work on COVID-19 outbreak It also gives the necessary background for future research in edge intelligence, AI-enabled robotic drone and intelligent networks ? 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Robotic Drones for COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cost of DNA sequencing has dropped exponentially over the past decade, making genomic data accessible to a growing number of scientists. In bioinformatics, localization of short DNA sequences (reads) within large genomic sequences is commonly facilitated by constructing index data structures which allow for efficient querying of substrings. Recent metagenomic classification pipelines annotate reads with taxonomic labels by analyzing their $k$-mer histograms with respect to a reference genome database. CPU-based index construction is often performed in a preprocessing phase due to the relatively high cost of building irregular data structures such as hash maps. However, the rapidly growing amount of available reference genomes establishes the need for index construction and querying at interactive speeds. In this paper, we introduce MetaCache-GPU -- an ultra-fast metagenomic short read classifier specifically tailored to fit the characteristics of CUDA-enabled accelerators. Our approach employs a novel hash table variant featuring efficient minhash fingerprinting of reads for locality-sensitive hashing and their rapid insertion using warp-aggregated operations. Our performance evaluation shows that MetaCache-GPU is able to build large reference databases in a matter of seconds, enabling instantaneous operability, while popular CPU-based tools such as Kraken2 require over an hour for index construction on the same data.

However, an urgent need for training health care worker (HCW) on preventive measures for COVID-19 infection was the need of the hour. Keeping in mind the precautionary measures required to combat COVID-19 infection, the only promising option for training was by adopting an online learning method. This study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of video-based training using online platforms for infection prevention and control (IPC) training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A quasi-experimental study, with only one experimental group comprising of HCWs, was undertaken to assess the effect of intervention which included video-assisted teaching-learning regarding IPC measures with a special focus on COVID-19 at a tertiary care Institute in North India. Online sessions were conducted on Dos and Donts, Hand Hygiene, donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), cleaning and disinfection, and bio-medical waste (BMW) management with the help of pre-recorded videos which was pre-validated. The session was followed by online interaction with participants by a single resource person. Pre-test and post-test were conducted through google forms before commencement and at the end of the online session respectively. The data were analyzed in terms of descriptive frequencies and percentages of different domains to describe the pre- and post-test knowledge. Results A total of 576 participants were included in the study. There was a statistically significant gain in scores of all questions related to cleaning and disinfection; and BMW. No significant change was observed in knowledge regarding the sequence of doffing (p-value: 0.94). The result of pairwise comparisons pre-test and post-test scores showed that intervention through video-assisted teaching-learning resulted in improvement of knowledge which was found to be statistically significant (p-value < 0.001). Conclusion Video-assisted teaching-learning through virtual platforms effectively trained health personnel on infection prevention and control practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Video-assisted training can successfully be handled by a single resource person to impart the knowledge and skill to the trainee. Virtual teaching and learning is a feasible and efficient method to deliver training to HCWs on infection control practices and this methodology may be adopted in the future for several other training in manpower crunch situations, similar restrictive circumstances as posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Effectiveness of Video-Based Online Training for Health Care Workers to Prevent COVID-19 Infection: An Experience at a Tertiary Care Level Institute, Uttarakhand, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medicinal uses and applications of metals and their complexes are of increasing clinical and commercial importance.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of the SAMSHA exemption on methadone adherence and OUD-related outcomes. METHODS A convenience sample of 183 clients (58% female) were recruited from a methadone clinic in the fall of 2019 for a cross-sectional survey. Survey data was linked to clinical records, including urine drug testing (UDT) results for methadone and emergency department (ED) visits at the local hospital. Participants were on stable methadone dosing for 9 months prior to and following March 2020. Methadone adherence was assessed by UDTs; OUD-related outcomes were assessed by overdose events and ED visits. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between change in take-home methadone doses and outcomes. RESULTS Mean take-home doses increased nearly 200% (11.4 doses/30 days pre-COVID-19 vs. 22.3 post-SAMHSA exemption). ED visits dropped from 74 (40.4%) pre-COVID-19 to 56 (30.6%) post-SAMHSA exemption (p = <0.001). No significant changes were observed in either the number of clients experiencing overdose or those who experienced one or more methadone negative UDTs in the post-SAMHSA exemption period.

Based on consensus of expert opinions, we suggest the administration of low-dose low molecular weight heparin subcutaneously twice-daily as anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (in the absence of contraindications, and in combination with mechanical thromboprophylaxis with sequential compression devices, where feasible) in children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illness (including the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [MIS-C]) who have markedly elevated D-dimer levels or superimposed clinical risk factors for hospitalassociated VTE. For children who are clinically unstable or have severe renal impairment, we suggest the use of unfractionated heparin by continuous intravenous infusion as anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. In addition, continued efforts to characterize VTE risk and risk factors in children with COVID-19, as well as to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis strategies in children hospitalized with COVID-19-related illness (including MIS-C) via cooperative multicenter trials, were identified among several key priorities for future research. CONCLUSION: These consensus-based recommendations on the use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illnesses and priorities for future research will be updated as high-quality evidence emerges.","output":"Consensus-based clinical recommendations and research priorities for anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc across the globe.

The most common manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19) is viral pneumonia with varying degrees of respiratory compromise and up to 40% of hospitalized patients might develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several clinical trials evaluated the role of corticosteroids in non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome with conflicting results. We designed a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of early intravenous dexamethasone administration on the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation within 28 days after randomization in adult patients with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to confirmed or probable COVID-19. METHODS: This is a pragmatic, prospective, randomized, stratified, multicenter, open-label, controlled trial including 350 patients with early-onset (less than 48 hours before randomization) moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, defined by the Berlin criteria, due to COVID-19. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to either standard treatment plus dexamethasone (Intervention Group) or standard treatment without dexamethasone (Control Group). Patients in the intervention group will receive dexamethasone 20mg intravenous once daily for 5 days, followed by dexamethasone 10mg IV once daily for additional 5 days or until intensive care unit discharge, whichever occurs first. The primary outcome is ventilator-free days within 28 days after randomization, defined as days alive and free from invasive mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality rates at day 28, evaluation of the clinical status at day 15 assessed with a 6-level ordinal scale, mechanical ventilation duration from randomization to day 28, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score evaluation at 48 hours, 72 hours and 7 days and intensive care unit -free days within 28.","output":"Sndrome do desconforto respiratrio agudo associada  COVID-19 tratada com DEXametasona (CoDEX): delineamento e justificativa de um estudo randomizado./ Sndrome do desconforto respiratrio agudo associada  COVID-19 tratada com DEXametasona (CoDEX): delineamento e justificativa de um estudo randomizado./ COVID-19-associated ARDS treated with DEXamethasone (CoDEX): study design and rationale for a randomized trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Writing this article aims to analyze the shift in the urban middle classs consumption behaviour in Jember during the Covid 19 pandemic.

Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS) is a promising, non-invasive neuromodulatory intervention that may prevent the emergence of the C-fibre evoked bladder reflexes that are thought to cause NDO. This paper presents the protocol for TTNS in acute SCI (TASCI), which will evaluate the efficacy of TTNS in preventing NDO. Furthermore, TASCI will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying TTNS, and the course of NLUTD development after SCI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: TASCI is a nationwide, randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, conducted at all four SCI centres in Switzerland. The longitudinal design includes a baseline assessment period 5C39 days after acute SCI and follow-up assessments occurring 3, 6 and 12 months after SCI. A planned 114 participants will be randomised into verum or sham TTNS groups (1:1 ratio), stratified on study centre and lower extremity motor score. TTNS is performed for 30 min/day, 5 days/week, for 6C9 weeks starting within 40 days after SCI. The primary outcome is the occurrence of NDO jeopardising the upper urinary tract at 1 year after SCI, assessed by urodynamic investigation. Secondary outcome measures assess bladder and bowel function and symptoms, sexual function, neurological structure and function, functional independence, quality of life, as well as changes in biomarkers in the urine, blood, stool and bladder tissue. Safety of TTNS is the tertiary outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: TASCI is approved by the Swiss Ethics Committee for Northwest/Central Switzerland, the Swiss Ethics Committee Vaud and the Swiss Ethics Committee Zrich (#2019-00074). Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications.

Holding the election in pandemic times caused turnout to drop significantly, but unevenly so across the electorate. We use both aggregate electoral results at the polling station level and individual-level data drawn from a survey we conducted between June and July 2020. If fear of contagion partly explains voters' abstention, this article highlights the contradictory effects of the pandemic on the socioeconomic determinants of voter turnout. On the one hand, the variation in turnout levels by age, which usually is quite significant in France, has considerably decreased in 2020. On the other hand, the differences in turnout levels according to the voters' economic and social status have been reinforced during the pandemic. This analysis of local individual data shows that the health crisis has generated important consequences also on the patterns of social inequalities in political representation.

The hypothesis was that axial micromotion enhances fracture healing compared to static interlocking. METHODS: Patients were treated in a single level I trauma centre over a 2.5-year period. Group allocation was not randomized; both the micromotion nail and standard-of-care static locking nails (control group) were commercially available and selected at the discretion of the treating surgeons. Injury risk levels were quantified using the Nonunion Risk Determination (NURD) score. Radiological healing was assessed until 24 weeks or clinical union. Low-dose CT scans were acquired at 12 weeks and virtual mechanical testing was performed to objectively assess structural bone healing. RESULTS: A total of 37 micromotion patients and 46 control patients were evaluated. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, sex, the proportion of open fractures, or NURD score. There were no nonunions (0%) in the micromotion group versus five (11%) in the control group. The proportion of fractures united was significantly higher in the micromotion group compared to control at 12 weeks (54% vs 30% united; p = 0.043), 18 weeks (81% vs 59%; p = 0.034), and 24 weeks (97% vs 74%; p = 0.005). Structural bone healing scores as assessed by CT scans tended to be higher with micromotion compared to control and this difference reached significance in patients who had biological comorbidities such as smoking. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, micromotion fixation was associated with improved healing compared to standard tibial nailing. Further prospective clinical studies will be needed to assess the strength and generalizability of any potential benefits of micromotion fixation.

Although several studies have discussed the role of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in viral infections, such as influenzae and SARS, it remains unexplored in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. 5-LOX acts on free arachidonic acid (AA) to form proinflammatory leukotrienes (LTs). Of note, numerous cells involved with COVID-19 (e.g., inflammatory and smooth muscle cells, platelets, and vascular endothelium) widely express leukotriene receptors. Moreover, 5-LOX metabolites induce the release of cytokines (e.g., tumour necrosis factor-&#945; [TNF-&#945;], interleukin-1&#945; [IL-1&#945;], and interleukin-1? [IL-1?]) and express tissue factor on cell membranes and activate plasmin. Since macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils can express lipoxygenases, activation of 5-LOX and the subsequent release of LTs may contribute to the severity of COVID-19. This review sheds light on the potential implications of 5-LOX in SARS-CoV-2-mediated infection and the anticipated therapeutic role of 5-LOX inhibitors.","output":"The role of 5-lipoxygenase in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its therapeutic implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay examines the question of whether, during a public health emergency, tribes located in a state that has adopted minimal protections to curb the pandemic may enact stronger protections for their own citizens and territories.

Here, we describe the SARS-CoV-2 variants that are currently circulating and co-circulating in the country, with the aim to highlight which variants have driven the different epidemic waves. For this purpose, we retrieved metadata information of Coronavirus sequences collected in Brazil and available at the GISAID database. SARS-CoV-2 lineages have been identified along with eleven variants, labelled as VOCs (Alpha, Gamma, Beta, Delta and Omicron) VOIs (Lambda and Mu) VUMs (B.1.1.318) and FMVs (Zeta, Eta and B.1.1.519). Here we show that, in the Brazilian context, after 24 months of sustained transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, local variants (among them the B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33) were displaced by recently introduced VOCs firstly with the Gamma, followed by Delta and more recently Omicron. The rapid spread of some of those VOCs (such as Gamma and Omicron) was also mirror by a large increase in the number of cases and deaths in the country. This in turn reinforces that, due to the emergence of variants that appear to induce a substantial evasion against neutralizing antibody response, it is important to strengthen genomic effort within the country and how vaccination still remains a critical process to protect the vulnerable population, still at risk of infection and death.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Brazil: how variants displacement have driven distinct epidemic waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Working under pandemic conditions exposes health care workers (HCWs) to infection risk and psychological strain. A better understanding of HCWs experiences of following local infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures during COVID-19 is urgently needed to inform strategies for protecting the psychical and psychological health of HCWs. The objective of this study was therefore to capture the perceptions of hospital HCWs on local IPC procedures and the impact on their emotional wellbeing during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. METHODS: Participants were recruited in two sampling rounds of an international cross-sectional survey. Sampling took place between 31 March and 17 April 2020 via existing research networks and between 14 May and 31 August 2020 via online convenience sampling. Main outcome measures were behavioural determinants of HCWs adherence to IPC guidelines and the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, a validated scale of 0C100 reflecting emotional wellbeing. The WHO-5 was interpreted as a score below or above 50 points, a cut-off score used in previous literature to screen for depression. RESULTS: 2289 HCWs from 40 countries in Europe participated. Mean age was 42 (11) years, 66% were female, 47% and 39% were medical doctors and nurses, respectively. 74% (n = 1699) of HCWs were directly treating patients with COVID-19, of which 32% (n = 527) reported they were fearful of caring for these patients. HCWs reported high levels of concern about COVID-19 infection risk to themselves (71%) and their family (82%) as a result of their job. 40% of HCWs considered that getting infected with COVID-19 was not within their control. This feeling was more common among junior than senior HCWs (46% versus 38%, P value < .01). Sufficient COVID-19-specific IPC training, confidence in PPE use and institutional trust were positively associated with the feeling that becoming infected with COVID-19 was within their control. Female HCWs were more likely than males to report a WHO-5 score below 50 points (aOR 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2C1.8).

Serum levels of complement C3 and C4, and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) were measured using an ELISA and albumin, calcium, and magnesium by using the spectrophotometric method in 60 COVID-19 patients and 30 controls. C3 and C4 were significantly decreased (p <0.001), and TxA2 and PGI2 significantly increased (p <0.001) in the COVID-19 patients compared with the controls with the highest levels in the CCTA patients group. Neural networks showed that a combination of C3, albumin, and TxA2 yielded a predictive accuracy of 100% in detecting COVID-19 patients. SpO2 was significantly decreased in the COVID-19 patients and was inversely associated with TxA2 and PGI2, and positively with C3, C4, albumin, and calcium. Patients with positive IgG results show significantly higher SpO2, TxA2, PGI2, and C4 levels than IgG-negative patients. CCTAs were accompanied by lower SpO2 and albumin and increased PGI2 and TxA2 levels, suggesting that interactions between immune-inflammatory pathways and platelet hyperactivity participate in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and, consequently, may play a role in an enhanced risk of hypercoagulability and venous thromboembolism.

This article represents an attempt to research the notion of \\"constitutional identity\\", which has recently emerged as a relevant concept in constitutional law, through the prism of its transformation reacting the world's challenges. The purpose of the research is to confirm or disprove hypothesis that both typical and extraordinary factors may influence differently on the transformation of constitutional identity. The methodology. The article is based on the dialectical method, as well as on the logical, historical, systemic methods. A comparative method was applied to study the features of the constitutional identity of States. Authors pay attention to the interaction of international and national policies. The main results, scope of application. Within the doctrine of constitutional identity it is presented a discussion with respect to terms and definitions of constitutional, state or national identity, constitutional identity of citizens. Moreover, such two notions as \\"individuality\\" and \\"identity\\" form a curious couple since \\"identity\\" may contravene \\"individuality\\". Different factors which can influence on transformation of the constitutional identity, are listed (globalization (antiglobalism), universalization of constitutional values, COVID-19 pandemic, migration, etc.). In particular, different countries choose different models of reflecting the processes of globalization in their domestic constitutional legislation: from striving for unification to systematic confrontation. In this regard, it seems necessary to assess these factors, taking into account the experience of different states. Besides, the activities of international bodies can give rise to the universalization of constitutional values. For example, supranational bodies (in particular, the European Court of Justice) develop general constitutional traditions and principles applicable to all countries for the formation of a special common culture. Another example is the current epidemiological crisis. The coronavirus infection has made its own adjustments to the constitutional identity of states. Examples of such transformation are full border closures or partial closures with individual states;amendments to the national legislation, according to which the issues of measures permissible for implementation by the state are being revised in order to ensure the life and health of the population. Conclusions. Definition the constitutional identity is an important strategic framework for national policy. However, there is no certain fixed constitutional identity of the state. On contrary, the identity of the state tends to be changeable. Transformation can be regarded as voluntary, forced or consciously responsive, expected or not. Voluntary transformation usually becomes a response to the evolutionary development of society, scientific and technological advances and discoveries. Forced transformation is likely to be a reaction to economic, epidemiological, political crises. Therefore, in order to determine the constitutional identity of certain state it is necessary to understand the cultural, historical, social and political contexts of its formation and current development in the conditions of the contemporary world.","output":"Transformation of Constitutional Identity Due to Contemporary Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Depression is associated with biases in facial emotion processing, which have an impact on the course and treatment of depression. While decades of research have established a negativity bias in processing in depression, there is still a gap in our understanding of how depression severity impacts sensitivity to detecting differences in emotional faces. METHODS We examined emotion sensitivity (ES), or the ability to to detect subtle differences in emotional faces, in a large, geographically and culturally diverse, web-based sample (N = 6598, age range = 18-96, 56.50% female, 66% Caucasian). Participants completed ES tasks (fear, anger, or happiness) and a Beck Depression Inventory-II, to determine depression severity. RESULTS Depression severity was correlated with overall ES performance as well as ES performance for individual emotions. Higher depression scores were associated with poorer performance in detecting happiness, fear, and anger (ps < .001). Examining performance by region, Eastern countries showed significantly poorer ES performance compared to Western countries, and were significantly more depressed. LIMITATIONS Our sample is non-clinical and self-selected. CONCLUSIONS This study is an extension of existing research on emotional facial processing, with an approach that takes into consideration the heterogeneity of depression symptoms and corrects psychometric confounds of traditional emotion face processing paradigms.

METHODS Using Explorys Inc., an aggregate of electronic health records from US health care systems from 1999 to June 2021, we identified patients with \\"alcoholic hepatitis,\\" \\"inflammation of pancreas caused by alcohol,\\" and \\"alcoholic gastritis,\\" based on Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT). We compared patients utilizing health care during the pandemic to those before it. RESULTS We identified 8,445,720 patients treated from June 21, 2020 to June 20, 2021 (\\"COVID cohort\\") and 65,587,860 patients treated before this (\\"pre-COVID cohort\\"). African American patients were more likely to be treated for all causes during COVID-19 [odds ratio (OR): 1.65; P<0.0001]. Alcoholic hepatitis (OR: 2.77), alcoholic pancreatitis (OR: 3.67), and alcoholic gastritis (OR: 1.70) (for each, P<0.0001) were more likely in all patients in the COVID cohort. African Americans in the COVID cohort were more likely to be diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis (OR: 2.63), alcoholic pancreatitis (OR: 2.17), and alcoholic gastritis (OR: 3.09) [for each, P<0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of alcohol-related liver and gastrointestinal disease increased during COVID-19. We suspect these increases are associated with increased alcohol use disorder resulting from the stress of social isolation. These data suggest COVID-19 disproportionately affected African Americans in overall health care utilization and increased burden of alcoholic gastrointestinal and liver disease.","output":"Increasing Prevalence and Racial Disparity of Alcohol-Related Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Population-Based National Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The analysis of the Sars-CoV-2 epidemic is of paramount importance to understand the dynamics of the coronavirus spread. This can help health and government authorities take the appropriate measures and implement suitable politics aimed at fighting and preventing it. Methods: A time-dependent dynamic SEIR model inspired in a model previously used during the MERS outbreak in South Korea was used to analyse the time trajectories of active and hospitalized cases in Portugal. Results: The time evolution of the virus spread in the country was adequately modelled. The model has changeable parameters every five days since the onset of mitigation measures. A peak of about 22,000 active cases is estimated, although the official value for recovered cases is out of date. Hospitalized cases could reach a peak of about 1,250 cases, of which 200/300 in ICU units. Conclusion: With appropriate measures, the number of active cases in Portugal can be controlled at about 22,000 people, of which about 1,250 hospitalized and 200/300 in ICU units.

METHOD: The study focused on choice between demand responsive transport (DRT), and more traditional modes of public transport, buses and private taxis. Participants completed online questionnaires to measure chronic regulatory focus, perception of health-related risk of using public transport, and choice of public transport mode (choice between buses and DRT, and separately, between taxis and DRT). RESULTS: The choice between buses and DRT is explained by moderation. The relationship between promotion focus and choice is moderated by risk perception whereas the relationship between prevention focus and choice is moderated by age. Specifically, the probability of choosing DRT is smaller for those saying DRT is riskier (relative to bus is riskier), and the effect gets stronger with increasing strength of promotion focus. Furthermore, the probability of choosing DRT increases with increasing strength of prevention focus for individuals older in age, but decreases with increasing strength of prevention focus for those younger in age. The choice between taxis and DRT is explained by mediated-moderation. The relationship between promotion focus and choice is moderated by age and mediated by risk perception. Specifically, the probability of saying that DRT is riskier than taxis decreases with increasing strength of promotion focus for individuals older in age. As a result, the probability of choosing DRT increases with increasing strength of promotion focus for older people. Moreover, the probability of saying that DRT is riskier than taxis increases with increasing strength of promotion focus for individuals younger in age. As a result, the probability of choosing DRT decreases with increasing strength of promotion focus for younger people.

However, the impact of VAST on clinical outcomes and on workload has not been shown previously with no reports to date from the UK. Our aim was to evaluate clinical outcomes of a multidisciplinary vascular access support team (VAST) and the value of the service to critical care teams. Methods: Prospectively collected data on all patients requiring vascular access at St Thomas Hospital, London over a 5-week period during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK. At the end of study period, online anonymised questionnaire administered to critical care team members, including nursing and medical professionals, to evaluate their experience of the service.

Results: 122 patients aged 52.1  13 years with high rate of pre-existing co-morbidities, underwent line insertion including 190 catheters (central venous n=182, arterial n=8). Median (range) number of 5 (0-17) lines were placed per day in patients of whom 90% tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-type 2 pathogen (SARS-CoV-2).

Methods: Medline and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies linked to mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients who have undergone non-elective hip surgeries using the keywords \\"COVID-19\\"OR \\"SARS-cov-2\\"OR \\"Coronavirus Infections\\"; AND \\"Surgery\\"OR \\"Hip\\"OR \\"Fracture\\"OR \\"Orthopedics.\\" We included all patients with hip fractures, but excluded pathological fractures and other non-traumatic hip pathologies. Four-hundred and eighty-one articles were identified for screening, in addition to an unpublished case-series of 67 patients that have 3 cases turned positive for COVID 19, yielding a total of 50patients for the final review. Results: The study included 4 articles published until May 9th 2020 and a case-series: 26(52%) patients were females; the median age was 86years; hypertension(53.6%), diabetes mellitus type II(28.6%), and coronary artery heart disease(25%) were the most common comorbidities; 34(68%) patients had intertrochanteric hip fracture and 16(32%) patients had femoral neck fractures; 22(59.5%) patients underwent cephalomedullary nail fixation, 12(32.4%) patients had hemiarthroplasty, and for 3(8.1%) patients, the type of surgery was not documented; 20(40%) patients died(12patients died before the surgery and 8died after surgery at a median time of 3days), 29(76.3%) patients had an unremarkable course throughout hospitalization and were discharged including 1(2.6%) patient managed non-operatively, and 1(2.6%) patient was admitted to the ICU after the surgery but eventually discharged.

Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the virus genetic material has been widely used, it still presents practical difficulties such as high cost, shortage of available reagents in the global market, need of a specialized laboratorial infrastructure and well-trained staff. These limitations result in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance blackouts across several countries.

Twelve COVID-19 samples from Brazilian patients were evaluated for both WGS and Sanger sequencing: three P.2, two P.1, six B.1.1 and one B.1.1.117 lineage. All results from the Sanger sequencing method perfectly matched the mutational profile of VOCs and non-VOCs RBD's characterized by WGS.

METHODS: This study was undertaken at two large teaching hospitals in the UK. Pharmacy staff attended local departmental focus groups. Staff attendance included pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy assistants representing all pharmacy services including aseptics, ward-based services, dispensary/distribution and procurement. Responses were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 138 pharmacy staff attended the departmental focus groups. This study identified which pharmacy-related changes implemented in the first wave will be beneficial to take forward into a second wave. These included extending the hours of the pharmacy service to critical care, retaining the competence of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians redeployed to critical care during wave 1, development of standard operating procedures for changes in practice, delivering/posting of dispensed outpatient medication to patients' place of residence, maintenance of ward-based pharmacy services, use of the healthcare app PANDO to aid team communication, utilisation of remote-controlled drug ordering, deployment of a COVID-19 ward stocklist, procurement of ready-made bags/prefilled syringes of critical care medications, aligning the central intravenous additive service with critical care demand to reduce waste and establishment of a pharmacy response in line with the hospital's implementation plan. CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided a number of recommendations for how hospital pharmacy departments may respond to a global pandemic. These experiences derived from the pharmacy departments at two large UK NHS Trusts may be used by other healthcare providers to help inform the pharmacy response to a global pandemic.","output":"Hospital pharmacy response to COVID-19 at two UK teaching hospitals: a departmental review of actions implemented to inform future strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Health-care workers (HCW) are at risk for psychological distress during an infectious disease outbreak, such as the coronavirus pandemic, due to the demands of dealing with a public health emergency. This rapid systematic review examined the factors associated with psychological distress among HCW during an outbreak. Method: We systematically reviewed literature on the factors associated with psychological distress (demographic characteristics, occupational, social, psychological, and infection-related factors) in HCW during an outbreak (COVID-19, SARS, MERS, H1N1, H7N9, and Ebola). Four electronic databases were searched (2000 to 15 November 2020) for relevant peer-reviewed research according to a pre-registered protocol. A narrative synthesis was conducted to identify fixed, modifiable, and infection-related factors linked to distress and psychiatric morbidity. Results: From the 4,621 records identified, 138 with data from 143,246 HCW in 139 studies were included. All but two studies were cross-sectional. The majority of the studies were conducted during COVID-19 (k = 107, N = 34,334) and SARS (k = 21, N = 18,096). Consistent evidence indicated that being female, a nurse, experiencing stigma, maladaptive coping, having contact or risk of contact with infected patients, and experiencing quarantine, were risk factors for psychological distress among HCW. Personal and organizational social support, perceiving control, positive work attitudes, sufficient information about the outbreak and proper protection, training, and resources, were associated with less psychological distress. Conclusions: This review highlights the key factors to the identify HCW who are most at risk for psychological distress during an outbreak and modifying factors to reduce distress and improve resilience. Recommendations are that HCW at risk for increased distress receive early interventions and ongoing monitoring because there is evidence that HCW distress can persist for up to 3 years after an outbreak. Further research needs to track the associations of risk and resilience factors with distress over time and the extent to which certain factors are inter-related and contribute to sustained or transient distress.","output":"Factors Associated With Psychological Distress in Health-Care Workers During an Infectious Disease Outbreak: A Rapid Systematic Review of the Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wild meat or bushmeat has long served as a principal source of protein and a key contributor to the food security of millions of people across the developing world, most notably in Africa, Latin America and Asia. More recently, however, growing human populations, technological elaborations and the emergence of a booming commercial bushmeat trade have culminated in unprecedented harvest rates and the consequent decline of numerous wildlife populations. Most research efforts aimed at tackling this problem to date have been rooted in the biological disciplines, focused on quantifying the trade and measuring its level of destruction on wildlife and ecosystems. Comparatively little effort, on the other hand, has been expended on illuminating the role of bushmeat in human livelihoods and in providing alternative sources of food and income, as well as the infrastructure to make these feasible. This paper aims to shift the focus to the human dimension, emphasising the true contributions of bushmeat to food security, nutrition and well-being, while balancing this perspective by considering the far-reaching impacts of overexploitation. What emerges from this synthesis is that bushmeat management will ultimately depend on understanding and working with people, with any approaches focused too narrowly on biodiversity preservation running the risk of failure in the long term. If wildlife is to survive and be utilised in the future, there is undoubtedly a need to relax adherence to unswerving biocentric or anthropocentric convictions, to appreciate the necessity for certain trade-offs and to develop integrated and flexible approaches that reconcile the requirements of both the animals and the people.","output":"The bushmeat and food security nexus: A global account of the contributions, conundrums and ethical collisions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As COVID-19 Omicron variant spread in several countries, healthcare workers' (HCWs) perceptions of vaccine effectiveness, booster and worries warrant reassessment. Methods: Online questionnaire among HCWs in Saudi Arabia (KSA) was collected between Dec 1-6, 2021, aiming to assess their Omicron variant's perceptions, worries, and booster-vaccine advocacy. Results: Among the 1285 HCWs participants in the study, two-thirds were females, 41% were nurses,46.4% were physicians, and 50% worked in tertiary care hospitals. Vaccination was perceived to be the most effective way to prevent the spread of Omicron variant and future variants by 66.9%. The respondents perceived social distancing (78%), universal masking (77.8%), and avoiding unnecessary travel (71.4%), slightly superior to vaccination to prevent COVID-19 variants spread. Of the respondents, 99.5% received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding the booster dose, 96% either received it or planned to receive it once they are eligible. 57.7% of the respondents agreed that Omicron could cause a new COVID-19 wave worldwide, 45.9% agreed it may cause another COVID-19 wave in Saudi Arabia and 46.1% indicated the possibility of another lockdown. Overall, the HCWs worry level of the Omicron variant correlated significantly and strongly with their perception of the effectiveness of vaccination and preventive measures. Male HCWs had a significant agreement with mandatory vaccination of all eligible adult populations while HCWs who are unwilling to receive the vaccine had a strong disagreement with mandatory vaccination. Conclusions: The current study was conducted in the first week of Omicron variant discovery in KSA and only two-thirds of HCWs felt that vaccination is the best option to prevent the variant spread, indicating the need to further motivation campaigns for vaccination and booster doses education among HCWs. HCWs had a strong belief in non-pharmacologic interventions that should be encouraged and augmented. It is important to further study and enhance coping strategies for HCWs as we move through the third year of the pandemic with more potential variants, to protect HCWs from fatigue and burnout.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant: healthcare workers' perceptions and beliefs of vaccine effectiveness and advocacy: a national survey during the first week of the World Health Organization variant alert"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess the risk of COVID-19 foreign imports cases to China.

It is not well understood how hospitals have managed VTE prevention and the effect of prevention strategies on mortality. OBJECTIVE: To characterize frequency, variation across hospitals, and change over time in VTE prophylaxis and treatment-dose anticoagulation in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, as well as the association of anticoagulation strategies with in-hospital and 60-day mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 used a pseudorandom sample from 30 US hospitals in the state of Michigan participating in a collaborative quality initiative. Data analyzed were from patients hospitalized between March 7, 2020, and June 17, 2020. Data were analyzed through March 2021. EXPOSURES: Nonadherence to VTE prophylaxis (defined as missing 2 days of VTE prophylaxis) and receipt of treatment-dose or prophylactic-dose anticoagulants vs no anticoagulation during hospitalization. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The effect of nonadherence and anticoagulation strategies on in-hospital and 60-day mortality was assessed using multinomial logit models with inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Of a total 1351 patients with COVID-19 included (median [IQR] age, 64 [52-75] years; 47.7% women, 48.9% Black patients), only 18 (1.3%) had a confirmed VTE, and 219 (16.2%) received treatment-dose anticoagulation. Use of treatment-dose anticoagulation without imaging ranged from 0% to 29% across hospitals and increased over time (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.31-1.61 per week). Of 1127 patients who ever received anticoagulation, 392 (34.8%) missed 2 or more days of prophylaxis. Missed prophylaxis varied from 11% to 61% across hospitals and decreased markedly over time (aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.97 per week). VTE nonadherence was associated with higher 60-day (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03-1.67) but not in-hospital mortality (aHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.91-1.03). Receiving any dose of anticoagulation (vs no anticoagulation) was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (only prophylactic dose: aHR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.26-0.52; any treatment dose: aHR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25-0.58). However, only the prophylactic dose of anticoagulation remained associated with lower mortality at 60 days (prophylactic dose: aHR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90; treatment dose: aHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.63-1.35). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This large, multicenter cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, found evidence of rapid dissemination and implementation of anticoagulation strategies, including use of treatment-dose anticoagulation. As only prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was associated with lower 60-day mortality, prophylactic dosing strategies may be optimal for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","output":"Trends in Venous Thromboembolism Anticoagulation in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The potential ability for weather to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been an area of controversial discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals perceptions of the impact of weather can inform their adherence to public health guidelines; however, there is no measure of their perceptions. We quantified Twitter users perceptions of the effect of weather and analyzed how they evolved with respect to real-world events and time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 166,005 English tweets posted between January 23 and June 22, 2020 and employed machine learning/natural language processing techniques to filter for relevant tweets, classify them by the type of effect they claimed, and identify topics of discussion. RESULTS: We identified 28,555 relevant tweets and estimate that 40.4% indicate uncertainty about weathers impact, 33.5% indicate no effect, and 26.1% indicate some effect. We tracked changes in these proportions over time. Topic modeling revealed major latent areas of discussion. DISCUSSION: There is no consensus among the public for weathers potential impact. Earlier months were characterized by tweets that were uncertain of weathers effect or claimed no effect; later, the portion of tweets claiming some effect of weather increased. Tweets claiming no effect of weather comprised the largest class by June. Major topics of discussion included comparisons to influenzas seasonality, President Trumps comments on weathers effect, and social distancing.

Clinical presentation and imaging findings of metastatic broad ligament LMS are often nonspecific. Complete excision plays an important role in treatment of patients with localized LMS. CASE PRESENTATION Here, we report a case of a 33-year-old woman with recurrent broad ligament LMS metastasizing to pancreas and thigh. Previously, she was diagnosed with broad ligament LMS and underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The disease-free interval was 2.5 years until metastases were found. Computerized tomography (CT) of abdomen and thighs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of thighs and whole-body 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) performed, revealed pancreatic and thigh metastasis. Ultrasonography-guided biopsy and histological examinations confirmed LMS at both the sites. Pancreatic metastasis was completely resected first. Then the patient underwent surgical resection of thigh metastasis when both chemotherapy and radiotherapy failed. She recovered well and remained free of disease recurrence in the 2 years follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Though imaging lacks specificity, it is a valuable asset in assessing the burden of disease and characterizing lesions while histological examination with immunohistochemistry is helpful for the diagnosis of LMS. Complete surgical resection of all metastatic sites where-ever feasible should be strongly considered in a treated case of broad ligament LMS with a durable disease-free interval.","output":"Recurrent broad ligament leiomyosarcoma with pancreatic and thigh metastasis: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: This review aims to critically assess current knowledge about the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of Fasciola infection in humans. RECENT FINDINGS: Fascioliasis is an emerging neglected zoonotic infection affecting the health and wellbeing of human populations. The burden of infection is unclear, and studies have shown the geographic expansion of fascioliasis in human and livestock likely related to climate change. The infection can be asymptomatic or present in acute or chronic forms. Regardless of the presentation, fascioliasis can be associated with long-term complications such as anemia and malnutrition. Early in the infection, antibody testing is the only tool available for diagnosis confirmation. In the chronic forms serology and stool microscopy are helpful. Other tests such as antigen detection and PCR-based methods including isothermal tests have shown promising results. Triclabendazole is the only drug available to treat Fasciola infection. However, reports of resistant infections in livestock and human threaten the clinical care and control of the infection in endemic areas.

So far, no therapeutics have yet proven to be effective. Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in China because of its in vitro activity. However, evidence supporting its clinical use with good efficacy is still lacking. Methods A total of 208 confirmed severe COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in Wuhan Union West Campus between 1 February 2020 and 10 March 2020 were enrolled in the retrospective study. Patients were divided into two groups based on the use of ribavirin. The primary endpoint was the time to clinical improvement. The secondary endpoints included mortality, survival time, time to throat swab SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negative conversion, and the length of hospital stay.

Therefore, social protective measures, beyond medical protective measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, border closures, and human tracing are initiated to control the spread of COVID-19. Such responses have produced secondary issues such as drastic changes in peoples way of life and work, housing instability, economic shock, and privacy issues. This paper examines the four domains of urban and regional issues related to the secondary impact of COVID-19, including (1) social distancing, urban structure, community, and density; (2) housing affordability; (3) lockdowns, border closures, reshoring, and regional economic recovery; and (4) smart city technology, contact tracing, and privacy. The following six recommendations have been proposed. First, institutional and cultural factors are more important than urban features, such as population density. To handle infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it is important to build systems, technology, infrastructure, and urban structures that can strengthen resilience instead of implementing a directionless policy of dispersion. Second, it is necessary to improve accessibility to essential services at the community level, including medical facilities and food supply. Third, continuous effort should be made to boost housing affordability, as it is directly related to peoples basic life. Fourth, measures are needed to protect those people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. There is also the need to restore global trade and economic relations. Fifth, since data technology-based COVID-19 control raises the human tracing and privacy issue, we must ensure the principles of privacy management, such as transparency and voluntary consent, are being met. Finally, since COVID-19 is spread through people, individuals may become anxious and fearful of others without grounds; this may increase prejudice and hatred, including xenophobia.

Methods This multi-centered retrospective study collected the information of 631 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at 28 authorized hospitals in Jiangsu province between January 23, 2019 and March 13, 2020. Epidemiological and demographic information, clinical and radiological characteristics, laboratory results and treatment of these patients were analyzed. Results A total of 583 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for final analysis, including 84 severe-critically ill patients and 499 mild-moderate patients. Median age of the severe-critically ill patients was 57.0 years [interquartile range (IQR), 49.0-65.8], and 50 (59.5%) were males. Multisystemic laboratory abnormalities were observed on admission in severe-critically ill patients. The severe-critically ill patients showed more noticeable radiologic abnormalities and more coexisting health issues as compared to mild-moderate patients. Most of the severe-critically ill COVID-19 patients become deteriorated in two weeks after diagnosis.

In addition, targeting of tumor neoantigens with TCR-engineered T cell therapy moves the field towards a highly personalized treatment, as tumor neoantigens derive from somatic mutations and are extremely patient-specific. Therefore, relevant TCRs have to be de novo identified for each patient and within a narrow time window.

SDN has a unique core-shell structure consisting of photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6)-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier (CeNLC) (virus core)@poly(allylamine hydrochloride)-functionalized MnO2 nanoparticles (virus spike), generating a virus-mimicking nanocomplex. SDN not only prompted cellular uptake through rough-surface-mediated endocytosis but also achieved mitochondrial accumulation by the interaction of cationic spikes and the anionic mitochondrial surface, leading to mitochondria-specific photodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, SDN could even mediate oxygen generation to relieve tumor hypoxia and, consequently, improve macrophage-associated anticancer immune response. Importantly, SDN served as a robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent due to the fast release of Mn2+ in the presence of intracellular redox components. We identified that SDN selectively accumulated in tumors and released Mn2+ to generate a 5.71-fold higher T1-MRI signal, allowing for effectively detecting suspected tumors. Particularly, SDN induced synergistic immunophotodynamic effects to eliminate malignant tumors with minimal adverse effects.

Residuals effect from surgery/anaesthesia and opioid analgesics may worsen respiration during the first nights after bariatric surgery. The aim of this observational study was to monitor respiration on the first postoperative night following elective bariatric surgery. Methods: This observational study aimed to determine the incidence and severity of hypo/apnoea in low risk obsess patients undergoing elective bariatric surgery in general anesthaesia. Patients with known or suspected sleep respiratory disturbances was not included. ESS was scored prior to surgery. Oxygen desaturation was analyzed by continuous respiratory monitoring. Mean oxygen saturation (SpO2), nadir SPo2, apnoea/hypopnea index and oxygen desaturation index was assess by standard tools. Results: 45 patients were monitored with portable polygraphy equipment (Embletta, ResMed) during the first postoperative night at the general ward following elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The prop ESS was 0-5 in 22, 6-10 in 14 and 11-16 in 6 of the patients studied (missing data 3). Mean SpO2 was 93%; 10 patients had a mean SpO2 of less than 92% and 4 of less than 90%. The lowest mean SpO2 was 87%. There were 16 patients with a nadir SpO2 of less than 85%, lowest nadir SpO2 being 63%. An Apnoea Hypo/apnoea Index (AHI) > 5 was found in 2 patients only (AHI 10 and 6), and an Oxygen Desaturation index (ODI) > 5 was found in 3 patients (24, 10 and 6, respectively). 3 patients had more prolonged (> 30 seconds) apnoea with nadir SpO2 81%, 83% and 86%.

Methods The study examined different capacities in the context of the health system as the central prerequisite of health system resilience. We compared health policies and services responses in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK. The selection is based on differences in types of health care systems and pandemic burdens in the first wave. Country experts complied descriptive case studies using written secondary and primary sources. Results During the first wave of the pandemic, the contribution of the health workforce rested on a broad range of capacities. The absorptive capacity concerned the freeing up capacities for newly established Covid-19 wards in hospitals. The adaptive capacity focused on increasing health workers. The transformative capacity concerned new service offerings. The influence of health systems was most visible in relation to the substantive areas of health care delivery at play, and less so in relation to the specific range of capacities of the health workforce. The lack of distinct patterns was striking, considering the inclusion of health systems, which differ on many counts. Conclusions The study calls for a reconceptualization of the institutional perquisites of health system resilience to grasp more fully the manifold and unique health workforce contribution. Governance is the key to effective health system responses to the COVID-19 crisis, and health professions are part and parcel of governance as frontline workers and collective actors.

Over the past few decades, the spread of allergic diseases has displayed an increasing trend, and it has been reported that 22% of 1.39 billion people in 30 countries have a type of allergic disease. Undoubtedly, allergic diseases, which can be chronic, with significant morbidity, mortality and dynamic progression, impose major economic burdens on society and families; thus, exploring the cause of allergic diseases and reducing their prevalence is a top priority. Recently, it has been reported that the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota can provide vital signals for the development, function, and regulation of the immune system, and the above-mentioned contributions make the GI microbiota a key player in allergic diseases. Notably, the GI microbiota is highly influenced by the mode of delivery, infant diet, environment, antibiotic use and so on. Specifically, changes in the environment can result in the dysbiosis of the GI microbiota. The proper function of the GI microbiota depends on a stable cellular composition which in the case of the human microbiota consists mainly of bacteria. Large shifts in the ratio between these phyla or the expansion of new bacterial groups lead to a disease-promoting imbalance, which is often referred to as dysbiosis. And the dysbiosis can lead to alterations of the composition of the microbiota and subsequent changes in metabolism. Further, the GI microbiota can affect the physiological characteristics of the human host and modulate the immune response of the host. The objectives of this review are to evaluate the development of the GI microbiota, the main drivers of the colonization of the GI tract, and the potential role of the GI microbiota in allergic diseases and provide a theoretical basis as well as molecular strategies for clinical practice.","output":"Pathogenesis of Children's Allergic Diseases: Refocusing the Role of the Gut Microbiota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Literature suggests that urban regeneration policies might contribute towards improving mental health of residents, but to date there is a lack of empirical research on how these policies and downward social mobility can interact and influence health outcomes.

A missing piece of the puzzle is the current distribution and the genetic variation of PUUV in France, which has been overlooked until now and remains poorly understood. During a population survey, from 2008 to 2011, bank voles were trapped in eight different forests of France located in areas known to be endemic for NE or in area from where no NE case has been reported until now. Bank voles were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig)G ELISA serology and two seropositive animals for each of three different areas (Ardennes, Jura and Orleans) were then subjected to laboratory analyses in order to sequence the whole S, M and L segments of PUUV. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that French PUUV isolates globally belong to the central European (CE) lineage although isolates from Ardennes are clearly distinct from those in Jura and Orleans, suggesting a different evolutionary history and origin of PUUV introduction in France.

For many months, the only weapons to fight against this infection were protective masks and social isolation. During recent months, fear of the virus has led people to avoid crowded environments and events, and to reduce medical checks, limiting them only to emergencies. Outpatient clinics, doctors offices, and all closed-in environments were required to limit the patients access. Nowadays, the presence of specific protocols around the world, and the extended vaccination campaign, have allowed a reduction of many restrictions. Unfortunately, the virus is still widespread, and dental practice and dental treatments suffer the consequences. Dental therapies in general, and in particular orthodontics, are not considered lifesaving. Due to this, orthodontists, in this historical time, must find solutions for motivating patients to start or continue therapies, while providing a safe way for them to do so. There are orthodontists who have developed, during this period, different ways to help them in treating and communicating with patients. Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the influence of the pandemic on the choice to start orthodontic treatment, oral health care, and the importance placed on the appearance of dental occlusions. Materials and Methods: This study is a survey analysis of 159 people, which was posted in Facebook groups of adult orthodontic patients. The timestamps and answers of responses were analyzed to avoid duplicated or interrupted questionnaires.

Conclusions about HRQL are difficult to make as the participants are likely drawn from different countries. A global estimate of HRQL with estimates of variation would permit pooling of data from diverse sources. The aim was to estimate a global HRQL score of typically developing children and adolescents on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL?) and to identify sources of variation across studies. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in December 2018 on four databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Inclusion criteria were all population health studies or validation studies using the self-report version of the PedsQL? for typically developing children aged 5 to 18 years. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted. RESULTS A total of 66 studies with a sample size of 67,805 participants were included in this analysis. The average QOL score across all studies was 80.9 (CI 78.6-83.2). Univariate analyses showed that region, minimum age of sample and income of country, was associated with the total HRQL score. Subgroup analysis showed that there was an effect of age and region on HRQL scores. CONCLUSION Results of this review provide ranges of pediatric HRQL across personal factors and regions that can be used for normative comparisons of HRQL. Interpretation of scores on generic measures should always take into consideration the contextual influences in the child's life.

There are no sequence or structure requirements to encapsidate single-stranded nucleic acid cargo. In this work, we wanted to determine how the length of the cargo impacts the stability and structure of the assembled CLPs. We hypothesized that cargo neutralizes the basic region of the alphavirus capsid protein and if the cargo is long enough, it will also act to scaffold the CP monomers together. Experimentally we found that CLPs encapsidating short 27mer oligonucleotides were less stable than CLPs encapsidating 48mer or 90mer oligonucleotides under different chemical and thermal conditions. Furthermore, cryo-EM studies showed there were structural differences between CLPs assembled with 27mer and 48mer cargo. To mimic the role of the cargo in CLP assembly we made a mutant (4D) where we substituted a cluster of four Lys residues in the CP with four Asp residues. We found that these few amino acid substitutions were enough to initiate CLP assembly in the absence of cargo. The cargo-free 4D CLPs show higher resistance to ionic strength and increased temperature compared to wild-type cargo containing CLPs suggesting their CLP assembly mechanism might also be different.","output":"Length of encapsidated cargo impacts stability and structure of in vitro assembled alphavirus core-like particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The enforcement of lockdowns and restrictions on non-essential contact have changed Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) practice. Therefore, this audit carried out its 4th cycle of physical health monitoring for patients on antipsychotics with severe mental illness (SMI) under the CMHT during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to observe its impact on physical health monitoring. In addition, with the increased use of telepsychiatry substituting routine face-to-face appointments during the pandemic, this audit also reviews the effect of lockdown on maintenance of contact between CMHT and people with SMI. Primary Objective: to compare the current clinical practice with the standards derived from NICE guidelines which include parameters like weight, body-mass index, blood pressure, ECG and blood tests, then compare with the previous three audit cycles, which collected identical data. Secondary Objective: to monitor amount of contact between healthcare staff and people with SMI on antipsychotics during the three months of Welsh lockdown and compare current clinical practice with the clinical practice achieved in the identical period in 2019. METHOD: Method for Primary Objective: Clinical practice on physical health checks were split into 10 standards derived from the NICE guidelines (NICEQS80, Quality Standard 6). Data collection surrounding physical health checks of patients on antipsychotics from 26th June 2019 to 26th June 2020 were collected and compared with the previous three audit cycles, which collected identical data. Method for Secondary Objective: Retrospective data surrounding amount and type of contact between CMHT and people with SMI was collected from 26th March 2020 to 26th June 2020, a period of enforced lockdown in Wales, and compared with the identical period in 2019. RESULT: The audit iterates trends over the last 4 cycles (2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019 and 2019/2020). The current audit cycle increased in 2/10 standards and decreased in 8/10 standards, compared with the average compliance in the 3 previous audit cycles. Out of the 10 derived standards, certain standards fared worse than others. There was a 79% increase in the number of staff-patient contact during the lockdown period.

We derive an effective Markovian theory to model the resulting decay dynamics of an arbitrary distribution of emitters and identify collective effects beyond the usual phenomena of super- and subradiance. Specifically, in the limit of many close-by emitters, we find that the system undergoes a supercorrelated decay process where all the emitters are either in the excited state or in the ground state but not in any of the intermediate states.

All the children <18 years admitted, between March 9th and May 3rd 2020 stratified by age, priority code, cause of admission and outcome have been included and compared to those admitted in the same period of 2019. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics of pediatric admissions to EDs since COVID-19 outbreak until the end of lockdown, and to describe the features of critical children. Findings 16,426 children were admitted in 2020, compared to 55,643 in 2019 (-7048%). Higher reduction was reported in hospitals without Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) (-7338%) than in those with PICU (-6408%) (P<00001). Admissions with low priority decreased more than critical ones (-8277% vs. 4417% respectively; P<00001). Reduction of discharged patients was observed both in hospitals with (-6650%) and without PICU (-7465%) (P<00001).

METHODS: Here, by using the live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection assay as well as HIV-1 based pseudotyped-virus carrying the spike (S) gene of the SARS-CoV-2 (ppSARS-2) and SARS-CoV (ppSARS), we examined whether infections with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can induce cross-neutralizing antibodies. FINDINGS: We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and we also found that the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein of SARS-CoV effectively inhibits ppSARS-2 entry in Huh7.5 cells. However, convalescent sera from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 patients showed high neutralizing activity only against the homologous virus, with no or limited cross-neutralization activity against the other pseudotyped virus. Similar results were also observed in vaccination studies in mice. INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates that although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as a cellular receptor, the neutralization epitopes are not shared by these two closely-related viruses, highlighting challenges towards developing a universal vaccine against SARS-CoV related viruses.

PRRSV infection induced both lung and gut injury, markedly decreased villus height and the villus to crypt ratio in the small intestine, and obviously increased the number of goblet cells and the relative expression of MUC2 mRNA in the jejunum. PRRSV infection aggravated the morphological depletion of tight junction proteins and increased IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF- expression by activating the NF-B signalling pathway in the jejunum.

Polish haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) isolates are usually low pathogenic and trigger a subclinical disease. Unfortunately, even the low- pathogenic HEV strains cause severe immunosuppression leading to secondary bacterial infections and huge economic losses. The objective of this study was to evaluate if the influence of Met on HEV infected turkeys immune response can be differentiated by both its level and source. Met is one of the amino acids that not only play a nutritional role but also participate in and regulate key metabolic pathways and immune response. In our study, the birds were assigned to 4 dietary treatments which differed in Met levels (0.55 and 0.78% in weeks 1C4 of age and 0.45 and 0.65% in weeks 5C8 of age, respectively) and sources (DL-methionine (DLM) or DL-methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA)). RESULTS: The HEV added the percentage of CD4(+) cells and decreased the percentage of IgM(+) cells in the blood, spleen and caecal tonsils (CTs) of turkeys. In addition, it increased the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells in blood, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) level in plasma. The higher dose of Met led to a significant decrease in the percentages of CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD4(+)IL-6(+) cell subpopulations in the blood of HEV-infected and uninfected turkeys and to an increase in the percentage of IgM(+) B cells in CTs. Turkeys administered feeds with an increased Met content displayed a decrease in plasma IL-6 levels and an increase in plasma IgA levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that HEV infection impairs the immune function in turkeys. Met content in the feed has a moderate effect on the immune response in HEV-infected turkeys. The source of this amino acid appears not be as important as its dose, because value of the analysed parameters did not differ significantly between turkeys receiving feeds with DLM or MHA. In the uninfected turkeys, the higher by 40% (than recommended by NRC) level of Met in the feeds had a positive effect on humoral immunity parameters.","output":"The immune response of young turkeys to haemorrhagic enteritis virus infection at different levels and sources of methionine in the diet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic prevails as an ultimatum to the global economic growth and henceforth, all of society since neither a curing drug nor a preventing vaccine is discovered.

Subsequently, the prediction of cumulative confirmed, death and recovered global cases are modelled with Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) and Prophet approaches. For long-term forecasting of COVID 19 cases, multivariate LSTM models employed. The performance metrics are computed for all the models and the prediction results are subjected to comparative analysis to identify the most reliable model. From the results, it is evident that the Stacked LSTM algorithm yields higher accuracy with an error of less than 2% compared to the other considered algorithms for the studied performance metrics. Country-specific analysis of India and city-specific analysis of Chennai COVID-19 cases are predicted and analyzed in detail. Also, statistical hypothesis analysis and correlation analysis are done on the COVID 19 datasets by including the features like temperature, rainfall, population, total infected cases, area and population density during the months of May, June, July and August to find out the best suitable model. Further, Practical significance of predicting COVID-19 cases is elucidated in terms of assessing pandemic characteristics, scenario planning, optimization of models and supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","output":"Forecasting of COVID-19 cases using Deep learning models: Is it reliable and practically significant?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents evidence of an informational effect in changes of the federal funds rate around FOMC announcements by exploiting exchange rate variations for a panel of emerging economies.

We also identify interrelations between pairs of action controls that are moderated by WFH. Finally, we examine the effect of WFH on employee outcomes. Our findings suggest that WFH has increased the time employees spend in meetings as well as employee job focus and decreased the remaining working hours per day. We also find that effectively adjusted action controls can offset negative effects of WFH.

Methods: The study was based on results from COVIDiet_Int cross-sectional studya part of COVIDiet project (NCT04449731). A self-administered online questionnaire was used to assess the frequency of food consumption, eating habits, and sociodemographic information. A total number of 4,281 participants (80.5% females and 19.4% males) completed the questionnaire. Results: The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) score before the confinement was 5.02  1.97, while during the confinement, the MEDAS score increased to 5.85  2.04. Participants who had higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) during the confinement were mostly females (88.8%), aged between 20 and 50 years, with the highest level of education (66.3%) and normal BMI (70.6%). The majority of participants maintained their dietary behavior as it was before COVID-19 confinement, while 36.9% decreased their physical activity. Participants with higher MEDAS score were more eager to increase their physical activity. Additionally, higher median values of MEDAS score were noted for participants with body mass index values below 24.9 kg/m(2) (6.0 vs. 5.0 for participants with BMI above 25 kg/m(2)). Participants in all residence places increased their cooking frequency during the confinement (53.8%), which was associated with an increase in vegetables, legumes, as well as fish and seafood consumption. Conclusions: According to our findings, Croatian adults exhibited medium adherence to the MedDiet during the COVID-19 confinement. The results suggest that cooking frequency could be positively associated with overall dietary quality, which is of utmost importance in these demanding times.","output":"Cooking at Home and Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet During the COVID-19 Confinement: The Experience From the Croatian COVIDiet Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The reported association between an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and the risk for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains controversial despite the publication of four meta-analyses on this topic. Here, we updated the meta-analysis with more studies and additional assessments that include adults and children within the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Sixteen articles (22 studies) were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using three genetic models (allele, recessive and dominant), in which ARDS patients were compared with non-ARDS patients (A1) and healthy controls (A2). Mortality outcomes were also assessed (A3). The influence of covariates was examined by meta-regression. Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple pooled associations. Subgroup analyses based on ethnicity (Asians, Caucasians) and life stage (adults, children) were conducted. Heterogeneity was addressed with outlier treatment. RESULTS: This meta-analysis generated 68 comparisons, 21 of which were significant. Of the 21, four A1 and three A3 highly significant (Pa = 0.00001-0.0008) outcomes withstood Bonferroni correction. For A1, allele and recessive associations were found in overall (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39-0.61), Caucasians (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35-0.61) and children (ORs 0.49-0.66, 95% CI 0.33-0.84) analyses. For A3, associations were found in overall (dominant: OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29-0.68) and Asian subgroup (allele/ dominant: ORs 0.31-0.39, 95% CIs 0.18-0.63) analyses. These outcomes were either robust, or statistically powered or both and uninfluenced by covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations of the ACE I/D polymorphism with the risk of ALI/ARDS were indicated in Caucasians and children as well as in Asians in mortality analysis. These findings were underpinned by high significance, high statistical power and robustness.

To better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, in this paper, we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-nCoV. For this purpose, we compare the codon usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae. We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host. Then, we study the evolutionary pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones. Taken together, our results suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV.","output":"Codon usage and evolutionary rates of the 2019-nCoV genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main purpose of this study is to identify the factors that contribute to teachers burnout during the COVID 19 pandemic in Ecuador.

OBJECTIVE: to assess the effects of the COVID-19 on the physical and mental health of non-health workers. DESIGN: observational descriptive cross-sectional study. DATA SOURCES: 1089 questionnaires have been analysed. Engagement (UWES-9), sense of coherence (SOC-13), mental health (Goldberg GHQ-12), demographic data, perception of health and stress and work environment were assessed. RESULTS: At low levels of engagement, the percentage of distress is higher (77.9%). Low levels of sense of coherence correspond to the highest percentages of distress (86.3%). The 94.1% believe it necessary for professionals and volunteers involved in COVID-19 to receive psychological support. Low comprehensibility is mediated by the perception of stress; if the perception is low, comprehensibility is modulated by the level of significance; if it is low, it generates 95.9% of distress. CONCLUSION: the interrelationship between the sense of coherence, work environment, work engagement, and psychological distress have particular interest in non-health workers who carried out essential activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We compared EL and ES for stump closure during LA for complicated appendicitis in children. METHODS All LA for complicated appendicitis performed between July 2005 and August 2009 were assessed prospectively. EL were used in 37 procedures and ES in 31. Apart from choice of technique which was the personal preference of the attending surgeon, all patients were managed according to the same intraoperative and postoperative protocols. RESULTS There was no significant difference between mean age at operation; gender ratio; mean preoperative and postoperative white blood cell; mean preoperative and postoperative white blood cell C-reactive protein; histopathology; mean operating time (EL: 71 minutes; ES: 64 minutes); mean hospitalization (EL: 5.3 days; ES: 5.1 days); febrile period (EL: 2.1 days; ES: 1.9 days); white blood cell normalization (EL: 2.6 days; ES: 2.4 days); and intravenous antibiotic usage (EL: 3.8 days; ES: 3.7 days). There were no intraoperative complications or ICU admissions in either group, but two EL cases required conversion to open surgery (P=NS). Incidences of intra-abdominal abscess (EL: n=1 or 2.7%; ES: n=1 or 3.2%), transient ileus (EL: n=2 or 5.4%; ES: n=2 or 6.4%), small bowel obstruction (EL: n=0; ES: n=0), and wound infection (EL: n=1 or 2.7%; ES: n=1 or 3.2 %) were not significantly different. Rate of rehospitalization for EL was 2.7% (n=1; colitis), and for ES, it was 3.2% (n=1; intra-abdominal abscess) (P=NS). Mean cost for EL was US$890, and for ES, it was US$1300.

The safety of PVP-I topically applied to the nasal and oral cavity is addressed by a literature review. The specific efficacy of PVP-I against coronaviruses and its potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is discussed. METHODS: A review was performed utilizing PubMed and Cochrane Databases. All citations in protocols for nasal and oral PVP-I use regarding COVID-19 were independently reviewed. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine has been safely administered for up to 5 months in the nasal cavity and 6 months in the oral cavity. Concentrations less than 2.5% in vitro do not reduce ciliary beat frequency or cause pathological changes in ciliated nasal epithelium, upper respiratory, or mucosal cells. Adverse events with oral use have not been reported in conscious adults or children. Allergy and contact sensitivity is rare. Chronic mucosal use up to 5% has not been shown to result in clinical thyroid disease. PVP-I is rapidly virucidal and inactivates coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

It also brings a challenge for privacy protection techniques: how can we leverage people's mobile data to help combat the pandemic without scarifying our location privacy. We demonstrate that we can have the best of the two worlds by implementing policy-based location privacy for epidemic surveillance.

With effective treatment options available, education and testing strategies are essential in preventing transmission. Text messaging is an effective tool for health promotion and can be used to target higher risk populations. This study reports on the design, delivery and testing of a mobile text messaging SMS intervention for HIV prevention and awareness, aimed at adults in the construction industry and delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Participants were recruited at Test@Work workplace health promotion events (21 sites, n=464 employees), including health checks with HIV testing. Message development was based on a participatory design and included a focus group (n=9) and message fidelity testing (n=291) with assessment of intervention uptake, reach, acceptability, and engagement. Barriers to HIV testing were identified and mapped to the COM-B behavioural model. 23 one-way push SMS messages (19 included short web links) were generated and fidelity tested, then sent via automated SMS to two employee cohorts over a 10-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Engagement metrics measured were;opt-outs, SMS delivered/read, number of clicks per web link, and four two-way pull messages exploring repeat HIV testing, learning new information, perceived usefulness and behaviour change. Results: 291 people participated (68.3% of eligible attendees). A total of 7,726 messages were sent between March and June 2020, with 91.6% successfully delivered (100% read). 12.4% of participants opted out over 10 weeks. Of delivered messages, links were clicked an average of 14.4%, max 24.1% for HIV related links. The number of clicks on web links declined over time (r= -6.24, p=0.01). Response rate for two-way pull messages was 13.7% of participants. Since the workplace HIV test offer at recruitment, 21.6% reported having taken a further HIV test. Qualitative replies indicated behavioural influence of messaging on exercise, lifestyle behaviours and intention to HIV test. Conclusion: SMS messaging for HIV prevention and awareness is acceptable to adults in the construction industry, has high uptake, low attrition and good engagement with message content, when delivered during a global pandemic.

Commonly reported enablers to swabbing were increasing community awareness and risk communication (80.8 %, n = 329), consistent and sufficient supplies of PPE (67.8 %, n = 276), increasing surge workforce (63.9 %, n = 260) and having a fridge to store swabs (59.7 %, n = 243). CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive community and HCWs engagement strategy in combination with innovations to improve supply chain are needed to increase COVID-19 swabbing in Papua New Guinea to reach national testing targets.","output":"Barriers and enablers experienced by health care workers in swabbing for COVID-19 in Papua New Guinea: a multi-methods cross-sectional study, November C December 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutralizing antibodies are critical to prevent corona virus infection. The structures of immunogens to elicit most potent neutralization antibodies are still under investigation. Here we tested the immunogenicity of the trimeric, full length Spike protein with 2 proline mutations to preserve its prefusion conformation. Recombinant trimeric Spike protein expressed by CHO cells was used with polyI:C (PIKA) adjuvant to immunize mice by 0-7-14 day schedule. The results showed that Spike-specific antibody was induced at day 21 with titer of more than 50,000 in average as measured by direct binding to Spike protein. The titer of neutralization reached more than 1000 in average when tested by a pseudo-virus system, using monoclonal antibodies (40592-MM57 and 40591-MM43) with neutralizing IC50 at 1 g/ml as standards. Protein/peptide array showed that the antibodies induced by trimeric S protein vaccine bind similarly to natural infection with the receptor binding domain (RBD) as major immunodominant region. No linear epitopes were found in RBD, although several linear epitopes were found in C-terminal domain right after RBD, and heptad repeat regions.

The primary outcome was 28-day clinical improvement, defined as two-category improvement from baseline on an 8-point ordinal scale. Propensity scores (PS) for favipiravir therapy were used for 1:1 matching. Cox regression was used to examine associations with the primary endpoint. Results The unmatched cohort included 1,493 patients, of which 51.7% were in the favipiravir group, and 48.3% were not receiving supplemental oxygen at baseline. Favipiravir was started within a median of 5 days from symptoms onset. Significant baseline differences between the two unmatched groups existed, but not between the PS-matched groups (N = 774). After PS-matching, there were no significant differences between the two groups in the proportion with 28-day clinical improvement (93.3% versus 92.8%, P 0.780), or 28-day all-cause mortality (2.1% versus 3.1%, P 0.360).

In this work, we have used a dataset that has captured six daily life activities of people from different locations during different times under realistic environments, unlike an regular controlled data collection environment. We have proposed a novel tower based convolutional neural network architecture that has employed parallel input layers with individual color channel images sent as inputs to the model. We have concatenated all the unique signature features from each channel to have better and robust feature representation to the model. We have analyzed the proposed model with different color spaces like RGB, LAB, HSV as inputs and found that our chosen input type performs better with the proposed model with significant test accuracy results.

Study participants included 65 survivors of childhood ALL who were <18 years of age at diagnosis, treated between years 1996 and 2008, and were at least two years since completion of therapy. The controls included 50 matched siblings. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to study the body composition (body fat percentage, BF% and lean body mass, LBM) of the participants and controls.

Standard IgG preparations were the first available for clinical use. They were produced by the cold-ethanol fractionation methods and did not make an exception. Noninfectious severe AEs occurred while infectious AEs were rarely reported. Indeed, prior to the introduction of mass screening for infection markers of plasma donations, inadvertent transmission of HIV to recipients of factor VIII and factor IX concentrates did occur, while IgG concentrates obtained from the same plasma pool did rarely transmit HIV (Morgenthaler 2001). Rare transmissions were restricted to products not exposed to low pH. The very few incidences of HIV and some incidences of HCV transmission by IgG concentrates in the early 1990s together with many cases of coagulation factor concentrates transmitted viral disease clearly demonstrated the need to establish standardized measures to render plasma products pathogen safe. In the second half of the 1990s, authorities shifted regulatory emphasis from a scientific review of the processes to a focus on compliance to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). The focus on cGMP compliance was applied to all aspects of plasma fractionation and the clinical use of plasma products. Court injunctions and warning letters were the consequences of this paradigm shift by authorities.

Research on SARS-CoV-2, as well as the closely related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses is restricted to BSL-3 facilities. Such BSL-3 classification makes SARS-CoV-2 research inaccessible to the majority of functioning research laboratories in the US;this becomes problematic when the collective scientific effort needs to be focused on such in the face of a pandemic. However, a minimal system capable of recapitulating different steps of the viral life cycle without using the virus' genetic material could increase accessibility. In this work, we assessed the four structural proteins from SARS-CoV-2 for their ability to form virus-like particles (VLPs) from human cells to form a competent system for BSL-2 studies of SARS-CoV-2. After establishing the minimal system requirements for VLP production, we examined their morphological relevance with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). VLPs produced with all four viral structural proteins were approximately 100 nm in diameter and bared the characteristic coronavirus crown or ?corona?. We next sought to evaluate the entry competency of our VLPs. GFP-tagged VLPs were generated by fluorescently tagging one of the four structural proteins used to produce VLPs. Once incorporation of the GFP-tagged protein into VLPs was confirmed, we used these GFP-VLPs to infect HEK293 cells. GFP-VLPs indeed did enter HEK293 cells and properly colocalized with endocytic markers Rab5 and LAMP1 in accordance with live virus data. To further evaluate viral entry, we made the VLP entry assay accessible to TEM analysis by replacing the GFP tag with an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) tag, which when oxidized produces a dark brown precipitate visible on micrographs. APEX2-VLPs were found to be entry-competent as well. In addition to entry, APEX2-VLPs yield the ability to visualize VLP assembly at the ER-Golgi intermediary complex (ERGIC) and for the first time we show localization of the structural proteins during SARS-CoV-2 VLP assembly, budding, and egress. In total, this research provides ample resources for other BSL-2 laboratories interested in joining the growing field to try and understand SARS-CoV-2 assembly, budding, and entry dynamics, biochemical and biophysical questions on the four structural proteins, and drug screening of viral assembly, budding, and/or entry inhibitors.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Viral Budding and Entry can be Modeled Using BSL-2 Level Virus-Like Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleoside analogs are a major class of antiviral drugs. Some act by increasing the viral mutation rate causing \\"death by mutagenesis\\" of the virus. Their mutagenic capacity, however, may lead to an evolutionary safety concern. We define evolutionary safety as a probabilistic assurance that the treatment will not generate an increased number of epidemiologically concerning mutated virus progeny. We develop a mathematical framework to estimate the total mutant load produced with and without mutagenic treatment. We predict rates of appearance of virus mutants as a function of the timing of treatment and the immune competence of patients, employing various assumptions about the vulnerability of the viral genome and its potential to generate undesired phenotypes. We focus on the case study of Molnupiravir, which is an FDA-approved treatment against COVID-19. We estimate that Molnupiravir is narrowly evolutionarily safe, subject to the current estimate of parameters. Evolutionary safety can be improved by restricting treatment to individuals with a low clearance rate and by designing treatments that lead to a greater increase in mutation rate. We report a simple rule to determine the fold-increase in mutation rate required to obtain evolutionary safety which is also applicable to other pathogen-treatment combinations.","output":"Evolutionary safety of death by mutagenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of new drugs is a time-taking and expensive process. Comprehensive efforts are being made globally toward the search of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ritonavir, and lopinavir have been included in the treatment regimen and shown effective results in several cases. Among the existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, remdesivir is found to be more effective against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir has broad-spectrum antiviral action against many single-stranded RNA viruses including pathogenic SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In this study, we proposed that remdesivir strongly binds to membrane protein (Mprotein), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), and main protease (Mprotease) of SARS-CoV-2. It might show antiviral activity by inhibiting more than one target. It has been found that remdesivir binds to Mprotease, Mprotein, and RDRP with ?7.8, ?7.4, and ?7.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The structure dynamics study suggested that binding of remdesivir leads to unfolding of RDRP. It has been found that strong binding of remdesivir to Mprotein leads to decrease in structural deviations and gyrations. Additionally, the average solvent-accessible surface area of Mprotein decreases from 127.17 to 112.12 nm(2), respectively. Furthermore, the eigenvalues and the trace of the covariance matrix were found to be low in case of MproteaseCremdesivir, MproteinCremdesivir, and RDRPCremdesivir. Binding of remdesivir to Mprotease, Mprotein, and RDRP reduces the average motions in protein due to its strong binding. The MMPBSA calculations also suggested that remdesivir has strong binding affinity with Mprotein, Mprotease, and RDRP.

Hyperinsulinemia, which characterizes IR, enhances sympathetic drive, and it can be hypothesized that IR is associated with impaired cardiac sympathetic innervation in HF. Yet, this hypothesis has never been investigated. Aim of the present observational study was to assess the relationship between IR and cardiac sympathetic innervation in non-diabetic HF patients. METHODS AND RESULTS One hundred and fifteen patients (87% males; 65  11.3 years) with severe-to-moderate HF (ejection fraction 32.5  9.1%) underwent iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy to assess sympathetic innervation and Homeostasis Model Assessment Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) evaluation to determine the presence of IR. From (123)I-MIBG imaging, early and late heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratios and washout rate were calculated. Seventy-two (63%) patients showed IR and 43 (37%) were non-IR. Early [1.68 (IQR 1.53-1.85) vs. 1.79 (IQR 1.66-1.95); P = 0.05] and late H/M ratio [1.50 (IQR 1.35-1.69) vs. 1.65 (IQR 1.40-1.85); P = 0.020] were significantly reduced in IR compared with non-IR patients. Early and late H/M ratio showed significant inverse correlation with fasting insulinemia and HOMA-IR.

Furthermore, the mean hysteresis time was calculated according to the median time from progression to the most serious situation to improve chest CT in patients after fever relief. The optimal scaling regression analysis was performed by including variables with statistical significance in univariate analysis. In addition, a multivariate regression model was established to investigate the relationship of the percentage of lesion/total lung volume with lymphocyte and other variables. RESULTS: In the included 166 patients with COVID-19, the average value of the most serious percentage of lesion/total lung volume was 6.62, of which 90 patients with fever had an average hysteresis time of 4.5 days after symptom relief, with a similar trend observed in those without fever. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymphocyte count in peripheral blood and transcutaneous oxygen saturation decreased with the increase of the percentage of lesion/total lung volume.

In different zip codes in New York City, the epicenter of the epidemic, the number of cases per 100,000 residents has varied between 437 and 4227, i.e., in a 1:10 ratio. To guide policy decisions regarding containment and reopening of the economy, schools, and other institutions, it is vital to identify which factors drive this large variation. This paper reports on a statistical study of the incidence variation across New York City, conducted with data at zip code granularity. Among many socio-economical and demographic measures considered, the average household size emerges as the single most important explanatory variable: an increase of the average household size by one member accounts, in our final model specification, for at least 876 cases, a full 23% of the span of incidence numbers, at a 95% confidence level. The percentage of the population above the age of 65, as well as that below the poverty line, are additional indicators with a significant impact on the case incidence rate, along with their interaction term. Contrary to common belief, population density, per se, fails to have a significantly positive impact. Indeed, population densities and case incidence rates are negatively correlated, with a -33% correlation coefficient.

RESULTS: Participants were willing to provide nursing care but worked in difficult environments, and their level of competence influenced how they engaged with these women. They realised that the lifeworld of the women made it difficult for them to disclose that they are experiencing gender-based violence. Participants emphasised the importance of multidisciplinary and multi-sectoral collaboration. A final theme, caring presence, also emerged. CONCLUSION: Participants felt compassion and were willing to provide nursing care. However, they experienced reluctance due to hindrances that limited them in connecting with and attuning to the women. This left them feeling frustrated, and with a deepened sense of empathy, as they realised how deeply the women are suffering. Recommendations were formulated. CONTRIBUTION: This study revealed nurses need to be guided in providing relational care to women who are experiencing gender-based violence. Based on the findings, it is recommended that infrastructure should be updated to ensure private and safe spaces for women, debriefing and training should be provided and multidisciplinary collaboration should be strengthened. Policy for improved referral systems, the assessment and management of women experiencing gender-based violence and the wellness of professional nurses should be developed.","output":"Professional nurses experience in providing nursing care to women experiencing gender-based violence: A caring presence study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, older and clinically vulnerable people were instructed to shield or stay at home. Policies restricting social contact and human interaction pose a risk to mental health, but we know very little about the impact of shielding and stay-at-home orders on the mental health of older people. AIMS: To understand the extent to which shielding contributes to poorer mental health. METHOD: We used longitudinal data from wave 9 (2018/2019) and two COVID-19 sub-studies (June/July 2020; November/December 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, and constructed logistic and linear regression models to investigate associations between patterns of shielding during the pandemic and mental health, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, pre-pandemic physical and mental health, and social isolation measures. RESULTS: By December 2020, 70% of older people were still shielding or staying at home, with 5% shielding throughout the first 9 months of the pandemic. Respondents who shielded experienced worse mental health. Although prior characteristics and lack of social interactions explain some of this association, even controlling for all covariates, those shielding throughout had higher odds of reporting elevated depressive symptoms (odds ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.22-2.87) and lower quality of life (? = -1.28, 95% CI -2.04 to -0.52) than those who neither shielded nor stayed at home. Shielding was also associated with increased anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Shielding seems associated with worse mental health among older people, highlighting the need for policy makers to address the mental health needs of those who shielded, both in the current pandemic and for the future.","output":"The impact of shielding during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online commerce in recent years has received a great development becoming a key element of all economic sectors.

Although working from home has been a conventional albeit infrequent behavior, the prevalence of this option was significantly and rapidly accelerated during the pandemic. This study explored the impacts of working from home on activity-travel behavior during the pandemic. Both work and non-work activity participation declined during the pandemic but to what extent was this due to working from home? How did working from home affect other measures of travel such as person-miles traveled? We approached these questions by developing a Structural Regression model and using cross-sectional data for the early phase of the pandemic when the infection curve was flattened and activity-travel behavior became relatively stable following the drastic changes observed during the pandemics initial shock. Combining U.S. county-level data from the Maryland Transportation Institute and Google Mobility Reports, we concluded that the proportion of people working from home directly depended on pandemic severity and associated public health policies as well as on a range of socio-economic characteristics. Working from home contributed to a reduction in workplace visits. It also reduced non-work activities but only via a reduction in non-work activities linked to work. Finally, a higher working from home proportion in a county corresponded to a reduction in average person-miles traveled. A higher degree of state government responses to containment and closure policies contributed to an increase in working from home, and decreases in workplace and non-workplace visits and person-miles traveled in a county. The results of this study provide important insights into changes in activity-travel behavior associated with working from home as a response strategy to major disruptions such as those imposed by a pandemic.","output":"Impact of Working from Home on Activity-travel Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Aggregate Structural Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate aerosol-spread in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using different methods of airway management.

The spread of the visualized aerosol was documented by a camera. In a second approach we applied nebulized detergents into human cadavers by an endotracheal tube and detected aerosol- spread during chest compressions the same way. We did recordings with undergoing compression- only-CPR, with a surgical mask and with an inserted laryngeal tube with and without a connected airway filter. Results: Most aerosol-spread at the direction of the provider was visualized during compression-only-CPR. The use of a surgical mask deflected the spread. Inserting a laryngeal tube connected to an airway filter lead to a remarkable reduction of aerosol-spread.

The existing research on the classification for COVID-19 cases faces the challenges of data imbalance, insufficient generalisability, the lack of comparative study, etc. To address these problems, this paper proposes a type of modified MobileNet to classify COVID-19 CXR images and a modified ResNet architecture for CT image classification. In particular, a modification method of convolutional neural networks (CNN) is designed to solve the gradient vanishing problem and improve the classification performance through dynamically combining features in different layers of a CNN. The modified MobileNet is applied to the classification of COVID-19, Tuberculosis, viral pneumonia (with the exception of COVID-19), bacterial pneumonia and normal controls using CXR images. Also, the proposed modified ResNet is used for the classification of COVID-19, non-COVID-19 infections and normal controls using CT images. The results show that the proposed methods achieve 99.6% test accuracy on the five-category CXR image dataset and 99.3% test accuracy on the CT image dataset. Six advanced CNN architectures and two specific COVID-19 detection models, i.e., COVID-Net and COVIDNet-CT are used in comparative studies. Two benchmark datasets and a CXR image dataset which combines eight different CXR image sources are employed to evaluate the performance of the above models. The results show that the proposed methods outperform the comparative models in classification accuracy, sensitivity, and precision, which demonstrate their potential in computer-aided diagnosis for healthcare applications.","output":"Classification of COVID-19 chest X-Ray and CT images using a type of dynamic CNN modification method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is well known and frequently found in hospitals and nursing care facilities, many cases are also reported outside these boundaries. In general, this pathogen infects debilitated patients either by comorbidities or by any form of immunodeficiency. In cases of respiratory infection, tobacco abuse seems to play an important role as a risk factor. In previously healthy patients, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with P. aeruginosa as the etiological agent is extremely rare, and unlike the cases involving immunocompromised or hospitalized patients, the outcome is severe, and is fatal in up to 61.1% of cases. Aerosolized contaminated water or solutions are closely linked to the development of respiratory tract infection. In this setting, metalworking fluids used in factories may be implicated in CAP involving previously healthy people. The authors report the case of a middle-aged man who worked in a metalworking factory and presented a right upper lobar pneumonia with a rapid fatal outcome. P. aeruginosa was cultured from blood and tracheal aspirates. The autopsy findings confirmed a hemorrhagic necrotizing pneumonia with bacteria-invading vasculitis and thrombosis. A culture of the metalworking fluid of the factory was also positive for P. aeruginosa. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that both strains (blood culture and metalworking fluid) were genetically indistinguishable.

Many patients suffer from systemic life-threatening problems and need to be carefully monitored in ICUs. Thus the intelligent prognosis is in an urgent need to assist physicians to take an early intervention, prevent the adverse outcome, and optimize the medical resource allocation. However, in the early stage of the epidemic outbreak, the data available for analysis is limited due to the lack of effective diagnostic mechanisms, rarity of the cases, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based approach, CovidCare, which leverages the existing electronic medical records to enhance the prognosis for inpatients with emerging infectious diseases. It learns to embed the COVID-19-related medical features based on massive existing EMR data via transfer learning. The transferred parameters are further trained to imitate the teacher model's representation behavior based on knowledge distillation, which embeds the health status more comprehensively in the source dataset. We conduct the length of stay prediction experiments for patients on a real-world COVID-19 dataset. The experiment results indicate that our proposed model consistently outperforms the comparative baseline methods. CovidCare also reveals that, 1) hs-cTnI, hs-CRP and Platelet Counts are the most fatal biomarkers, whose abnormal values usually indicate emergency adverse outcome. 2) Normal values of gamma-GT, AP and eGFR indicate the overall improvement of health.

Yet critical questions and concerns have been raised about the growing expenditure, viability, long term legacy, and impacts of mega sports events such as the Olympic Games. While much evidence has focused on the challenges of creating legacy for Olympic Games, there is considerably less literature on understanding the Paralympic context. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the role of innovation in creating legacy from MSEs and propose a theoretical and methodological plan for such research. Innovation, a key driver in organizational performance, is suggested as essential to defining, planning for and measuring legacy.

This paper developed a computer vision system to automatically detect the violation of face mask wearing and physical distancing among construction workers to assure their safety on infrastructure projects during the pandemic. For the face mask detection, the paper collected and annotated 1,000 images, including different types of face mask wearing, and added them to a pre-existing face mask dataset to develop a dataset of 1,853 images. Then trained and tested multiple Tensorflow state-of-the-art object detection models on the face mask dataset and chose the Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2 network that yielded the accuracy of 99.8%.

METHOD: Individuals with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes using multiple diabetes devices were recruited to evaluate the user experience with Tidepool over three months. Two endocrinologists used the Tidepool software to maintain a weekly communication with participants reviewing the devices data remotely. Demographic, clinical, psychological and usability data were collected at several stages of the study. RESULTS: Six participants, from ten at the baseline (five MDI and five CSII), completed this pilot study. Three different diabetes devices were employed by the participants: a glucose meter (Abbot), an intermittently-scanned glucose monitor (Abbot), and an insulin pump (Medtronic). A score of 81.3 in the system usability scale revealed that overall, most participants found the system easy to use, especially the web interface. The system also compared highly favourably against the proprietary platforms. The ability to upload and share data and communicate remotely with the clinicians was raised consistently by participants. Clinicians cited the lockdown imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic as a valuable test for this platform. Inability to upload data from mobile devices was identified as one of the main limitations.

It has been moreover speculated that this neurotropism could potentially cause a delayed outbreak of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases of neuroinflammatory origin. A propagation mechanism has been proposed across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, from the nose to the olfactory epithelium, and possibly afterward to other limbic structures, and deeper parts of the brain including the brainstem. METHODS: Review of clinical examination, and whole-brain voxel-based analysis of 18F-FDG PET metabolism in comparison with healthy subjects (p voxel < 0.001, p-cluster < 0.05, uncorrected), of two patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 explored at the post-viral stage of the disease. RESULTS: Hypometabolism of the olfactory/rectus gyrus was found on the two patients, especially one with 4-week prolonged anosmia. Additional hypometabolisms were found within amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, cingulate cortex, pre-/post-central gyrus, thalamus/hypothalamus, cerebellum, pons, and medulla in the other patient who complained of delayed onset of a painful syndrome. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings reinforce the hypotheses of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism through the olfactory bulb and the possible extension of this impairment to other brain structures. 18F-FDG PET hypometabolism could constitute a cerebral quantitative biomarker of this involvement. Post-viral cohort studies are required to specify the exact relationship between such hypometabolisms and the possible persistent disorders, especially involving cognitive or emotion disturbances, residual respiratory symptoms, or painful complaints.","output":"18F-FDG brain PET hypometabolism in post-SARS-CoV-2 infection: substrate for persistent/delayed disorders?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Production of human monoclonal antibodies that exhibit broadly neutralizing activity is needed for preventing HIV-1 infection, however only a few such antibodies have been generated till date. Isolation of antibodies by the hybridoma technology is a cumbersome process with fewer yields. Further, the loss of unstable or slowly growing clones which may have unique binding specificities often occurs during cloning and propagation and the strongly positive clones are often lost. This has been avoided by the process described in this paper, wherein, by combining the strategy of EBV transformation and recombinant DNA technology, we constructed human single chain variable fragments (scFvs) against the third variable region (V3) of the clade C HIV-1 envelope. RESULTS: An antigen specific phage library of 7000 clones was constructed from the enriched V3- positive antibody secreting EBV transformed cells. By ligation of the digested scFv DNA into phagemid vector and bio panning against the HIV-1 consensus C and B V3 peptides followed by random selection of 40 clones, we identified 15 clones that showed V3 reactivity in phage ELISA. DNA fingerprinting analysis and sequencing showed that 13 out of the 15 clones were distinct. Expression of the positive clones was tested by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. All the 13 anti-V3 scFvs showed cross-reactivity against both the clade C and B V3 peptides and did not show any reactivity against other unrelated peptides in ELISA. Preliminary neutralization assays indicated varying degrees of neutralization of clade C and B viruses. EBV transformation, followed by antigen selection of lines to identify specific binders, enabled the selection of phage from un-cloned lines for scFv generation, thus avoiding the problems of hybridoma technology. Moreover, as the clones were pretested for antigen binding, a comparatively small library sufficed for the selection of a considerable number of unique antigen binding phage. After selection, the phage clones were propagated in a clonal manner. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy can be efficiently used and is cost effective for the generation of diverse recombinant antibodies. This is the first study to generate anti-V3 scFvs against HIV-1 Clade C.","output":"A novel strategy for efficient production of anti-V3 human scFvs against HIV-1 clade C"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pregnancy is associated with major structural and hemodynamic changes in the cardiovascular system that predispose women to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.

NSQIP was chosen given its national scope, widespread use in research, and coding inclusive of AAPIs. We examine the proportion of studies representing AAPIs in the demographics, methods, results, or discussion. We then performed multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between study characteristics and AAPI inclusion. RESULTS In 1,264 studies included for review, 62% included race. Overall, only 22% (n=278) of studies included AAPIs. Of studies that included race, 35% represented AAPIs in some component of the study.

To seek the corresponding transcriptomic origins for the impact of COVID-19 infection and its aftermath consequences, we sought the relevance of long and short non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) for susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. We selected inflammation-prone men and women of diverse ages among the cohort of Genome Tissue expression (GTEx) by mining RNA-seq datasets from their lung, and blood tissues, followed by quantitative qRT-PCR, bioinformatics-based network analyses and thorough statistics compared to brain cell culture and infection tests with COVID-19 and H1N1 viruses. In lung tissues from 57 inflammation-prone, but not other GTEx donors, we discovered sharp declines of the lung pathology-associated ncRNA DANCR and the nuclear paraspeckles forming neuroprotective ncRNA NEAT1. Accompanying increases in the acetylcholine-regulating transcripts capable of controlling inflammation co-appeared in SARS-CoV-2 infected but not H1N1 influenza infected lung cells. The lung cells-characteristic DANCR and NEAT1 association with inflammation-controlling transcripts could not be observed in blood cells, weakened with age and presented sex-dependent links in GTEx lung RNA-seq dataset. Supporting active involvement in the inflammatory risks accompanying COVID-19, DANCRs decline associated with decrease of the COVID-19-related cellular transcript ACE2 and with sex-related increases in coding transcripts potentiating acetylcholine signaling. Furthermore, transcription factors (TFs) in lung, brain and cultured infected cells created networks with the candidate transcripts, indicating tissue-specific expression patterns. Supporting links of post-infection inflammatory and cognitive damages with cholinergic mal-functioning, man and woman-originated cultured cholinergic neurons presented differentiation-related increases of DANCR and NEAT1 targeting microRNAs. Briefly, changes in ncRNAs and TFs from inflammation-prone human lung tissues, SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells and man and woman-derived differentiated cholinergic neurons reflected the inflammatory pathobiology related to COVID-19. By shifting ncRNA differences into comparative diagnostic and therapeutic profiles, our RNA-sequencing based Resource can identify ncRNA regulating candidates for COVID-19 and its associated immediate and predicted long-term inflammation and neurological complications, and sex-related therapeutics thereof.

We examined the association between serum bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels and clinical outcomes using Kaplan-Meier methods after the matching of baseline characteristics by propensity scores. RESULTS Of 178 patients with CKD, patients with lower HCO3- levels (N = 94), as compared with patients with higher HCO3- levels (N = 84), were more likely to be male (P < 0.05), had more severe CKD stages (P < 0.05), more frequent use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (P < 0.05) or uric acid lowering agent (P < 0.001), heavier body weight (P < 0.001) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (P < 0.05).

The current study examined whether daily practice of brief mindfulness training has a beneficial impact on affective well-being, and mitigates the negative impact of exposure to COVID-19 news during the pandemic. Participants were randomly assigned into a mindfulness training (MT) group or a waitlist control (WC) group. Participants in the MT group practiced guided mindfulness meditation for a minimum of 10 min each day for 10 days. Both groups completed questionnaires assessing well-being at baseline and after the 10-day period. We also included four ecological momentary assessments (EMA) interspersed throughout the day to measure fine-grained affective states and recent exposure to COVID-19-related news, which has been linked to negative affect. We observed an increase in positive affect in the MT group compared to the WC group in the post-training assessment. However, no group differences emerged in the other three post-training affective measures of negative affect, anxiety and depression. EMA revealed that the MT group also showed more positive affective valence than the WC group across the 10 days. Notably, the WC group reported more negative affective valence following COVID-19 news exposure, whereas the MT group was not impacted.

Subjects were categorized according to their level of alcohol consumption as non-drinkers (reference) and low- (0.01 to 20.0 g/day), moderate- (20.1 to 40.0 g/day), moderate- to high- (40.1 to 60.0 g/day), and high-dose (> 60.0 g/day) drinkers. We defined hypertension as a blood pressure  140/90 mmHg and/or the use of anti- hypertensive drugs. Results In total, 11 articles (seven Asian and four Western) were selected for our analysis. Among Asian men, a significantly elevated risk was observed even in the low alcohol dose group in comparison with the group with no alcohol consumption, and the risk increased in a dose-dependent manner (pooled relative risks [95% confidence intervals (CI)]: 1.25 [1.13 to 1.38], 1.48 [1.27 to 1.72], 1.75 [1.43 to 2.15], and 1.78 [1.51 to 2.09]). Among Western men, a similar dose-response relationship was noted in general (p for subgroup difference > 0.1), but a significantly elevated risk was evident only in the high-dose group (pooled relative risks [95% CI]: 1.22 [0.85 to 1.74], 1.57 [0.90 to 2.75], 1.47 [0.44 to 4.91], and 1.49 [1.02 to 2.18]). Conclusions Even low doses of alcohol can lead to the development of hypertension, particularly in Asian men. Our findings could serve as additional evidence for developing an appropriate preventive strategy in each region.","output":"The effect of alcohol dose on the development of hypertension in Asian and Western men: systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Many studies have shown the advantages of monitoring wastewater in the evaluation of microbiological pathogens circulating in the community.

We aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and associations with mortality among COVID-19-confirmed individuals admitted to an infectious diseases referral hospital in Metro Manila. MAIN TEXT: This was a single-centre retrospective analysis including the first 500 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 individuals admitted to San Lazaro Hospital, Metro Manila, Philippines, from January to October 2020. We extracted clinical data and examined epidemiological and clinical characteristics and factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Of the 500 individuals, 133 (26.6%) were healthcare workers (HCW) and 367 (73.4%) were non-HCW, with HCW more likely presenting with milder symptoms. Non-HCW admissions were more likely to have at least one underlying disease (51.6% vs. 40.0%;p = 0.002), with hypertension (35.4%), diabetes (17.4%), and tuberculosis (8.2%) being the most common. Sixty-one (12.2%) died, comprising 1 HCW and 60 non-HCW (0.7% vs. 16.3%;p &lt; 0.001). Among the non-HCW, no death occurred for the 0-10 years age group, but deaths were recorded across all other age groups. Compared to those who recovered, individuals who died were more likely to be older (p &lt; 0.001), male (p = 0.015), report difficulty of breathing (p &lt; 0.001), be HIV positive (p = 0.008), be intubated (p &lt; 0.001), categorised as severe or critical (p &lt; 0.001), have a shorter mean hospital stay (p &lt; 0.001), or have an additional diagnosis of pneumonia (p &lt; 0.001) or ARDS (p &lt; 0.001).

We compare our recently described new method of endoscopic single-access adrenalectomy with the conventional retroperitoneoscopic approach in a matched-pairs study. METHODS Fifty single-access retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomies (SARA) were performed in 47 selected patients suffering from Conn's adenomas (n = 20), pheochromocytomas (n = 15), Cushing's adenomas (n = 6), and other diseases (n = 6). For SARA, a single 2-cm skin incision beneath the 12th rib was used. Following creation of the retroperitoneal space with the rigid endoscope, dissection was carried out single-handed. Another 47 patients served as control group; they were treated by the traditional retroperitoneoscopic three-port approach (CORA). Patients were matched with respect to gender, body mass index, diagnoses, tumor size, and tumor site. RESULTS Mortality was zero and no major complications occurred in both groups. SARA was completed in 41 cases (86%). The overall complication rate was 8.5% in SARA and 6.4% in CORA. Operative time was longer for SARA (56 +/- 28 min) than for CORA (40 +/- 12 min) (P < 0.05). Postoperatively, pain medication was administered in 47% of SARA patients and in 75% of CORA patients (P = 0.01). Mean hospital stay was 2.4 +/- 0.7 days (SARA) and 3.1 +/- 1.2 days (CORA) (P < 0.01).

The secondary bile acid metabolite, deoxycholic acid (DoC), affects the viability of human pathogens but also plays multiple roles in host physiology. We assessed in vitro the antimicrobial activity of DoC and investigated its potential to eradicate Spn colonization using an ex vivo model of human nasopharyngeal colonization and an in vivo mouse model of colonization. At a physiological concentration DoC (0.5 mg/ml; 1.27 mM) killed all tested Spn strains (N=48) two h post-inoculation. The ex-vivo model of nasopharyngeal colonization showed that DoC eradicated colonization by Spn strains as soon as 10 min post-exposure. The mechanism of action did not involve activation of autolysis since the autolysis-defective double mutants lytAlytC and spxBlctO were as susceptible to DoC as was the wild-type (WT). Oral streptococcal species (N=20), however, were not susceptible to DoC (0.5 mg/ml). Unlike trimethoprim, whose spontaneous resistance frequency (srF) for TIGR4 or EF3030 was 110?9, no spontaneous resistance was observed with DoC (srF110?12). Finally, the efficacy of DoC to eradicate Spn colonization was assessed in vivo using a topical route via intranasal (i.n.) administration and as a prophylactic treatment. Mice challenged with Spn EF3030 carried a median of 4.05105 cfu/ml four days post-inoculation compared to 6.67104 cfu/ml for mice treated with DoC. Mice in the prophylactic group had a 99% reduction of the pneumococcal density (median, 2.61 103 cfu/ml).

Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated to compare the incidence of retinal vascular occlusions before and after COVID-19 diagnosis after accounting for baseline demographic characteristics, medical history, and hospitalization. Results: A total of 432a?515 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection were included in this study. The mean (SD) age was 40.9 (19.2) years, and 231a?767 patients (53.6%) were women. Sixteen patients had an RAO (crude incidence rate, 3.00 per 1 000 000 patients), and 65 had an RVO (crude incidence rate, 12.20 per 1 000 000 patients) in the 6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis. The incidence of new RVOs was higher in the 6 months after COVID-19 infection compared with the 6 months before infection after adjusting for age; sex; self-reported race and ethnicity; body mass index; history of diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia; and hospitalization (adjusted IRR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.05-2.26; P = .03). There was a smaller increase in the incidence of RAOs after COVID-19 diagnosis (IRR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.64-2.85; P = .44). The peak incidence of RAOs and RVOs occurred 10 to 12 weeks and 6 to 8 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that there was an increase in the incidence of RVOs after COVID-19 infection; however, these events remain rare, and in the absence of randomized controls, a cause-and-effect relationship cannot be established. Further large, epidemiologic studies are warranted to better define the association between retinal thromboembolic events and COVID-19 infection.","output":"Changes in the Incidence of Retinal Vascular Occlusions After COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The UK government faces a massive post-COVID problem in restructuring failing companies and rebuilding its already depressed regions.

This study started from 1 May, 2020, to 30 December, 2021. CT study of the chest for 1200 infected patients with COVID-19 (600 were medical stuff and 600 persons of non-medical staff) was done in five health quarantine centres in Egypt. CT findings were reviewed in relation to the severity of symptoms. The results of the two groups were compared to each other. RESULTS: CT findings were more frequent and more severe in the medical staff group, including that the number of consolidative patches mixed with areas of ground glass attenuation in medical staff group was (37.2%) versus non-medical staff group was (22.2%), with p-value (*0.001), diffuse lobar involvement was in (150 severe cases) in medical staff group versus in 67 severe cases of non-medical staff group and had significant difference (p value *0.005), fibrosis (p value *0.002) and more opportunity to get severe form of infection increased in medical personnel rather than control group (p value *0.001) which may be due to limited health care facilities in protection against infection especially in developing countries and more contact during work time with infected persons and high viral load.

Materials and Methods Data were analyzed from the SWIFT PRIME trial, a global, multicenter, prospective study in which outcomes were compared in patients treated with intravenous tPA alone or in combination with the Solitaire device (Covidien, Irvine, Calif). Between December 2012 and November 2014, 196 patients were enrolled. The relation between time from (a) symptom onset to reperfusion and (b) imaging to reperfusion and clinical outcome was analyzed, along with patient and health system characteristics that affect discrete steps in patient workflow. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess relationships between time and outcome; negative binomial regression was used to evaluate effects on workflow. The institutional review board at each site approved the trial. Patients provided written informed consent, or, at select sites, there was an exception from having to acquire explicit informed consent in emergency circumstances. Results In the stent retriever arm of the study, symptom onset to reperfusion time of 150 minutes led to 91% estimated probability of functional independence, which decreased by 10% over the next hour and by 20% with every subsequent hour of delay. Time from arrival at the emergency department to arterial access was 90 minutes (interquartile range, 69-120 minutes), and time to reperfusion was 129 minutes (interquartile range, 108-169 minutes). Patients who initially arrived at a referring facility had longer symptom onset to groin puncture times compared with patients who presented directly to the endovascular-capable center (275 vs 179.5 minutes, P < .001). Conclusion Fast reperfusion leads to improved functional outcome among patients with acute stroke treated with stent retrievers.

This report describes the design and methods of a study evaluating the potential of ES as a routine clinical tool for pediatric patients who have suspected genetic conditions and who are in the early stages of the diagnostic odyssey. METHODS: The North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next-generation Exome Sequencing (NCGENES) 2 study is an interdisciplinary, multi-site Phase III randomized controlled trial of two interventions: educational pre-visit preparation (PVP) and offer of first-line ES. In this full-factorial design, parent-child dyads are randomly assigned to one of four study arms (PVP + usual care, ES + usual care, PVP + ES + usual care, or usual care alone) in equal proportions. Participants are recruited from Pediatric Genetics or Neurology outpatient clinics in three North Carolina healthcare facilities. Eligible pediatric participants are < 16 years old and have a first visit to a participating clinic, a suspected genetic condition, and an eligible parent/guardian to attend the clinic visit and complete study measures. The study oversamples participants from underserved and under-represented populations. Participants assigned to the PVP arms receive an educational booklet and question prompt list before clinical interactions. Randomization to offer of first-line ES is revealed after a childs clinic visit. Parents complete measures at baseline, pre-clinic, post-clinic, and two follow-up timepoints. Study clinicians provide phenotypic data and complete measures after the clinic visit and after returning results. Reportable study-related research ES results are confirmed in a CLIA-certified clinical laboratory. Results are disclosed to the parent by the clinical team. A community consultation team contributed to the development of study materials and study implementation methods and remains engaged in the project. DISCUSSION: NCGENES 2 will contribute valuable knowledge concerning technical, clinical, psychosocial, and health economic issues associated with using early diagnostic ES to shorten the diagnostic odyssey of pediatric patients with likely genetic conditions. Results will inform efforts to engage diverse populations in genomic medicine research and generate evidence that can inform policy, practice, and future research related to the utility of first-line diagnostic ES in health care.

They harm the individual patient, the healthcare system and the economy. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has highlighted contributing factors globally: insufficient national medicine regulation, poor enforcement of existing legislation, weak stakeholder collaboration and the rise of novel viruses, such as the COVID-19. The study aimed to assess the legislative and policy framework and institutional relationships governing pharmaceuticals and anti-counterfeiting strategies. METHODS: The study was explorative and consisted of two phases. The first phase was between 2016 and 2017. It looked at document analysis (annual reports and press releases from 2011 to 2016) from government institutions involved in medicines regulation and law enforcement for SF seizure reports between 2004 and 2017. The second phase was between 2016 and 2018 through in-depth semi-structured interviews (seven in total) with selected stakeholders. RESULTS: First Phasethe data collected and reported by various departments was sporadic and did not always correlate for the same periods indicating, a lack of a central reporting system and stakeholder collaboration. In South Africa, counterfeiting of medicines mainly involves the smuggling of non-registered goods. The most common counterfeit items were painkillers, herbal teas, herbal ointments, while some were medical devices. Furthermore, Customs identified South Africa as a transhipment point for SF infiltration to neighbouring countries with less robust regulatory systems. Second phaseinterview transcripts were analysed by thematic coding. These were identified as the adequacy of legislation, institutional capacity, enforcement and post-market surveillance, stakeholder collaboration and information sharing, and public education and awareness. CONCLUSION: Document analysis and interviews indicate that South Africa already has a national drug policy and legislative framework consistent with international law. However, there is no specific pharmaceutical legislation addressing the counterfeiting of medicines. Law enforcement has also been complicated by poor stakeholder engagement and information sharing.

It is imperative for leading economies to implement preventive strategies targeted towards UDD, given consistent policies are currently lacking. Recently established similarities between the aetiological hypotheses of depression and cardiometabolic diseases are shifting paradigms within this field. It is believed that dietary practices could potentially reduce the incidence of depression; similar to their effects on metabolism. Thus, the aim of this review was to compile current evidence on healthy dietary patterns as suitable contributors towards primary prevention strategies against UDD. Most of the well-known biological mechanisms behind depression have been positively associated with healthful diets and dietary patterns to varying degrees. Interestingly, a common factor of UDD is the production and overall effects of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-, and C-reactive protein. These compounds have been associated with depressive symptoms, disturbances in neuroendocrine function, leaky gut, monoamine activity and brain function, while also being key factors in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MD) in particular, is well supported by first-level evidence regarding its preventive qualities against metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and thus considered a model for healthy eating by various organizations. In one of the few clinical trials investigating these associations, the PREDIMED trial, individuals with diabetes assigned to a MD supplemented with mixed tree nuts experienced a 41% relative risk reduction for developing depression. Lastly, there is a need to include health related quality of life as an indicator of physical and mental well-being, considering its putative associations with depression and suicide risk. Going forward, focusing on clinical trials, using precise nutritional assessments, and identifying nutritional biomarkers which may be related to depression are needed to fully support the implementation of dietary recommendations in the field of psychiatry.","output":"Healthy diet, depression and quality of life: A narrative review of biological mechanisms and primary prevention opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is relevant due to the critical need for changing the consumption-oriented economic growth model to an investment one for the long-term sustainable development of Russia, considering global environmental challenges.

In contrast to the evolutionary psychological mechanisms linking parasites to human behavior and cultural characteristics proposed by Thornhill and Fincher, we offer an alternative hypothesis that structural racism and differential access to sanitation systems drive both variation in parasite prevalence and differential behaviors and cultural characteristics. METHODS We adopt a Bayesian framework to estimate parasite prevalence rates in 51 districts in eight Latin American countries using the disease status of 170,220 individuals tested for infection with the intestinal roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides (Hrlimann et al., []: PLoS Negl Trop Dis 5:e1404). We then use district-level estimates of parasite prevalence and individual-level social data from 5,558 individuals in the same 51 districts (Latinobarmetro, 2008) to assess claims of causal associations between parasite prevalence and sociocultural characteristics. RESULTS We find, contrary to Thornhill and Fincher, that parasite prevalence is positively associated with preferences for democracy, negatively associated with preferences for collectivism, and not associated with violent crime rates or gender inequality. A positive association between parasite prevalence and religiosity, as in Fincher and Thornhill (: Behav Brain Sci 35:61-79), and a negative association between parasite prevalence and achieved education, as predicted by Eppig et al. (: Proc R S B: Biol Sci 277:3801-3808), become negative and unreliable when reasonable controls are included in the model. We find support for all predictions derived from our hypothesis linking structural racism to both parasite prevalence and cultural outcomes.

All neonatal deaths with neurological symptoms occurring within the first 30 days of life were enrolled, irrespective of the suspected clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Sixteen neonates were enrolled after death for MITS of the brain, performed for diagnostic purposes, during the study period from February 2020 to March 2021. Their gestational ages ranged from 26 to 38 weeks. All neonates had either a history of seizures and/or respiratory distress or clinical evidence of sepsis and were on ventilator support. Histopathology in all 16 neonates showed evidence of anoxia, with or without reactive astrogliosis or microgliosis.

Methods: We reviewed clinical histories of 177 patients with confirmed COVID-19. The patients were categorized into mild group (153 patients) and severe group (24 patients). The baseline demographic and laboratory indicators of all patients were collected, including the neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) and C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was performed to search for indicators predicting exacerbation in COVID-19 patients, and acquiring the area under the curves (AUCs), sensitivity, specificity and cut-off value. Results: The age of the severe group were significantly older than those of the mild group (P <0.01). Fever was the typical symptom in all COVID-19 patients. Cough and fatigue were manifested in mild group, yet severe patients were more prominent in dyspnea. The laboratory indicators showing that the mild group mainly had an elevated C-reactive protein;the severe group had a decreased lymphocyte count and lymphocyte ratio. WBC, neutrophil count, neutrophil ratio, D-dimer, AST, ALT, LDH, BUN, CRP levels increased. Furthermore, compared to mild group, WBC, neutrophil count, neutrophil ratio (Neut%), D-dimer, total bilirubin, albumin, AST, ALT, LDH, BUN, creatine kinase, CRP, CAR, NLCR were significantly higher, the lymphocyte count, lymphocyte ratio, and APTT were significantly lower in severe group (P<0.05). The ROC indicating that NLCR, Neut%, CAR, CRP, and LDH were better at distinguishing mild and severe patients. The AUCs of NLCR was larger than others (NLCR>Neut%>CAR>CRP>LDH: 0.939>0.925>0.908>0.895>0.873), which suggested that NLCR was the optimal maker;a cut-off value for NLCR of 6.15 had 87.5% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity for predicting exacerbation in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: The different types of COVID-19 had significant differences in age, clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators, and severe patients might be easier to suffer from the multiple organ damage. An elevated NLCR may indicate that the disease was progressing towards exacerbation. It was essential to dynamically monitor the serum NLCR levels which contributed to evaluate the patient's condition and efficacy.

Neither the nature of this phenotype nor its relevance to survival are well understood, limiting the efficacy of modern life-support. METHODS: To explore the hypothesis that survival from critical illness relates to changes in cellular bioenergetics, we combined assessment of mitochondrial respiration with metabolomic, lipidomic and redox profiling in skeletal muscle and blood, at multiple timepoints, in 21 critically ill patients and 12 reference patients. RESULTS: We demonstrate an end-organ cellular phenotype in critical illness, characterized by preserved total energetic capacity, greater coupling efficiency and selectively lower capacity for complex I and fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-supported respiration in skeletal muscle, compared to health. In survivors, complex I capacity at 48 h was 27% lower than in non-survivors (p = 0.01), but tended to increase by day 7, with no such recovery observed in non-survivors. By day 7, survivors FAO enzyme activity was double that of non-survivors (p = 0.048), in whom plasma triacylglycerol accumulated. Increases in both cellular oxidative stress and reductive drive were evident in early critical illness compared to health. Initially, non-survivors demonstrated greater plasma total antioxidant capacity but ultimately higher lipid peroxidation compared to survivors. These alterations were mirrored by greater levels of circulating total free thiol and nitrosated species, consistent with greater reductive stress and vascular inflammation, in non-survivors compared to survivors. In contrast, no clear differences in systemic inflammatory markers were observed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Critical illness is associated with rapid, specific and coordinated alterations in the cellular respiratory machinery, intermediary metabolism and redox response, with different trajectories in survivors and non-survivors.

For this reason, in this study, semi-thin sections of a single Penicillium rubens cell were analyzed by Raman enhanced surface spectroscopy. The spectra showed peaks corresponding to the macromolecules that make up the cellular components. In addition, the various organelles were analyzed by TEM and AFM to observe the cellular nanostructures. With the use of these techniques, it is possible to identify molecules in semi-thin sections, which provides a wide potential for biomedical applications and for the analysis of cell dynamics. The observation of the most detailed possible structure of cells is used as a starting point in numerous studies to identify and localize some biochemical processes.

Regarding the results, during the synthesis of penicillin, the antibiotic-producing Penicillium rubens cells showed significant changes compared to the non-producing cells: the cell wall is observed to be significantly thickened in the production phase, organelles such as peroxisomes grow in number and size since it is known that the final route of metabolite synthesis takes place in them. When penicillin is released from peroxisomes, they must be degraded to release the load from the cell; this is done by vacuoles, which are active and engulf peroxisomes. The newly synthesized penicillin is found within secretory vesicles that travel towards the cell membrane and both membranes fuse creating ripples. On the other hand, and given that a single cell is being studied, it is essential to increase the signal to detect biomolecules employing the Raman-SERS technique, using a silver substrate to obtain the increased signal.

Over the year, plant phytochemicals are increasingly becoming an alternative source of an antimicrobial agent with a novel mechanism of action and limited side effects compared to synthetic drugs. Isolated saponins and tannins were evaluated for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 M pro via Molecular Docking and it was observed that a handsome number of the phytochemicals had binding affinity much better than Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, and N3 inhibitor which were used as the standard in this study. Further Investigation of drug-likeness, ADMET profile, and bioactivity of these phytochemicals revealed that binding affinity alone is not enough in the drug discovery process and that 4 hit compounds were identified as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2Mpro.

AIMS: we aimed to describe what European trainees and young gastroenterologists know about COVID-19 and identify training gaps to implement educational programs. METHODS: A prospective web-based electronic survey was developed and distributed via e-mail to all members of the Italian Young Gastroenterologist and Endoscopist Association and to European representatives. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-seven subjects participated in the survey, of whom 14 (7.1%) were excluded. The majority were gastroenterologists in training (123, 67.7%) working in institutions with COVID-19 inpatients (159, 86.9%), aged &#8804;30 years (113, 61.8%). The activity of Gastroenterology Units was restricted to emergency visits and endoscopy, with reductions of activities of up to 90%. 84.5% of participants felt that the COVID-19 outbreak impacted on their training, due to unavailability of mentors (52.6%) and interruption of trainee's involvement (66.4%). Most participants referred absence of training on the use of personal protective equipment, oxygen ventilation systems and COVID-19 therapies. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 outbreak significantly impacted on gastroenterologists' clinical activity.

Because this RNA virus can mutate massively without a specifically tracing maker. Herein, using a geographic stratified genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2599 full-genome sequences, we identified that two SNPs (i.e., 1059.C>T and 25563.G>T) of linkage disequilibrium were presented in approximately half of North America SARS-CoV-2 population (p = 2.44 x 10?212 and p = 2.98 x 10?261), resulting two missense mutations (i.e., Thr 265 Ile and Gln 57 His) in ORF1ab and ORF3a, respectively. Interestingly, these two SNPs exclusively occurred in the North America dominated clade 1, accumulated during mid to late March, 2020. We did not find any of these two SNPs by retrospectively tracing the two SNPs in bat and pangolin related SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV-2 from the first epicenter Wuhan or other regions of China mainland. This suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 population of Chinese mainland were different from the prevalent strains of North America. Time-dependently, we found that these two SNPs first occurred in Europe SARS-CoV-2 (26-Feb-2020) which was 3 days early than the occurring date of North America isolates and 17 days early for Asia isolates (Taiwan China dominated). Collectively, this population genetic analysis highlights a well-confidential transmission route of the North America isolates and the two SNPs we newly identified are possibly novel diagnosable or druggable targets for surveillance and treatment.","output":"Tracing two causative SNPs reveals SARS-CoV-2 transmission in North America population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: International studies suggest that males may be less likely to adhere to SARS-CoV-2 transmission mitigation efforts than females. However, there is a paucity of research in this field in the United States. The primary aim of this study was to explore the relationship of binary gender identity (female/male) with beliefs, attitudes, and pandemic-related practices in the early stages of the pandemic. Methods: This study is based on a cross-sectional, voluntary response survey. Patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 5 and June 7, 2020 were invited to participate. All patients were tested within a large community healthcare system that serves patients through eight hospitals and hundreds of clinics across Washington State. Bivariate associations between gender and various demographics were tested using Chi-squared and Student's t-tests. We examined associations between gender and pandemic-related beliefs, attitudes, and practices using multivariable logistic regression, accounting for potential confounding factors. Results: Females were more likely than males to agree that they (aOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.14C2.00) or their families (aOR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.31C2.33) were threatened by SARS-CoV-2, or that their own behavior could impact transmission (aOR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.49C3.15). Similarly, females were more likely to agree that social distancing (aOR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.19C2.46), handwashing (aOR = 3.27, 95% CI 2.06C5.21), and masking (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.02C1.94) were necessary to slow SARS-CoV-2 spread. Females were significantly less likely to visit outside of their social distancing circle (aOR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.47C0.81), but among those who did, practices of social distancing (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI 0.89C2.23), remaining outdoors (aOR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.56C1.40), and masking (aOR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.74C1.93) were comparable to males, while females practiced handwashing more than males (aOR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.33C3.34).

Design: Systematic analysis. Data sources: Worldometer, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, United Nations Main outcome measures: The explanators of nDpm and CFR were mathematically hypothesised and tested on publicly-available data from 88 countries with linear regression models on May 1st 2020. The derived explanators - age-adjusted infection fatality rate (IFRadj) and case detection rate (CDR) - were estimated for each country based on a SARS-CoV-2 model of China. The accuracy and agreement of the models with observed data was assessed with R2 and Bland-Altman plots, respectively. Sensitivity analyses involved removal of outliers and testing the models at five retrospective and two prospective time points. Results: Globally, IFRadj estimates varied between countries, ranging from below 0.2% in the youngest nations, to above 1.3% in Portugal, Greece, Italy, and Japan. The median estimated global CDR of SARS-CoV-2 infections on April 16th 2020 was 12.9%, suggesting that most of the countries have a much higher number of cases than reported. At least 93% and up to 99% of the variance in nDpm was explained by reported prevalence expressed as cases per million citizens (nCpm), IFRadj, and CDR. IFRadj and CDR accounted for up to 97% of the variance in CFR, but this model was less reliable than the nDpm model, being sensitive to outliers (R2 as low as 67.5%). Conclusions: The current differences in SARS-CoV-2 mortality between countries are driven mainly by reported prevalence of infections, age distribution, and CDR.

However, in sub-Saharan Africa a low prevalence and mortality have been observed so far. Methods We collected data on individual social contacts in Ethiopia across geographical contexts characterized by heterogeneous population density, work and travel opportunities, and access to primary care. We assessed how socio-demographic factors and observed mixing patterns can influence the COVID-19 disease burden, by simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in remote settlements, rural villages, and urban neighborhoods, under the current school closure mandate. Results From national surveillance data, we estimated a net reproduction number of 1.62 (95%CI 1.55-1.70). We found that, at the end of an epidemic mitigated by school closure alone, 10-15% of the overall population would have been symptomatic and 0.3-0.4% of the population would require mechanical ventilation and/or possibly result in a fatal outcome. Higher infection attack rates are expected in more urbanized areas, but the highest incidence of critical disease is expected in remote subsistence farming settlements. Conclusions The relatively low burden of COVID-19 in Ethiopia can be explained by the estimated mixing patterns, underlying demography and the enacted school closures. Socio-demographic factors can also determine marked heterogeneities across different geographical contexts within the same country. Our findings can contribute to understand why sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a relatively lower attack rate of severe cases compared to high income countries.","output":"Demography, social contact patterns and the COVID-19 burden in different settings of Ethiopia: a modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foundry is a province-wide network of integrated health and social service centres for young people aged 12-24 in British Columbia (BC), Canada.

Simultaneously, it is evident that every node of the bioenergy supply chain, from cultivation of energy crops to production of electricity and heat, is vulnerable to climate change impacts. However, climate change assessments of bioenergy supply chains neither account for the global nature of the bioenergy market, nor the complexity and dynamic interconnectivity between and within different sub-systems in which the bioenergy supply chain is embedded, thereby neglecting potential compounding and cascading impacts of climate change. In this paper, systems thinking is utilised to develop an analytical framework to address this gap, and aided by causal loop diagrams, cascading impacts of climate change are identified for a case study concerning imports of wood pellets from the United States to the European Union. The findings illustrate how the complexity and interconnectivity of the wood pellet supply system predispose the supply chain to various cascading climate change impacts stemming from environmental, social, political and economic domains, and highlight the value of using system-based analysis tools for studying such complex and dynamic systems.","output":"Using systems thinking and causal loop diagrams to identify cascading climate change impacts on bioenergy supply systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The increase in demand for Telemedicine globally has continued to rise in recent months, showing remarkable success in a variety of medical fields.

The accepted method of primary analysis of phase III trials of radical chemoradiotherapy is by intention to treat (ITT). Yet, investigators often resort to 'post hoc' analyses comparing only patients who received the treatment per protocol (PP). Analysis of treatment PP aims to maintain the comparable groups achieved by randomisation, whilst identifying a true or more accurate treatment effect if the planned chemoradiotherapy is optimally applied with full compliance. Poor compliance is recognised to be associated with inferior outcomes. Reasons for poor compliance if identified and understood, might influence the design of future trials. Yet this entire methodology risks substantial bias and is often disparaged. In localised squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) chemoradiotherapy with concurrent 5-flurouracil (or capecitabine) and mitomycin C achieves high rates of local control, but results in substantial acute toxicities. Some novel radiotherapy techniques (intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), meticulous organs-at-risk (OAR) contouring, and techniques such as sparing of PET-active bone marrow) appear to reduce acute toxicity. Good quality assurance in the design of trials, patient education, optimizing nutrition, proactive surveillance during treatment, and early interventions might also improve compliance.

Methods Both Chinese and English databases were systematically searched using specific keywords associated with the aims until November 21th, 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for quality assessment. A Statistical analysis was carried out using Review Manager 5.3 and STATA 15.1. Results Nine clinical trials were included in this study involving 2577 subjects. The results indicate that the association between elevated HbA1c referred as a continuous variable and adverse prognosis of COVID-19 was not significant (OR, 1.02; 95%CI, 0.95-1.09). However, higher HbA1c levels regarded as a dichotomous variable contributed to an increase mortality of COVID-19 (OR, 2.300; 95%CI, 1.679-3.150). Results were stable in a sensitivity analysis.

METHODS In mouse allograft transplantation models, a blocking CD200 antibody was used to improve renal and cardiac graft survival. Similarly, in humans a blocking CD200 antibody would be administered to the organ recipient in combination with currently used immunosuppressive drugs or even as a monotherapy. RESULTS In the presented animal experiments, anti-CD200 antibody application to the allograft recipient decreases SHIP expression in splenocytes. This is accompanied by a significant increase in renal or cardiac graft survival. Furthermore, anti-CD200 antibody has an immunosuppressive effect manifested by an increased production of T regulatory and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and a decrease in B cells and activated T cells.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review (January 2009-June 2019) was conducted for preventive, follow-up, and sick visits; Title X confidential visits were excluded. Questions were asked about method at start and end of the visit. Nonparametric median tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables assessed for differences for patient age, race, gender, insurance type, visit type, and provider gender.

The surge in ICU beds might severely limit burn centers to accept burn patients in a regional mass casualty incident. METHODS: Burn bed data was collected by a regional burn disaster consortium. Open burn bed census was collected via telephone from each burn center in the consortium on April 15(th), May 7(th), May 21(st), June 4(th) and June 18(th) of 2020. This data was compared to published data from 2009 to 2016. RESULTS: The results are listed in Table 1. Lowest available burn bed was 35 beds on April 15th, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Although a disaster may impact surrounding local and state hospitals, it does not always impact a burn centers ability to transfer patients from a local trauma center or nearby burn center. A pandemic however affects a larger region and impacts all hospitals within that region. Peak ICU utilization in the Northeast was between the second and third week of April. During the peak utilization time, burn bed census was about 50% of the historical average. Burn bed census did not return to historical average until May 7, 2020. If a mass casualty event occurred in the pandemic region, the Northeast region would have to reach out to other ABA designated regions for assistance. Historically, burn mass casualty plans are based on the capacity to move burn patients to other burn centers in order to relieve surge capacity at the affected center. This data illustrates that, in a pandemic, burn beds are being utilized for non-burn patients. The ability to follow these plans will be greatly impacted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients over 18 years of age, who underwent a maintenance haemodialysis program at our unit, and being tested positive for COVID-19 by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs and/or were observed to have disease-related signs in their CTs were included in the study. RESULTS: In this study, 23 of 42 patients receiving haemodialysis support in our clinic were included. The median age was 67 years (min 35; max 91 years) and all of them had primary hypertension and other comorbidities. Their clinical evaluation showed that dry cough (47.8%) and shortness of breath (47.8%) were the most common symptoms. Fever was less pronounced (30.4%). The median time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 1 day (min 0; max ) and time from hospitalization to death was 18 days (min:1; max 22).

This study aimed to compare extubation of patients post-cardiac surgery with a BMI 30 kg/m(2) onto high-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) with standard care to determine whether HFNC could assist in minimising post-operative atelectasis and improve respiratory function. METHODS In this randomised controlled trial, patients received HFNC or standard oxygen therapy post-extubation. The primary outcome was atelectasis on chest X-ray. Secondary outcomes included oxygenation, respiratory rate (RR), subjective dyspnoea, and failure of allocated treatment. RESULTS One hundred and fifty-five patients were randomised, 74 to control, 81 to HFNC. No difference was seen between groups in atelectasis scores on Days 1 or 5 (median scores = 2, p = 0.70 and p = 0.15, respectively). In the 24-h post-extubation, there was no difference in mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio (HFNC 227.9, control 253.3, p = 0.08), or RR (HFNC 17.2, control 16.7, p = 0.17).

However, data arising from different fields such as environmental, financial, biomedical sciences and other areas may not fit the classical distributions. Therefore, the need arises for developing new distributions that would capture high degree of skewness and kurtosis and enhance the goodness-of-fit in empirical distribution. In this paper, we introduce a novel family of distributions which can extend some popular classes of distributions to include different new versions of the baseline distributions. The proposed family of distributions is referred as the Marshall-Olkin Weibull generated family. The proposed family of distributions is a combination of Marshall-Olkin transformation and the Weibull generated family. Two special members of the proposed family are investigated. A variety of shapes for the densities and hazard rate are presented of the considered sub-models. Some of the main mathematical properties of this family are derived. The estimation for the parameters is obtained via the maximum likelihood method. Moreover, the performance of the estimators for the considered members is examined through simulation studies in terms of bias and root mean square error. Besides, based on the new generated family, the log Marshall-Olkin Weibull-Weibull regression model for censored data is proposed. Finally, COVID-19 data and three lifetime data sets are used to demonstrate the importance of the newly proposed family. Through such an applications, it is shown that this family of distributions provides a better fit when compared with other competitive distributions.","output":"A new generalized family of distributions based on combining Marshal-Olkin transformation with T-X family"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 infection is a global health issue, and vaccination is the main strategy to control this pandemic. In this study, 189 participants received BNT162b2 or CoronaVac vaccine, and 133 of them recorded adverse events (AEs) daily for 4 weeks after vaccination. Their neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was determined with live virus microneutralization (vMN) assay. The vMN geometric mean titer (GMT) on day 56 was 129.9 (95% confidence interval [CI],108.6 to 155.2) in the BNT162b2 group and 13.1 (95% CI, 11.2 to 15.3) in the CoronaVac group. Day 56 vMN GMT was 147.9 (95% CI, 118.9 to 184.1) in females and 129.9 (95% CI, 108.6 to 155.2) in males receiving BNT162b2, while it was 14.0 (95% CI, 11.6 to 17.0) in females and 11.4 (95% CI, 8.7 to 15.0) in males receiving CoronaVac. Injection site pain (88.8%) and redness (77.5%) were the most commonly BNT162b2-related AEs, and injection site pain (37.7%) and tiredness (26.4%) were more frequent in the CoronaVac group. Women showed a higher frequency of headache (45.7% versus 29.4%) and joint pain (26.1 versus 14.7%) than men in BTN162b2 group. Headache (26.5% versus 0%) and tiredness (38.2% versus 5.3%) were more common in women than in men vaccinated with CoronaVac. No correlation between any AE and antibody response was observed in BNT162b2 or CoronaVac platforms. After taking the gender factor into account, in the BNT162b2 group, a low correlation between day 21 vMN titer and redness (rho = 0.34) or itching (rho = 0.32) was presented in females, and a low correlation between day 56 vMN titer and fever (rho = 0.35) was presented in males. Taken together, AEs could have a low correlation with BNT162b2 vaccine response. IMPORTANCE Effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are vital tools for containing the COVID-19 pandemic by increasing population immunity. While currently available vaccines can elicit antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 with high efficacy, the associated side effects may cause vaccine hesitancy. Our work is important in that we have thoroughly analyzed the correlation between immunogenicity and reactogenicity of two COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 and CoronaVac) in the study. Our results showed that women had higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than men after receiving BNT162b2 or CoronaVac. Furthermore, a low correlation was observed between day 21 vMN titer and local reactions (redness and itching) in females, as well as between day 56 vMN titer and fever in males receiving BNT162b2. Thus, common side effects are not always a negative impact of vaccination but may serve as an indicator of immunogenicity of vaccines. Our study may help in increasing the publics acceptance and confidence over COVID-19 vaccination and ultimately achieving the goal of containing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Correlation of Immunogenicity and Reactogenicity of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Service learning and short-term missions represent one of the many habits disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Standard treatment of chronic GvHD comprises steroids in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), with its immunomodulatory mechanism, is applied as part of steroid-sparing regimens for chronic GvHD. Immunocompromised, chronically ill patients are at particular risk of severe disease courses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. T-cell immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection is well-described but the role of the humoral immune responses is not fully understood. This case report describes a moderate course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient <9 months after HSCT who was suffering from active, severe, chronic GvHD treated with prednisone and ECP. Following HSCT from a matched unrelated donor to cure acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the 25-year-old male patient experienced multiple infectious complications associated with cytopenia, B-cell dyshomeostasis and autoantibody production followed by development of severe chronic GvHD thereafter at day +212. The steroid-sparing treatment plan consisted of supportive care, topical treatment, prednisone and ECP. He was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at day +252, experiencing loss of smell and taste as well as a cough. The patient's oxygen saturation was between 94 and 97% on room air, and computed tomography images showed evolution of typical of SARS-CoV-2 infiltrates. In addition to cytopenia and immune dyshomeostasis, laboratory tests confirmed macrophage activating syndrome, transaminitis and Epstein-Barr virus viraemia. At that time, anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies were not available in Austria and remdesivir seemed contraindicated. Surprisingly, despite severe lymphopenia the patient developed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies within 15 days, which was followed by clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and EBV with resolution of symptoms. Thereafter, parameters of immune dysregulation such as lymphopenia and B-cell dyshomeostasis, the latter characterised by elevated CD21(low) B cells and autoantibody expression, normalised. Moreover, we observed complete response of active chronic GvHD to treatment.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Active, Multiorgan, Severe cGVHD After HSCT for Adolescent ALL: More Luck Than Understanding?

However, such a practice is widespread and is likely to be as common in Papua New Guinea as in many other countries. METHODS In a cross-sectional descriptive study, children were recruited who had been diagnosed with a common cold or URTI by attending clinical staff-mostly nurses-in a provincial hospital's children's outpatient department using a standard definition. The frequency of antibiotic prescribing was determined and the clinical knowledge and practices of nurses, health extension officers, community health workers and doctors working in the children's outpatients department regarding the common cold and its management was assessed. RESULTS One hundred and eight children diagnosed with the common cold were enrolled; 89 (82.4%) were prescribed antibiotics. Children with fever on examination, those older than 12 months and those whose symptoms lasted 7 days were more likely to be prescribed antibiotics. Of the health workers surveyed, 95% knew that viruses were the cause of the common cold, but 30% thought that antibiotics were needed for treatment. CONCLUSIONS Although among healthcare workers, there was a gap between knowledge of aetiology and knowledge of appropriate management of the common cold, there was a larger apparent gap between that knowledge and practice. Findings from this study could be used to identify interventions promoting rational antibiotic use, targeting both health-care workers and the community.","output":"Antibiotic use in the management of children with the common cold at a provincial hospital in Papua New Guinea: a point-prevalence study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract In the modern business environment, consumers are increasingly influenced by megatrends involving marketplace, technology, socioeconomics, geopolitics, and natural environment. Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the outside-in perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities. We elaborate on the megatrends in the interconnected world of the marketing ecosystem, and propose emerging research directions in each area.","output":"Marketing ecosystem: An outside-in view for sustainable advantage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vvECMO) is a highly invasive technique with a high risk of mortality. Based on reports of improved outcomes in high-volume ECMO centers, we established a regional vvECMO unit. The objective of this study was to evaluate how the vvECMO unit affected patient mortality rates. METHODS: This was a historical cohort study of all patients admitted to Dijon University Hospital and supported by vvECMO between January 2011 and June 2021. Patients managed with the vvECMO unit were compared with patients managed with non-vvECMO units. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. RESULTS: Of 172 patients treated using vvECMO, 69% were men, and the median [interquartile range] age was 59 [48C66] yr. Of the 172 patients, 35 were treated in the vvECMO unit and 137 were treated elsewhere (110/137 before the unit was established and 27/137 after). Ninety-day mortality was lower in patients managed in the vvECMO unit (15/35, 43% vs 92/137, 67%; P = 0.005). Within the vvECMO unit, mortality rates were also lower for the subgroup of patients managed after the specialized unit was established (15/35, 43% vs 20/27, 74%; P = 0.002). After adjusting for baseline severity of illness at vvECMO initiation, the vvECMO unit was independently associated with a lower 90-day mortality rate (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.80). CONCLUSION: The establishment of a vvECMO unit was associated with reduced 90-day mortality. This improved survival may relate to patient selection, more specialized mechanical ventilation support, and/or improvement of vvECMO care.

Here, we report the identification of the most C-terminal cleavage product of the 1a polyprotein as a 16-kDa protein in infectious bronchitis virus-infected Vero cells. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that the protein exhibits a distinct perinuclear punctate staining pattern, suggesting that it is associated with cellular membranes. Positive staining observed on nonpermeabilized cells indicates that the protein may get transported to the cell surface, but no secretion of the protein out of the cells was observed. Treatment of the membrane fraction prepared from cells expressing the 16-kDa protein with Triton X-100, a high pH, and a high concentration of salts showed that the protein may be tightly associated with intracellular membranes. Dual-labeling experiments demonstrated that the 16-kDa protein colocalized with the 5'-bromouridine 5'-triphosphate-labeled viral RNA, suggesting that it may be associated with the viral replication machinery. Sequence comparison of the 16-kDa protein with the equivalent products of other coronaviruses showed multiple conserved cysteine residues, and site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that these conserved residues may contribute to dimerization of the 16-kDa protein. Furthermore, increased accumulation of the 16-kDa protein upon stimulation with epidermal growth factor was observed, providing preliminary evidence that the protein might be involved in the growth factor signaling pathway.","output":"Membrane association and dimerization of a cysteine-rich, 16-kilodalton polypeptide released from the C-terminal region of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus 1a polyprotein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 6.6 million people worldwide.

G-TADOC solves three major challenges. First, TADOC involves a large amount of dependencies, which makes it difficult to exploit massive parallelism on a GPU. We develop a novel fine-grained thread-level workload scheduling strategy for GPU threads, which partitions heavily-dependent loads adaptively in a fine-grained manner. Second, in developing G-TADOC, thousands of GPU threads writing to the same result buffer leads to inconsistency while directly using locks and atomic operations lead to large synchronization overheads. We develop a memory pool with thread-safe data structures on GPUs to handle such difficulties. Third, maintaining the sequence information among words is essential for lossless compression. We design a sequence-support strategy, which maintains high GPU parallelism while ensuring sequence information.

The advantageous pharmacologic profile includes rapid onset of action (40-60 secs), short duration (6-10 mins), and better intubation conditions such as ease of laryngoscopy and diaphragm inactivation. There are recognized adverse effects including benign manifestations (muscle fasciculations) to life-threatening conditions (acute hyperkalemia and malignant hyperthermia). Scenarios with increased risk include muscular dystrophies, rhabdomyolysis, crush/burn injuries, malignant hyperthermia, and abdominal infections. We present a case of life-threatening hyperkalemia after administration in the setting of critical care myopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old woman was admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19 pneumonia. Treatment included steroids, neuromuscular blockade, and prone positioning. Due to frequent ventilator associated pneumonias and difficulty with airway hygiene, endotracheal (ET) tube exchange was planned on hospital day 34. Succinylcholine was utilized given suitable creatinine clearance, normal serum potassium, and sinus rhythm. The removed ET tube had dark, thick, adherent secretions. Less than one minute from administration, telemetry changed to a wide QRS complex and degenerated into pulseless ventricular fibrillation. There was no preceding hypoxemia. The patient received ACLS with defibrillation for recurrent ventricular fibrillation with ROSC. DISCUSSION: Succinylcholine binds to the post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the motor endplate causing depolarization. Receptor activation triggers efflux of intracellular potassium into the plasma. Receptor upregulation occurs in pathologic conditions including lower motor neuron disorders, immobilization, burns, and muscular dystrophies. Myopathies have inherent membrane fragility and increased permeability producing release of potassium. The development of critical illness myopathy, polyneuropathy, and polyneuromyopathy in the ICU has an incidence of 25-83%. Proposed mechanisms include myosin loss, necrosis of the muscle, muscle membrane dysfunction, denervation of the muscle, nerve ischemia, and axonal injury. Activation of the acetylcholine receptors and sustained muscle contraction in this state can result in devastating hyperkalemia. CONCLUSIONS: Succinylcholine as a paralytic medication for RSI in patients with critical care myopathy should give providers clinical equipoise. There is a risk for acute hyperkalemia due to the damaged muscle membrane and upregulated acetylcholine receptors. REFERENCE #1: Tran, D. T.

Metrics were compared within different classes of rurality, using seven rurality classification schemes. Significant differences were noted in four of the five metrics between classes of rurality. Rural counties in TN experienced significant lags to the first case, hospitalization, and fatality, and the peak cases in rural counties were delayed relative to urban counties when outlier counties with early state prison outbreaks were excluded. In rural TN counties, regardless of rurality definition, cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities were slower to appear. However, once community spread was established, rurality no longer had a protective effect.","output":"Rurality and COVID-19 in Tennessee: Assessing and Communicating Pandemic Emergence and Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: The case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 has been high among residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities. It is important to know if the excess mortality persists beyond the acute infection. Objective: To evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 is associated with higher mortality after the first month from documented infection. Design: We extended the follow-up period of a previous, retrospective cohort study based on the Swedish Senior Alert register. LTC residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 were matched to uninfected controls using time-dependent propensity scores on age, sex, body mass index, health status, comorbidities, and prescription medication use. In a sensitivity analysis, residents were also matched on geographical region and time of Senior Alert registration. Setting: LTC facilities in Sweden. Participants: 3731 LTC residents with SARS-CoV-2 and 3731 controls (n=3604 in each group in the sensitivity analysis). Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 infection, documented in the SmiNet register (until September 15, 2020). Main Outcome: All-cause mortality over 8 months (until October 24, 2020). Results: The median age was 87 years, and 65% were women. Excess mortality was highest 5 days after documented infection (hazard ratio 19.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.6-24.8), after which excess mortality decreased rapidly. After the second month, the mortality rate became lower in infected residents than in controls. Median survival of uninfected controls was 577 days (1.6 years), which is much lower than national life expectancy in Sweden at age 87 (5.05 years in men, 6.07 years in women). During days 61-210 of follow-up, the hazard ratio for death was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.34-0.50) in the main analysis and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.62-0.93) in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusions and Relevance: No excess mortality was observed in LTC residents who survived the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (the first month). The life expectancy of uninfected residents was much lower than that of the general population of the same age and sex. This difference should be taken into account in calculations of years of life lost among LTC residents.","output":"Time-Varying Death Risk After SARS-CoV-2-Infection in Swedish Long-Term Care Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic renal replacement therapy by either a kidney transplant (KTX) or hemodialysis (HD) predisposes patients to an increased risk for adverse outcomes of COVID-19. However, details on this interaction remain incomplete. To provide further characterization, we undertook a retrospective observational cohort analysis of the majority of the hemodialysis and renal transplant population affected by the first regional outbreak of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Germany. In a region of 250,000 inhabitants we identified a total of 21 cases with SARS-CoV-2 among 100 KTX and 260 HD patients, that is, 7 KTX with COVID-19, 14 HD with COVID-19, and 3 HD with asymptomatic carrier status. As a first observation, KTX recipients exhibited trends for a higher mortality (43 vs 18%) and a higher proportion of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (57 vs 27%) when compared to their HD counterparts. As a novel finding, development of ARDS was significantly associated with the time spent on previous renal replacement therapy (RRT), defined as the composite of dialysis time and time on the transplant (non-ARDS 4.3 vs ARDS 10.6 years, P = .016). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed an OR of 1.7 per year of RRT. The association remained robust when analysis was confined to KTX patients (5.1 vs 13.2 years, P = .002) or when correlating the time spent on a renal transplant alone (P = .038). Similarly, longer RRT correlated with death vs survival (P = .0002). In conclusion our data suggest renal replacement vintage as a novel risk factor for COVID-19-associated ARDS and death.

We quantified 39 plasma cytokines and chemokines using multiplex ELISA. Spearman rank correlation and Mann-Whitney U test were used to identify mechanistically coupled cytokines/chemokines and compare disease severity. Compared to healthy controls, patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of interleukins 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 15, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1), IFN-{gamma}-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1), eotaxin-3, interferon-gamma (IFN-{Upsilon}), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), and fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1). Patients with severe COVID-19 had higher IL-10 and lower macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) compared to the mild or moderate group (P<0.05).

This paper focuses on an under-appreciated supply chain risknetwork cybersecuritythat was present before the pandemic and which the pandemic brings into sharper focus. While the proliferation of digital services has created significant value and employment opportunities, it has also created a wide array of new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities of DVRs, CCTVs, voting machines, and municipal systems, leading to denial of service attacks and ransomware hold ups are known. But, these examples miss a problem. Although these examples give the impression that only certain hardware and specific entities are affected, taking networked cybersecurity into account changes yields different conclusions. For example, given that enterprise software, which is common for work at home situations, is rapidly becoming a cybersecurity vulnerability, anyone connected by this software necessarily becomes a target too. Malicious cyber incidents, like data breaches, can have ripple effects across a network of businesses and sectors. Current definitions and regulations of Critical Infrastructure (CI) overlook this point. We argue that the network dimension of cybersecurity supply chain risk is an important, under-studied aspect of the problem. Legal definitions of CI and the voluntary nature of cybersecurity governance leave gaps in the classification of CI and how to identify cybersecurity risk, particularly in the professional services sector. In addition, the voluntary nature of cybersecurity governance demands risk-based and objective measures to aid in identifying when to take steps on improving cybersecurity, but exactly what such metrics are is, at best, evolving. We address both these problems. By drawing on a new dataset, we develop metrics that measure productivity effects and that captures network cybersecurity risk. This approach allows us to show that a major sector, professional services, is missed by current definitions of critical infrastructure, but could be captured if CI definitions accounted for networked cybersecurity risk. In addition, the approach aids voluntary participation in mitigating cybersecurity risk because it provides a way for any firm or sector to identify and assess the nature of its networked cybersecurity risk. In short, networked cybersecurity vulnerabilities can adversely affect aggregate growth and national security objectives because of connectivity across firms and sectors. This work seeks to provide a path forward for understanding, defining, and protecting networked cybersecurity.","output":"Identifying Critical Infrastructure in a World with Network Cybersecurity Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic poses many direct and indirect consequences for children's health and associated research.

METHODS AND RESULTS: COVID-19 patients at seven institutions receiving HCQ therapy from whom a baseline and at least one ECG at 48+ h were available were enrolled in the study. QT/QTc prolongation, QT-associated and QT-independent arrhythmic events, arrhythmic mortality, and overall mortality during HCQ therapy were assessed. A total of 649 COVID-19 patients (61.9  18.7 years, 46.1% males) were enrolled. HCQ therapy was administrated as a home therapy regimen in 126 (19.4%) patients, and as an in-hospital-treatment to 495 (76.3%) hospitalized and 28 (4.3%) intensive care unit (ICU) patients. At 36C72 and at 96+ h after the first HCQ dose, 358 and 404 ECGs were obtained, respectively. A significant QT/QTc interval prolongation was observed (P < 0.001), but the magnitude of the increase was modest [+13 (9C16) ms]. Baseline QT/QTc length and presence of fever (P = 0.001) at admission represented the most important determinants of QT/QTc prolongation. No arrhythmic-related deaths were reported. The overall major ventricular arrhythmia rate was low (1.1%), with all events found not to be related to QT or HCQ therapy at a centralized event evaluation. No differences in QT/QTc prolongation and QT-related arrhythmias were observed across different clinical settings, with non-QT-related arrhythmias being more common in the intensive care setting.

Protocols for the management of poisoning recommend diazepam, although there are uncertainties in its pharmacology and efficacy in this context. The aim was to assess the effects of diazepam in experimental models of chloroquine cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In vitro experiments involved cardiac tissues isolated from rats and incubated with chloroquine alone or in combination with diazepam. In vivo models of toxicity involved chloroquine administered intravenously to pentobarbitone-anaesthetised rats and rabbits. Randomised, controlled treatment studies in rats assessed diazepam, clonazepam and Ro5-4864 administered: (i) prior, (ii) during and (iii) after chloroquine and the effects of diazepam: (iv) at high dose, (v) in urethane-anaesthetised rats and (vi) co-administered with adrenaline. KEY RESULTS: Chloroquine decreased the developed tension of left atria, prolonged the effective refractory period of atria, ventricular tissue and right papillary muscles, and caused dose-dependent impairment of haemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters. Cardiac arrhythmias indicated impairment of atrioventricular conduction. Studies (i), (ii) and (v) showed no differences between treatments and control. Diazepam increased heart rate in study (iv) and as with clonazepam also prolonged the QTc interval in study (iii). Combined administration of diazepam and adrenaline in study (vi) improved cardiac contractility but caused hypokalaemia. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Neither diazepam nor other ligands for benzodiazepine binding sites protect against or attenuate chloroquine cardiotoxicity.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the RT-LAMP assay with RT-PCR using the Loopamp&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 Detection Kit. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and fifty-one nasopharyngeal swab and 88 sputum samples obtained from individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: RT-LAMP had high specificity (98.5 % (95 % CI: 96.9-100 %)), sensitivity (87.0 % (95 % CI: 82.8-91.3 %)), positive predictive value (97.9 % (95 % CI: 96.1-99.7 %)), negative predictive value (90.2 % (95 % CI: 86.4-94.0 %)), and concordance rate (93.3 % (95 % CI: 90.1-96.5 %)). Nasopharyngeal and sputum samples positive in RT-LAMP contained as few as 10.2 and 23.4 copies per 10 L, respectively. RT-LAMP showed similar performance to RT-PCR for samples with cycle threshold value below 36.

These antibodies activate platelets via platelet FcIIa receptors, with platelet activation greatly enhanced by PF4. Here we summarize the current concepts in the pathogenesis of VITT. We first address parallels between heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and VITT, and provide recent findings on binding of PF4 to adenovirus particles and non-assembled adenovirus proteins in the two adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S. Further, we discuss the potential role of vaccine constituents such as glycosaminoglycans, EDTA, polysorbate 80, human cell-line proteins and nucleotides as potential binding partners of PF4. The immune response towards PF4 in VITT is likely triggered by a proinflammatory milieu. Human cell-line proteins, non-assembled virus proteins, and potentially EDTA may contribute to the proinflammatory state. The transient nature of the immune response towards PF4 in VITT makes it likely thatas in HITmarginal zone B cells are key for antibody production. Once high-titer anti-PF4 antibodies have been formed 5-20 days after vaccination, they activate platelets and granulocytes. Activated granulocytes undergo NETosis and the released DNA also forms complexes with PF4, which fuels the Fc receptor-dependent cell activation process, ultimately leading to massive thrombin generation. Finally, we summarize our initial observations indicating that VITT-like antibodies might also be present in rare patients with recurrent venous and arterial thrombotic complications, independent of vaccination.","output":"Pathogenesis of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Passive immunotherapy has been evaluated as a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19 disease.

All independent variables (sociodemographic characteristics, family support, and emotional, health excluding friends' support, physical activity volume, and coronavirus restrictions) were significantly different between participants engaging vs. not engaging in risky behaviors. Our findings suggest that family support is one of the most influential factors in preventing risky behavior during the pandemic, and they emphasize the importance of family-based interventions with children and adolescents from elementary to high school.","output":"Risk Behaviors, Family Support, and Emotional Health among Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The progressive SARS-CoV2 outbreaks worldwide have evoked global investigation. Despite the numerousin-silico approaches, the virus-host relationship remains a serious concern. MicroRNAs are the small non-coding RNAs that help in regulating gene profiling. The current study utilized miRNA prediction tools along with the PANTHER classification system to demonstrate association and sequence similarities shared between miRNAs of SARS-CoV2 and human host. METHOD: An in-silico approach was carried out using Vmir analyzer to predict miRNAs from SARS-CoV2 viral genomes. Predicted miRNAs from SARS-CoV2 viral genomes were used for effective hybridization sequence identification along the nucleotide similarities with human miRNAs from miRbase database. Further, it was proceeded to analyze the gene ontology using miRDB with PANTHER classification. RESULT: Based on the prediction and analysis, we have identified 22 potential miRNAs from five genomes of SARS-CoV2 linked with 12 human miRNAs. Analysis of human miRNAs hsa-mir-1267, hsa-mir-1-3p, hsa-mir-5683 were found shared between all the five viral SARS-CoV2 miRNAs. Further, PANTHER classification analyzed the gene-ontology being carried by these associations showed that 44 genes were involved in biological functions that includes genes specific for signaling pathway, immune complex generation, enzyme binding with effective role in the virus-host relationship. CONCLUSION: Our analysis concludes that the genes identified in this study can be effective in analyzing the virus-host interaction. It also provides a new direction to understand viral pathogenesis with a probable new way to link, that can be used to understand and relate the miRNAs of the virus to the host conditions.","output":"An in-silico approach to study the possible interactions of miRNA between human and SARS-CoV2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This paper aims to investigate the Portuguese general public views regarding the criteria that should guide critical COVID-19 patients to receive medical devices (ventilators and IUC beds) during the current pandemic context. Based on rationing principles and protocols proposed in ethical and medical literature the authors explore how Portuguese general public evaluates the fairness of five allocation principles: \\"prognosis\\", \\"severity of health condition\\", \\"patients age\\", \\"instrumental value\\" (frontline healthcare professionals should be prioritized during the pandemic) and \\"lottery\\". DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH An online questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of 586 Portuguese citizens. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were used to define a hierarchy of prioritization criteria and to test for the association between respondents support to them and their socio-demographic and health characteristics. FINDINGS Respondents gave top priority to prognosis when faced with absolute scarcity, followed closely by the severity of health condition, patient's age with instrumental value receiving lowest support, on average. However, when the age of the patients was confronted with survival, younger-first principle prevailed over recovery. In a pandemic context, lottery was considered the least fair allocation method. The findings suggest that respondents' opinions are aligned with those of ethicists but are partially in disagreement with the protocol suggested for Portugal.

Natural transformation is one mechanism of HGT where extracellular DNA (eDNA) from the environment is recombined into a host genome. The widespread conservation of transformation in bacterial lineages implies there is a fitness benefit. However, the nature of these benefits and the evolutionary origins of transformation are still unknown. Here, I examine how 330 generations or 100 days of serial passage in either constant or increasing salinities impacts the growth rate and transformation efficiency of Pseudomonas stutzeri. While the growth rate generally improved in response to serial transfer, the transformation efficiency of the evolved lineages varied extensively, with only 39-64% of populations undergoing transformation at the end of adaptive evolution. In comparison, 100% of the ancestral populations were able to undergo natural transformation. I also found that evolving P. stutzeri with different cell lysates (or populations of dead cells) minimally affected the growth rate and transformation efficiency, especially in comparison to the pervasiveness with which transformation capacity was lost across the evolved populations. Taken together, I show that the efficiency of eDNA uptake changes over relatively rapid timescales, suggesting that transformation is an adaptive and selectable trait that could be lost in environments where it is not beneficial.","output":"Changes in natural transformation after salt adaptation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared a worldwide pandemic Compared to adults, there has been a significantly smaller number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the pediatric population, although the incidence is increasing every day This article looks to review specific epidemiological factors, symptomatology, laboratory and imaging workup, and other relevant metrics derived from the limited published literature that are specific to the pediatric population, to provide a review for the pediatric practitioner and guide, in part, the creation of a clinical algorithm for the management of COVID-19 in the pediatric population that can be utilized by pediatric institutions","output":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and Pediatric Patients: A Review of Epidemiology, Symptomatology, Laboratory and Imaging Results to Guide the Development of a Management Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The state of boredom presents a conundrum: When bored, we want to engage with an activity, but we don't want to engage with whatever is currently available This conflict is exacerbated when external factors impose restrictions on the range of behaviors we can engage in, which is precisely the scenario we are currently facing, at a global level, during this period of social isolation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic We collected data from 924 North American participants (530 Male, Mean age = 37 7 years) using the internet-based Mturk platform to examine the relation between self-reports of boredom proneness (using the Short Boredom-Proneness Scale) and individual responses to questions about compliance with social-distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic Our sample replicated recent findings in boredom research, including a negative correlation between boredom proneness and self-control We also provide novel evidence that highly boredom prone people have been more likely to break the rules of social isolation in a variety of ways (e g , fewer hours spent in social isolation, poor adherence to social distancing as evidenced by increased likelihood of holding a social gathering and coming into proximity with more people than recommended) We further demonstrated that boredom proneness substantially mediates the association between self-control and rule-breaking These results indicate that boredom proneness is a critical factor to consider when encouraging adherence to social isolation","output":"Boredom in the COVID-19 pandemic: Trait boredom proneness, the desire to act, and rule-breaking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza virus is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.

The aim of this study was to determine the potential role of active GLP-1 in H9N2 influenza virus-induced ALI/ARDS in mice. First, we uncovered that GCG mRNA expression levels and GCG precursor protein levels were significantly increased, but total GLP-1 and active GLP-1 levels were decreased in the lungs of H9N2-infected mice. Next, liraglutide, an active GLP-1 analogue, was used to treat infected mice and to observe its effects on H9N2 virus-induced ALI. Liraglutide treatment ameliorated the declined body weight, decreased food intake and mortality observed in infected mice. It also alleviated the severity of lung injury, including lowering lung index, decreasing inflammatory cell infiltration and lowing total protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In addition, liraglutide did not influence viral titers in infected lungs, but decreased the levels of interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor- in BALF. These results indicated that liraglutide alleviated H9N2 virus-induced ALI in mice most likely due to lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","output":"The active GLP-1 analogue liraglutide alleviates H9N2 influenza virus-induced acute lung injury in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abortion law is one of the main factors influencing the number of abortions performed in a country.

FINDINGS: In each case, the administration's policy choices intensified, rather than mitigated, structural racism and racial health inequality. Its choices had a disproportionate adverse impact on minority populations and patients who are more likely to depend on public programs, be poor, experience pandemic-related job loss, lack insurance, rely on health care safety net providers, and be exposed to public charge sanctions.

The disease can be spread by both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals. Uncertainty remains over key aspects of the virus infectiousness (particularly the newly emerging variants) and the disease has had severe economic impacts globally. For these reasons, COVID-19 is the subject of intense and widespread discussion on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. These public forums substantially influence public opinions and in some cases can exacerbate the widespread panic and misinformation spread during the crisis. Thus, this work aimed to design an intelligent clustering-based classification and topic extracting model named TClustVID that analyzes COVID-19-related public tweets to extract significant sentiments with high accuracy. We gathered COVID-19 Twitter datasets from the IEEE Dataport repository and employed a range of data preprocessing methods to clean the raw data, then applied tokenization and produced a word-to-index dictionary. Thereafter, different classifications were employed on these datasets which enabled the exploration of the performance of traditional classification and TClustVID. Our analysis found that TClustVID showed higher performance compared to traditional methodologies that are determined by clustering criteria. Finally, we extracted significant topics from the clusters, split them into positive, neutral and negative sentiments, and identified the most frequent topics using the proposed model. This approach is able to rapidly identify commonly prevailing aspects of public opinions and attitudes related to COVID-19 and infection prevention strategies spreading among different populations.","output":"TClustVID: A novel machine learning classification model to investigate topics and sentiment in COVID-19 tweets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Density functional theory (DFT) was performed in order to predict the structural, chemical descriptors and optoelectronic properties of the drugs Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin using the wB97XD, O3LYP and B3LYP functional with 6-31+G(d,p) basis set.

The lateral flow test strip technology can achieve results visible to the naked eye, while fluorescence readout can achieve real-time high-sensitivity detection. The fluorescent readout-based Cas12a assay can achieve HBV detection with a limit of detection of 1 copy/L within 13 min, while the lateral flow test strip technique only takes 20 min. In the evaluation of 73 clinical samples, the sensitivity and specificity of both the fluorescence readout and lateral flow test strip method were 100%, and the results of the assay were fully comparable to qPCR.

Recent studies demonstrated that the incidence of severe or fatal M. pneumoniae was gradually increasing, which may be related to the excessive inflammation. However, the exact pathogenesis of excessive inflammation in Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia(MPP) is still unclear. This study aimed to reveal the role of miR-29c/B7-H3/Th17 axis in children with MPP. METHODS: Children hospitalized in Respiratory Department during Jan. 2014 to Dec. 2015 were enrolled. All children enrolled was confirmed with MP infection using real-time PCR and ELISA. Children were excluded if they were co-infected with other pathogens. A total of 52 children with MPP and 26 controls were enrolled. miR-29c expression in monocytes of children with MPP was determined by real-time PCR and soluble B7-H3 (sB7-H3) and IL-17 were determined by ELISA, and explore their clinical significance. miR-29c overexpression and silencing technology and luciferase reporter assay were performed to confirm whether B7-H3 is the direct target of miR-29c. The levels of transcription factor ROR-t in CD4+ T cells and cytokine IL-17A in supernatant were detected after stimulated by different concentrations of B7-H3 fusion protein in vitro. RESULTS: Of all 52 children with MPP, the mean age of the children were 77  33 months, and 23 cases were male accounting for 44.2%. Nineteen cases had pleural effusion accounting for 36.5%. Children with MPP had significantly lower level of miR-29c and higher level of sB7-H3 and IL-17 compared to controls (both P < 0.05). The level of miR-29c significantly increased during convalescent phase compared to that of acute phase while sB7-H3 and IL-17 significantly decreased during convalescent phase (both P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the level of sB7-H3 and IL-17 in children with MPP during acute-stage (r = 0.361,P = 0.009). Children with MPP combined with pleural effusion had significantly higher level of sB7-H3 compared to those without pleural effusion (9952.3  3065.3 vs. 7449.7  2231.5, pg/ml), and the levels of sB7-H3 was positively correlated with the number of days of fever. The level of miR-29c was negatively correlated with M. pneumoniae specific IgG, IgM level. High concentrations of B7-H3(15g/ml) could enhance ROR-t expression and increase IL-17A. Functional studies based on luciferase reporter assay and immunofluorescence staining suggested that B7-H3 is the direct target of miR-29c, and miR-29c silencing or overexpression could up- or down-regulate the expression of B7-H3 in THP-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The axis of miR-29c/B7-H3/Th17 plays a vital role in children with MPP through excessive inflammation. miR-29c and B7-H3 may be the new target for the prevention and treatment of MPP, and may be the novel and potential biomarkers for the assessment of prognosis.","output":"The role of miR-29c/B7-H3/Th17 axis in children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After one year of stop-and-go COVID-19 mitigation, in the spring of 2021 European countries still experienced sustained viral circulation due to the Alpha variant.

We identify optimal strategies by balancing efficacy of interventions with a data-driven distress index, integrating intensity and duration of social distancing. RESULTS: We show that moderate interventions would require a much longer time to achieve the same result as high intensity lockdowns, with the additional risk of deteriorating control as adherence wanes. Shorter strict lockdowns are largely more effective than longer moderate lockdowns, for similar intermediate distress and infringement on individual freedom.

This study was designed to assess the beneficial effects of post-treatment of oroxylin A (OroA), a flavonoid, in ameliorating lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced lung inflammation and fatality. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats were injected with LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) to induce ALI, and OroA was given (15 mg/kg, iv) 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge. Twenty four hrs after LPS challenge, biochemical changes in the blood and lung tissues, and morphological/histological alterations in the lung associated with inflammation and injury were examined. Therapeutic effect of OroA was assessed by measuring the survival rate in endotoxemic mice. KEY RESULTS: LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) significantly altered WBC counts, elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and nitric oxide (NO), increased pulmonary edema, thickened alveolar septa, and decreased survival rate. These changes were ameliorated by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge. This post-treatment also significantly attenuated LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) and the release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in lung tissues. Furthermore, post-treatment with OroA (60 mg/kg, ip) administered 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge in mice significantly increased survival rate. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION: OroA administered after induction of ALI by LPS significantly prevent and revere lung tissues injuries with increased survival rate.

We excluded those who had not been to their workplace in the previous 6 weeks, leaving us with a sample size of 831. Respondents were asked about their use of PPE, hand hygiene and physical distancing in the workplace. Frequency of uptake was reported descriptively; adjusted logistic regressions were used to separately investigate factors associated with adherence to use of PPE, maintaining good hand hygiene and physical distancing from colleagues. RESULTS: Adherence to personal protective measures was suboptimal (PPE use: 80.0%, 95% CI 77.3 to 82.8; hand hygiene: 67.8%, 95% CI 64.6 to 71.0; coming into close contact with colleagues: 74.7%, 95% CI 71.7 to 77.7). Adherence to PPE use was associated with having received training about health and safety in the workplace for COVID-19, greater perceived social pressure to adopt the behaviour and availability of PPE. Non-adherence was associated with fatalism about COVID-19 and greater perceived difficulty of adopting protective measures. Workplace design using markings to facilitate distancing was associated with adherence to physical distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of personal protective behaviours among UK HCWs at the start of the pandemic was variable. Factors associated with adherence provide insight into ways to support HCWs to adopt personal protective behaviours, such as ensuring that adequate PPE is available and designing workplaces to facilitate physical distancing.","output":"Adherence to protective measures among healthcare workers in the UK: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pneumonic disease caused by the SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the 7th Coronavirus to have successfully infected and caused an outbreak in humans. Genome comparisons have shown that previous isolates, the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), including the SARS-CoV are closely related, yet different in disease manifestation. Several explanations were suggested for the undetermined origin of SARS-CoV-2, in particular, bats, avian and Malayan pangolins as reservoir hosts, owing to the high genetic similarity. The general morphology and structure of all these viral isolates overlap with analogous disease symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnoea and headache, very similar to the current SARS-CoV-2. Chest CT scans for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reveal pulmonary lesions, bilateral ground-glass opacities, and segmental consolidation in the lungs, a common pathological trait. With greatly overlapping similarities among the previous coronavirus, the SARS-CoV, it becomes interesting to observe marked differences in disease severity of the SARS-CoV-2 thereby imparting it the ability to rapidly transmit, exhibit greater stability, bypass innate host defences, and increasingly adapt to their new host thereby resulting in the current pandemic. The most recent B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants of SARS-CoV-2, highlight the fact that changes in amino acids in the Spike protein can contribute to enhanced infection and transmission efficiency. This review covers a comparative analysis of previous coronavirus outbreaks and highlights the differences and similarities among different coronaviruses, including the most recent isolates that have evolved to become easily transmissible with higher replication efficiency in humans.","output":"SARS coronavirus outbreaks past and present-a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and its predecessors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have been publishing real-time forecasts of confirmed cases and deaths for COVID-19 from mid-March 2020 onwards, published at www.doornik.com/COVID-19.

METHODS: A new classification and standardized imaging diagnosis report mode of viral pneumonia was established by studying and summarizing the imaging findings of various kinds of viral pneumonia, combining with lesion density, interstitial changes, pleural effusion, lymph nodes, and some special signs. After systematic training, the radiologist experienced clinical practice for screening CT features. COVID-19 cases were screened retrospectively in the single-center. The confirmed cases were verified, and the diagnostic efficacy of the standardized imaging reporting system in screening COVID-19 was tested. RESULTS: There were 912 patients in this stage receiving the screening imaging examination. Of them, 190 patients were screened in the report mode and 30 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19. The CT manifestation of COVID-19 was characterized by pure ground glass lesions or with a few solid components, predominant subpleural distribution, no lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion, and often with paving-way sign and air bronchus sign.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the use and efficiency of remote interpretation of visual fields (VFs) in an academic center and to determine how often the VF interpretation was consistent with the patient's clinical history and imaging at the time of the consult. METHODS This is a retrospective study at a single academic center that enrolled all patients receiving a remote interpretation of VF from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012. Data were collected regarding the referring department, indication for the VF, interpretation of the VF and comparison with any prior VFs, any associated interventions with the VF, and available follow-up VFs. The main outcome measures included 1) characterizing the use of remote VF interpretations and 2) how many remote VF interpretation results were consistent with the referring diagnosis based on the patient's clinical history and imaging. RESULTS One hundred eighty patients received remote interpretation of VFs. The most frequent referring departments were endocrinology (79; 44%), neurology (51; 28%), and neurosurgery (43; 24%). The VF indications included parasellar lesion (107; 59%), seizure disorder (26; 14%), meningioma (19; 11%), vascular lesion (11; 6%), and others (17; 9%). There were 78 patients (43%) that had an intervention before the VF, whereas 49 (27%) were preoperative VFs. Eighty-seven (48%) of the VFs were interpreted as abnormal. Of all the 180 remote interpretation of VFs, 156 (87%) had VF interpretations that were consistent with the clinical question posed by the referring provider based on clinical history and imaging. Among the other 24 remote VF interpretations (13% of total remote VF interpretations), there was no clear interpretation because of either additional unexpected VF defects (n = 5, 21%), VF defect mismatch (n = 6, 25%), or unreliable VFs (n = 13, 54%). The median wait time for patients receiving remote VF interpretations was 1 day. CONCLUSIONS Remote interpretation of VFs was most often requested by endocrinology, neurology, and neurosurgery and could be performed very quickly. The most common indications were parasellar lesions, and just less than half of patients receiving remote VF interpretations had a prior intervention. A majority of remote VF interpretations were able to answer the clinical question, given the patient's clinical history and imaging. Remote interpretation of VFs may thus offer referring departments a more efficient method of obtaining VF interpretations than in-office neuro-ophthalmology examinations.","output":"Characterization and Utility of Remote Interpretation of Visual Field Diagnostic Testing in an Academic Center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Why did some Bolivian departments have more success containing COVID-19 than others?

Whisker stimulation was used to verify that typical CBF responses were obtained in all mice. Photo-stimulation of SOM-cre and NOS-cre mice produced significant increases in CBF that were similar to whisker responses. In NOS-cre mice, CBF responses scaled with the photo-stimulus pulse duration and frequency. In SOM-cre mice, CBF increases were followed by decreases. In VIP-cre mice, photo-stimulation did not consistently produce significant changes in CBF, while slower increases in CBF that peaked 14C18 s after stimulation onset were observed in PV-cre mice. Control experiments performed in non-expressing regions showed no changes in CBF.

Patients vulnerable to severe COVID-19 are at risk of hydroxychloroquine interactions with co-morbidities and co-medications contributing to detrimental, including fatal, adverse treatment effects. METHODS: A retrospective survey was undertaken of health conditions and co-medications of patients with COVID-19 who were pre-screened for enrolment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled hydroxychloroquine multi-centre trial. RESULTS: The survey involved 305 patients [median age 71 (interquartile range 59-81) years]. The majority of patients (n = 279, 92%) considered for inclusion in the clinical trial were not eligible, mainly due to safety concerns caused by health conditions or co-medications. The most common were QT-prolonging drugs (n = 188, 62%) and haematologic/haemato-oncologic diseases (n = 39, 13%) which prohibited the administration of hydroxychloroquine. In addition, 165 (54%) patients had health conditions and 167 (55%) patients were on co-medications that did not prohibit the use of hydroxychloroquine but had a risk of adverse interactions with hydroxychloroquine. The most common were diabetes (n = 86, 28%), renal insufficiency (n = 69, 23%) and heart failure (n = 58, 19%).

The role of incremental positive end-expiratory pressure titration in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome supported with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the preferred method for setting positive end-expiratory pressure in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all subjects supported with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome from 2009 to 2019 in the intensive care units in Tianjin Third Central Hospital. Subjects were divided into two groups according to the positive end-expiratory pressure titration method used: P-V curve (quasi-static pressure-volume curve-guided positive end-expiratory pressure setting) group or Crs (respiratory system compliance-guided positive end-expiratory pressure setting) group. RESULTS: Forty-three subjects were included in the clinical outcome analysis: 20 in the P-V curve group and 23 in the Crs group. Initial positive end-expiratory pressure levels during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were similar in both groups. Incidence rates of barotrauma and hemodynamic events were significantly lower in the Crs group (all p < 0.05). Mechanical ventilation duration, intensive care unit length of stay, and hospital length of stay were significantly shorter in the Crs group than the P-V curve group (all p < 0.05). Subjects in the Crs group showed non-significant improvements in the duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and 28-day mortality (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Respiratory system compliance-guided positive end-expiratory pressure setting may lead to more optimal clinical outcomes for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome supported by veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Since then, the virus has also rapidly spread among Latin American, Caribbean and African countries. The first aim of this study was to identify new emerging COVID-19 clusters over time and in space in Latin American, Caribbean, and African regions [mostly low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)], using a prospective space-time scan measurement approach. The second aim was to assess the impact of real-time population mobility patterns between January 21st to May 18th, under the implemented government interventions, measurements and policy restrictions, on COVID-19 spread, among those regions and globally. An optimal assessment of monitoring and detection tools as well as population mobility patterns could help countries to better plan and prepare their strategies against the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We created a global COVID-19 database merging WHO daily case reports with other measures such as population density, country income levels for January 21st to May 15th, 2020. A score of government policy interventions was created ranging from \\"light\\", \\"intermediate\\", and \\"high\\", to \\"very high\\" interventions. Prospective space-time scan statistic methods were applied in five time periods between January to May 2020 and a regression mixed model analysis was used. METHODS: We created a global COVID-19 database merging WHO daily case reports with other measures such as population density, country income levels for January 21st to May 15th, 2020. A score of government policy interventions was created ranging from \\"light\\", \\"intermediate\\", and \\"high\\", to \\"very high\\" interventions. Prospective space-time scan statistic methods were applied in five time periods between January to May 2020 and a regression mixed model analysis was used. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 emerging clusters within these five periods of time grew from 7 emerging clusters to 28 by mid-May. We also detected various increasing and decreasing relative risk estimates of COVID-19 spread among Latin American, Caribbean and African countries within the period of analysis. Globally, population mobility to parks and similar leisure areas during at least a minimum of implemented intermediate-level control policies (when compared to low-level control policies) was related with accelerated COVID-19 spread. Results that were almost consistent when the regional stratified analysis was applied. Also globally, population mobility due to working reasons during high and very high implemented control policies, when compared to low- level control policies, was related with positive COVID-19 spread. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective space-time scan is an approach that LMICs could use to detect emerging clusters in a timely manner and implement specific control policies and interventions to slow down COVID-19 transmission.

Appropriate prescription and optimised use of antimicrobials according to the principles of antimicrobial stewardship as well as quality diagnosis and aggressive infection control measures may help prevent the occurrence of MDROs during this pandemic.","output":"Increased antimicrobial resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Carotid blowout syndrome (CBS) is a life-threatening complication of head and neck cancer and radiation therapy. Endovascular techniques have emerged as preferable alternatives to surgical ligation for treatment of CBS. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to study periprocedural complications and outcomes of CBS patients treated with coil embolization and covered stents. METHODS A comprehensive literature search identified studies that reported outcomes of endovascular treatment of CBS published from 2000 to April 2016. Outcomes included technical success, postoperative rebleeding, survival time, and perioperative complications. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. RESULTS Twenty-five noncomparative studies with 559 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Technical success rate was 100% in both coiling and covered stenting groups. Median survival time was 3 months (range, 0-96 months) for all CBS patients. Overall perioperative mortality was 11% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5%-17%). Postoperative rebleeding rate was 27% (95% CI, 19%-367%). Perioperative stroke and infection rates were 3% (95% CI, 1%-6%) and 1% (95% CI, 0%-5%), respectively. At last follow-up, 39% of patients were alive (95% CI, 29%-48%). CONCLUSIONS Coil embolization and stent grafts may both be safe treatment options for CBS with few perioperative complications and high rates of technical success, but prognosis after treatment remains poor. In general, noncomparative studies do not demonstrate differences between the two techniques with respect to periprocedural complications and patient outcomes.","output":"Endovascular treatment of carotid blowout syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changes as a consequence of the crisis generated by the COVID-19 are causing a critical problem at the global level Therefore, the aim of this research is to promote knowledge about the current crisis in tourism and provide tools and strategies that facilitate the search for answers and recovery-oriented options This is a qualitative, exploratory and propositional research study based on which, empirical and theoretical methods were used;the main source for obtaining primary data was interviews, and secondary data was obtained through documentary research As a result of this study, a conceptual theoretical framework for understanding crisis in tourism is recommended, and a conceptual model for the management of this crisis in tourism is proposed, based on a process that integrates risks and crises Finally, a methodological management scheme to implement in Juarez City is suggested It concludes by highlighting the value of research, education and the culture of preparedness to face these pandemics","output":"Response to the Crisis Generated by the Covid-19 Pandemic in Tourism. from the Global to the Local: Ciudad Juarez (mexico)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used in the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of a variety of diseases, including prostate cancer. Facts have proved that AI has broad prospects in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE: This study mainly summarizes the research on the application of artificial intelligence in the field of prostate cancer through bibliometric analysis and explores possible future research hotspots. METHODS: The articles and reviews regarding application of AI in prostate cancer between 1999 and 2020 were selected from Web of Science Core Collection on August 23, 2021. Microsoft Excel 2019 and GraphPad Prism 8 were applied to analyze the targeted variables. VOSviewer (version 1.6.16), Citespace (version 5.8.R2), and a widely used online bibliometric platform were used to conduct co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of countries, institutions, authors, references, and keywords in this field. RESULTS: A total of 2,749 articles were selected in this study. AI-related research on prostate cancer increased exponentially in recent years, of which the USA was the most productive country with 1,342 publications, and had close cooperation with many countries. The most productive institution and researcher were the Henry Ford Health System and Tewari. However, the cooperation among most institutions or researchers was not close even if the high research outputs. The result of keyword analysis could divide all studies into three clusters: Diagnosis and Prediction AI-related study, Non-surgery AI-related study, and Surgery AI-related study. Meanwhile, the current research hotspots were deep learning and multiparametric MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence has broad application prospects in prostate cancer, and a growing number of scholars are devoted to AI-related research on prostate cancer. Meanwhile, the cooperation among various countries and institutions needs to be strengthened in the future. It can be projected that noninvasive diagnosis and accurate minimally invasive treatment through deep learning technology will still be the research focus in the next few years.","output":"The Global Research of Artificial Intelligence on Prostate Cancer: A 22-Year Bibliometric Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Soft tissue tumors are often accompanied with elevated skin temperature; however, studies concerning the relationship between soft-tissue tumors and skin temperature elevation are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of skin temperature elevation in soft-tissue tumors and identify factors related to skin temperature elevation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study comprised 118 patients at our hospital with soft-tissue tumors, excluding lipomatous tumors, whose pathological diagnosis was surgically confirmed between February 2017 and March 2021. Sixty-one and 57 patients had been diagnosed with benign lesions and malignant tumors, respectively (men, 64; women, 54; median age, 61 [range, 20C92] years). The relationship between skin temperature, monitored using a thermography camera, and the presence of soft-tissue malignancy was investigated. We reviewed clinical data to identify factors related to elevated skin temperature. RESULTS: Temperature differences  0.2 C compared to the unaffected side were significantly associated with the presence of malignant tumors (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that intertumoral blood supply was associated with elevated skin temperature (OR 3.22, 95% CI 2.03C5.13; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated skin temperature, influenced by intertumoral blood supply, may be an important adjunct to physical findings when diagnosing malignant soft-tissue tumors. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Intertumoral blood supply influenced elevated skin temperature in malignant soft-tissue tumors. A skin temperature difference  0.2 C compared to the unaffected side can help differentiate between benign and malignant tumors. Skin temperature differences may help in diagnosing malignant soft-tissue tumors.","output":"An analysis of tumor-related skin temperature differences in malignant soft-tissue tumors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After decades of lower or comparable mortality rates in rural than in urban areas of the U.S., numerous studies have documented a rural mortality penalty that started in the 1990s and has grown since the mid-2000s. The widening of the gap appears to be especially pronounced among non-Hispanic (NH) whites. However, the rural U.S. is not monolithic, and some rural places have experienced much larger mortality rate increases than others over the past 30 years. Drawing on restricted mortality files from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), I examine metro versus nonmetro and intra-nonmetro (divisional and economic dependency) all-cause and cause-specific mortality trends among working-age (25C64) NH white males and females, 1990C2018. Results show that the nonmetro mortality penalty is wide and growing and is pervasive across multiple disease and injury categories. Trends for females are particularly concerning. Smaller nonmetro declines in mortality from cancers and cardiovascular disease (throughout the 1990s and 2000s) and larger increases in metabolic and respiratory diseases, suicide, alcohol-related, and mental/behavioral disorders (throughout the 2010s) collectively drove the growth in the nonmetro disadvantage. There are also large divisional disparities (which are growing for females), with particularly poor trends in New England, South Atlantic, ES Central, WS Central, and Appalachia and more favorable trends in the Mid-Atlantic, Mountain, and Pacific. Mining-dependent counties have diverged from the other economic dependency types since the mid-2000s due to multiple causes of death, whereas farming counties have comparatively lower mortality rates. High and rising mortality rates across a variety of causes and rural places, some of which have been occurring since the 1990s and others that emerged more recently, suggest that there is not one underlying explanation. Instead, systemic failures across a variety of institutions and policies have contributed to rural Americas troubling mortality trends generally and within-rural disparities more specifically.

Due to lack of large series with long-term follow-up, disagreement remains regarding its safety and efficacy. We present a series of 1020 consecutive LSGs performed with long-term follow-up. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was conducted on patients who underwent LSG from January 2005 to February 2014. Data included weight, height, BMI, ideal body weight, comorbid conditions, intraoperative complications, mean length of hospital stay (LOS), early (<30 days) readmission, early and late (>30 days) postoperative complications, and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL). RESULTS Of the 1020 patients, 66.6 % (n = 679) were female, with a mean age of 38.4  16.5 years. Mean BMI at the time of first visit was 43.4  5.8 kg/m(2). The most common comorbid conditions identified were diabetes mellitus (89.4 %), sleep apnea (86.4 %), hypertension (80.3 %), and hyperlipidemia (70 %). Over the entire follow-up period, 57 % of diabetic patients experienced significant improvement or remission. There was no mortality in this series. Early postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery included leak in 0.1 % (n = 1), stricture in 0.1 % (n = 1), emesis in 23 % (n = 234), dehydration in 19 % (n = 194), prolonged ileus in 18 % (183), and self-limited bleeding in 3 % (n = 30). Mean LOS was of 3.4  2.1 days, with a 3.8 % overall rate of early readmissions. Long-term morbidity was found in 3.9 % of patients (n = 40) and included stricture in 0.49 % (n = 5) and GERD in 6 % (n = 61). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0 %.

Their efficacy has been questioned by several recent studies. We therefore studied the results of all of our patients who received a biological prosthesis, including hernia recurrence and infectious complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 68 patients who underwent biological prosthesis placement from 2009 to 2015 in a single center. RESULTS The site of implantation was on the anterior abdominal wall in 49 (72%) of cases, in the pelvis in 19 (28%). The median follow-up was 19 months. In the early post-operative period, 22 (32.3%) of patients presented with wall abscess; eight (11.7%) underwent surgical revision and seven (10.2%) underwent interventional radiological drainage. In the medium term, 41/56 (73%) had a late complication; 32 (57%) of the patients developed recurrent herniation and 15 (26.7%) of them were re-operated. In addition, nine (16%) of patients developed a late surgical site infection and eight (14.2%) a chronic residual infection. In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for recurrence were parastomal hernia (P=0.007) and a history of recurrent hernia (P=0.002).

Studies on lung cancer diagnosis and treatment during an epidemic are lacking. We analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on lung cancer diagnosis in Korea, where lung cancer incidence continues to rise. METHODS: The number of newly diagnosed lung cancer cases in three university-affiliated hospitals during the pandemic and their clinical features were compared with lung cancer cases diagnosed during the same period in the past 3 years. The effectiveness of measures taken by the study hospitals to prevent nosocomial transmission was reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 612 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer from February through June, 2017-2020. During the pandemic, the number of patients who sought consultation at the division of pulmonology of study hospitals dropped by 16% from the previous year. Responding to the pandemic, the involved hospitals created physically isolated triage areas for patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms. Wide-range screening and preventive measures were implemented, thus minimizing the delay in lung cancer diagnosis. No patient acquired COVID-19 due to hospital exposure.

The problem is basically the fluid dynamics of a transient turbulent jet/puff with buoyancy, laden with evaporating droplets carrying the pathogen. A turbulent flow of this nature does not lend itself to reliable estimates through modeling approaches such as RANS (Reynolds-Averaged NavierCStokes equations) or other droplet-based models. However, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of what may be called cough/sneeze flows can play an important role in understanding the spread of the contagion. The objective of this work is to develop a DNS code for studying cough/sneeze flows by a suitable combination of the DNS codes available with the authors (developed to study cumulus cloud flows including thermodynamics of phase change and the dynamics of small water droplets) and to generate useful data on these flows. Recent results from the cumulus cloud simulations are included to highlight the effect of turbulent entrainment (which is one of the key processes in determining the spread of the expiratory flows) on the distribution of liquid water content in a moist plume. Furthermore, preliminary results on the temperature distribution in a dry cough (i.e., without inclusion of liquid droplets) are reported to illustrate the large spatial extent and time duration over which the cough flow can persist after the coughing has stopped. We believe that simulations of this kind can help to devise more accurate guidelines for separation distances between neighbors in a group, design better masks, and minimize the spread of respiratory diseases of the COVID-19 type.","output":"Understanding Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19-Type Infections by Direct Numerical Simulations of Cough/Sneeze Flows"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Long-lasting efficacy of insecticide-treated nets is a balance between adhesion, retention and migration of insecticide to the surface of netting fibres. ICON? Maxx is a twin-sachet 'home-treatment kit' of pyrethroid plus binding agent, recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for long-lasting, wash-fast treatment of polyester nets. While knitted polyester netting is widely used, fine woven polyethylene netting is increasingly available and nets made of cotton and nylon are common in Africa and Asia. It is important to investigate whether ICON Maxx is able to fulfill the WHO criteria of long-lasting treatment on a range of domestic fabrics to widen the scope for malaria protection. METHODS: This study was a controlled comparison of the bio-efficacy and wash-fastness of lambda-cyhalothrin CS, with or without binder, on nets made of cotton, polyethylene, nylon, dyed and undyed polyester. Evaluation compared an array of bioassays: WHO cone and cylinder, median time to knockdown and WHO tunnel tests using Anopheles mosquitoes. Chemical assay revealed further insight. RESULTS: ICON Maxx treated polyethylene and polyester netting met the WHO cone and tunnel test bio-efficacy criteria for LLIN after 20 standardized washes. Although nylon and cotton netting failed to meet the WHO cone and cylinder criteria, both materials passed the WHO tunnel test criterion of 80% mortality after 20 washes. All materials treated with standard lambda-cyhalothrin CS without binder failed to meet any of the WHO bio-efficacy criteria within 5 washes. CONCLUSION: The bio-efficacy of ICON Maxx against mosquitoes on netting washed up to 20 times demonstrated wash durability on a range of synthetic polymer and natural fibres: polyester, polyethylene, nylon and cotton. This raises the prospect of making insecticide-binder kits into an effective approach for turning untreated nets, curtains, military clothing, blankets-and tents and tarpaulins as used in disasters and humanitarian emergencies-into effective malaria prevention products. It may provide a solution to the problem of reduced LLIN coverage between campaigns by converting commercially sourced untreated nets into LLINs through community or home treatment. It may also open the door to binding of non-pyrethroid insecticides to nets and textiles for control of pyrethroid resistant vectors.","output":"Bio-efficacy and wash-fastness of a lambda-cyhalothrin long-lasting insecticide treatment kit (ICON?

However, the predominant bacterial species causing pneumonia secondary to respiratory viral infections other than influenza remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to know whether the pathogens causing post-viral bacterial pneumonia vary according to the type of respiratory virus. METHODS: Study subjects were 5,298 patients, who underwent multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction for simultaneous detection of respiratory viruses, among who visited the emergency department or outpatient clinic with respiratory symptoms at Ulsan University Hospital between April 2013 and March 2016. The patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 251 clinically significant bacteria were identified in 233 patients with post-viral bacterial pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most frequent bacterium in patients aged <16 years, regardless of the preceding virus type (p=0.630). In patients aged 16 years, the isolated bacteria varied according to the preceding virus type. The major results were as follows (p<0.001): pneumonia in patients with influenza virus (type A/B), rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus infections was caused by similar bacteria, and the findings indicated that Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia was very common in these patients. In contrast, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus infections were associated with pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria.

For the fulfillment of Saudi Arabias Vision 2030, the promotion of preventive care medicine through HAI management is a crucial issue. This study explores the perspectives of Saudi tertiary healthcare workers (HCWs) on HAIs and infection control measures. METHODS: Quantitative data were assessed to determine HCWs knowledge of HAI and their attitudes towards and practice of infection control measures. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data from 40 doctors and nurses. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Further, routine sterile procedures in the wards and intensive care units were video recorded, and the footage was discussed by the infection control team and the personnel involved in the videos. This discussion was videographed and transcribed. Both interview data and reflective discussion of the video were analysed using thematic analysis. The quantitative data were analysed using the KruskalCWallis test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: KruskalCWallis test revealed no difference in mean knowledge, attitude, or practice scores between nurses/ doctors or the genders. There was a significant difference in knowledge score and practice scores between the Intensive care unit & the Paediatric ward /infection control department with the maximum scores in knowledge and practice among participants from the intensive care unit. Logistic regression analysis for dependent variables (knowledge and attitude) and independent variables like age, gender, designation, and departments was not significant. The qualitative data yielded four themes: knowledge of HAI and infection control, infection control measures in practice, a shortfall in infection control measures and HAI, and required implementation. Video-reflexive ethnography (VRE) revealed lapses in handwashing practice and proper usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially surgical masks. CONCLUSION: Early introduction of training programmes in medical and nursing schools and video demonstrations of appropriate infection control practices during sterile procedures would be highly beneficial to HCWs.

OBJECTIVES: This article summarizes previous results on SARS-CoV?2 prevalence from seroepidemiological studies in Germany focusing on children and adolescents and complements the already existing overview on seroprevalence in adults from general population samples and especially blood donors in Germany. METHODS: The results are based on an ongoing systematic search in study registries, in literature databases, of preprint publications, and of media reports of seroepidemiological studies in Germany and their results. RESULTS: As of 17 September 2021, we are aware of 16 German seroepidemiological studies focusing on children and adolescents. Results are available for nine of these studies. For almost all settings studied, SARS-CoV?2 seroprevalence was well below 1% for preschool and elementary school children in the first COVID-19 wave and below 2% for adolescents. As the pandemic progressed, higher seroprevalences of up to 8% were found in elementary school children. DISCUSSION: Results of SARS-CoV?2 antibody studies in children and adolescents in Germany are scarce so far and are based on non-representative samples at local or regional level. In future studies, it is necessary on the one hand to estimate which proportion of children and adolescents has already either had an infection or has been vaccinated.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A quasi experimental longitudinal pretest posttest study was conducted at a referral radiation therapy center from May 2020 to September 2020. It included 52 adult patients admitted for a first course radical radiation therapy. One generic and 6 site-specific (breast, pelvis, head and neck, brain, chest and abdomen, and bladder) animated cartoon videos were developed in house to provide concise overview of the overall patient's trajectory in radiation therapy, with full visual description of the procedures and specific preparation measures. A 14-item questionnaire was designed to assess pre- and postintervention levels of understanding and confidence of patients, with calculation of and an understanding and confidence score (UCS), range 0-14. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) UCS in pre- and postintervention was 9.36 (2.48) and 11.92 (1.34) out of 14, respectively, indicating a mean increase of 2.57 subsequent to the intervention (P < .001). The effect size was large with a Cohen's d = 1.01. Of the 14 dimensions explored, 8 were observed to have remarkable improvement, notably understanding the purpose of the tattoo mark, reason of daily or weekly imaging, and what to expect with radiation therapy. Participants with poor reading ability had greater increase in UCS (UCS = 4.25 vs 2.33) and in 5 out of 8 dimensions with remarkable improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The use of digital educational material in radiation oncology meets the urgent need for providing patients with concise and site-specific information, while sparing extra hospital visits to meet education coordinators during the COVID-19 crisis. Additional studies are warranted to assess both the clinical and long-term effectiveness of the educational material, using a longitudinal controlled design.","output":"Site-Specific Education Using Digital Media to Improve Patient Understanding of the Radiotherapy Trajectory: An Interventional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) enters cells by virus-cell membrane fusion triggered by its spike (S) protein, it is not well known how the S protein participates in fusion events. We reported that the soluble form of MHV receptor (soMHVR) transformed a nonfusogenic S protein into a fusogenic one (F. Taguchi and S. Matsuyama, J. Virol. 76:950-958, 2002). In the present study, we demonstrate that soMHVR induces the conformational changes of the S protein, as shown by the proteinase digestion test. A cl-2 mutant, srr7, of the MHV JHM virus (JHMV) was digested with proteinase K after treatment with soMHVR, and the resultant S protein was analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody (MAb) 10G, specific for the membrane-anchored S2 subunit. A 58-kDa fragment, encompassing the two heptad repeats in S2, was detected when srr7 was digested after soMHVR treatment, while no band was seen when the virus was untreated. The appearance of the proteinase-resistant fragment was dependent on the temperature and time of srr7 incubation with soMHVR and also on the concentration of soMHVR. Coimmunoprecipitation indicated that the direct binding of soMHVR to srr7 S protein induced these conformational changes; this was also suggested by the inhibition of the changes following pretreatment of soMHVR with anti-MHVR MAb CC1. soMHVR induced conformational changes of the S proteins of wild-type (wt) JHMV cl-2, as well as revertants from srr7, srr7A and srr7B; however, a major proportion of these S proteins were resistant to proteinase K even without soMHVR treatment. The implications of this proteinase-resistant fraction are discussed.

We report the results of a rapidly-implemented COVID-19 online interdisciplinary CPD webinar series. We aimed to determine if this virtual approach for large-scale CPD was relevant, appreciated, and effective for specialist physicians in Quebec. Methods and Analysis: This was a retrospective descriptive online survey-based study. The weekly virtual educational webinars took place between March 3, 2020 to June 15, 2020, resulting in a total of 26 webinars over 16 weeks. The study included all individuals who attended any of the webinar sessions, namely specialist physicians and department chiefs. Number of participants and overall appreciation of webinar sessions were data points collected. Results: Across all webinars, there were 8,500 unique specialist physicians which comprises 80.7% of the entire specialist practicing population in Quebec. Of note, every medical and surgical specialty was represented by attendance in at least one session. In total, 27,504 evaluation forms were completed out of all the sessions, meaning a 78.4% response rate. In post-webinar surveys, 97.6% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the webinars were pertinent to their practice and 94.6% agreed or strongly agreed that the presentation met their continuing professional needs. Conclusions: This novel interdisciplinary COVID-19 webinar series is a successful and appreciated strategy to maintain CPD amidst a global pandemic. One year later, it has become a mainstay in our toolbox and we trust this unique model of large-scale interdisciplinary CPD via webinar sessions is useful in normal times as well as in times of crisis.","output":"Implementation of Interdisciplinary Province-Wide Webinar Series During the COVID-19 Pandemic by the Federation of Medical Specialists of Quebec (FMSQ): A Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The middle and lower respiratory tract is a very common location for infections in infants and children. Infections of the mucosal surfaces of the larynx, trachea, and bronchial tree account for the majority of all infections in this age group and can be associated with considerable morbidity and even mortality in certain populations. Many viral upper respiratory tract pathogens can also involve the middle and lower respiratory tract, particularly for children experiencing their first infection with the pathogen. Laryngitis may cause sore throat and hoarse voice but can also be associated with tracheitis and even bronchiolitis as the pathogen, infection, and host responses move further down the respiratory tree. Bronchiolitis may also occur as a separate infection in the lower airways presenting as respiratory distress in a young infant with prominent wheezing. Many respiratory viral diseases occur with seasonal patterns, with most cases occurring in the fall, winter, and early spring in temperate climates. In the tropics, some viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), may cause disease sporadically, year round, but epidemics still occur during rainy seasons. Bacterial infections can also involve the middle airway. Epiglottitis is a feared condition due to the potential for sudden airway obstruction. Fortunately, the diagnosis of epiglottitis has become quite rare since the introduction of routine childhood immunization against Haemophilus influenzae, serotype B, was once the most common cause of epiglottitis. Bacterial tracheitis can be a secondary bacterial infection following an acute viral infection of the trachea or a consequence of prolonged endotracheal intubation. While the mechanism of injury to the trachea is different, both processes lead to disruption of mucosal integrity, predisposing the patient to a tracheal infection caused by bacteria that normally only colonize the airway.","output":"Laryngitis, Tracheitis, Epiglottitis, and Bronchiolitis: Sore Throat, Change in Voice, Feverora Wheezing Infant in Respiratory Distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Societies require prosocial activities during crises The COVID\\\\19 pandemic presents individuals with unique challenges that may affect their emotional state leading to reformed personal moral norms Crucially, personal moral norms are important predictors of moral behaviour Given the longevity of the pandemic, studying its impact on affect, satisfaction and internal drive of (non\\\\)donors during COVID\\\\19 and if personal moral norms are affected is paramount This study relies on longitudinal data, consisting of six waves carried out biweekly Our panel is representative for the German population, capturing changes in affect, satisfaction, internal drive and personal moral norms We compare the emotional state and personal moral norms of (non\\\\)donors in the pandemic to pre\\\\pandemic phase Moreover, we analyse changes in emotional state and personal moral norms during the pandemic and investigate the role of emotional state on personal moral norms Firstly, our results show that personal moral norms of (non\\\\)donors drop compared to pre\\\\pandemic Within pandemic, personal moral norms of active donors are not further altered Secondly, we find significant changes of emotional state in the pandemic compared to pre\\\\pandemic phase, for example individuals feel more optimistic, but less satisfied and less energetic Thirdly, we find that feeling more grateful increases personal moral norms of non\\\\donors This study provides insights into how crises shape (non\\\\)donors emotional state and its impact on relevant donor motivations, that is, personal moral norms Blood banks can use this knowledge to enhance recruiting and retention efforts during crises [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of ISBT Science Series is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"The role of affect, satisfaction and internal drive on personal moral norms during COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper analyzed the impact of lockdown on the ambient noise levels in the seventy sites in the seven major cities of India and ascertained the noise scenario in lockdown period, and on the Janta Curfew day in comparison to the pre-lock down period and year 2019 annual average values.

All companions are required to register their real personal data with 14 days of travel history, occupation, contact history, and cluster history. We would like to evaluate the impact of the new regulations to the accompanying and visiting culture in Taiwan, via analyzing the appearance and characteristics of inpatient companions in this period. METHODS Using intelligent technology, we designed a novel system in managing the inpatient companions (InPatients Companions Management System [IPCMS]), and the IPCMS was used to collect data about characteristics of inpatients and companions between April 27 and May 3, 2020. The database is built using MySQL software. Microsoft Excel 2016 and SPSS version 20.0 statistical software were used for data analysis, including the basic data of the companions, differential analysis of companions' gender, person-days and cumulative time, differential analysis of accompaniment-patient relationship, and frequency of accompaniment and cumulative hours. RESULTS During study period, daily inpatient admissions ranged from 2242 to 2514, the number of companions per day ranged from 2048 to 2293, and the number of companions for one inpatient is 1 to 9 per day, with an average of 1.20 to 1.26. The companions were mostly family members, and most of them were the inpatients' children (32.9%), and spouse (26.13%). More females than males were noted in all categories of companionship with statistical significance. CONCLUSION The data obtained in this study could be an important basis for the transformation and reform of the companions culture in Taiwan's hospitals and will also provide a glimpse into the attitudes and culture of companions who have long been ignorant and neglected.

Resistance extends to the polyclonal serum immunoglobulins of four out of four healthy convalescent donors we tested and to monoclonal antibodies in clinical use.

people around the world have infected with the COVID-19 virus The SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in the human upper respiratory tract Infected people produce large amounts of the virus in their upper respiratory tract during an introductory period, which leads to more spread of the virus to other people The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through person-to-person transmission and contact with contaminated surfaces However, the rapid spread of the disease suggests that other routes, such as airborne transmission, may play a role Several research studies have been performed to evaluate the possible transmission of the virus through the air Although some studies have found no evidence of airborne transmission, recent work has confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 even in public places Experience and knowledge of the mechanism of similar viruses such as SARS-CoV also support this hypothesis During COVID-19 pandemic, while the hospitals can be one of the most important centers in providing health care services, due to the inappropriate air ventilation and purification system, high traffic of people;some of them have been introduced themselves as one of the most high-risk sources of SARS-CoV-2 transmission The present study aimed to assess the SARS-CoV-2 in the air and surfaces of ICU ward in one of the designated hospitals in Tehran So that, in addition to determining the possibility of inhalation and contact exposure in ICU, which is the main ward for presenting special medical care to patients with severe acute respiratory infections, it aimed to assess a hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission Methods: This cross-sectional experimental study was performed on April 29, 2020 in the Covid-19 ICU ward in one of the designated hospitals, Tehran, Iran The area of ward was 50 m2 and has seven beds, all of which were occupied at the time of sampling, and five medical staff were involving there All patients were equipped with oxygen masks and all the staff used all conventional personal protective equipment such as Honeywell-75FFP100NL respirators On average, surface disinfection was performed three times a day The general ventilation system included the ceiling diffuser to supply fresh air into the room and wall-mounted exhaust vent and did not use natural ventilation (such as opening the window) It should be noted that the exhaust system did not work well at the time of sampling This study was carried out in two phases including surface and air sampling Impinger method was applied to air sampling Thus, at a distance of 1 5 to 1 8 meters from the ground, the air of the ICU ward was passed through a sampling pump with an flow rate of 1 5 l/min into the porous midget impeller-30 ml containing 15 ml of virus transmission medium (PVTM) for 45 minutes To reverse the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples, the reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reaction method was used Sampling of surfaces was done with the help of swabs impregnated with the solution of the Viral Transport Medium from a certain area (25 cm2) from the desired part and putting it inside the vial containing the transfer medium (protein stabilizer, antibiotic and buffer solution) They are also were analyzed by RT-PCR technique Prior to sampling, all laboratory equipment used was sterilized and autoclaved using a 70% alcohol solution according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol The air sampling was done at a distance of 1 5 to 2 meters from the patient's bed The devices used to measure temperature, humidity and air velocity were multi-purpose anemometer (China BENETE, GM8910,) and air pressure, digital barometer (AIRFLOW, DB2, USA) The mean parameters of weather conditions included: air temperature 24  C, humidity 35%, air pressure 1005 mb and air velocity of 0 09 m / s Results: Of the ten air samples, 6 were positive (60%), with the highest RNA concentrations observed at the point between beds 6 and 7 (3913 copies per ml) Most of the reported negative air samples were from the middle of the ward, which was further away from the patients' beds The mean RNA concentration of the virus was obtained 820  2601 copies per milliliter In addition, of ten samples taken from different surfaces of the ward, 4 samples were positive (40%) and the highest concentration (8318 copies per ml) was related to the table next to bed number 3 All positive samples were observed close to the patient's bed, and the mean RNA concentration of the virus was 3227  3674 copies per milliliter Conclusion: The results of the study indicated that the virus was present in the inhaled air of the ward and its surfaces, especially in areas close to the bed of patients These findings underscore the airborne transmission of the virus along with other ways of transmission, such as person-to-person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces Due to the environmental pollution of the studied ICU ward to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the effective implementation of air isolation methods such as the use of respiratory protection equipment (N95 mask) and powered air-purifying respirator as well as ensuring the correct function of hospital ventilation systems and improving it, is essential for the protection of health care staff Health care workers need to be continuously monitored and screened from a COVID-19 perspective, and infection prevention and control protocols (IPCs), such as respiratory protection, regular cleaning of the environment, and effective disinfection of areas have been implemented In the case of the virus, the spread of the disease through both direct methods (drops and person-to-person) as well as indirect contact (contaminated objects and airborne transmission) has almost been proven, which reaffirms the need for precautionary measures regarding airborne isolation

However, patients with cancer were excluded from pivotal clinical trials. Early data suggest that vaccine response is less robust in patients with immunosuppressive conditions or treatments, while toxicity and acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines in the cancer population is unknown. Unanswered questions remain about the impact of various cancer characteristics (such as treatment modality and degree of immunosuppression) on serological response to and safety of COVID-19 vaccinations. Furthermore, as the virus and disease manifestations evolve, ongoing data is required to address the impact of new variants. METHODS: SerOzNET is a prospective observational study of adults and children with cancer undergoing routine SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in Australia. Peripheral blood will be collected and processed at five timepoints (one pre-vaccination and four post-vaccination) for analysis of serologic responses to vaccine and exploration of T-cell immune correlates. Cohorts include: solid organ cancer (SOC) or haematological malignancy (HM) patients currently receiving (1) chemotherapy, (2) immune checkpoint inhibitors (3) hormonal or targeted therapy; (4) patients who completed chemotherapy within 6C12 months of vaccination; (5) HM patients with conditions associated with hypogammaglobulinaemia or immunocompromise; (6) SOC or HM patients with allergy to PEG or polysorbate 80. Data from healthy controls already enrolled on several parallel studies with comparable time points will be used for comparison. For children, patients with current or prior cancer who have not received recent systemic therapy will act as controls. Standardised scales for quality-of-life assessment, patient-reported toxicity and vaccine hesitancy will be obtained. DISCUSSION: The SerOzNET study was commenced in June 2021 to prospectively study immune correlates of vaccination in specific cancer cohorts. The high proportion of the Australian population na?ve to COVID-19 infection and vaccination at study commencement has allowed a unique window of opportunity to study vaccine-related immunity. Quality of life and patient-reported adverse events have not yet been reported in detail post-vaccination for cancer patients.

It has become very difficult to control the spreading of the virus. The virus is a RNA virus and the virulence of the virus is mediated by three virulence causing proteins, viz., Nsp1, Nsp3c and ORF7. So far the drug designing endeavors against the virus have been being targeted towards the spike protein which is responsible for the entry of the virus inside human host as well as the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. However, no effective treatment against the virus has so far been developed. In the present situation, an attempt has been made to target the virulence protein factor Nsp1 which binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit of the human host. We tried to target the Nsp1 by in-silico virtual screening of ligand libraries. We built the three dimensional structure of Nsp1 and used the structure to screen the ChEMBL drug library. We used molecular docking simulations of the top6 screened ligands with Nsp1 and subjected the liagnd-Nsp1 complexes to molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the behaviors of the ligands in a virtual cell. From our analysis we could predict that the ligands bearing the ChEMBL identifiers, CHEMBL1096281, CHEMBL2022920, CHEMBL175656, had the best binding affinity values with Nsp1. Therefore, these ligand molecules may be tested in wet-lab for further analysis. This is the first report to target the virulence factor Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

To stop the spread of the disease, many governments declared a complete lockdown.The nationwide lockdown had some positive effects on the environment even though it led to a decline in global economic growth. Air pollution levels reduced dramatically as a result of this lockdown on pollution. Most of Europes populated cities saw a reduction in NO2 concentration of 45C54%.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected from 131 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 3 Chinese hospitals. Their common clinical manifestations, as well as characteristics and evolvement features of chest CT images, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan, Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough, fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%) patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of lesions co-existing in 61 (47%) cases.

In this study, we aim to explore a new CaMKII-targeted synthetic lethal therapy for GSCs. Through high-throughput drug combination screening using CaMKII inhibitors and a bioactive compound library in GSCs, neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) inhibitors such as SR 140333 and aprepitant are found to be potential anticancer agents that exhibit chemical synthetic lethal interactions with CaMKII inhibitors, including hydrazinobenzoylcurcumin (HBC), berbamine, and KN93. Combined treatment with NK1R and CaMKII inhibitors markedly suppresses the viability and neurosphere formation of U87MG- and U373MG-derived GSCs. In addition, the combination of HBC and NK1R inhibitors significantly inhibits U87MG GSC tumor growth in a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Furthermore, the synthetic lethal interaction is validated using RNA interference of CaMKII?3 and NK1R. Notably, the synthetic lethal effects in GSCs are associated with the activation of caspase-mediated apoptosis by inducing p53 expression and reactive oxygen species generation, as well as the suppression of stemness marker expression by reducing nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) activity. This follows the downregulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling and a decrease in intracellular calcium concentration. Moreover, NK1R affects CaMKII?3 activation.

Among present coal mining risks, methane gas (called gas in this paper) explosion or ignition in an underground mine remains ever-present. Although many techniques have been used, gas accidents associated with the complex elements of underground gassy mines need more robust monitoring or warning systems to identify risks. This paper aimed to determine which single method between the PCA and Entropy methods better establishes a responsive weighted indexing measurement to improve coal mining safety. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative mixed research methodologies were adopted for this research, including analysis of two case studies, correlation analysis, and comparative analysis. The literature reviewed the most-used multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods, including subjective methods and objective methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each MCDM method were briefly discussed. One more round literature review was conducted to search publications between 2017 and 2019 in CNKI. Followed two case studies, correlation analysis and comparative analysis were then conducted. Research ethics was approved by the Shanxi Coking Coal Group Research Committee. RESULTS: The literature searched a total of 25,831publications and found that the PCA method was the predominant method adopted, and the Entropy method was the second most widely adopted method. Two weighting methods were compared using two case studies. For the comparative analysis of Case Study 1, the PCA method appeared to be more responsive than the Entropy. For Case Study 2, the Entropy method is more responsive than the PCA. As a result, both methods were adopted for different cases in the case study mine and finally deployed for user acceptance testing on 5 November 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The findings and suggestions were provided as further scopes for further research. This research indicated that no single method could be adopted as the better option for establishing indexing measurement in all cases. The practical implication suggests that comparative analysis should always be conducted on each case and determine the appropriate weighting method to the relevant case. This research recommended that the PCA method was a dimension reduction technique that could be handy for identifying the critical variables or factors and effectively used in hazard, risk, and emergency assessment. The PCA method might also be well-applied for developing predicting and forecasting systems as it was sensitive to outliers. The Entropy method might be suitable for all the cases requiring the MCDM. There is also a need to conduct further research to probe the causal reasons why the PCA and Entropy methods were applied to each case and not the other way round. This research found that the Entropy method provides higher accuracy than the PCA method.

Numerous fatal causalities were described in the international environment. For example fatal causalities during the SARS-Epidemic as well as cases of death caused by influenza. METHODS AND RESULTS: Selective literature review of occupationally acquired aerogene infections like SARS-coronavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, RSV, adenovirus, tuberculosis as well as pertussis. Currently available data demonstrate that personal protective measures (e.g. appropriate use of hand washing and oronasal mask), as well as vaccinations (if available) reduces the risk for transmission of infectious diseases. DISCUSSION: The risk for occupationally acquired infections is sometimes an unavoidable part of daily patient care. From occupational medicine point of view and for control of infectious diseases preventive measures should be implemented to provide the best possible protection of HCW involved.

Early detection of RSV infection can avoid unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic intervention and is required to prevent the nosocomial spread of RSV infection in pediatric hospitals. We developed a web tool to calculate the probability of RSV infection in children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) (RSVpredict). METHODS During winter seasons 2014/2015 to 2017/2018, 1545 children hospitalized with clinical symptoms of ARTI at the University Hospital Heidelberg/Germany were prospectively included. Medical information was reported on a standardized data sheet, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. We applied logistic regression to develop a prediction model and developed a web-based application to predict the individual probability of RSV infection. RESULTS Duration of clinical symptoms 2 days on admission, calendar month of admission, admission for lower respiratory tract infection, the presence of cough and rale and younger age were associated with RSV infection (P < 0.05). Those data were included in the prediction model (RSVpredict, https://web.imbi.uni-heidelberg.de/rsv/). RSVpredict is a web-based application to calculate the risk of RSV infection in children hospitalized with ARTI.

However, the readout from the chemical modulation of a single protein is poorly correlated with phenotypic response of organism, leading to high failure rate in drug development. Chemical-induced gene expression profile provides an attractive solution to phenotype-based screening. However, the use of such data is currently limited by their sparseness, unreliability, and relatively low throughput. Several methods have been proposed to impute missing values for gene expression datasets. However, few existing methods can perform de novo chemical compound screening. In this study, we propose a mechanism-driven neural network-based method named DeepCE (Deep Chemical Expression) which utilizes graph convolutional neural network to learn chemical representation and multi-head attention mechanism to model chemical substructure-gene and gene-gene feature associations. In addition, we propose a novel data augmentation method which extracts useful information from unreliable experiments in L1000 dataset. The experimental results show that DeepCE achieves the superior performances not only in de novo chemical setting but also in traditional imputation setting compared to state-of-the-art baselines for the prediction of chemical-induced gene expression. We further verify the effectiveness of gene expression profiles generated from DeepCE by comparing them with gene expression profiles in L1000 dataset for downstream classification tasks including drug-target and disease predictions. To demonstrate the value of DeepCE, we apply it to patient-specific drug repurposing of COVID-19 for the first time, and generate novel lead compounds consistent with clinical evidences. Thus, DeepCE provides a potentially powerful framework for robust predictive modeling by utilizing noisy omics data as well as screening novel chemicals for the modulation of systemic response to disease.","output":"A deep learning framework for high-throughput mechanism-driven phenotype compound screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human activities such as urbanization often has negative affects wildlife.

Twenty 1-day-old SPF White Leghorn chickens were randomly divided into two groups, each comprising 10 chickens, which were kept in separate positive-pressure isolators. Chickens in group A served as a virus-free control group up to the end of the experiment, whereas chickens in group B were inoculated with 0.1 ml of 104.5 EID50 of the IBV/chicken/Iran/UTIVO-C/2014 isolate of IBV, and kidney tissue samples were collected at 2 and 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) from both groups. Sequencing of five protein spots at 2 dpi and 22 spots at 7 dpi that showed differential expression by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) along with fold change greater than 2 was done by MS-MALDI/TOF/TOF. Furthermore, the corresponding protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks at 2 and 7 dpi were identified to develop a detailed understanding of the mechanism of molecular pathogenesis.

Methods Variables mirroring transportation and logistics' systems intensity (trade data, the logistics performance index, and investment in transportation) are cross-tabulated with epidemiological data from the recent coronavirus pandemic. As the samples of the data pertain to a dependent commonality, the statistical hypothesis test applicable is McNemar's test. In addition, the statistical power of the test(s) is calculated as a marker of methodological validity and reliability. To further strengthen the analytical methodology, a plethora of descriptive statistics have been calculated and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) has been conducted. Results This work confirms that the domain of transportation bears a strong association with not only mortality of a disease, but its recovery rates as well. All crosstabs provide statistically significant results and the statistical power calculated is very high, signifying the appropriateness of the methodology and the very low probability of Type II error.

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a population-based cohort study nested in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX, 2000-2014) and IBM MarketScan Research Database (MarketScan, 2003-2015). The source cohort included 2045 hydroxychloroquine-exposed pregnancies and 3,198,589 pregnancies not exposed to hydroxychloroquine continuously enrolled in their respective insurance program for 3 months before the last menstrual period through at least 1 month after delivery; infants were enrolled for at least 3 months after birth. We compared the risk of congenital malformations in women using hydroxychloroquine during the first trimester of pregnancy with that of those not using hydroxychloroquine, restricting the cohort to women with rheumatic disorders and using propensity score matching to control for indication, demographics, medical comorbidities, and concomitant medications (1867 hydroxychloroquine-exposed pregnancies and 19,080 pregnancies not exposed to hydroxychloroquine). The outcomes considered included major congenital malformations diagnosed during the first 90 days after delivery and specific malformation types for which there were at least 5 exposed events: oral cleft, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genital, urinary, musculoskeletal, and limb defects. RESULTS: Overall, 54.8 per 1000 infants exposed to hydroxychloroquine were born with a major congenital malformation versus 35.3 per 1000 unexposed infants, corresponding to an unadjusted relative risk of 1.51 (95% confidence interval, 1.27-1.81). Patient characteristics were balanced in the restricted, propensity score-matched cohort. The adjusted relative risk was 1.26 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.54); it was 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.65) for a daily dose of &#8805;400 mg and 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.50) for a daily dose of <400 mg. Among the different malformation groups considered, more substantial increases in the risk of oral clefts, respiratory anomalies, and urinary defects were observed, although estimates were imprecise. No pattern of malformation was identified. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a small increase in the risk of malformations associated with first-trimester hydroxychloroquine use. For most patients with autoimmune rheumatic disorders, the benefits of treatment during pregnancy will likely outweigh this risk. If hydroxychloroquine were shown to be effective for coronavirus disease 2019 prophylaxis in ongoing trials, the risk of malformations would need to be balanced against such benefits.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine early in pregnancy and risk of birth defects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world was first alerted to the existence of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on December 31st , 2019.

It is now timely to look at this information to see what conclusions can be drawn. The evidence collected to date clearly indicates that the virus can traverse the blood testes barrier and gain access to the seminiferous tubules. Depending on the severity of the infection, an impact on semen quality has been detected potentially influencing sperm morphology, motility, count and DNA integrity. Fortunately, the early signs are that these changes are potentially reversible with the passage of time. Whether the deleterious impact of COVID-19 infection reflect a direct impact of the virus on the germ line or, as suggested in the accompanying letter by Marin et al, are induced by the oxidative stress that accompanies the cytokine storm precipitated by this virus, is a key issue that now needs to be resolved.

The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) is expressed with a high incidence (>90%) and high density in insulinomas. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), the natural ligand of GLP-1R, is rapidly degraded in vivo. A more stable agonist of GLP-1R is exendin-3. We investigated imaging of insulinomas with DOTA-conjugated exendin-3 labelled with (68)Ga. METHODS Targeting of insulinomas with [Lys(40)(DOTA)]exendin-3 labelled with either (111)In or (68)Ga was investigated in vitro using insulinoma tumour cells (INS-1). [Lys(40)((111)In-DTPA)]Exendin-3 was used as a reference in this study. In vivo targeting was investigated in BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous INS-1 tumours. PET imaging was performed using a preclinical PET/CT scanner. RESULTS In vitro exendin-3 specifically bound and was internalized by GLP-1R-positive cells. In BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous INS-1 tumours a high uptake of [Lys(40)((111)In-DTPA)]exendin-3 in the tumour was observed (33.5 +/- 11.6%ID/g at 4 h after injection). Uptake was specific, as determined by coinjection of an excess of unlabelled [Lys(40)]exendin-3 (1.8 +/- 0.1%ID/g). The pancreas also exhibited high and specific uptake (11.3 +/- 1.0%ID/g). High uptake was also found in the kidneys (144 +/- 24%ID/g) and this uptake was not receptor-mediated. In this murine tumour model optimal targeting of the GLP-1R expressing tumour was obtained at exendin doses < or =0.1 microg. Remarkably, tumour uptake of (68)Ga-labelled [Lys(40)(DOTA)]exendin-3 was lower (8.9 +/- 3.1%ID/g) than tumour uptake of (111)In-labelled [Lys(40)(DTPA)]exendin-3 (25.4 +/- 7.2%ID/g). The subcutaneous tumours were clearly visualized by small-animal PET imaging after injection of 3 MBq of [Lys(40)((68)Ga-DOTA)]exendin-3. CONCLUSION [Lys(40)((68)Ga-DOTA)]Exendin-3 specifically accumulates in insulinomas, although the uptake is lower than that of [Lys(40)((111)In-DTPA)]exendin-3. Therefore, [Lys(40)((68)Ga-DOTA)]exendin-3 is a promising tracer to visualize insulinomas with PET.","output":"68Ga-labelled exendin-3, a new agent for the detection of insulinomas with PET."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Peer workers (those with lived/living experience of substance use working in overdose response settings) are at the forefront of overdose response initiatives in British Columbia (BC). Working in these settings can be stressful, with lasting social, mental and emotional impacts. Peer workers have also been disproportionately burdened by the current dual public health crises characterized by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and rise in illicit drug overdose deaths. It is therefore critical to develop supports tailored specifically to their realities. METHODS: We used the six steps outlined in the Intervention Mapping (IM) framework to identify needs of peer workers and design an intervention model to support peer workers in overdose response settings. RESULTS: Eight peer-led focus groups were conducted in community settings to identify peer workers needs and transcripts were analyzed using interpretive description. The strategies within the intervention model were informed by organizational development theory as well as by lived/living experience of peer workers. The support needs identified by peer workers were categorized into three key themes and these formed the basis of an intervention model titled ROSE; R stands for Recognition of peer work, O for Organizational support, S for Skill development and E for Everyone. The ROSE model aims to facilitate cultural changes within organizations, leading towards more equitable and just workplaces for peer workers. This, in turn, has the potential for positive socio-ecological impact. CONCLUSIONS: Centering lived/living experience in the intervention mapping process led us to develop a framework for supporting peer workers in BC.

Mobility restriction policy and obligatory preventive measures practices could influence the service implementation. Previous literature suggested that communicable diseases outbreak brought fear and mistrust to the health system which resulted in the decrease of service coverage during emergency situations. As one of the worlds worst-hit COVID-19 countries, Indonesia faces considerable challenges in maintaining health services, including MNCH care. This study investigated multi-level factors which become barriers to the implementation of MNCH care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Method: Qualitative case study was conducted in three Kabupaten (districts), namely Sidoarjo, Gowa, and Manggarai Barat. The selection of these areas was based on the high COVID-19 cases and different achievements in MNCH indicators coverages. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 133 people involved in MNCH services, such as women as the main users of the services, health workers, cadres, village representatives, as well as staff from local district health offices. Data were analyzed using the Socio-Ecological Model (SEM) Framework and constant comparative techniques to triangulate information among informants. Result: A total of 133 people participated in the study, of which 67% were women who were pregnant, giving birth, or having children aged under-5 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The factors that affect the utilization of MNCH services were categorized in five socio-ecological levels of analysis, namely individual factors (fear of COVID-19 contraction and awareness of the importance of MNCH services);interpersonal factors (unsupportive extended family and financial barriers);community-based factors (local norms and beliefs, limited transportation services, and geographical barriers), organizational factors (unequal distribution of health resources, ineffective implementation of preventive measures in the health facility, and impractical innovation of services approach), and policy (rapid development of guidelines and one size fits all policy issues). Conclusions: Fear of COVID-19 contraction and persistent barriers from multi-faceted factors had hindered the effective implementation of MNCH care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. The Government of Indonesia, along with local governments, are required to develop specific solutions based on the capacity of health resources as well as interactive and multilevel factors which inhibit womens decision and practice to seek MNCH care in a volatile situation.","output":"Reviewing the Implementation of Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Health Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetive: Describe the functional situation of patients one and two months after admission for COVID-19 pneumonia in an intensive care unit (ICU) and affect their mood one month after hospital discharge.Design: Prospective cohort study was carried out.

However, information on early risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity is unavailable yet. METHODS: In this prospective study, a cohort of 137 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Clinical information and laboratory data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Viral positivity duration was calculated by an interval from the day SARS-CoV-2 positive confirmed to the day SARS-CoV-2 returned to negative in these 137 COVID-19 patients. Early risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity were evaluated. FINDINGS: The median SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration is 12 days (range: 4 days ~ 45 days) for this cohort. Cox regression results showed a significantly shorter viral positivity duration was related to younger [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.658, p = 0.017], not severe patient (HR = 0.653, p = 0.076), higher count of lymphocytes (HR = 1.464, p = 0.033), eosinophils (HR = 1.514, p = 0.020) and CD8+ T cells (HR=1.745, p=0.033), and lower IL-6 (HR = 0.664, p = 0.036) and IL-10 (HR = 0.631, p = 0.021). Multivariate analysis with covariables adjusted results showed that the count of CD8+ T cells (HR=2.376, p=0.114) was a predominant risk factor for the SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration.

We determined that iota-carrageenan in concentrations as low as 6 g/mL inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The concentrations of iota-carrageenan with activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro may be easily achieved through the application of nasal sprays as commonly used in several countries. Recently a double-blind, placebo-controlled study showed that iota-carrageenan in isotonic sodium chloride reduces ca. five times the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in health care personnel.

This study aims to assess the relevance of viral genomic data for the prediction of severe influenza A(H3N2) infections among patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), in view of risk assessment and patient management. METHODS: 160 A(H3N2) influenza positive samples from the 2016C2017 season originating from the Belgian SARI surveillance were selected for whole genome sequencing. Predictor variables for severity were selected using a penalized elastic net logistic regression model from a combined host and genomic dataset, including patient information and nucleotide mutations identified in the viral genome. The goodness-of-fit of the model combining host and genomic data was compared using a likelihood-ratio test with the model including host data only. Internal validation of model discrimination was conducted by calculating the optimism-adjusted area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) for both models. RESULTS: The model including viral mutations in addition to the host characteristics had an improved fit ([Formula: see text] =12.03, df = 3, p = 0.007).

METHODS This was a single center, retrospective cohort study of critically ill adult patients with SA-AKI. Early exposure to azithromycin was defined as receipt of one or more doses within 48 h of a hospital admission with SA-AKI. The primary outcome of MAKE assessed at hospital discharge was the composite of death, requirement for kidney replacement therapy, or a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25% or more. Multivariable logistic regression was used to account for potential confounders in the assessment. RESULTS Of 737 included patients with SA-AKI, 152 (20.6%) received azithromycin. Patients that received early azithromycin were less likely to experience MAKE at hospital discharge when compared to those patients not receiving azithromycin: 38.8% versus 48.4% (P = 0.035). In multivariable logistic regression, receipt of azithromycin was independently associated with a decreased odds of MAKE at hospital discharge (aOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.93). CONCLUSIONS Early exposure to azithromycin in SA-AKI is independently associated with lower odds of MAKE at hospital discharge.","output":"Azithromycin and Major Adverse Kidney Events in Critically Ill Patients With Sepsis-Associated Acute Kidney Injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plants offer a source of bioinspiration for soft robotics. Nevertheless, a gap remains in designing robots based on the fundamental principles of plant intelligence, rooted in a non-centralized, modular architecture and a highly plastic phenotype. We contend that a holistic approach to plant bioinspiration-one that draws more fully on the features of plant intelligence and behavior-evidences the value of an enactivist perspective. This is because enactivism emphasizes not only features of embodiment such as material composition and morphology, but also autonomy as an important aspect of plant intelligence and behavior. The enactivist sense of autonomy concerns the dynamics of self-producing systems (such as plants) that create a distinction between themselves and a domain of interactions that bear on the conditions of viability of the system. This contrasts with the widespread, but diluted notion of autonomy that merely indicates the independent operability of a system for an arbitrary period. Different notions of autonomy are relevant for soft roboticists, for instance, when evaluating limitations on existing growing robots (\\"growbots\\") that take bioinspiration from plants, but depend on a fixed source of energy and material provided by an external agent. More generally, plant-inspired robots serve as a case study for an enactivist approach to intelligence, while, correspondingly, enactivism calls attention to the possibility of non-zoological forms of intelligence embodied in a self-organizing, autonomous system.","output":"Enacting Plant-Inspired Robotics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interaction information is a model-free, non-parametric measure used for detection of interaction among variables. It frequently finds interactions which remain undetected by standard model-based methods. However in the previous studies application of interaction information was limited by lack of appropriate statistical tests. We study a challenging problem of testing the positiveness of interaction information which allows to confirm the statistical significance of the investigated interactions. It turns out that commonly used chi-squared test detects too many spurious interactions when the dependence between the variables (e.g. between two genetic markers) is strong. To overcome this problem we consider permutation test and also propose a novel HYBRID method that combines permutation and chi-squared tests and takes into account dependence between studied variables. We show in numerical experiments that, in contrast to chi-squared based test, the proposed method controls well the actual significance level and in many situations detects interactions which are undetected by standard methods. Moreover HYBRID method outperforms permutation test with respect to power and computational efficiency. The method is applied to find interactions among Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms as well as among gene expression levels of human immune cells.","output":"Testing the Significance of Interactions in Genetic Studies Using Interaction Information and Resampling Technique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Clinical research and treatment of childhood obesity is challenging, and objective biomarkers obtained in a home-setting are needed. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of novel digital endpoints gathered by a home-monitoring platform in pediatric obesity. Methods: In this prospective observational study, 28 children with obesity aged 6C16 years were included and monitored for 28 days. Patients wore a smartwatch, which measured physical activity (PA), heart rate (HR), and sleep. Furthermore, daily blood pressure (BP) measurements were performed. Data from 128 healthy children were utilized for comparison. Differences between patients and controls were assessed via linear mixed effect models. Results: Data from 28 patients (average age 11.6 years, 46% male, average body mass index 30.9) and 128 controls (average age 11.1 years, 46% male, average body mass index 18.0) were analyzed. Patients were recruited between November 2018 and February 2020. For patients, the median compliance for the measurements ranged from 55% to 100% and the highest median compliance was observed for the smartwatch-related measurements (81C100%). Patients had a lower daily PA level (4,597 steps vs. 6,081 steps, 95% confidence interval [CI] 862C2,108) and peak PA level (1,115 steps vs. 1,392 steps, 95% CI 136C417), a higher nighttime HR (81 bpm vs. 71 bpm, 95% CI 6.3C12.3) and daytime HR (98 bpm vs. 88 bpm, 95% CI 7.6C12.6), a higher systolic BP (115 mm Hg vs. 104 mm Hg, 95% CI 8.1C14.5) and diastolic BP (76 mm Hg vs. 65 mm Hg, 95% CI 8.7C12.7), and a shorter sleep duration (difference 0.5 h, 95% CI 0.2C0.7) compared to controls. Conclusion: Remote monitoring via wearables in pediatric obesity has the potential to objectively measure the disease burden in the home-setting. The novel endpoints demonstrate significant differences in PA level, HR, BP, and sleep duration between patients and controls.

However, how the burden (number) of vascular risk factors influences the risk of severe COVID-19 disease remains unresolved. Our aim was to investigate the association of severe COVID-19 illness with vascular risk factor burden. METHODS: We included 164 (61.8  13.6 years) patients with COVID-19 in this retrospective study. We compared the difference in clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) findings between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 illness. We evaluated the association between the number of vascular risk factors and the development of severe COVID-19 disease, using a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Sixteen (9.8%) patients had no vascular risk factors; 38 (23.2%) had 1; 58 (35.4%) had 2; 34 (20.7%) had 3; and 18 (10.9%) had 4 risk factors. Twenty-nine patients (17.7%) experienced severe COVID-19 disease with a median (14 [7C27] days) duration between onset to developing severe COVID-19 disease, an event rate of 4.47 per 1000-patient days (95%CI 3.10C6.43). Kaplan-Meier curves showed a gradual increase in the risk of severe COVID-19 illness (log-rank P < 0.001) stratified by the number of vascular risk factors. After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities as potential confounders, vascular risk factor burden remained associated with an increasing risk of severe COVID-19 illness.

Methods: A total of 140 children with 2019-nCoV infection diagnosed in Shijiazhuang People's Hospital and Hebei Provincial Chest Hospital from January 2021 to February 2021 were selected for this study. According to the clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging examination, the children were divided into asymptomatic infection group, mild infection group and common infection group. The levels of white blood cell (WBC), LY, CRP, PA, albumin (ALB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CKMB) in the children were recorded on the 2nd d after the positive detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Results: There were 73(52.1%) children in the asymptomatic infection group, 35(25.0%) children in the mild infection group and 32(22.9%) children in the common infection group. LY level in the common infection group was lower than that in the asymptomatic infection group and the mild infection group (F= 3.152, both p< 0.05). CRP level in the common infection group was higher than that in the asymptomatic infection group and the mild infection group (F= 6.343, both p< 0.05). CRP level in the mild infection group was higher than that in the asymptomatic infection group (t= 2.052, p< 0.05). PA level in the common infection group and the mild infection group was lower compared with the asymptomatic infection group (F= 5.229, both p< 0.05). WBC, ALB, AST, ALT, CK and CKMB levels in the three groups showed no statistical significance (F= 1.803, F= 1.208, F= 2.391, F= 1.973, F= 0.401, F= 1.332, respectively, all p> 0.05). Correlation analysis demonstrated that LY and PA levels were negatively correlated with hospital stay (r= -0.265, r= -0.325, both p< 0.050), but CRP level was not correlated with hospital stay (r= -0.039, p> 0.05).

To maximize its effectiveness, it is paramount to investigate psychological factors that predict adherence to social distancing guidelines and examine corresponding interventions. We focused on individual differences in if-then planning, self-control, and boredom, and tested an intervention based on if-then planning. We conducted a two-wave longitudinal study combining observational and experimental methods. Participants (N = 574, 35.7% female, age: M = 37.5 years, SD = 10.8) reported their adherence to social distancing guidelines and the perceived difficulty of adherence at T1, along with trait measures of if-then planning, self-control, and boredom. Afterwards, they were randomly assigned to an if-then planning intervention to increase adherence, or to a control intervention. One week later at T2, participants again reported their adherence and the perceived difficulty of adhering. Multiple regression and structural equation modeling were used to establish whether trait if-then planning, self-control, and boredom predicted adherence, and to examine the effects of the if-then planning intervention. Trait if-then planning, self-control, and boredom were associated with T1 adherence, while only if-then planning and boredom predicted T2 adherence. No overall treatment effect of the if-then planning intervention emerged; however, participants who complied with the intervention (75.6%) maintained higher levels of adherence over time than control participants. In sum, individual differences in if-then planning, self-control, and boredom predicted adherence to social distancing guidelines.

However, the nature of this structural inequality in relation to COVID-19 is poorly understood. Here, we hypothesized that two structural features, racial residential segregation and income inequality, of metropolitan areas in the United States have contributed to health-compromising conditions, which, in turn, have increased COVID-19 fatalities; moreover, that these two features, when combined, may be particularly lethal. To test this hypothesis, we examined the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in an early 30-day period of the outbreak in the counties located in each of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The growth curves for cases and deaths were steeper in counties located in metropolitan areas where Blacks and Hispanics are residentially segregated from Whites. Moreover, the effect of racial residential segregation was augmented by income inequality within each county.

RECENT FINDINGS: From a total of 455 titles on COVID-19 and alcohol, 227 abstracts were screened, and 95 articles were reviewed (on November 25th, 2020). The immediate effect was an increase in alcohol related emergencies including alcohol withdrawal, related suicides, and methanol toxicity. Although there are mixed findings with respect to changes in the quantity of drinking, there are reports of binge/heavy drinking during the lockdown as well as relapse postlockdown. Psychological, social, biological, economic and policy-related factors appear to influence the changes in drinking. Although preliminary data suggest no change in alcohol use among persons with comorbid mental illness, findings in this population are presently limited. Among patients with alcohol related liver disease, outcomes appear worse and caution is warranted with the use of medications. Alcohol also appears to increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and complicates its course.Although some nations banned alcohol sales completely during lockdown, others declared it as an essential commodity, resulting in different problems across countries. Alcohol use has added to the burden of the problem particularly among vulnerable groups like the adolescents, elderly, patients with cancer, as well as health professionals. Services for patients with alcohol use disorders have been affected. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable impact on alcohol use, with an increase in alcohol related emergencies, changes in alcohol use patterns, increased risk of contracting COVID-19, effect on alcohol policies and sales, and an effect on vulnerable groups.

DESIGN: Mixed-methods study. SETTING: Tertiary-care center in West Haven, Connecticut. PATIENTS: HCP including physicians, nurses, and ancillary staff. METHODS: Face-mask compliance was measured through direct observations during a 4-week baseline period after universal masking was mandated. Frontline and management HCP completed semistructured interviews from which a multimodal intervention was developed. Direct observations were repeated during a 14-week period following implementation of the multimodal intervention. Differences between units were evaluated with &#967;2 testing using the Bonferroni correction. Face-mask compliance between baseline and intervention periods was compared using time-series regression. RESULTS: Among 1,561 observations during the baseline period, median weekly face-mask compliance was 82.2% (range, 80.8%-84.4%). Semistructured interviews were performed with 16 HCP. Qualitative analysis informed the development of a multimodal intervention consisting of audit and passive feedback, active discussion, and increased communication from leadership. Among 2,651 observations during the intervention period, median weekly face-mask compliance was 92.6% (range, 84.6%-97.9%).

Hospital systems require rapid adaptation to respond to the increased demand for airway management while ensuring high quality patient care and provider safety. There is limited literature detailing successful system-level approaches to adapt to the surge of COVID-19 patients requiring airway management. METHODS: A deliberate system-level approach was used to expand a preexisting airway response service. Through a needs analysis (taking into account both existing resources and anticipated demands), we established priorities and solutions for the airway management challenges encountered during the pandemic. RESULTS: During our COVID-19 surge (March 10, 2020, through May 26, 2020), there were 619 airway consults, and the COVID airway response team (CART) performed 341 intubations. Despite a 4-fold increase in intubations during the surge, there was no increase in cardiac arrests or surgical airways and no documented COVID-19 infections among the CART. CONCLUSIONS: Our system-level approach successfully met the sudden escalation in demand in airway management incurred by the COVID-19 surge. The approach that addressed staffing needs prioritized provider protection and enhanced quality and safety monitoring may be adaptable to other institutions.","output":"Rapid Expansion of the Airway Response Team to Meet the Needs of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of viral diseases is on the rise and has caused many problems for public health. COVID-19 is a new viral outbreak in the world. This study aimed to investigate the trends of incidence and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 in the world by April 30, 2020. METHODS: This was a descriptive-analytical study. We investigated the number of cases and deaths in 35 selected countries and regions of the WHO that had at least 10,000 cases by the time of the study. In addition, the incidence and CFR of COVID-19 were investigated. Finally, time trends of the number of cases, deaths, and CFR were investigated using ordinary least squares regression models. RESULTS: The total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 3,090,184. The European region had the highest number of COVID-19 patients (1,434,649 [46.43%]). Ukraine with 10,406 and the USA with 1,003,974 cases have reported the lowest and highest confirmed cases, respectively. In addition, the European region and the African region with 157.13 and 2.50 patients per 100,000 population had the highest and the lowest incidence rate, respectively. India (2.44) and Spain (455.69) had the lowest and the highest incidence rate per 100,000 population, respectively. In the world, 217,759 deaths have happened, of which 135,961 (62.44%) were reported in the European region. Furthermore, the USA had the highest number of deaths (52,428) due to COVID-19. CFR was 7.05% in the world, which ranged from 3.74% in the African region and 9.48% in the European region. The number of patients and deaths due to COVID-19 had increasing trends in all countries, and the trend of CFR just for Iran and Ukraine was negative. CONCLUSION: The countries had different trends in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. However, regarding the increasing trend of the disease in the world, it will be more important to rely on public prevention strategies.

It not only results in severe economic losses but also raises concerns over animal welfare and antimicrobial resistance and remains an important zoonotic agent in some countries. The definition and diagnosis of S. suis-associated diseases can be complex. Should S. suis be considered a primary or secondary pathogen? The situation is further complicated when referring to respiratory disease, since the pathogen has historically been considered as a secondary pathogen within the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Is S. suis a respiratory or strictly systemic pathogen? S. suis is a normal inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract, and the presence of potentially virulent strains alone does not guarantee the appearance of clinical signs. Within this unclear context, it has been largely proposed that co-infection with some viral and bacterial pathogens can significantly influence the severity of S. suis-associated diseases and may be the key to understanding how the infection behaves in the field. In this review, we critically addressed studies reporting an epidemiological link (mixed infections or presence of more than one pathogen at the same time), as well as in vitro and in vivo studies of co-infection of S. suis with other pathogens and discussed their limitations and possibilities for improvement and proposed recommendations for future studies.","output":"Review of the speculative role of co-infections in Streptococcus suis-associated diseases in pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Identification of shared and divergent predictors of clinical severity across respiratory viruses may support clinical decision-making and resource planning in the context of a novel or re-emergent respiratory pathogen. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to identify predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality following hospitalization with influenza (N=45,749; 2011-09 to 2019-05), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, N=24,345; 2011-09 to 2019-04), or SARS-CoV-2 (N=8,988; 2020-03 to 2020-12; pre-vaccine) using population-based health administrative data from Ontario, Canada. Multivariable modified Poisson regression was used to assess associations between potential predictors and mortality. We compared the direction, magnitude and confidence intervals of risk ratios to identify shared and divergent predictors of mortality. Results: 3,186 (7.0%), 697 (2.9%) and 1,880 (20.9%) patients died within 30 days of hospital admission with influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Common predictors of increased mortality included: older age, male sex, residence in a long-term care home, and chronic kidney disease. Positive associations between age and mortality were largest for patients with SARS-CoV-2. Few comorbidities were associated with mortality among patients with SARS-CoV-2 as compared to those with influenza or RSV.

During the high solar activity, emissions of matter and electromagnetic fields from the Sun make it difficult for cosmic rays to penetrate the Earth. When solar energy is high, cosmic ray intensity is lower, so that the solar magnetic field and solar winds affect the Earth externally and originate new viruses. In this paper, we assess the possible effects of sunspot numbers on the world virus appearance. The literature has no sufficient results about these phenomena. Therefore, we try to relate solar ray extremum to virus generation and the history of pandemics. First, wavelet decomposition is used for smoothing the sunspot cycle to predict past pandemics and forecast the future time of possible virus generation. Finally, we investigate the geographical appearance of the virus in the world to show vulnerable places in the world. The result of the analysis of pandemics that occurred from 1750 to 2020 shows that world's great viral pandemics like COVID-19 coincide with the relative extrema of sunspot number. Based on our result, 27 pandemic (from 36) incidences are on sunspot extrema. Then, we forecast future pandemics in the world for about 110 years or 10 cycles using presented multi-step autoregression (MSAR).

During the unprecedented times of COVID-19, the medical doctors at Eastbourne District General Hospital (EDGH) commenced a surge rota consisting of 4 days on, 4 days off. I aimed to review the bleep system to assess whether ward and medical staff could easily contact the relevant doctor and to introduce and distribute a new bleep system which may in turn, enable a safer and smoother running of the hospital.MethodsA cross-sectional study of all doctors on the surge rota (April 13, 2020, and May 31, 2020) at EDGH was obtained. The primary outcome measure was their responses to a survey pre- and post-initiation of the bleep system.ResultsA total of 32 doctors responded to the survey. Following initiation of the bleep system the ease of contacting a specific doctor, increased from 18.75% to 93.75%. Similarly, medical staff knowing which bleep to carry (18.75% to 87.5%) and nursing staff knowing who to reliably contact (9.38% to 75%). Doctors also reported being bleeped less often regarding issues not related to them (84.38% to 46.88%) and if they were contacted inappropriately, they knew who to forward the issue on to once the system was in place.ConclusionsThe bleep system is one of the only ways to contact a doctor. Therefore, it is both empirically important and essential for a robust system to be in place which enables both patient safety within the hospital and the smooth running of our NHS service. During COVID times, I implemented a more robust system than its predecessor.

Access to scientifically correct information can assist patients in early detection or prevention of the disease. However, misinformation on social networking sites (SNSs) about breast cancer can be propagated rapidly, posing a threat to health communication efforts. The aim of this study is to analyse the characteristics of the most shared news stories referencing the disease that circulated on SNSs, including the credibility of this content. METHODS: This is an exploratory quali-quantitative study. Data collection was conducted between June 2019 and June 2020. We performed statistical and content analysis of the stories that had at least 1,000 total shares. Each story was classified in accordance to the following aspects: credibility; type of rumour; source; content type; mentions prevention or early detection/screening exams. RESULTS: The abundance of news stories in our sample (n = 1,594) were not classified according to their credibility, as they do not address science, risk factors, prevention, treatment, or other aspects which can be assessed for scientific accuracy. However, content classified as \\"rumours\\" are 3.29 times more shared than those considered scientifically correct. Regarding content type, most stories are classified as 'real-life story' or 'solidarity' (67.69%). In our sample, 5.08% of the total comment on prevention and 19.7% reference early detection. CONCLUSION: We consider it can be a good strategy, in SNSs, to combine content of greater popularity, such as real-life stories, with subjects that can make a difference in a patient's life, such as early detection, breast cancer symptoms and disease prevention strategies.

Using a recently developed bladder sensory threshold device, sine wave electrical stimulation was applied for 90 minutes to the rat bladder. The spinal cord was harvested after the rats were killed. The Fos-IR cells in the spinal regions of the medial dorsal horn, lateral dorsal horn, dorsal commissure, and sacral parasympathetic nucleus were measured. The distributions of the Fos-IR neurons were compared. RESULTS The maximal expression of Fos-IR cells, induced by 250- and 5-Hz stimulation of the bladder, was found at L6 of the spinal cord and was significantly greater than that in the control group (P<.01). Stimulation with 2000 Hz did not induce any Fos-IR cells. Fos-IR neurons were predominantly seen in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus region in response to 250-Hz stimulation and in the dorsal commissure region in response to 5-Hz stimulation. The number of positive neurons was similar to the number caused by capsaicin instillation.

So far, there is no direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission and the mechanisms leading to the adverse outcomes are not well understood Results An asymptomatic pregnant woman with preterm fetal distress during the COVID19 pandemic was included. We obtained multiple maternal, placental and neonatal swabs, which showed a median viral load in maternal blood, urine, oropharynx, fornix posterior over a period of 6 days was 5.0 log copies /mL. The maternal side of the placenta had a viral load of 4.42 log copies /mL, while the fetal side had 7.15 log copies /mL. Maternal breast milk, feces and all neonatal samples tested negative. Serology of immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 was tested positive in maternal blood, but negative in umbilical cord and neonatal blood. Pathological examination of the placenta included immunohistochemical investigation against SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression in combination with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy. It showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles with generalized inflammation characterized by histiocytic intervillositis with diffuse perivillous fibrin depositions with damage to the syncytiotrophoblasts. Discussion Placental infection by SARS-CoV-2 lead to fibrin depositions hampering fetal-maternal gas exchange most likely resulted in fetal distress necessitating a premature emergency caesarean section. Postpartum, the neonate showed a clinical presentation resembling a pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome including coronary artery ectasia, most likely associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) for which admittance and care on the Neonatal Intensive Care unit (NICU) was required, despite being negative for SARS-CoV-2. This highlights the need for awareness of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes during the current COVID-19 pandemic, especially considering that the majority of pregnant women appear asymptomatic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 placental infection and inflammation leading to fetal distress and neonatal multi-organ failure in an asymptomatic woman"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Patients with cancer are at increased risk for severe COVID-19, but it is unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is effective for them. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infections among a population of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, multicenter, nationwide cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection among patients in the VA health care system from December 15, 2020, to May 4, 2021. All adults with solid tumors or hematologic cancer who received systemic cancer-directed therapy from August 15, 2010, to May 4, 2021, and were alive and without a documented SARS-CoV-2 positive result as of December 15, 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Each day between December 15, 2020, and May 4, 2021, newly vaccinated patients were matched 1:1 with unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls based on age, race and ethnicity, VA facility, rurality of home address, cancer type, and treatment type/timing. EXPOSURES: Receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. A proxy for vaccine effectiveness was defined as 1 minus the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals compared with unvaccinated controls. RESULTS: A total of 184 485 patients met eligibility criteria, and 113 796 were vaccinated. Of these, 29 152 vaccinated patients (median [IQR] age, 74.1 [70.2-79.3] years; 95% were men; 71% were non-Hispanic White individuals) were matched 1:1 to unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls. As of a median 47 days of follow-up, 436 SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected in the matched cohort (161 infections in vaccinated patients vs 275 in unvaccinated patients). There were 17 COVID-19Crelated deaths in the vaccinated group vs 27 COVID-19Crelated deaths in the unvaccinated group. Overall vaccine effectiveness in the matched cohort was 58% (95% CI, 39% to 72%) starting 14 days after the second dose. Patients who received chemotherapy within 3 months prior to the first vaccination dose were estimated to have a vaccine effectiveness of 57% (95% CI, C23% to 90%) starting 14 days after the second dose vs 76% (95% CI, 50% to 91%) for those receiving endocrine therapy and 85% (95% CI, 29% to 100%) for those who had not received systemic therapy for at least 6 months prior. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in patients with cancer. Some immunosuppressed subgroups may remain at early risk for COVID-19 despite vaccination, and consideration should be given to additional risk reduction strategies, such as serologic testing for vaccine response and a third vaccine dose to optimize outcomes.","output":"Association of COVID-19 Vaccination With SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Patients With Cancer: A US Nationwide Veterans Affairs Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stressors caused by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) contribute to increased addictive behaviors in the general population worldwide. Little is known, however, about addictive behaviors of people who have recovered a long time ago, even years, from substance use disorder (SUD). The goal of the present research was to examine the craving for drug use and addictive behaviors (tobacco and alcohol consumption, viewing of pornography, gambling, and shopping online) of people who recovered from SUD, before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: During one week of isolation imposed in Israel following the outbreak of COVID-19 in April, 2020, a self-report questionnaire was distributed to a convenience sample of 113 people who had recovered from SUD, aged 22-69, 78% men. Results Fifty-one percent of participants reported craving drugs during the isolation period and engaging in addictive behaviors. Significant differences were found in tobacco and alcohol consumption, gambling, and viewing of pornography online, before and after the outbreak of the pandemic, especially in participants who reported having engaged in these addictive behaviors to some extent before the outbreak. A hierarchical linear regression showed a significant explained variance (R 2=44%, p<.001), with stronger feelings of loneliness and shorter length of time free from drug use being associated with stronger craving for drugs. Conclusions: The drug addiction treatment establishment should pay close attention and strengthen communication with people who recovered from SUD. It is necessary to develop real-time anti-craving and anti-replacement addiction interventions to prevent relapses.","output":"Addictive behaviors and craving during the COVID-19 pandemic of people who have recovered from substance use disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 was not easy for Emergency Medicine (EM) clinicians with the burden of tackling a pandemic.

The polysaccharide capsule of group B N. meningitidis is poorly immunogenic and thus is an important model for studying pathogen-host co-evolution through understanding the molecular basis of the host immune response. We used a modified reverse-transcriptase PCR to amplify and sequence the V-genes of murine hybridomas produced against types B and C capsular PS. Databank analysis of the sequences encoding the V-genes of type C capsular PS mAb, 4-2-C, reveal that heavy chain alleles are recurrently used to encode this specificity in mice. Interestingly, a V-gene from the same germline family also encodes the V-domain of mAbs 2-2-B, which targets the antigenically distinct serogroup B capsular PS. Somatic mutation, junctional diversity and alternative light chains collectively impart the specificity for these serologically distinct epitopes. Knowledge of the specific immunoglobulin genes used to target common bacterial virulence factors may lead to insights on pathogen-host co-evolution, and the potential use of this information in pre-symptomatic diagnosis is discussed.","output":"Molecular analysis of monoclonal antibodies to group variant capsular polysaccharide of Neisseria meningitidis: recurrent heavy chains and alternative light chain partners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The closure of schools in response to COVID\\\\19 compromised access to essential meals for many students.

Although all usual safety and efficacy monitoring mechanisms remain in place, varied attitudes toward the new vaccines have arisen among different population groups. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to discern the evolution and disparities of attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines among various population groups through the study of large-scale tweets spanning over a whole year. METHODS: We collected over 1.4 billion tweets from June 2020 to July 2021, which cover some critical phases concerning the development and inoculation of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. We first developed a data mining model that incorporates a series of deep learning algorithms for inferring a range of individual characteristics, both in reality and in cyberspace, as well as sentiments and emotions expressed in tweets. We further conducted an observational study, including an overall analysis, a longitudinal study, and a cross-sectional study, to collectively explore the attitudes of major population groups. RESULTS: Our study derived 3 main findings. First, the whole populations attentiveness toward vaccines was strongly correlated (Pearson r=0.9512) with official COVID-19 statistics, including confirmed cases and deaths. Such attentiveness was also noticeably influenced by major vaccine-related events. Second, after the beginning of large-scale vaccine inoculation, the sentiments of all population groups stabilized, followed by a considerably pessimistic trend after June 2021. Third, attitude disparities toward vaccines existed among population groups defined by 8 different demographic characteristics. By crossing the 2 dimensions of attitude, we found that among population groups carrying low sentiments, some had high attentiveness ratios, such as males and individuals aged 40 years, while some had low attentiveness ratios, such as individuals aged 18 years, those with occupations of the 3rd category, those with account age <5 years, and those with follower number <500. These findings can be used as a guide in deciding who should be given more attention and what kinds of help to give to alleviate the concerns about vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: This study tracked the year-long evolution of attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines among various population groups defined by 8 demographic characteristics, through which significant disparities in attitudes along multiple dimensions were revealed. According to these findings, it is suggested that governments and public health organizations should provide targeted interventions to address different concerns, especially among males, older people, and other individuals with low levels of education, low awareness of news, low income, and light use of social media. Moreover, public health authorities may consider cooperating with Twitter users having high levels of social influence to promote the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines among all population groups.","output":"The Evolution and Disparities of Online Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Vaccines: Year-long Longitudinal and Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This technical note presents information on personal hygiene, basic infection prevention, and control measures, as well as how to take care of the person suspected of having COVID-19 or carriers of this virus as safely as possible, while avoiding the infection spreading to other household members","output":"Recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfection in Homes with Suspected or Confirmed Cases of COVID-19, 11 May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prediction of human diseases precisely is still an uphill battle task for better and timely treatment.

All MHV DI RNAs characterized so far contain an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a fused viral protein; in addition, DI RNAs with a long ORF have a competitive advantage over those with a shorter ORF. These findings suggest that DI RNA replication may require an ORF encoding a cis-acting viral protein. In this study, we used a naturally occurring DI RNA and inserted a 12-nucleotide (nt) amber-mutation linker at various positions to truncate the ORF. Most of the mutants replicated as well as the wild-type DI RNA, irrespective of the presence or absence and the length of the ORF in the RNA. Sequence analysis showed that all of the mutants retained the insertional mutations even after two viral passages in tissue culture, establishing that the mutant DI RNAs replicated. We have further introduced two 3-nucleotide substitutions of the first two AUG codons of the ORF, thus completely closing the ORF. This DI RNA replicated as well as the wild-type DL but, after a single passage, the majority of the mutant RNAs was replaced by recombinant RNAs which contain a restored functional ORF. However, an additional insertion of a 12-nt amber-mutation linker downstream of the AUG substitutions prevented recombination, and the DI RNA still replicated. These data indicate that DI RNA replication does not require a DI-specific ORF encoding cis-acting viral proteins and that a 12-nucleotide insertion could prevent or delay the occurrence of RNA recombination, suggesting the importance of direct or indirect RNA alignment in homologous RNA recombination.","output":"A cis-Acting Viral Protein Is Not Required for the Replication of a Coronavirus Defective-Interfering RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Overweight and obesity are defined as an unnecessary accumulation of fat, which poses a risk to health. It is a well-identified risk factor for increased mortality due to heightened rates of heart disease, certain cancers, musculoskeletal disorders, and bacterial, protozoan and viral infections. The increasing prevalence of obesity is of concern, as conventional pathogenesis may indeed be increased in obese hosts rather than healthy hosts, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a new disease and we do not have the luxury of cumulative data. Obesity activates the development of gene induced hypoxia and adipogenesis in obese animals. Several factors can influence obesity, for example, stress can increase the body weight by allowing people to consume high amounts of food with a higher propensity to consume palatable food. Obesity is a risk factor for the development of immune-mediated and some inflammatory-mediated diseases, including atherosclerosis and psoriasis, leading to a dampened immune response to infectious agents, leading to weaker post-infection impacts. Moreover, the obese host creates a special microenvironment for disease pathogenesis, marked by persistent low-grade inflammation. Therefore, it is advisable to sustain healthy eating habits by increasing the consumption of various plant-based and low-fat foods to protect our bodies and decrease the risk of infectious diseases, especially COVID-19.","output":"Factors Associated with Increased Morbidity and Mortality of Obese and Overweight COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several treatment plants were sampled for influent, primary clarifier sludge, return activated sludge (RAS), and anaerobically digested sludge throughout nine weeks during the summer of the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary clarifier sludge had a significantly higher number of SARS-CoV-2 gene copy number per liter (GC/L) than other sludge samples, within a range from 1.0  105 to 1.0  106 GC/L. Gene copy numbers in raw influent significantly correlated with gene copy numbers in RAS in Silver Creek (p-value = 0.007, R2 = 0.681) and East Canyon (p-value = 0.009, R2 = 0.775) WRFs; both of which lack primary clarifiers or industrial pretreatment processes. This data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 gene copies tend to partition into primary clarifier sludges, at which point a significant portion of them are removed through sedimentation. Furthermore, it was found that East Canyon WRF gene copy numbers in influent were a significant predictor of daily cases (p-value = 0.0322, R2 = 0.561), and gene copy numbers in RAS were a significant predictor of weekly cases (p-value = 0.0597, R2 = 0.449). However, gene copy numbers found in primary sludge samples from other plants significantly predicted the number of COVID-19 cases for the following week (t = 2.279) and the week after that (t = 2.122) respectively. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 extracted from WRF biosolids may better suit epidemiological monitoring that exhibits a time lag. It also supports the observation that primary sludge removes a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 marker genes. In its absence, RAS can also be used to predict the number of COVID-19 cases due to direct flow through from influent.

Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay limit of detection was comparable to central laboratory reverse-transcription quantitative PCR tests with observed SARS-CoV-2 detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert? Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were diluted into six sample pools. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted by population public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care test site and should be determined by assessing positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates. This information is included as a supplemental dataset that we encourage public health authorities to use as a guide to make recommendations that will maximize testing capacity and resource conservation.","output":"Recommendations for sample pooling on the Cepheid GeneXpert? system using the Cepheid Xpert?

Their all-out efforts contributed to Hubei finally winning the fight to prevent and control the pandemic. The aim of this study is to explore the influence of perceived organizational support on the emotional labor of medical personnel in Hubei Province. A group of 170 medical personnel from (tertiary) hospitals who participated in the pandemic aid operation in Hubei completed self-administered questionnaires, including the perceived organizational support scale, emotional labor scale, and professional identity scale. This study used Pearson's correlation in SPSS to analyze the three variables of organizational support, emotional labor, and professional identity. Organizational support and emotional labor (r = 0.443, P &lt; 0.01), organizational support and professional identity (r = 0.631, P &lt; 0.01), and emotional labor and occupational identity (r = 0.511, P &lt; 0.01) showed a significant positive correlation. The bootstrapping mediating effect test was used to determine the overall mediating effect of occupational identity. Occupational identity was a complete mediating effect between organizational support and emotional labor. The results show that a strong sense of organizational support can promote higher emotional labor among medical workers in Hubei Province. A strong sense of organizational support will also promote a stronger professional identity;further, a strong professional identity completely mediates the effect of perceived organizational support on emotional labor. These results infer that in emergency medical and health services, medical personnel can realize a high sense of organizational support, which could enhance their professional identity;this enables them to combine their professional goals with organizational goals more actively and to finally pay higher emotional labor to achieve organizational goals.","output":"Factors That Influence Perceived Organizational Support for Emotional Labor of Chinese Medical Personnel in Hubei"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This introduction to the Journal of Industrial Relations? 2020 Annual Review of Industrial Relations provides an overview of the six Annual Review articles, an international review and two practitioner reviews.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess geriatric depression, quality of life, and associated factors among elderly persons in the low-resource country. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was used from March to April 2020. The depression and quality of life were assessed using the standardized and pre-tested geriatric depression scale (GDS) and the World Health Organization Quality Of Life (WHOQOL)-BREF, respectively. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select woreda and study participants. For data input and analysis, Epi-data version 4.3 and SPSS version 23 were utilized, consecutively. Bivariable and multivariable in the logistic regression analysis were done, and significance was determined at the odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval and P value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 822 elderly persons participated in face to face interviewed-administered questionnaire. More than half 54.5% (n = 448) of elderly persons had depression and 51.8% (n = 426) of elderly participants had low quality of life. Advanced age, single participants, not having a formal education, living alone, and having chronic diseases were significantly associated with both the depression symptoms and low overall WHOQOL-BREF. Depression was correlated with low quality of life. CONCLUSION: We found that elderly persons have a high risk of depression symptoms and a low quality of life.

Male (P = 0.025) and older populations (P = 2.525  10-39) were at significantly higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. People were generally susceptible, and most cases concentrated in people of 30-79 years. Furthermore, we investigated the association between diagnosis rate and the amount of testing in 501 subjects. Results revealed a 1.27-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 35.5%) of diagnosis rate from testing once to twice (P = 5.847  10-9) and a 1.43-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 39.9%) from testing once to 3 times (P = 7.797  10-14).

People from low socioeconomic and educational backgrounds as well as low health literacy tend to be affected by the uncertainty, complexity, volatility, and progressiveness of public health crises and emergencies. A key lesson that governments have taken from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is the importance of developing and disseminating highly accessible, actionable, inclusive, coherent public health advice, which represent a critical tool to help people with diverse cultural, educational backgrounds and varying abilities to effectively implement health policies at the grassroots level. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to translate the best practices of accessible, inclusive public health advice (purposefully designed for people with low socioeconomic and educational background, health literacy levels, limited English proficiency, and cognitive/functional impairments) on COVID-19 from health authorities in English-speaking multicultural countries (USA, Australia, and UK) to adaptive tools for the evaluation of the accessibility of public health advice in other languages. METHODS: We developed an optimised Bayesian classifier to produce probabilistic prediction of the accessibility of official health advice among vulnerable people including migrants and foreigners living in China. We developed an adaptive statistical formula for the rapid evaluation of the accessibility of health advice among vulnerable people in China. RESULTS: Our study provides needed research tools to fill in a persistent gap in Chinese public health research on accessible, inclusive communication of infectious diseases' prevention and management. For the probabilistic prediction, using the optimised Bayesian machine learning classifier (GNB), the largest positive likelihood ratio (LR+) 16.685 (95% confidence interval: 4.35, 64.04) was identified when the probability threshold was set at 0.2 (sensitivity: 0.98; specificity: 0.94). CONCLUSION: Effective communication of health risks through accessible, inclusive, actionable public advice represents a powerful tool to reduce health inequalities amidst health crises and emergencies. Our study translated the best-practice public health advice developed during the pandemic into intuitive machine learning classifiers for health authorities to develop evidence-based guidelines of accessible health advice.

The proportion of patients with incidental COVID-19 changes was recorded over the study period, and the percentage of the population who had been affected by COVID-19 by the end of April 2020 estimated. Results CT appearances consistent with COVID-19 began to exceed a background pre-COVID rate in the second week of February and did not decline until 2 weeks after lockdown. By the end of April 2020, approximately 45% of the population had been infected. Conclusions CT of major trauma patients can be used to monitor the spread of COVID-19. This novel technique could be used retrospectively or prospectively anywhere where trauma scans are available, to monitor the disease in the local population.","output":"COVID-19: could CT provide the best population level biomarker?

We compared anticipated help-seeking times for cancer symptoms and perceived barriers to help-seeking before and after the coronavirus pandemic. METHODS: Two waves (pre-Coronavirus: February 2020, N = 3269; and post-Coronavirus: August 2020, N = 1500) of the Spanish Onco-barometer population survey were compared. The international ABC instrument was administered. PreCpost comparisons were performed using multiple logistic and Poisson regression models. RESULTS: There was a consistent and significant increase in anticipated times to help-seeking for 12 of 13 cancer symptoms, with the largest increases for breast changes (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.22C1C96) and unexplained bleeding (OR = 1.50, 1.26C1.79). Respondents were more likely to report barriers to help-seeking in the post wave, most notably worry about what the doctor may find (OR = 1.58, 1.35C1.84) and worry about wasting the doctors time (OR = 1.48, 1.25C1.74).

All groups were treated for 10 days. Blood and liver samples were collected for biochemical, molecular, and histological analyses. Treatment with CP led to deformations in the liver tissue that were associated with higher liver function markers (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase). Additionally, a disturbance in the redox balance was observed after CP exposure, as indicated by increased levels of oxidants, including malondialdehyde and nitric oxide, and the decreased levels of endogenous antioxidants, including glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. At the molecular level, CP treatment resulted in reduced expression of the Nrf2/ARE pathway and other genes related to this pathway, including NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit. CP also led to a hyper-inflammatory response in hepatic tissue, with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interlukin-1beta, and upregulation of nitric oxide synthase 2. CP also enhanced the immunoreactivity of the profibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta, in liver tissue. Upregulation of caspase 3 and Bcl-2-associated X protein and downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 were also observed in response to CP treatment. Treatment with allicin reversed the molecular, biochemical, and histological changes that occurred with CP exposure.

The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is one of most important pathways that regulate interferon production. Thus, the present study aimed to dissect whether E. coli infections can regulate interferon production and the underlying mechanisms. For this aim, two lung cell lines, a human bronchial epithelial cell line transformed with Ad12-SV40 2B (BEAS-2b) and a human fetal lung fibroblast (HFL1) cell line, were used. The effects of E. coli infections on interferon production were studied using qRT-PCR, Western blot, and siRNA knockdown assays. E. coli infections remarkably promoted the expression levels of IFN-, IFN-, and ISGs. Major components of the JAK/STAT pathway, including JAK1, STAT1, and STAT2, were demonstrated to be regulated by E. coli infections. Importantly, knockdown of JAK1, STAT1, and STAT2 abolished the induction of IFN-, IFN-, and ISGs by E. coli. Therefore, experiments in the present study demonstrated that E. coli infections remarkably promoted interferon production in lung cells, which was closely regulated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The findings in the present study are useful for further understanding the pathogenesis of E. coli infections in the lung and finding novel therapies to treat E. coli-induced lung injury.","output":"Escherichia coli infection activates the production of IFN- and IFN- via the JAK1/STAT1/2 signaling pathway in lung cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study evaluated the essential stroke care structure available in the two Tertiary Health Facilities in Rives State, Nigeria.

Design Observational controlled cohort study. Setting & Patients Adult patients receiving maintenance dialysis were followed for 3 months both before and after transfer to a new unit, where they received HDF. Prior to transfer, control patients were already treated by HDF. Methods Quality of life at baseline and follow-up was measured using the validated minutes to recovery (MR) question. Dialysis data were collected for 3 consecutive sessions monthly; laboratory values were collected monthly. Wilcoxon signed rank test and repeated measures analysis of covariance were used to evaluate pre/post transfer changes and quantile regression to identify predictors of change in recovery time. Results Of 227 patients, 82 died, were transplanted, were hospitalized or did not transfer, leaving 123 subjects and 22 controls for analysis. MR did not improve with switching to HDF, although patients with MR > 60 min before transfer experienced a significant decrease in their MR, compared with controls.

PARTICIPANTS: Eleven EC members and five additional external healthcare and bioethical professionals, forming a multidisciplinary panel, took part in the study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The compilation of a list of ethical principles (maximum of 10 items) and their priority ranking and application within an emergency pandemic context was established as the expected outcome of this work. RESULTS: A consensus on 10 guiding ethical principles was reached by the multidisciplinary panel. Transparency ranked first on the priority list as the most frequently voted principle, followed by the number of lives saved, life-years saved, respect for individuals autonomy and equity. Other principles including life cycle, sickest first, reciprocity, instrumental value and lottery were also considered appropriate as potential tiebreakers. These principles were discussed and made consistent with the current Italian pandemic context by producing an explanatory document. CONCLUSIONS: The identified principles could be used in preparedness plans to guide resource allocation during pandemic events.

The appropriateness and usefulness of these technologies as a containment measure have since sparked political and academic discussions globally. The present paper contributes to this debate through an exploration of how the national daily newspapers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland reported on the development and adoption of digital contact-tracing apps during early and after stages of the lockdown. These countries were among the first in Europe to develop apps and were critical voices in the debate of decentralized vs. centralized data processing. We conducted thematic analysis on news coverage published between January and May 2020 in high-circulation national daily newspapers (print) from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. A total of 148 newspaper articles were included in the final analysis. From our analysis emerged six core themes of the development and adoption of digital contact tracing apps: 1) data governance; 2) role of IT giants; 3) scientific rigor; 4) voluntariness; 5) functional efficacy; 6) role of the app. These results shed light on the different facets of discussion regarding digital contact tracing as portrayed in German-speaking media. As news coverage can serve as a proxy for public perception, this study complements emerging survey data on public perceptions of digital contact tracing apps by identifying potential issues of public concern.","output":"Digital contact-tracing during the Covid-19 pandemic: an analysis of newspaper coverage in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has caused significant disruption.

It has potential to increase efficiency in public health areas, such as surveillance, communication, data analysis and visualization, planning and collaboration. While the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalisation of healthcare, a structured and planned approach is needed to ensure its sustainable and equitable integration in healthcare. Capacity building in digital literacy plays a key role to ensure an adequate implementation of digital public health. Moreover, the application of digital health solutions in public health services requires a proper training for students, young professionals, and public health experts. To fulfil this, education on digital health should be fully integrated in medical and public health curricula. Our workshop aims to discuss the potential of digital health technologies for public health services and identify proposals for a renewed digital public health curriculum. In this workshop, we will present a summary of potential uses of digital health in public health, focusing advances developed during COVID-19 pandemic. This introduction will provide a background for participants to be aware of digital health solutions, from basic digital services to innovations, that are applicable in public health practice. Panellists will share both local and national experiences. Although there are some examples of digital health updated curricula, a more comprehensive and structured approach to public health training is needed. Digital public health education should include specific topics, such as capacity building, opportunities for youth, and an ethics-driven approach. However, it should be tailored for public health students and professionals needs, which are certainly different. A short presentation will provide a guiding framework for participants to discuss the topic. Following, during small group discussions, workshop participants will share perspectives and suggestions for an updated digital public health curricula, including different approaches for both undergraduate students, public health residents and public health experts. In this round table discussion, one panelist will present a summary of potential uses of digital health in public health (10 minutes). The following presentation will cover main concerns that digital public health education should consider, particularly for young professionals (10 minutes). Following, participants will be asked to discuss in 3 to 6 small groups which topics should be included in curricula and training opportunities in medical schools, public health schools and public health services (20 minutes). Finally, each group will briefly present their conclusions (15 minutes), which will be highlighted in a wrap-up conclusion (5 minutes). We intend to keep in touch with all participants, in order to develop a concrete proposal for digital health education curricula. KEY MESSAGES: Digital health has potential to increase efficiency in multiple public health areas and digital health education is a key step to ensure its implementation in public health schools and services. COVID-19 accelerated the digitalization in public health, but a planned approach is needed to guarantee adequate training for students and professionals.","output":"3.G.

A UAV is fitted with a wireless Bidirectional Relay BR to enable coverage network extension and increase transmission throughput. The downside of the BR advantages is the delay in data transmission caused by the UAV movement. A consequence of this delay is increased total energy consumption, causing further degradation in bit error rate performance, especially at high SNR levels. In wireless communication, the trade-off between delay and energy consumption is, fortunately, possible to improve performance. Therefore, this study aims to enhance UAV network performance by reducing energy consumption, data transmission delay, and bit error rate. A multi-objective algorithm is employed to generate an adaptive optimal energy allocation strategy based on the balance between energy consumption and transmission delays. The results of theoretical analysis are illustrated with several examples. As herein demonstrated, the proposed solution effectively balances delay and energy efficiency in a customised system design and improves the bit error rate in UAV networks","output":"Balanced Performance Between Energy-Delay and Bit Error Rate in UAV Relay Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are concerns that the future balance between the supply and demand for nurses will result in major nursing shortages around the world.

A total of 6,277 Italian adults completed an online survey, including socio-demographic variables, COVID-19 related information, the 16-item Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale (MDS-16), and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 Items (DASS-21). Based on an empirically derived cut-off score, 1,082 participants (17.2%) were identified as probable maladaptive daydreamers (MDers). A binary logistic regression revealed that compared to controls, probable MDers reported that during the COVID-19 lockdown they experienced higher levels of anxiety and depression, decreased online social relationships, and, surprisingly, stable or increased face-to-face social relationships. Given the peculiar characteristics of the pandemic context, these findings suggest that the exposure to the risk of contagion had probably exacerbated the tendency of probable MDers to lock themselves inside their mental fantasy worlds, which in turn may have contributed to further estrangement from online social relationships and support, thus worsening their emotional distress.","output":"Maladaptive Daydreaming in an Adult Italian Population During the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Inequality is rife throughout South Africa. The first wave of COVID-19 may have affected people in lower socioeconomic groups worse than the affluent. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and the specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in South Africa is not known. METHODS: We tested 405 volunteers representing all socioeconomic strata from the workforce of a popular shopping and tourist complex in central Cape Town with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. We assessed the association between antibody positivity and COVID-19 symptom status, medical history, and sociodemographic variables. We tested 137 serum samples from healthy controls collected in Cape Town prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to confirm the specificity of the assay in the local population. RESULTS: Of the 405 volunteers tested one month after the first peak of the epidemic in Cape Town, 96(23.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Of those who tested positive, 46(47.9%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the previous 6 months. Seropositivity was significantly associated with living in informal housing, residing in a subdistrict with low income-per household, and having a low-earning occupation. The specificity of the assay was 98.54%(95%CI 94.82%-99.82%) in the pre-COVID controls. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high background seroprevalence in Cape Town, particularly in people of lower socioeconomic status.

Accident statistics show that E-bikes are growingly involved in traffic accidents. This study evaluates the injury pattern and severity of E-bike injuries in direct comparison to injuries in motorcycle and bicycle accidents. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, the data of 1796 patients who were treated at a Level I Trauma Center between 2009 and 2018 due to traffic accident, involving bicycles, E-bikes or motorcycles, were evaluated and compared with regard to injury patterns and injury severity. Accident victims treated as inpatients with at least 16 years of age were included in this study. Pillion passengers and outpatients were excluded. RESULTS: The following distribution was found in the individual groups: 67 E-bike, 1141 bicycle and 588 motorcycle accidents. The injury pattern of E-bikers resembled that of bicyclists much more than that of motorcyclists. The patients with E-bike accidents were almost 14 years older and had a higher incidence of moderate traumatic brain injuries than patients with bicycle accidents. Considering the E-bike riders wore nearly twice as often a helmet as bicycle riders. In comparison, the motorcyclists involved in an accident had fewer facial injuries, but more frequent and more serious injuries to the spine, abdomen and lower extremities. CONCLUSION: The overall E-bike injury pattern is similar to that of cyclists. The differences in the injury pattern to motorcycle accidents could be due to the higher speeds at the time of the accident, the different protection and vehicle architecture. What is striking, however, is the higher age and the increased craniocerebral trauma of the E-bikers involved in accidents compared to the cyclists. Older and untrained people who have a slower reaction time and less control over the E-bike could benefit from head protection or practical courses similar to motorcyclists.","output":"Comparison of injury patterns between electric bicycle, bicycle and motorcycle accidents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY The French public health institute is responsible for promoting and coordinating threats the detection and assessment of health risks, and for suggesting possible responses.

The quality and accuracy of these signals is first verified, before assessing, through a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of introduction and dissemination. This article examines specific cases illustrating the process of detection, risk analysis and response, with respect to infectious threats that are endemic in tropical regions and have the potential to be imported into metropolitan France. For both novel pathogens and exotic diseases  which, not being endemic in France, are less well known  the analysis and response process must regularly be adapted to the latest epidemiological, clinical and biological findings, taking interactions between the pathogen, host, and environment into consideration.

In this quality improvement project (QIP), we sought to understand our trainees thoughts on this new multi-zonal handover process and aimed to identify risk-reduction measures to aid better patient care. METHOD: The opinions of trainees on the new handover system were obtained using an online Likert scale survey. Following the responses, a new morning and night handover proforma was developed. This was used trust-wide and a post-intervention repeat survey was conducted to assess the new changes. RESULTS: The primary survey received 31 responses with feedback illustrating mixed effectiveness of the existing handover process. Free text comments highlighted issues surrounding safety, poor organisation, poor continuity of care with one serious incident reported. Post-intervention of a new handover proforma, a repeat online survey received 25 responses.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the most common symptoms reported by patients with COVID-19, as well as the order of symptom appearance, by examining tweets in Arabic. METHODS: We searched Twitter posts in Arabic for personal reports of COVID-19 symptoms from March 1 to May 27, 2020. We identified 463 Arabic users who had tweeted about testing positive for COVID-19 and extracted the symptoms they associated with the disease. Furthermore, we asked them directly via personal messaging to rank the appearance of the first 3 symptoms they had experienced immediately before (or after) their COVID-19 diagnosis. Finally, we tracked their Twitter timeline to identify additional symptoms that were mentioned within 5 days from the day of the first tweet on their COVID-19 diagnosis.

Following a standardized case report form, we monitored several parameters such as pain, transparency of the dressing, active bleeding, exudation and inflammation by using the Verbal Rating Scale 1-10 through out. RESULTS With regard to re-epithelialization, pain and acute bleeding all three dressings were equivalent. Dressilk(?) and Biobrane(?) presented clearly superior to PolyMem(?) in both wound assessment and in the reduction of mild inflammation and exudation. High subjective satisfaction rates were reported with Dressilk(?) and Biobrane(?) dressings in regard to comfort and mobility.

A deep neural network (DNN) was applied, and deep features derived from CXR and clinical findings formed fused features for diagnosis prediction. Results: The clinical features of COVID-19 and influenza showed different patterns. Patients with COVID-19 experienced less fever, more diarrhea, and more salient hypercoagulability. Classifiers constructed using the clinical features or CXR had an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.909 and 0.919, respectively. The diagnostic efficacy of the classifier combining the clinical features and CXR was dramatically improved and the AUC was 0.952 with 91.5% sensitivity and 81.2% specificity. Moreover, combined classifier was functional in both severe and non-serve COVID-19, with an AUC of 0.971 with 96.9% sensitivity in non-severe cases, which was on par with the computed tomography (CT)-based classifier, but had relatively inferior efficacy in severe cases compared to CT. In extension, we performed a reader study involving three experienced pulmonary physicians, artificial intelligence (AI) system demonstrated superiority in turn-around time and diagnostic accuracy compared with experienced pulmonary physicians.

As of January 2022, the worldwide spreading of SARS-CoV-2 leads to approximately 0.35 billion of human infections and five millions of deaths. Current vaccination is one of the effective ways to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission and reduce the disease severity. However, the antibody level against the immunogen significantly drops several months after the standard two-dose vaccination, and hence a third or fourth dose booster (the same immunogen) has been suggested to boost the antibody response. Here, we described an ultra-effective nasal vaccine booster that potently induced the extraordinary high-level of neutralizing antibody in pre-vaccinated mice. The vaccine booster is composed of a recombinant receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (either wild-type or omicron) fused with a domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. In the absence of adjuvants, a single intranasal administration of the booster in pre-vaccinated mice significantly induced systemic and mucosal antibody responses as evidenced by the elevation of the cross-variant neutralizing antibody and induction of IgA in bronchoalveolar lavage respectively. Most importantly, the single dose nasal vaccine booster (omicron version) potently enhanced the neutralizing activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 omicron virus infection.

Among 232 instances where logic was satisfied for gonorrhea, 44% (102 instances) reflected a diagnosis and 56% (130 instances) reflected laboratory results. Data completeness was uniformly equal or higher for eCRs vs. ELRs. CONCLUSIONS The eCR approach was successful in identifying chlamydia and gonorrhea cases and provided a more complete set of information to assist public health authorities when compared with ELRs. eCR has the potential to automate and relieve staff burden on an important reporting requirement for clinical providers.","output":"Automating Case Reporting of Chlamydia and Gonorrhea to Public Health Authorities in Oregon Clinics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To improve the performance of underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS), which is subject to system uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances in trajectory tracking control, a sliding mode controller is proposed in this paper.

Then the error asymptotic convergence of the trajectory tracking control is proven by the Lyapunov-like function. Finally, the effectiveness of the sliding mode controller is verified by rich simulation.

METHODS. SARS-CoV-2 antinucleocapsid (N) IgG and polymerase chain reaction via a nasopharyngeal swab were analyzed in all patients within 24 h before liver or kidney transplantation. Kinetics of IgG antibodies were analyzed and compared with an immunocompetent cohort. RESULTS. Between May 1, 2020, and March 18, 2021, 168 patients underwent liver or kidney transplantation in our center, of which 11 (6.54%) patients with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. The median interval between SARS-CoV-2 infection and transplantation was 4.5 mo (range, 0.9C11). After a median posttransplant follow-up of 4.9 mo, 10 out of 11 patients were alive without clinical signs of viral shedding or recurrent or active infection. One patient without symptom resolution at time of transplantation died after combined liver-kidney transplantation. In 9 out of 11 patients with previously polymerase chain reaction-confirmed infection, SARS-CoV-2 anti-N and antispike (S) IgG were detectable at day of transplantation. Absolute levels of anti-N and anti-S IgG were positively correlated, declined over time in all patients, and were significantly lower compared with immunocompetent individuals. All patients remained anti-S IgG positive until the last posttransplant follow-up, whereas 3 patients became anti-N negative. CONCLUSIONS. We observed an uncomplicated course of liver or kidney transplantation after SARS-CoV-2 infection in selected patients. Although having lower absolute IgG antibody levels than immunocompetent individuals, all seroconverted patients remained anti-S IgG positive.

It often results in subpar living conditions for a patient as they have to go through expensive and painful treatments to fight this cancer. One in eight women all over the world is affected by this disease. Almost half a million women annually do not survive this fight and die from this disease. Machine learning algorithms have proven to outperform all existing solutions for the prediction of breast cancer using models built on the previously available data. In this paper, a novel approach named BCD-WERT is proposed that utilizes the Extremely Randomized Tree and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for efficient feature selection and classification. WOA reduces the dimensionality of the dataset and extracts the relevant features for accurate classification. Experimental results on state-of-the-art comprehensive dataset demonstrated improved performance in comparison with eight other machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Kernel Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gaussian Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbor. BCD-WERT outperformed all with the highest accuracy rate of 99.30% followed by SVM achieving 98.60% accuracy.

Thlaspi arvense, a close relative of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with worldwide distribution, thrives from sea level to above 4,000 m elevation in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), China. Its strong adaptability renders it an ideal model system for studying plant adaptation in extreme environments. However, how the retrotransposons affect the T. arvense genome evolution and adaptation is largely unknown. We report a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of T. arvense with a scaffold N50 of 59.10 Mb. Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) account for 56.94% of the genome assembly, and the Gypsy superfamily is the most abundant TEs. The amplification of LTR-RTs in the last six million years primarily contributed to the genome size expansion in T. arvense. We identified 351 retrogenes and 303 genes flanked by LTRs, respectively. A comparative analysis showed that orthogroups containing those retrogenes and genes flanked by LTRs have a higher percentage of significantly expanded orthogroups (SEOs), and these SEOs possess more recent tandem duplicated genes. All present results indicate that RNA-based gene duplication (retroduplication) accelerated the subsequent tandem duplication of homologous genes resulting in family expansions, and these expanded gene families were implicated in plant growth, development, and stress responses, which were one of the pivotal factors for T. arvense's adaptation to the harsh environment in the QTP regions. In conclusion, the high-quality assembly of the T. arvense genome provides insights into the retroduplication mediated mechanism of plant adaptation to extreme environments.","output":"Rapid Genome Evolution and Adaptation of Thlaspi arvense Mediated by Recurrent RNA-Based and Tandem Gene Duplications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the early five months of the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, the South Indian state of Kerala regularly appeared in world media, presenting an impactful case of Covid-19 innovations.

Moreover, respiratory samples in viral transport media are the ideal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In early 2021, many clinicians transitioned to antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tests, which use anterior nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection.

Gene expression level is widely accepted as the primary determinant of protein evolutionary rate, because it scales with the extent of selective constraints imposed on a protein, leading to the well-known negative correlation between expression level and protein evolutionary rate (the E-R anticorrelation). Selective constraints have been hypothesized to entail the maintenance of protein function, the avoidance of cytotoxicity caused by protein misfolding or nonspecific protein-protein interactions, or both. However, empirical tests evaluating the relative importance of these hypotheses remain scarce, likely due to the nontrivial difficulties in distinguishing the effect of a deleterious mutation on a protein's function versus its cytotoxicity. We realized that examining the sequence evolution of viral proteins could overcome this hurdle. It is because purifying selection against mutations in a viral protein that result in cytotoxicity per se is likely relaxed, whereas purifying selection against mutations that impair viral protein function persists. Multiple analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and nine other virus species revealed a complete absence of any E-R anticorrelation. As a control, the E-R anticorrelation does exist in human endogenous retroviruses where purifying selection against cytotoxicity is present. Taken together, these observations do not support the maintenance of protein function as the main constraint on protein sequence evolution in cellular organisms.","output":"The Missing Expression Level-Evolutionary Rate Anticorrelation in Viruses Does Not Support Protein Function as a Main Constraint on Sequence Evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused sensation and fear among the world population.

A cross-sectional study was conducted to find out the relationship between study participant characteristics, HBM constructs and unhealthy behavior. Study constructs were assessed on a four point Likert scale and were mean aggregated such that higher scores indicated stronger feelings about a construct. Findings shows that urban poor in the age group 30C40 years were more likely to feel susceptible to contracting Covid-19 (mean score: 2.59 and std. dev. 0.54), they also had a higher perception of the benefit of Covid-19 preventive behaviours than participants in other age groups (mean score: 2.95 and std. dev. 0.71). Also, the most prevalent unhealthy behaviour amongst urban poor residents was the indiscriminate use of facemasks as shown by almost half (47.6%) of participants who agreed that they use facemasks all the time even when alone.

A major unresolved question is whether prior immunity to endemic, human common cold coronaviruses (hCCCoV) impacts susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or immunity following infection and vaccination. Therefore, we analyzed samples from the same individuals before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We found hCCCoV antibody levels increase after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, demonstrating cross-reactivity. However, a case-control study indicates baseline hCCCoV antibody levels are not associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rather, higher magnitudes of pre-existing betacoronavirus antibodies correlate with more SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following infection, an indicator of greater disease severity. Additionally, immunization with hCCCoV spike proteins before SARS-CoV-2 immunization impedes generation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in mice.

Once a model has been calibrated, it can be used as a forecasting tool to make predictions and to evaluate contingency plans. It is customary to employ only point estimators for such predictions. However, some models may fit the same data reasonably well for a broad range of parameter values, and this flexibility means that predictions stemming from such models will vary widely, depending on the particular parameter values employed within the range that give a good fit. When data are poor or incomplete, model uncertainty widens further. A way to circumvent this problem is to use Bayesian statistics to incorporate observations and use the full range of parameter estimates contained in the posterior distribution to adjust for uncertainties in model predictions. Specifically, given the epidemiological model and a probability distribution for observations, we use the posterior distribution of model parameters to generate all possible epidemiological curves via the posterior predictive distribution. From the envelope of all curves one can extract the worst-case scenario and study the impact of implementing contingency plans according to this assessment.

The number of pathogens detected in each specimen by microbial culture method was 2(1, 2), which was significantly less than 2(1,4) by mNGS method (Z=3.359, P<0.01). In 5 specimens, no bacteria were detected by microbial culture method, while bacteria and virus were detected by mNGS method in each 2 specimens. Among the 14 specimens with two or more types of pathogens detected by mNGS method, the relative abundance of bacteria in the first place ranged from 28.8% to 95.9%. Of all the 23 specimens, 7 (30.4%) of the two methods had completely the same results, 5 (21.7%) of the results were completely inconsistent, and 11 (47.8%) of the results were not completely the same. Conclusions: Compared with the traditional microbial culture method, the mNGS method has higher detection sensitivity and stronger ability to detect pathogens, and can determine the main pathogens of mixed infections. As a supplement to the culture method, the mNGS method is expected to play an important role in the diagnosis of burn and acute or chronic wound infection.","output":"[Application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing technology in pathogen detection of burn patients and acute or chronic wound patients]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In article, there are considered results in digitalization wildfire management near smart city within Industry 4.0 period, when while climate change and Covid-19 pandemic.

To cope with those challenges, digital twins that create a digital representation of physical entities by integrating real-time and real-world data seem to be a promising approach. This paper aims to provide an overview of digital twin applications in the food industry and analyze their challenges and potentials. Therefore, a literature review is executed to examine digital twin applications in the food supply chain. The applications found are classified according to a taxonomy and key elements to implement digital twins are identified. Further, the challenges and potentials of digital twin applications in the food industry are discussed. The survey revealed that the application of digital twins mainly targets the production (agriculture) or the food processing stage. Nearly all applications are used for monitoring and many for prediction. However, only a small amount focuses on the integration in systems for autonomous control or providing recommendations to humans. The main challenges of implementing digital twins are combining multidisciplinary knowledge and providing enough data. Nevertheless, digital twins provide huge potentials, e.g., in determining food quality, traceability, or designing personalized foods.","output":"Can a Byte Improve Our Bite?

The effect of these restrictions is unknown, given that beauty services are widely used for stress relief or to enhance confidence. The current study explored the relationship between engagement in appearance-focused behaviors and distress regarding beauty service closure. Participants with high and low levels of dysmorphic concern were compared to determine whether COVID-19 restrictions may affect these groups differently. METHOD: An online survey was completed by 216 participants living in Australia. Questions addressed engagement in appearance-focused behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and attitudes toward beauty service closure. The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire (DCQ) was used to group participants by low and high dysmorphic concern. RESULTS: Appearance-focused behaviors decreased in the low DCQ group (n = 163) during the COVID-19 pandemic, while such behaviors in the high DCQ group (n = 53) remained unchanged. Individuals who were living alone, younger, reported higher dysmorphic concern and greater distress over beauty service closure engaged in more frequent appearance-focused behaviors (R2 = .57, p < .001). The high DCQ group reported greater distress over beauty service closure and increased desire to obtain future beauty treatments. DISCUSSION: While COVID-19 restrictions may have provided a break from societal appearance pressure for those with low dysmorphic concern, appearance-focused behaviors persisted in individuals with high dysmorphic concern. A greater understanding of the long-term impacts on appearance-related distress is needed to determine mental health priorities emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic: Psychological and behavioral responses to the shutdown of the beauty industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The self is a distinct entity from the rest of the world, and actions and sensory feedback are our channels of interaction with the external world. This study examined how the sense of control influences people's perception of sensorimotor input under the framework of categorical perception. Twenty human participants (18 males, two females) took part in both experiments. Experiment 1 showed that the sensitivity (d') of detecting a 20% change in control from no change was higher when the changes occurred at the control-category boundary than within each category. Experiment 2 showed that the control categories greatly affected early attention allocation, even when the judgment of control was unnecessary to the task. Taken together, these results showed that our perceptual and cognitive systems are highly sensitive to small changes in control that build up to a determinant change in the control category within a relatively narrow boundary zone between categories, compared to a continuous, gradual physical change in control.Significance Statement Categorical perception is an important cognitive function that connects human low-level perceptual systems with high-level conceptual systems. Categorical perception has been intensively studied with sensory features (e.g., color and faces), but little is known about sensorimotor information, despite its importance for interacting with the external world. This is the first study to show that individuals perceive their control in meaningful categories rather than via linear encoding. The categorical perception of control diminishes sensitivity to differences within control categories, while increasing sensitivity to sensorimotor inputs at the control-category boundaries. The findings broaden our understanding on how human action influences the perception of action consequences, and how humans organize the external world according to the consequences of their actions.","output":"Categorical perception of control."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"South Africa hosts some of the busiest maritime ports which are gateway ports to several landlocked countries in the region. Road transportation is the main modality for moving goods between seaports and hinterland within South Africa and beyond to at least six landlocked countries in the region. However, the high rate of violent crime against freight trucks and vans has for many years been a major known risk to the road freight transport industry. Traditionally, these crimes have been motivated by monetary proceeds from sales of stolen goods from hijacked vehicles or the vehicles themselves. Recently, however, influenced by anti-immigrant sentiments, similar attacks have been specifically targeting foreign drivers and trucks resulting in death, injury, and damage to vehicles and cargo. Previously considered an internal problem for South Africa as a matter arising from domestic social and economic challenges in that country, the emergence of attacks on foreign drivers and trucks have raised concerns about the future of South Africa as an economic powerhouse, its role as a transit country for landlocked countries, and about its relationship with regional neighbors. For the landlocked countries in the region, any instability in South Africa can have a serious impact on the logistics that sustain businesses and international trade.

Recently, some HFP activities have grown (e.g. gardening), while other activities (e.g. hunting) have become less common in the United States. Anecdotally, COVID-19 has sparked an increase in HFP evidenced by increased hunting licenses and shortages in seeds and canning supplies. HFP may have positive benefits for food security and diet quality, though research beyond gardening is especially limited in high-income countries. METHODS: We examine HFP activities since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and their relationship to food security and dietary quality using multivariable logit models and matching analysis with a statewide representative survey (n = 600) of residents of Vermont, United States. RESULTS: We find 29% of respondent households classified as food insecure since COVID-19, and higher prevalence of food insecurity among those experiencing a negative job change since COVID-19, households earning less than $50,000 annually, Hispanic and multi-race respondents. Nearly 35% of respondents engaged in HFP activities since the COVID-19 pandemic began; the majority of those gardened, and more than half pursued HFP activities more intensely than before the pandemic or for the first time. Food insecure households were more likely to pursue HFP more intensely, including more gardening, fishing, foraging, and hunting. Respondents who were food insecure, Black, Indigenous, People of Color, those with a negative job disruption, and larger households all had greater odds of increased intensity of HFP during the COVID-19 pandemic. HFP was significantly associated with eating greater amounts of fruits and vegetables; however, this effect was only significant for food secure households. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results suggest that HFP activities have increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be an important safety net for food insecure households. However, HFP for food insecure households does not translate into the same higher fruit and vegetable intake as found among food secure HFP households, suggesting this population may be trying to maintain intake, or that they may have potential important resource or technical assistance needs. Long-term, HFP activities may have important food security and diet quality impacts, as well as conservation implications, which should be more thoroughly explored. Regardless, the increased interest and intensity of HFP demonstrates opportunities for educational and outreach efforts.","output":"Home food procurement impacts food security and diet quality during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Complexities of virus genotypes and the stochastic contacts in human society create a big challenge for estimating the potential risks of exposure to a widely spreading virus such as COVID-19. To increase public awareness of exposure risks in daily activities, we propose a birthday-paradox-based probability model to implement in a web-based system, named COSRE (community social risk estimator) and make in-time community exposure risk estimation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We define exposure risk to mean the probability of people meeting potential cases in public places such as grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, offices, etc. Our model has three inputs: the real-time number of active and asymptomatic cases, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the room. With COSRE, possible impacts of the pandemic can be explored through spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., a variable number of people may be projected into public places through time to assess changes of risk as the pandemic unfolds. The system has potential to advance understanding of the true exposure risks in various communities. It introduces an objective element to plan, prepare and respond during a pandemic. Spatial analysis tools are used to draw county-level exposure risks of the United States from April 1 to July 15, 2020. The correlation experiment with the new cases in the next two weeks shows that the risk estimation model offers promise in assisting people to be more precise about their personal safety and control of daily routine and social interaction.

A subset of these patients developed refractory hypoxaemia despite maximal conventional mechanical ventilation and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This review focuses on considerations for ventilatory strategies, infection control and patient selection related to ECMO for ARDS in a pandemic. We also summarise the experiences with ECMO in previous respiratory pandemics. METHODS: A review of pertinent studies was conducted via a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar. References of articles were also examined to identify other relevant publications. RESULTS: Since the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009, the use of ECMO for ARDS continues to grow despite limitations in evidence for survival benefit. There is emerging evidence to suggest that lung protective ventilation for ARDS can be further optimised while receiving ECMO so as to minimise ventilator-induced lung injury and subsequent contributions to multi-organ failure. Efforts to improve outcomes should also encompass appropriate infection control measures to reduce co-infections and prevent nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses. Patient selection for ECMO in a pandemic can be challenging. We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimise resource allocation. CONCLUSION: The role of ECMO in managing ARDS during respiratory pandemics continues to grow. This is supported by efforts to redefine optimal ventilatory strategies, reinforce infection control measures and enhance patient selection.","output":"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Respiratory Failure During Respiratory Epidemics and Pandemics: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Contemporary societies lack direct evidence that diversity of neuro-origin psychological traits C neurodiversity C benefits the human species.

COVID-19 amplified those concerns, and an examination of recommendations to manage COVID-19 may shed light on the future of AL. This review summarizes recommendations from 6 key organizations related to preparation for and response to COVID-19 in AL in relation to resident health and quality of life; compares recommendations for AL with those for nursing homes (NHs); and assesses implications for the future of AL. DESIGN: Nonsystematic review involving search of gray literature. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Recommendations from key governmental bodies and professional societies regarding COVID-19 in AL, long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in general, and NHs. MEASURES: We collected, categorized, and summarized these recommendations as they pertained to quality of life and health care. RESULTS: Many recommendations for AL and NHs were similar, but differences provided insight into ways the pandemic was recognized and challenged AL communities in particular: recommending more flexible visitation and group activities for AL, providing screening by AL staff or an outside provider, and suggesting that AL staff access resources to facilitate advance care planning discussions. Recommendations were that AL integrate health care into offered services, including working with consulting clinicians who know both the residents and the LTC community. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Long-term care providers and policy makers have recognized the need to modify current long-term care options.

Our studies, therefore, provide initial insights into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 as a neurotropic virus and emphasize that brain organoids could model CNS pathologies of COVID-19.

Current evidence suggests that vertical transmission from mother to baby, antenatally or intrapartum, does occur, but is uncommon. According to the published reports of infants born to COVID-19-affected mothers, as well as the anecdotal experience of current practices worldwide, it appears that investigations regarding the potential of SARS-COV-2 vertical transmission in pregnancy have so far been based, to a large extent, on PCR testing of neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. Given that the transplacental route of intrauterine transmission for SARS-COV-2 is less likely to immediately involve the upper respiratory tract of the newborn, contrary to what happens after birth, it would be advisable to include appropriate biological samples, such as cord blood, placenta, amniotic fluid and neonatal blood, along with the pharyngeal samples, in order to contribute significantly to such investigations. It is important to point out that negative PCR tests of neonatal pharyngeal samples do not exclude the possibility of intrauterine viral transmission, while positive pharyngeal swabs are more likely to reflect intrapartum or postpartum contaminants, rather than antenatal intrauterine transmission, in the absence of other criteria. Revision and enhancement of the so far prevailing practices appear important, in order to facilitate the development of good clinical practice for managing neonates and ensuring safety of families and healthcare providers.","output":"Pharyngeal sampling for PCR-testing in the investigation of SARS-COV-2 vertical transmission in pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, medical education migrated to digital environments, without clear guidelines for virtual courses or evaluations of how these courses have been developed.

COVID-19 has been the major global health crisis of our time with high psychosocial impact. Vaginismus is a form of female sexual dysfunction and a subset of genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder in which any form of vaginal penetration is painful or impossible. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function of women treated for vaginismus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All women treated using dilators between 2018C2019 were included. Data obtained 3 months after comfortable penetration and during the pandemic via telephone interview were compared. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Golombok-Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to evaluate sexual function and depression. Frequency of sexual intercourse and pain was compared using a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Seventy-seven women were included. Mean duration of treatment and number of treatment sessions were 3.5  2.6 months and 4.2  2.6, respectively. There were significant improvements in the FSFI desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain subscales and total score and in the GRISS infrequency, noncommunication, avoidance, non-sensuality, and vaginismus subscales and total score during the pandemic. The GRISS dissatisfaction and anorgasmia subscales and BDI score significantly worsened. Mean frequency of sexual intercourse was 2.3  1.8/week and did not change significantly. Pain scores decreased during the pandemic (2.7  2.8) compared to post-treatment (6.2  2.9). CONCLUSION: Although frequency of sexual intercourse was not affected and pain scores and FSFI total and subscale scores improved, satisfaction and orgasm were adversely affected, which may be attributed to increased stress and anxiety during the pandemic.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures on the sexual functions of women treated for vaginismus (genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The oncogene Myc is deregulated in the majority of human tumors and drives numerous hallmarks of cancer.

The debate was dominated by utility-based arguments for saving the most lives or life-years. These arguments were tempered by equity-based concerns that triage based solely on prognosis would exacerbate existing health inequities, leaving disadvantaged patients worse off. Central to this debate was the assumption that ICU admission is a valuable but scarce resource in the pandemic context.In this paper, we argue that the concern about achieving equity in ICU triage is problematic for two reasons. First, ICU can be futile and prolong or exacerbate suffering rather than ameliorate it. This may be especially true in patients with COVID-19 with emerging data showing that most who receive access to a ventilator will still die. There is no value in admitting patients with poor prognostic indicators to ICU to meet an equity target when intensive critical care is contrary to their best interests. Second, the focus on ICU admission shifts focus away from important aspects of COVID-19 care where there is greater opportunity for mitigating suffering and enhancing equitable care.We propose that the focus on equity concerns during the pandemic should broaden to include providing all people who need it with access to the highest possible standard of end-of-life care. This requires attention to culturally safe care in the following interlinked areas: palliative care, communication and decision support and advanced care planning.","output":"Revisiting the equity debate in COVID-19: ICU is no panacea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An efficient mechanism for the sequence\\\\specific inhibition of gene expression is RNA interference.

METHODS: We assess respiratory needs over the course of mild, moderate and severe epidemic scenarios within Singapore as a case study using a transmission dynamic model. The number of respirators required within the respiratory isolation wards and intensive care units was estimated over the course of the epidemic. We also considered single-use, extended-use and prolonged-use strategies for N95 respirators for use by healthcare workers treating suspected but negative (misclassified) or confirmed COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Depending on the confirmed to misclassified case ratio, from 1:0 to 1:10, a range of 117.1 million to 1.1 billion masks are required for single-use. This decreases to 71.6C784.4 million for extended-use and 12.8C148.2 million for prolonged-use, representing a 31.8C38.9% and 86.5C89.1% reduction, respectively.

However, this phenomenon demands attention also in areas where media and patients were focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, but the healthcare system was not overwhelmed by the huge number of COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this observational study, we compared the incidence rate of all consecutive STEMI patients admitted at the University Hospital of Trieste, Italy, during March and April 2020 with the same 2 months of the previous 5 years (2015-2019). Patient characteristics were compared between 2020 and 2019.The incidence rate of STEMI admission in March-April 2020 was lower than those in March-April 2015-2019, 36 vs. 56 cases per 100a000ainhabitants/year [relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.42-0.96, Pa=a0.045]. Considering that the incidence rates were constant in the past years (Pa=a0.24), the turnaround in 2020 is most likely due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Interestingly, this reduction was a dynamic phenomenon with a U-shaped curve during the 2-month period. System-of-care times were similar between 2020 and 2019; however in 2020, patients presented more frequently signs of heart failure compared to 2019 (Killip class &#8805;2 in 68% vs. 29%, Pa=a0.003). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a marked reduction in the STEMI incidence rate. This U-shaped phenomenon demands attention because a potential cause for the decrease in STEMI incidence may include the avoidance of medical care. Public campaigns aiming to increase awareness of ischemic symptoms may be needed during community outbreak.","output":"COVID-19 impact on ST-elevation myocardial infarction incidence rate in a north-eastern Italian STEMI network: a U-shaped curve phenomenon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays Sustainability is a huge issue.

Data on LTx in ALF is limited to LTx outcomes, and the unpredictable course of SARS-CoV-2 makes candidate selection challenging. This study summarizes our experiences, in both patients transplanted and those we declined. Methods LTx referrals for ALF due to SARS-CoV-2 between 01Apr20-01Oct21 were reviewed. Set parameters were collected prospectively. Acceptance criteria reflected previous guidance. Cases were discussed at our multi-disciplinary meeting and suitable candidates evaluated at source before transfer for consent and listing. Internal follow-up and external data from declined patients were retrospectively analysed, with survival to discharge and length of hospital stay as end-points. Results 45 patients were referred (78% male). Median age was 55.8 [IQR 47.6-59.8] years. 36 (80%) required both mechanical ventilation and vvECMO, of median duration 46 [31-82] and 34 [24-72] days respectively. Consolidation was the commonest CT finding (47%). Bacterial colonisation (23/45, 51%), coagulopathy (21/45, 47%) and hepatic dysfunction (11/45, 24%) were common. Twenty-two patients were conscious, of whom 21 were evaluated. Five patients died during evaluation, from either sepsis or bleeding. One failed evaluation, and one withdrew consent. Six patients improved, making urgent LTx unnecessary, with 5 attending our review clinic. Of the 8 patients successfully evaluated, one died unexpectantly awaiting transfer, one improved at listing and a further patient died of sepsis after listing. Three patients underwent LTx, all being discharged home at 3 months post-LTx. Conclusion LTx candidate selection in critically ill SARS-CoV2 patients is challenging. Late recovery, particularly in non-fibrotic ALF is not unusual. Decision-making needs to include acceptable morbidity as a prelude to delayed evaluation and perhaps listing. More data is needed about declined candidates, particularly unweanable sedated patients with single-organ failure. Even successful awake recipients may experience significant psychological injury, underlining previous arguments in sedated patients.

The pulmonary examination was remarkable for bilateral crepitation. On blood workup, there was leukocytosis and raised c-reactive protein (CRP). D-dimer, ferritin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), vitamin B12, and hypercoagulability workup were normal. Transthoracic echocardiography was also normal. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the virus. Chest x-ray showed infiltrations in the left middle and both lower zones of the lungs in the peripheral distribution. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed peripheral and mid to basal predominant multilobar ground-glass opacities. CT scan of the head showed a large hypodense area, with a loss of gray and white matter differentiation, in the left middle cerebral artery territory.

The data collected for the patients included demographics, comorbidities and laboratory values taken at admission and throughout the course of hospitalization. We trained multivariate Markov prognostic models to identify high-risk patients at admission along with a dynamic measure of risk incorporating time-dependent changes in patients' laboratory values. From the set of factors available upon admission, the Markov model determined that age >80 years, history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased mortality risk.

Incorporating dynamic changes in lab values throughout hospitalization lead to dramatic gains in the predictive accuracy of the model and indicated a catalogue of variables for determining high-risk patients including eosinophil percentage, white blood cells (WBC), platelets, pCO2, RDW, large unstained cells (LUC) count, alkaline phosphatase and albumin. Our prognostic model highlights the nuance of determining risk for COVID-19 patients and indicates that, rather than a single variable, a range of factors (at different points in hospitalization) are needed for effective risk stratification.","output":"A Dynamic Bayesian Model for Identifying High-Mortality Risk in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The Coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has put the healthcare services all over the world into a challenging situation.

In India, the Rotavirus Vaccine (RVV) (2019) and the fractionated injectable polio vaccine (f-IPV) (2016) are more prone to wastage with high procurement costs. In this operational research study, we determined the effectiveness of a (self-designed) dose based reporting tool (DBRT) in reducing vaccine (f-IPV and RVV) wastage at primary care facilities in India during December 2019 to March' 2020. Data reports of all the immunization sessions conducted at three primary care facilities were analyzed to calculate the wastage rates of the RVV and the f-IPV for the following periods: (1). Period of initiation (August-November' 2019) (2). Pre-intervention with sensitization of healthcare providers (December' 2019-January' 2020) (3). Post-intervention after application of the DBRT. Intervention: The DBRT is a paper-based reporting format that assigns a unique code to each RVV and IPV vial. The health facility is required to report the total doses administered from each coded vial during every immunization session by updating it on the assigned reporting format. Pre-intervention, the average monthly wastage of f-IPV was 23.5% and of the RVV ranged from 18%-31%. Post-intervention, on using the DBRT, the monthly wastage of both RVV and f-IPV dropped significantly to 8.6% and 11.4%, respectively. During the subsequent month, the IPV wastage further decreased to only 4.7%. In conclusion, the DBRT reduces vaccine wastage in government primary care facilities by enabling a paper audit trail that promotes responsiveness and accountability among healthcare workers directly involved in vaccine administration.","output":"The effectiveness of a dose based reporting tool in reducing vaccine wastage at primary care clinics in Delhi, India: an operational research study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aconitine (ACO), a main active ingredient of Aconitum, is well-known for its cardiotoxicity. However, the mechanisms of toxic action of ACO remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated the cardiac effects of ACO and mesaconitine (MACO), a structurally related analog of ACO identified in Aconitum with undocumented cardiotoxicity in guinea pigs. We showed that intravenous administration of ACO or MACO (25 g/kg) to guinea pigs caused various types of arrhythmias in electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, including ventricular premature beats (VPB), atrioventricular blockade (AVB), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). MACO displayed more potent arrhythmogenic effect than ACO. We conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recording in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, and observed that treatment with ACO (0.3, 3 M) or MACO (0.1, 0.3 M) depolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP) and reduced the action potential amplitude (APA) and durations (APDs) in a concentration-dependent manner. The ACO- and MACO-induced AP remodeling was largely abolished by an INa blocker tetrodotoxin (2 M) and partly abolished by a specific Na+/K+ pump (NKP) blocker ouabain (0.1 M). Furthermore, we observed that treatment with ACO or MACO attenuated NKP current (INa/K) and increased peak INa by accelerating the sodium channel activation with the EC50 of 8.36  1.89 and 1.33  0.16 M, respectively. Incubation of ventricular myocytes with ACO or MACO concentration-dependently increased intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates strong arrhythmogenic effects of ACO and MACO resulted from increasing the peak INa via accelerating sodium channel activation and inhibiting the INa/K. These results may help to improve our understanding of cardiotoxic mechanisms of ACO and MACO, and identify potential novel therapeutic targets for Aconitum poisoning.","output":"Inhibition of the INa/K and the activation of peak INa contribute to the arrhythmogenic effects of aconitine and mesaconitine in guinea pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: This investigation explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and following alert levels on pets in New Zealand. Pet owners were surveyed during the last week of the first Alert Level 4 lockdown (highest level of restrictions) and then three months later during Alert Level 1 (lowest level of restrictions). During lockdown, just over half of those surveyed thought that their pets wellbeing was better than usual, and most owners could list at least one benefit of lockdown for their pets. These included more company, play and exercise. Owners expressed that they were concerned about their pets wellbeing after lockdown, with pets missing company/attention and separation anxiety being major themes. The Alert Level 1 survey indicated that owners continued to play with their pets more but that higher levels of exercise were not maintained. Just over one-third of owners took steps to prepare their pets to transition out of lockdown. The results indicate that pets may have enjoyed improved welfare during lockdown due to the possibility of increased human-pet interaction. The steps taken by owners to prepare animals for a return to normal life may enhance pet wellbeing long-term if maintained. ABSTRACT: The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on human-pet interactions within New Zealand, particularly during lockdown, was investigated via two national surveys. In Survey 1, pet owners (n = 686) responded during the final week of the five-week Alert Level 4 lockdown (highest level of restrictionsApril 2020), and survey 2 involved 498 respondents during July 2020 whilst at Alert Level 1 (lowest level of restrictions). During the lockdown, 54.7% of owners felt that their pets wellbeing was better than usual, while only 7.4% felt that it was worse. Most respondents (84.0%) could list at least one benefit of lockdown for their pets, and they noted pets were engaged with more play (61.7%) and exercise (49.7%) than pre-lockdown. Many respondents (40.3%) expressed that they were concerned about their pets wellbeing after lockdown, with pets missing company/attention and separation anxiety being major themes. In Survey 2, 27.9% of respondents reported that they continued to engage in increased rates of play with their pets after lockdown, however, the higher levels of pet exercise were not maintained. Just over one-third (35.9%) of owners took steps to prepare their pets to transition out of lockdown. The results indicate that pets may have enjoyed improved welfare during lockdown due to the possibility of increased human-pet interaction.

Design, setting, and participants: We conducted a vaccine booster study built on a single-center, randomized, double-blind phase 1/2 trial of the two-dose schedule of CoronaVac among healthy adults[]60 years in Hebei, China. We examined neutralizing antibody titres six months or more after the second dose in all participants. We provided a third dose to 303 participants recruited in phase 2 trial to assess their immune responses. InterventionsTwo formulations (3 g, and 6 g) were used in phase 1 trial, and an additional formulation of 1.5 g was used in phase 2 trial. All participants were given two doses 28 days apart and followed up 6 months after the second dose. Participants in phase 2 received a third dose 8 months after the second dose. Main outcomes and measuresGeometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 and adverse events were assessed at multiple time points following vaccination. ResultsNeutralizing antibody titres dropped below the seropositive cutoff of 8 at 6 months after the primary vaccination in all vaccine groups in the phase 1/2 trial. A third dose given 8 months or more after the second dose significantly increased neutralizing antibody levels. In the 3 g group (the licensed formulation), GMT increased to 305 [95%CI 215.3-432.0] on day 7 following the third dose, an approximately 7-fold increase compared with the GMT 28 days after the second dose.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four medical students were recruited to serve as novice users. Following brief, standardized training, students executed endotracheal intubation with the King Vision(?), Macintosh and VividTrac(?) laryngoscopes, on a cardiopulmonary resuscitation trainer in normal and difficult airway scenarios. We evaluated the time to and proportion of successful intubation, the best view of the glottis, esophageal intubation, dental trauma and user satisfaction. RESULTS: In the normal airway scenario, significantly shorter intubation times were achieved using the King Vision(?) than the Macintosh laryngoscope. In the difficult airway scenario, we found that the VividTrac(?) was superior to the King Vision(?) and Macintosh laryngoscopes in the laryngoscopy time. In both scenarios, we noted no difference in the first-attempt success rate, but the best view of the glottis and dental trauma, esophageal intubation and bougie use were more frequent with the Macintosh laryngoscope than with the videolaryngoscopes.

Due to nosocomial spread of infection and the variable incubation period with the virus, follow-up past 30 days after injury is required to evaluate the true mortality amongst these patients. We aim to assess 120-day mortality rates in hip fracture patients with COVID-19 infection and compare this to hip fracture patients without COVID-19 infection presenting during the same time period. METHODS: This is a retrospective multicenter review of all patients aged  60 years admitted with a fractured neck of femur between March 5 and April 5, 2020, at nine U.K. trauma units. COVID-19 status, demographic data, comorbidities, and date of death (if applicable) were collected. RESULTS: Data were collected for 265 hip fracture patients. Forty-six patients (17.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 infection. There were no significant differences in age or Charlson comorbidity score between those with or without COVID-19. Those with COVID-19 infection were more likely to be male (p = 0.01). Patients with COVID-19 had a 30-day mortality of 35% versus 10% in patients without (p < 0.01). One hundred twenty-day mortality was also greater in those with COVID-19 infection at 63% compared to those without at 17% (p < 0.01).

To characterize the stabilization achievable through structure design, we compare optimization of AUP by conventional mRNA design methods to results from the LinearDesign algorithm, a new Monte Carlo tree search algorithm called RiboTree, and crowdsourcing through the OpenVaccine challenge on the Eterna platform. Tests were carried out on mRNAs encoding nanoluciferase, green fluorescent protein, and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidates encoding SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, spike receptor binding domain, and full-length spike protein. We find that Eterna and RiboTree significantly lower AUP while maintaining a large diversity of sequence and structure features that correlate with translation, biophysical size, and immunogenicity. Our results suggest that increases in in vitro mRNA half-life by at least two-fold are immediately achievable and that further stability improvements may be enabled with thorough experimental characterization of RNA hydrolysis.","output":"Theoretical basis for stabilizing messenger RNA through secondary structure design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Treatment with bone-seeking radionuclides may provide palliation from pain originating from bone metastases.

We reformulate and solve the DICE model as an optimal control dynamic programming problem with six state variables (related to the carbon concentration, temperature, and economic capital) evolving over time deterministically and affected by two controls (carbon emission mitigation rate and consumption). We then extend the model by adding a discrete stochastic shock variable to model the economy in the stressed and normal regimes as a jump process caused by events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These shocks reduce the world gross output leading to a reduction in both the world net output and carbon emission. The extended model is solved under several scenarios as an optimal stochastic control problem, assuming that the shock events occur randomly on average once every 100 years and last for 5 years. The results show that, if the world gross output recovers in full after each event, the impact of the COVID-19 events on the temperature and carbon concentration will be immaterial even in the case of a conservative 10% drop in the annual gross output over a 5-year period. The impact becomes noticeable, although still extremely small (long-term temperature drops by [Formula: see text] ), in a presence of persistent shocks of a 5% output drop propagating to the subsequent time periods through the recursively reduced productivity. If the deterministic DICE model policy is applied in a presence of stochastic shocks (i.e., when this policy is suboptimal), then the drop in temperature is larger (approximately [Formula: see text] ), that is, the lower economic activities owing to shocks imply that more ambitious mitigation targets are now feasible at lower costs.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 type events on the economy and climate under the stochastic DICE model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper seeks to deal with the advance of Covid-19 in indigenous territories in Brazil, whether urban or rural.

This study aimed to describe GE and RTI outbreaks with infection and all-cause lethality rates according to the individual characteristics of nursing home residents. METHODS: Clinical and virological surveillance were conducted (2007 to 2018). Virus stratifications for the analysis were: outbreaks with positive norovirus or influenza identifications (respectively NoV+ or Flu+), episodes with no NoV or influenza identification or testing (respectively NoV- or Flu-). Associations between individual variables (sex, age, length of stay (LOS), autonomy status) and infection and lethality rates were tested with univariate and Mantel-Haenszel (MH) methods. RESULTS: 61 GE outbreaks and 76 RTI oubreaks (total 137 outbreaks) were recorded involving respectively 4309 and 5862 residents. In univariate analysis, higher infection rates and age were associated in NoV+, NoV-, and Flu+ contexts, and lower infection rates were associated with longer stays (NoV+ and NoV-). In MH stratified analysis (virus, sex (female/male)) adjusted for LOS (<4 or 4 years), the odds of being infected remained significant among older residents (86 years): NoV+/male (Odds ratio (OR(MH)): 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16C2.30) and Flu+/female and male (respectively OR(MH): 1.50, CI: 1.27C1.79 and 1.73, CI: 1.28C2.33). In univariate analysis, lower autonomy status (NoV+, Flu+ and Flu-) and increased age (Flu+) were associated with higher lethality. In MH adjusted analysis, significant OR(age) adjusted for autonomy was: Flu+/ 86 years compared with <86 years, 1.97 (1.19C3.25) and OR(autonomy) adjusted for age for the more autonomous group (compared with the less autonomous group) was: Flu+, 0.41 (0.24C0.69); Flu-, 0.42 (0.20, 0.90).

Many acute pediatric conditions can be managed safely and effectively through telehealth especially when remote physical exam equipment is used. Telehealth can also be especially useful in medical care of children with medical complexity. Traveling with medical equipment to multiple subspecialists can be incredibly challenging and often a similar quality visit can be conducted through telehealth in the comfort of a child's home environment.

AREAS COVERED This short review focuses on fluorescent quantum dot-based modeling of SARS-CoV-2. New BSL-2 viral models are essential to find small molecules and biologics that may be effective in stopping viral infection as well as treating already infected individuals. Nanoparticles are invaluable tools for biological research as they can be used to both modeling pathogens and serve as a platform for developing vaccines. EXPERT OPINION Visualizing viral activity with fluorescent quantum dots enables both biochemical and cell-based assays to detect virus-host receptor interactions, cellular activity after binding to cell plasma membrane, screening for interventions using small molecule drug repurposing, and testing of novel biologics.

We report that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1, which activates the small GTPase Arf1 to induce COPI transport processes, is required for rotavirus replication since knocking down GBF1 expression by RNA interference, or inhibiting its activity by treatment with Brefeldin A (BFA) or Golgicide A (GCA) significantly reduce the yield of infectious viral progeny. This reduction in virus yield was related to a block in virus assembly since in the presence of either BFA or GCA the assembly of infectious mature triple-layered virions was significantly prevented and only doubled layered-particles were detected. We report that the catalytic activity of GBF1, but not the activation of Arf1, is essential for the assembly of the outer capsid of rotavirus. We show that both BFA and GCA, as well as interfering with the synthesis of GBF1, alter the electrophoretic mobility of glycoproteins VP7 and NSP4 and block the trimerization of the virus surface VP7, a step required for its incorporation into virus particles. Although a post-translational modification of VP7 (other than glycosylation) could be related to the lack of trimerization, we found that NSP4 might also be involved in this process, since knocking-down its expression reduces VP7 trimerizarion. In support, recombinant VP7 protein overexpressed in transfected cells formed trimers only when co-transfected with NSP4.IMPORTANCERotavirus, a member of the family Reoviridae, is the major cause of severe diarrhea in children and young animals worldwide. Despite the significant advances in the characterization of the biology of this virus, the mechanisms involved in morphogenesis of the virus particle are still poorly understood.

A significant driving factor in the significant reduction in travel in the US was the declaration of varying state-, county-, and city-level stay-at-home orders with varying degrees of reduction. However, it is still not clear how significantly any one of those orders contributed to the reduction in travel. This article looks at continuous count data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, area to quantify the disruption in terms of reductions in traffic volume as well as the abnormality of the disruption to travel patterns. A nearly 50% reduction in total traffic volume is found, and regional trends both in reductions and the gradual recovery toward normal travel patterns are identified. Furthermore, key dates are identified that led to significant reductions in travel, and this disruptive event is compared with other significantly disruptive events in Minnesota for context. It is found that although the stay-at-home order was a significant milestone in the fight against COVID-19, traffic volumes had already reduced significantly before the order went into effect, and traffic volumes had recovered significantly before the order expired.

As India is ushering towards \\"Digital India\\" it becomes essential for the government to embrace the cloud to enhance governance and meet the citizen expectations. This paper aims to discuss the evolution of cloud computing (Meghraj) in government organizations by examining the various information technology (IT) and cloud policies, thereby focusing on the policy gaps. The second part of this study assesses the cloud adoption trend by analyzing adopted cloud services, deployments models, leading sectors in cloud adoption and cloud approach. Eventually, in consultation with experts, a conceptual framework for cloud adoption in the government organizations of India is developed for wider cloud adoption. Design/methodology/approach The authors reviewed various IT/cloud policies and related literature to find the policy gaps for slow cloud adoption in government organizations. Authors have researched to collect the data from the various government procurement portals and analysed the tender and contracts of 500 organizations for cloud requirements to infer the cloud adoption trends. Based on the review of policy gaps, adoption trends and by consulting the experts a conceptual cloud adoption framework has been developed for wider cloud adoption in government organizations. Findings This study can be a pathfinder where the most innovative findings are about the cloud adoption trends in the government organizations in the time frame from 2013 till 2020. Several key findings are - the public cloud are the most widely adopted, infrastructure as a service model is the most used services, the majority of the applications migrating to the cloud are legacy applications, the leading sector in cloud adoption are - IT, transport and education. It is observed that the pandemic Covid-19 has acted as a catalyst and accelerated cloud adoption in government organizations. Eventually, a conceptual cloud adoption framework has been suggested addressing the policy gaps, deficiencies, overcoming the gaps and their related outcomes for the wider cloud adoption in the government organizations. Practical implications The findings of this work highlight the cloud adoption trends in government organizations which can prove vital to the policymakers. This work will assist policymakers, government organizations, researchers, IT professionals and others interested in analyzing the state of cloud adoption. The conceptual cloud adoption framework developed endeavours to uncover the policy gaps, suggest the gap resolution mechanism and outcomes which may assist the organization for wider cloud adoption. This research work effectively connects the policies to practice by stimulating the interest in understanding the policies, strategies and thereby creating the enabling environment for cloud adoption. This study provides feedback on cloud adoption trends which can assist in policy refinement and further strengthen policy/strategies. Originality/value As of date, there is limited data available for cloud adoption in government organizations.

Some genetic and environmental factors contribute to the promotion of the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, there are no effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. It has been revealed that bidirectional communication exists between the brain and the gut. The gut microbiota is a changeable and experience-dependent ecosystem and can be modified by genetic and environmental factors. The gut microbiota provides potential therapeutic targets that can be regulated as new interventions for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss genetic and environmental risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, summarize the communication among the components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and discuss the treatment strategy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT is a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and restoration of the gut microbiota to a premorbid state is a novel goal for prevention and treatment strategies.","output":"Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases and promising therapeutic intervention via fecal microbiota transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective is to improve the prediction accuracy of foundation pit deformation in geotechnical engineering, thereby provide early warning for engineering practice. The digital close-range photogrammetry is used to obtain monitoring data. The error compensation method is used to optimize the center of the monitoring point. Aiming at the limitations of back propagation neural network (BPNN), a genetic algorithm (GA)-optimized BPNN algorithm is proposed. Then, the optimized algorithm is applied to predict the deformation and displacement of foundation pits from three aspects, i.e., simple horizontal displacement, simple longitudinal displacement, and the combination of horizontal and longitudinal displacements. Meanwhile, the time domain, space domain, and time-space domain are used as input features to compare the prediction results of the BPNN model and the GA-optimized BPNN model. Finally, the GA-improved BPNN is compared with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model and Random Forest (RF) model. The results show that the prediction result, obtained by simultaneously using horizontal displacement and longitudinal displacement as input features, has smaller errors; also, the actual output is closer to the expected output. Compared with the prediction result with time domain and space domain as input features, the prediction result with time-space domain as input features is closer to the expected output. Taking the combination of time and space domains as input features, compared with the BPNN model, the GA-optimized BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0163), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9800), and a shorter training time (7.08 s). Compared with the SVR model and RF model, the GA-improved BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0211), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9706), and shorter training time (7.61 s). Therefore, the foundation pit deformation prediction model based on BPNN and GA has strong prediction ability, which can be popularized and applied in similar geotechnical engineering.","output":"The deformation monitoring of foundation pit by back propagation neural network and genetic algorithm and its application in geotechnical engineering."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides a rapid assessment method of potentially infectious waste flow related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Romania focusing on the emergency state (from 16 March to 14 May 2020) where a national lockdown was in force with restrictive and social distancing measures concerning population mobility and economic activities. Medical and municipal waste management systems are critical services in combating the virus spread in the community. This assessment is useful due to poor available data of medical waste flow in environmental reports and it covers COVID-19 patients, quarantined, and self-isolated persons as the main potential infectious waste sources. The proposed model estimates that COVID-19 related waste flow is 4312 t at the national level from 25 February to 15 June of which 2633 t in the emergency state period. This assessment is correlated with deficiencies of medical and municipal waste management systems in Romania before the COVID-19 pandemic as stress factors of public health and environment. This study points out the main challenges of waste operators and reveals some best practices during this pandemic crisis. Based on the results and discussion section, several recommendations are proposed to COVID-19 waste-related issues and points out the crucial role of the reliable medical and municipal waste database in managing such biologic hazards at national and EU levels.

We hypothesized that the association of inflammation with mortality was different by type 2 diabetes status. METHODS: A case-control (died-survived) study of 538 COVID-19 hospitalized patients, stratified by diabetes status, was conducted at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. We quantified the levels of eight cytokines and chemokines in serum, including interferon(IFN)-2, IFN-, Interleukin(IL)-1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, IFN-induced protein 10 (IP10)/CXCL10 and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) using immunoassays. Logistic regression models were used to model the relationships of log-transformed inflammatory markers (or their principal components) and mortality. RESULTS: In multiple logistic regression models, higher serum levels of IL-6 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR):1.74, 95% confidence intervals (CI): (1.48, 2.06)), IL-8 (aOR: 1.75 (1.41, 2.19)) and IP10 (aOR: 1.36 (1.24, 1.51)), were significantly associated with mortality. This association was also seen in second principal component (PC) with loadings reflecting similarities among these three markers (aOR: 1.88 (1.54-2.31)). Significant positive association of these same inflammatory markers with mortality was also observed within each strata of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: We show that mortality in COVID19 patients is associated with elevated serum levels of innate inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and inflammatory chemokines IL-8 and IP10. This relationship is consistent across strata of diabetes, suggesting interventions targeting these innate immune pathways could potentially also benefit patients with diabetes.","output":"Inflammation and mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients with and without type 2 diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of seventeen hitherto unknown ANP analogs bearing the (E)-but-2-enyl aliphatic side chain and modified heterocyclic base such as cytosine and 5-fluorocytosine, 2-pyrazinecarboxamide, 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide or 4-substituted-1,2,3-triazoles were prepared in a straight approach through an olefin acyclic cross metathesis as key synthetic step.

This problem poses a threat to healthcare workers, first responders, and the public, which demands solutions that can span the gap between institutional shortages and resupplies. Objectives: To examine the efficacy of autoclave-based decontamination for the reuse of single-use surgical masks and N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs). This method is the most readily available form of decontamination in the hospital and laboratory settings. Methods: Three models of N95 FFRs and two procedural masks were evaluated in this study. A moist heat autoclave using four different autoclave cycles: 115C for one hour, 121.1C for 30 minutes, 130C for two minutes, and 130C for four minutes was used. After the autoclave process, the FFRs were NIOSH fit tested and particle counting was performed for both coarse particles of 5 micrometers (M) and fine particles from 0.1M to 1.0M. Results: We observed negligible alterations in the functionality and integrity of 3M 1805 and 3M 1870/1870+ N95 FFRs after three autoclave cycles. Surgical masks also showed minimal changes in functionality and integrity. The 3M 1860 FFR failed fit test after a single autoclave decontamination cycle. Discussion and Conclusion: The study finds that specific surgical masks and N95 FFR models can withstand autoclave decontamination for up to three cycles.

A three part review series has been developed focusing on calf health from birth to weaning. In this paper, the last of the three part series, we review disease prevention and management with particular reference to pneumonia, focusing primarily on the pre-weaned calf. Pneumonia in recently weaned suckler calves is also considered, where the key risk factors are related to the time of weaning. Weaning of the suckler calf is often combined with additional stressors including a change in nutrition, environmental change, transport and painful husbandry procedures (castration, dehorning). The reduction of the cumulative effects of these multiple stressors around the time of weaning together with vaccination programmes (preconditioning) can reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality in the feedlot. In most studies, calves housed individually and calves housed outdoors with shelter, are associated with decreased risk of disease. Even though it poses greater management challenges, successful group housing of calves is possible. Special emphasis should be given to equal age groups and to keeping groups stable once they are formed. The management of pneumonia in calves is reliant on a sound understanding of aetiology, relevant risk factors, and of effective approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Early signs of pneumonia include increased respiratory rate and fever, followed by depression. The single most important factor determining the success of therapy in calves with pneumonia is early onset of treatment, and subsequent adequate duration of treatment. The efficacy and economical viability of vaccination against respiratory disease in calves remains unclear.","output":"Calf health from birth to weaning.

The extent to which special tailoring to the addressed subjects would be helpful in improving the effectiveness of prevention measures is unknown. Therefore, the goal of this systematic review is to assess gender-specific differences in primary prevention actions. SUBJECT AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in 2015 by searching the PubMed (Medline) and Cochrane Library databases as well as adding additional studies by cross-referencing. The search focused on studies with an analysis of gender differences in health and risk behavior concerning primary prevention. Therefore, major exclusion criteria were single-gender studies, underage (<18 years) study collectives and secondary or tertiary prevention measures. RESULTS: In total, 23 studies from 13 different countries were included in the qualitative evaluation. The studies covered 11 different subtopics of primary prevention, but were too diverse in content and type to draw many fundamental conclusions. A meta-analysis was not possible. Generally a tendency for females to be more health-conscious and engaged in preventive behavior could be seen in most subgroups. CONCLUSION: The importance of gender-specific prevention measures for the healthcare system is being increasingly stressed, but only a few studies specifically analyzing the influence of gender on preventive behavior could be identified.

We examined the use and contents of both communication methods amidst the pandemic, their associations with family wellbeing and personal happiness, and the mediation effects of communication quality in Hong Kong Chinese adults. Methods This population-based online survey enrolled 4,921 respondents in May 2020, who reported (i) any face-to-face or IM family communication when the pandemic was severe;(ii) communication contents being classified as neutral, positive, supportive, and negative;and (iii) communication quality, family wellbeing and personal happiness (score 0C10). Associations of family wellbeing and personal happiness with communication methods and contents (no communication excluded) were examined using linear regressions (), adjusting for each other, sex, age, socioeconomic status, and the number of cohabitants. Mediating effects of communication quality on these associations were examined. Prevalence estimates were weighted by sex, age, and education of the general population. Interactions of methods and contents were examined. Results Of 4,891 included respondents (female: 52.9%, 45C54 years: 37.7%, 65 years: 21.3%), 7.1% reported no communication, 12.7% face-to-face communication only, 26.7% IM only, and 53.4% both methods. More males and those at younger ages, had lower socioeconomic status, or fewer cohabitants showed no family communication or face-to-face only.

Within emergency management, mutual aid has come to mean the specific legal mechanisms by which governments, non-governmental organizations, and private sector entities share resources. However, the term mutual aid has a much longer history of functioning outside of government and emergency management circles. With a recorded history in Black and Creole communities dating back to the mid-1700s, it has been widely used within communities of color for centuries.

Such standards are divided into 5 components and 25 items including 1) organizational set up, human resources, plans, evaluation and occupational health network collaboration, 2) OHS for health workers of PCUs, 3) pro-active OHS for community workers, 4) in-house OHS and 5) integration of environmental health services (EHS). This work was undertaken to explore the OHS quality control program among PCUs following such standards. Material and Method: The staff of the Regional Office of Disease Prevention and Control (RDDC), and the staff of the Provincial Public Health Office have been trained to audit PCUs. Additionally, the basic OH course has been developed and trained PCUs staff. The evaluation system using the web-based has been established since 2019 and the instruction manual for all users have been documented as well. The PCUs staff conducted self-assessment and RDDC staff approved their results through such platform. The assessment criteria of the standards have been classified into 4 levels including starting level, good level, very good level and excellent level depending on the performance of PCUs practices. Results: During 2018-2021, 2,456 PCUs (25.7%) participated in the project and conducted self-assessment following OHS standards. Of them, 1,529/ (62.3%) PCUs could pass the criteria approved by the external auditor. Their levels were starting, good, very good and excellent amounting to 262 (17.1%), 585 (38.3%), 321 (21.0%),and 361 (23.6%) respectively. E-learning basic OH curriculum has been developed after gathering training need information from PCUs staff. There were 12 study hours and 7 subjects packed in the course including OH policy, walkthrough-survey, risk assessment and control, common occupational diseases (OD), practical BOHS, OD record and related OH laws. This course will plan to begin next year (2022). Conclusions: Participated PCUs could provide BOHS following such criteria. However, they had some limitations, such as 1) the capacity of PCUs staff for early diagnosis of OD and EHS provision were limited, 2) common hazards related to health problems have been identified, but control measure still need to be strengthened, Currently, the web-based audit platform was very helpful because of COVID-19 outbreak. Capacity building, training and supervision were the main activities for strengthening the quality assurance system. Recommendations: The future development should be addressed in 4 issues as follow: 1) specification of OHS interventions in the benefit package of universal coverage scheme to support operational finance, 2) training PCUs staff to enhance competency, 3) OHS quality continuous development and 4) OHS legislation enforcement.","output":"Quality assurance approach for basic occupational health services provided by Primary Care Units (PCUs) in Thailand, an example for others?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This retracts the article DOI: 10.7759/cureus.19516.].","output":"Retraction: Severe Dengue With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Due to COVID-19: A Co-infection Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has overwhelmed and altered health care systems worldwide, with a substantial impact on patients with chronic diseases.

METHODS: From March 9 to May 3, 2020, a prospective observational study was conducted in the Liver Unit of the University Hospital of Naples Federico II to evaluate the impact of (1) a fully implemented telemedicine program, partially restructured in response to COVID-19 to include video consultations; (2) extended hours of operation for helpline services; and (3) smart-working from home to facilitate follow-up visits for patients with CLD while adhering to social distancing regulations. RESULTS: During the lockdown in Italy, almost 400 visits were conducted using telemedicine; only patients requiring urgent care were admitted to a non-COVID-19 ward of our hospital. Telemedicine services were implemented not only for follow-up visits but also to screen patients prior to hospital admission and to provide urgent evaluations during complications. Of the nearly 1700 patients with CLD who attended a follow-up visit at our Liver Unit, none contracted COVID-19, and there was no need to alter treatment schedules.

Concerning the need for continuous monitoring of vital signs, especially for the elderly or those with certain types of diseases, the development of algorithms that can estimate vital signs using smartphones has attracted researchers worldwide. Such algorithms estimate vital signs (heart rate and oxygen saturation level) by processing an input PPG signal. These methods often apply multiple pre-processing steps to the input signal before the prediction step. This can increase the computational complexity of these methods, meaning only a limited number of mobile devices can run them. Furthermore, multiple pre-processing steps also require the design of a couple of hand-crafted stages to obtain an optimal result. This research proposes a novel end-to-end solution to mobile-based vital sign estimation by deep learning. The proposed method does not require any pre-processing. Due to the use of fully convolutional architecture, the parameter count of our proposed model is, on average, a quarter of the ordinary architectures that use fully-connected layers as the prediction heads. As a result, the proposed model has less over-fitting chance and computational complexity. A public dataset for vital sign estimation, including 62 videos collected from 35 men and 27 women, is also provided. The experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art estimation accuracy.","output":"Efficient Deep Learning-based Estimation of the Vital Signs on Smartphones"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tourism industry is probably one of the most affected by the crisis caused by Covid-19. It is the responsibility of politicians, tourism professionals and researchers to look for solutions to revive this important industry. This article shows how the development of Sustainable Tourism can help in the sustenance of the tourism industry, since one of the premises on which Sustainable Tourism is based is the non-overcrowding of tourist destinations (essential factor in the current context). Considering this argument and the existing regulations on lockdown rules, social distancing and meet up, it is considered that the practices in Sustainable Tourism can become a potential solution to stimulate tourist movements and help the revival of the tourism industry. Therefore, more specifically, the main objective of this article is to know tourists perception among about Sustainable Tourism and to determine which factors help its development. In this sense, the use of structural equation models in a research of 308 tourists has determined how factors related to the tourists' attitude, motivation and perceived benefits provided by the development of Sustainable Tourism increase the intention to consume this type of tourism.

METHODS Genbank sequences of six human coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-HKU1, were included as reference sequences. Primers were designed based on multiple alignment of reference sequences, targeting the conserved regions of each species of HcoV. Virus strains and nucleic acid preserved in our lab were used as template in developing this automatic-electrophoresis-based one-tube multiplex RT-PCR assay. Detection limits and reproducibility were also evaluated with these templates. Samples with infection of other respiratory viruses preserved in our lab were used to evaluate specificity of this assay. Finally, we tested this assay with 140 clinical samples that were validated by real-time PCR in parallel. RESULTS This automatic-electrophoresis-based multiplex RT-PCR assay was able to detect six human coronaviruses simultaneously. All positive samples in this study were detected with at least one specific fragment of anticipated length (195, 304, 332, 378, 415, 442 bp) . No fragment was detected in negative controls. Detection limits of 1.010(1-1.0)10(2) copies/l were achieved in tests of single virus. No cross reaction was observed with other respiratory viruses. This multiplex RT-PCR assay showed the same sensitivity and specificity to that of individual real-time RT-PCR validated with clinical samples. Both methods detected 28 positive samples (20%) .

A clinical study was conducted between November 2019 and September 2020. A total of 175 patients (n = 175) were enrolled in the research. The aim of the study was to assess the attitude of patients towards the new situation related to the reduced availability of dental offices providing oral surgery procedures. The level of anxiety associated with surgical intervention was measured using a self-made COVID-19 questionnaire and the MDAS scale. The ED-5Q questionnaire and EQ-VAS scale were also used in this research. The study showed that 21.9% of respondents presented with increased anxiety about a dental visit compared with the time before the pandemic. This epidemiological situation has led to an overwhelming increase in moderate dental anxiety (M: 11.4) among patients undergoing oral surgery procedures.

In this study, we established and used multiple indirect Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)-based serological assays to study the antibody response in COVID-19 patients. In order to validate the assays we determined the cut off values, sensitivity and specificity of the assays using sera collected from pre-pandemic healthy controls, COVID-19 patients at different time points after disease-onset, and seropositive sera to other human coronaviruses (CoVs).

Limited resources and unlimited demands prevent health-care services to be provided to all those in need. This became publicity evident with the current Covid-19 pandemic. Although controversial, health care rationing has always existed and is now inevitable. Setting priorities becomes then inevitable. How to define those priorities is a complex and yet irresolvable issue mainly because it involves several and conflicting criteria, translated into efficiency and equity considerations. This is why multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was introduced to health care as an appropriate decision-support framework for solving complex problems. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes the application of two combined approaches C analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and AHP-VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), as decision support tools to rank patients with competing needs in a more effective and equitable way. A rationing scenario involving four patients, differentiated by personal characteristics and health conditions, is used to illustrate, test and compare the applicability of both approaches. After extraction of the relative weights of the prioritization criteria involved in the hypothetical scenario from paired wise comparison methods, TOPSIS and VIKOR priority setting methods were designed. Findings: Results suggest that patients ranking from both combination approaches are similar and in accordance with the order made directly by health-care professionals. Therefore, the relative weights computed by AHP in combination with TOPSIS and/or VIKOR methods could be used with suitable applicability by health-care decision-makers.

Methods Python crawler automatic update function was used to collect the epidemic data released by the National Health Commission of China. An improved infectious disease dynamics SEIR model, which can automatically correct the COVID-19 basic reproductive number (R0), was constructed to predict the development trend of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province of China and South Korea. Results The peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province of China predicted by the model would appear on Feb. 21, 2020. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases would be about 50 000 on Feb. 19 and would fall to below 30 000 on Mar. 4, and the epidemic would end on May 10. According to the actual data released by the National Health Commission of China, the peak number of confirmed COVID-19 patients was 53 371. The model predicted that an epidemic peak in South Korea would be on Mar. 7, and would end at the end of April. Conclusion This improved infectious disease dynamics SEIR model established in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic has achieved relatively accurate prediction. The timely and effective intervention by relevant government departments has significantly affected the development of the epidemic. The epidemic situation in other countries in East Asia, such as South Korea, is still on the rise in March, suggesting that China needs to be on guard against the risk of imported epidemic.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic trend prediction based on improved infectious disease dynamics susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global infection and mortality rates from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are disproportionately high in certain populations, including amongst older people.

Successive rounds of testing for infection will be performed over a period of 12 months. Nasopharyngeal swabs will detect evidence of viral RNA and therefore active infection (accompanied by collection of data on symptoms), whereas blood tests will detect antibodies and evidence of cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Whole genome sequencing of viral isolates to investigate pathways of transmission of infection is planned in collaboration with the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium. Qualitative interviews with care home staff will investigate the impact of the pandemic on ways of working and how test results influence infection control practices and behaviours.

Masks substantially reduce exhaled respiratory droplets and aerosols from infected wearers and reduce exposure of uninfected wearers to these particles. Cloth masks and medical procedure masks? fit more loosely than do respirators (e.g., N95 facepieces). The effectiveness of cloth and medical procedure masks can be improved by ensuring that they are well fitted to the contours of the face to prevent leakage of air around the masks' edges. During January 2021, CDC conducted experimental simulations using pliable elastomeric source and receiver headforms to assess the extent to which two modifications to medical procedure masks, 1) wearing a cloth mask over a medical procedure mask (double masking) and 2) knotting the ear loops of a medical procedure mask where they attach to the mask's edges and then tucking in and flattening the extra material close to the face (knotted and tucked masks), could improve the fit of these masks and reduce the receiver's exposure to an aerosol of simulated respiratory droplet particles of the size considered most important for transmitting SARS-CoV-2.

We mapped evidence on the nature and extent of roles assigned to lay animal vaccinators, and identified lessons useful for their future deployment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines, we searched seven bibliographic databases for articles published between 1980 and 2021, with the search terms lay OR community-based OR volunteer AND \\"animal health worker\\" OR vaccinator*, and applied an a priori exclusion criteria to select studies. From 30 identified studies, lay vaccinators were used by non-government developmental (n = 12, 40%), research (n = 10, 33%) and government (n = 5, 17%) programmes to vaccinate domestic animals. The main reason for using lay vaccinators was to provide access to animal vaccination in the absence of professional veterinarians (n = 12, 40%). Reported positive outcomes of programmes included increased flock and herd sizes and farmer knowledge of best practice (n = 13, 43%); decreased disease transmission, outbreaks and mortality (n = 11, 37%); higher vaccination coverage (10, 33%); non-inferior seroconversion and birth rates among vaccinated herds (n = 3, 10%). The most frequently reported facilitating factor of lay vaccinator programmes was community participation (n = 14, 47%), whilst opposition from professional veterinarians (n = 8, 27%), stakeholders seeking financial gains to detriment of programmes goals (n = 8, 27%) and programming issues (n = 8, 27%) were the most frequently reported barriers. No study reported on cost-effectiveness and we found no record from a low and middle-income country of lay vaccinator programmes being integrated into national veterinary services.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 318 patients with distinct clinical myocardial pathologies and 20 healthy controls. Populations included myocarditis, atypical chest pain/palpitations, STEMI, severe aortic stenosis, acute COVID infection, amyloidosis, and cardiac transplantation with acute rejection, without current rejection but with prior rejection, and with no history of rejection.

While medicines, drugs, and vaccines against the COVID-19 are being developed, social isolation has become the most used method for controlling the virus spreading. With the social isolation, authorities aimed to slow down the spreading, avoiding saturation of the healthcare system, and allowing that all critical COVID-19 cases could be appropriately treated. By tuning the proposed model to fit Brazil's initial COVID-19 data, the objectives of the paper are to analyze the impact of the social isolation features on the population dynamics; simulate the number of deaths due to COVID-19 and due to the lack of healthcare infrastructure; study combinations of the features for the healthcare system does not collapse; and analyze healthcare system responses for the crisis. Methods In this paper, a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model is described in terms of probabilistic cellular automata and ordinary differential equations for the transmission of COVID-19, flexible enough for simulating different scenarios of social isolation according to the following features: the start day for the social isolation after the first death, the period for the social isolation campaign, and the percentage of the population committed to the campaign. Results Results showed that efforts in the social isolation campaign must be concentrated both on the isolation percentage and campaign duration to delay the healthcare system failure. For the hospital situation in Brazil at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, a rate of 200 purchases per day of intensive care units and mechanical ventilators is the minimum rate to prevent the collapse of the healthcare system. Conclusions By using the model for different scenarios, it is possible to estimate the impact of social isolation campaign adhesion. For instance, if the social isolation percentage increased from 40% to 50% in Brazil, the purchase rate of 150 intensive care units and mechanical ventilators per day would be enough to prevent the healthcare system to collapse.

The IBDV genome is formed by two dsRNA segments. The largest one harbors two partially overlapping open reading frames encoding a non-structural polypeptide, known as VP5, and a large polyprotein, respectively. VP5 is non-essential for virus replication. However, it plays a major role in IBDV pathogenesis. VP5 accumulates at the plasma membrane (PM) of IBDV-infected cells. We have analyzed the mechanism underlying the VP5 PM targeting. Updated topological prediction algorithm servers fail to identify a transmembrane domain within the VP5 sequence. However, the VP5 polycationic C-terminal region, harboring three closely spaced patches formed by two or three consecutive basic amino acid residues (lysine or arginine), might account for its PM tropism. We have found that mutations, either C-terminal VP5 deletions or replacement of basic amino acids by alanine residues, that reduce the electropositive charge of the VP5 C-terminus abolish PM targeting. Lipid overlay assays performed with an affinity-purified Flag-tagged VP5 (FVP5) protein version show that this polypeptide binds several phosphoinositides (PIP), exhibiting a clear preference for monophosphate species. Experiments performed with FVP5 mutant proteins lacking the polycationic domain demonstrate that this region is essential for PIP binding. Data gathered with IBDV mutants expressing C-terminal deleted VP5 polypeptides generated by reverse genetics demonstrate that the VP5-PIP binding domain is required both for its PM targeting in infected cells, and for efficient virus dissemination. Data presented here lead us to hypothesize that IBDV might use a non-lytic VP5-dependent cell-to-cell spreading mechanism.","output":"Infectious Bursal Disease Virus VP5 Polypeptide: A Phosphoinositide-Binding Protein Required for Efficient Cell-to-Cell Virus Dissemination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogenic bacterial biofilms can be life threatening, greatly decrease patient's quality of life and are a substantial burden on the healthcare system.

We study popular attitudes toward the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and how these have changed over the course of the pandemic in Switzerland, drawing on data from two rounds of an original public opinion survey conducted in the spring and winter of 2020. We find that the public supports prioritizing vulnerable groups such as health care workers or the elderly. We also find a notable degree of cross-generational solidarity: younger age cohorts prioritize the elderly, while older groups prioritize (typically younger) health care workers. We then examine whether this finding is not in fact driven by vaccine hesitancy. This is not the case for older age groups, whose solidarity thus seems to be genuine. Vaccine hesitancy is an issue among younger groups, however.","output":"Popular Attitudes Toward the Distribution of Vaccines Against COVID-19: The Swiss Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the most stressful events of recent times. Among the population, healthcare professionals who treat COVID-19 patients are most likely to develop psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The present study thus aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian healthcare workers. METHODS The responses of 145 healthcare workers (72 medical doctors and 73 nurses) were included in the final dataset. Participants were asked to provide sociodemographic and clinical information, and to complete: (a) quality of life and health-related Visual Analogue Scales, (b) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y1, (c) Beck Depression Inventory, and (d) PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. RESULTS A comparison between healthcare professionals working in COVID-19 wards and other units revealed that the former reported higher levels of both depressive symptoms and PTSS. Moreover, the results of regression analyses showed that in healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients, gender and marital status, and gender and age significantly predicted depressive symptoms and PTSS, respectively. Particularly, being female and not in a relationship were found to be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, whereas being female and older were found to be related to higher levels of PTSS. CONCLUSIONS The current findings suggest that specific predisposing factors could identify healthcare workers who are at high risk of developing mental health symptoms when faced with COVID-19 patients.","output":"Mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is an international pandemic.

To assess the state of medical ICT across the nation, we devised and administered a comprehensive digital healthcare survey to medical institutions across the nation. (2) Methods: From 16 November through 11 December 2020, this study targeted 42 tertiary hospitals, 311 general hospitals, and 1431 hospital locations countrywide. (3) Results: Since 2015, most hospitals have implemented electronic medical record (EMR) systems (90.5 percent of hospitals, which is the smallest unit, and 100 percent of tertiary hospitals). The rate of implementation of personal health records (PHRs) varied significantly between 61.9 percent and 2.4 percent, depending on the size of the hospital. Hospitals have implemented around three to seven government-sponsored information/data transmission and receiving systems for statistical or investigative objectives. For secondary usage of medical data, more than half of tertiary hospitals have implemented a clinical data warehouse or shared data model. However, new service establishments utilizing modern medical technologies such as artificial intelligence or lifelogging were scarce and in the planning stages.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test a self-management SMS text messaging intervention for people with IBD. Our goal was to examine intervention feasibility, acceptability, and engagement and to preliminarily evaluate improvements in certain self-reported health outcomes among participants. METHODS: We developed an SMS text messaging program called Text4IBD. The program sent daily support messages and resources about disease self-management over the course of a 2-week, single-group, pretest-posttest intervention to participants (N=114) diagnosed with IBD. We examined intervention feasibility, acceptability, and engagement through Text4IBD message topic recall and use of resources (ie, visiting supplemental websites recommended by the Text4IBD program). We also assessed pretest-posttest measures of IBD-related distress, self-efficacy, perceived support, use of coping strategies, and medication adherence. Analyses examined participants evaluations of the intervention and compared pretest-posttest changes in secondary outcomes using paired-samples statistics. RESULTS: Approximately all participants who completed the intervention (n=105) were receptive to Text4IBD and viewed the program as feasible and acceptable. In addition, most participants (103/105, 98.1%) recalled at least one of the message topics sent by the program, and 79% (83/105) of them self-reported engaging with at least one of the external self-management resources recommended by the Text4IBD program. Pretest-posttest results showed reduced IBD-related distress (mean 3.33, SD 0.68 vs mean 2.86, SD 0.73; P<.001) and improvements in most other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study highlight the value of SMS text messaging as a useful digital medium for providing support to people with IBD, particularly to those who may struggle with disease-related distress. Text4IBD was highly feasible and acceptable and may help people self-manage their IBD.

In the wake of the pandemic, the health and socio-economic challenges experienced by the youth in Kenya are likely to be elevated. We assessed knowledge, practices, perceived risk of infection, adoption of recommended behaviour and the effects of COVID-19 among the youth in Kenya. METHODS: A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted between April 30th to May 7th, 2020 through a combined online survey and phone interviews. A total of 2156 youth across all 47 counties in Kenya completed the responses to the study questions. All survey responses analyzed using Stata version 15 were tabulated by gender, age, and education level to generate basic descriptive tables and tested for differences by category using chi-square tests. Where applicable, linear and logistic regression analysis model was conducted using covariates such as employment status, gender, and education level. RESULTS: Knowledge on symptoms of COVID-19 was generally high. Female respondents were more likely to identify more symptoms correctly compared to men (p < 0.001). However, youth reported very low levels of anyone being at risk of infection (7.1%). Most youth have adopted behavior necessary to slow down the infection. There were generally very low reported levels of inability to access health services related to sexual and reproductive health. About 50.0% of respondents reported significant decline in income during the pandemic period, nearly a third reported living in fear while 26.5% reported feeling stressed. CONCLUSION: There was high knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, preventive strategies, and high adoption of preventive practices. Strategies to sustain behaviors positively adopted among young people will be critical to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Despite the low reported rates of inability to access sexual and reproductive health, response measures should include strategies that facilitate continuity of services among young people.

In times of an infectious epidemic where medical subspecialties lead the frontline, a surgeons role becomes rather vague. However, the only obstacle that stands in between the surgeon and fighting in the frontline of an infectious disease outbreak, is the traditional perception of what a surgeon can do. By presenting the strategies employed by our institution and its surgical unit, which remains the epicenter of the COVID-19 fight in Singapore, together with our medical counterparts, we hope to be able to improve our practices to respond and prevent the pandemic from escalating further as a collective community of surgeons across the globe.

The literature on epidemics indicates that the early diagnosis of a coronavirus infection can lead to a reduction in mortality rates. To prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from spreading, the regular identification and monitoring of infected patients are needed. In this regard, wireless body area networks (WBANs) can be used in conjunction with machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) to identify and monitor the human body for health-related information, which in turn can aid in the early diagnosis of diseases. This paper proposes a novel coronavirus-body area network (CoV-BAN) model based on IoT technology as a real-time health monitoring system for the detection of the early stages of coronavirus infection using a number of wearable biosensors to examine the health status of the patient. The proposed CoV-BAN model is tested with five machine learning-based classification methods, including random forest, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, support vector machine and multi-layer perceptron classifiers, to optimize the accuracy of the diagnosis of COVID-19. For the long-term sustainability of the sensor devices, the development of energy-efficient WBAN is critical. To address this issue, a long-range (LoRa)-based IoT program is used to receive biosensor signals from the patient and transmit them to the cloud directly for monitoring. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model using the random forest classifier outperforms models using the other classifiers, with an average accuracy of 88.6%. In addition, power consumption is reduced when LoRa technology is used as a relay node.","output":"An Intelligent and Energy-Efficient Wireless Body Area Network to Control Coronavirus Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review aims to systematically identify and synthesize qualitative data on adolescents' experiences of the barriers to and facilitators of physical activity to understand whether these differ by socioeconomic position.

We examined the perception, attitude, perceived barriers and facilitation measures of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in a Chinese population with free vaccine choices (Sinovac [Coronavac] vs. BioNTech/Fosun [Comirnaty]) and adequate doses. Method: We conducted a random telephone survey of the general population in 1195 subjects aged 18 years or above from 23 April 2021 to 8 May 2021 after two months of vaccine rollout. A descriptive analysis of the levels of enabling factors, obstacles and perception of COVID-19 vaccination was conducted using ANOVA and Chi-square tests for trend. Results: Only 10.1% and 13.5% had received one and two COVID-19 vaccine doses, respectively. Among those who had not received any COVID-19 vaccine (75.4%), only 25.1% expressed their intention to receive in the coming 6 months. The barriers with the highest scores included having heard of cases with serious adverse events or death after vaccination (score: 8.17 out 10, 95% C.I. 7.99, 8.35), lack of confidence on governmental recommendations (7.69, 95% C.I. 7.47, 7.91), and waiting for a better vaccine (7.29, 95% C.I. 7.07, 7.52). The highest score for the impact of various incentives for vaccination was for vaccine passports for overseas travel (4.44, 95% C.I. 4.18, 4.71). Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy is commonly observed in this Chinese population despite adequate provision of vaccine doses and choices. No single incentive is strong enough to promote vaccination, and multiple facilitation measures for different groups of population are needed to encourage vaccine uptake.

The lockdown is deemed as an extreme case of familialism, which exacerbates the lack of systemic parenting support, a characteristic of the Italian welfare state. While before the pandemic parents faced highperforming parenting and working models, homeworking and online teaching have made the management of their different roles even harder. This situation has negatively impacted on the mental health of the interviewees, while in parallel reducing parents', particularly mothers', sense of guilt related to the lack of time devoted to their children.

Compared to the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2, the majority of currently circulating isolates possess an S protein variant characterized by an aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution at amino acid position 614 (D614G). Residue 614 lies outside the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the mutation does not alter the affinity of monomeric S protein for ACE2. However, S(G614), compared to S(D614), mediates more efficient ACE2-mediated transduction of cells by S-pseudotyped vectors and more efficient infection of cells and animals by live SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes and synthesizes the epidemiological and functional observations of the D614G spike mutation, with focus on the biochemical and cell-biological impact of this mutation and its consequences for S protein function. We further discuss the significance of these recent findings in the context of the current global pandemic.","output":"Functional importance of the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic discussions employ language metaphors and metonymies to make sense of the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis.

Researchers, like many, have suffered from the effects of the pandemic. Those hardships notwithstanding, we suggest that research into COVID-19 has benefitted from a seed corn of discovery science that has provided the basis for routine diagnostic PCR and antibody tests; for structural analyses of the way in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with cells; for the development of new treatments (and the debunking of ineffective ones); for studies of the genetics of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2; and for the development of vaccines. The speed of dissemination of research has benefitted from the widespread use of pre-prints, and researchers and funders have become more nimble in their approaches to research and more willing to change their priorities in the face of the pandemic. In our experience, the advice provided to schools on the basis of this research was, however, often published at the last minute and was frequently flawed or inconsistent. This has led to a widening of the attainment gap between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers and it has exacerbated the digital divide and holiday hunger.

The reasons behind that difference are not fully understood, but underreporting is typically presumed as one of the main factors. This study aimed to assess FL epidemiology in Poland based on 2000-2014 data from the Polish National Cancer Registry, which has 100% population coverage and over 90% completeness of the registration. All cases were coded according to ICD-10 and ICD-O-3 recommendations. The total number of registered FL cases was 3,928 with crude (CR) and standardized (SR) incidence rates of 0.72/105 and 0.87/105, respectively. The median age of FL diagnosis was 61 years, with the male to female incidence ratio of 1.06. The distribution of morphological types of FL: not otherwise specified (NOS), grades 1, 2, or 3 were 72.58, 4.81, 12.88, and 9.73%, respectively. Among all reported mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, FL was ranked the fourth in incidence, just after chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CR 3.62/105, SR 4.99/105), plasma cell neoplasms (CR 3.78/105, SR 4.97/105) and diffuse B-cell lymphoma, NOS (CR 2.13/105, SR 2.65/105). The systematic increase in FL incidence among females was observed. Our study confirms a lower FL incidence rate in Poland as compared to other European countries. Moreover, as our analysis was based on a registry with high data completeness, it provides evidence that reasons other than underreporting are responsible for FL incidence discrepancies between Eastern and Western Europe.","output":"Population-based epidemiological data of follicular lymphoma in Poland: 15 years of observation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) containing protective antigen (PA) is the only FDA-approved anthrax vaccine in the United States. Characterization of the binding of AVA-induced anti-PA human antibodies against the PA antigen after vaccination is crucial to understanding mechanisms of the AVA-elicited humoral immune response. Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is often coupled with a short liquid chromatography gradient (e.g., 5C10 min) for the characterization of protein interactions. We recently developed a long-gradient (e.g., 90 min), sub-zero temperature, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography HDX-MS (UPLC-HDX-MS) platform that has significantly increased separation power and limited back-exchange for the analysis of protein samples with high complexity. In this study, we demonstrated the utility of this platform for mapping antibodyCantigen epitopes by examining four fully human monoclonal antibodies to anthrax PA. Antibody p1C03, with limited neutralizing activity in vivo, bound to a region on domain 1A of PA. p6C04 and p1A06, with no neutralizing activities, bound to the same helix on domain 3 to prevent oligomerization of PA. We found p6C01 strongly bound to domain 3 on a different helix region. We also identified a secondary epitope for p6C01, which likely leads to the blocking of furin cleavage of PA after p6C01 binding. This novel binding of p6C01 results in highly neutralizing activity. This is the first report of this distinct binding mechanism for a highly neutralizing fully human antibody to anthrax protective antigen. Studying such epitopes can facilitate the development of novel therapeutics against anthrax.","output":"Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry Reveals a Novel Binding Region of a Neutralizing Fully Human Monoclonal Antibody to Anthrax Protective Antigen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infections often cause only mild disease that may evoke relatively low Ab titers compared with patients admitted to hospitals. Generally, total Ab bridging assays combine good sensitivity with high specificity. Therefore, we developed sensitive total Ab bridging assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Abs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein in addition to conventional isotype-specific assays. Ab kinetics was assessed in PCR-confirmed, hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (n = 41) and three populations of patients with COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospital admission: PCR-confirmed convalescent plasmapheresis donors (n = 182), PCR-confirmed hospital care workers (n = 47), and a group of longitudinally sampled symptomatic individuals highly suspect of COVID-19 (n = 14). In nonhospitalized patients, the Ab response to RBD is weaker but follows similar kinetics, as has been observed in hospitalized patients. Across populations, the RBD bridging assay identified most patients correctly as seropositive. In 11/14 of the COVID-19-suspect cases, seroconversion in the RBD bridging assay could be demonstrated before day 12; nucleocapsid protein Abs emerged less consistently. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of finger-prick sampling for Ab detection against SARS-CoV-2 using these assays. In conclusion, the developed bridging assays reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 Abs in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients and are therefore well suited to conduct seroprevalence studies.","output":"Development of a SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody Assay and the Dynamics of Antibody Response over Time in Hospitalized and Nonhospitalized Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Few studies have examined disparities in autism services and functional outcomes over the life course.

RECENT FINDINGS Forty studies were included. Low-income and racial/ethnic minority youth on the autism spectrum were less likely to participate in transition planning meetings, enroll in postsecondary education, find competitive employment after high school, live independently, participate in social activities, and receive health care transition services than their White and higher income peers on the autism spectrum. Racial/ethnic minority and low-income youth on the autism spectrum were more likely to be disconnected from educational, occupational, and social activities upon entering adulthood.

(GE Healthcare) data were obtained for 14 min both in the absence (pre-operatively) or presence (postoperatively) of pain in a group of surgical patients, each patient acting as their own control. Various dynamic photoplethysmography variables were extracted to quantify pain intensity; the most accurate index was selected using logistic regression as a classifier. The area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was measured to evaluate the accuracy of final model predictions. In total, 12,012 heart beats from 89 patients were used to develop a new Nasal Photoplethysmography Index for analgesic depth quantification. The two-variable model (a combination of diastolic peak point variation and heart beat interval variation) was most accurate in discriminating between the presence and absence of pain (numerical rating scale (NRS)  3). The accuracy and area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the Nasal Photoplethysmography Index were 75.3% and 0.8018, respectively, and 64.8% and 0.7034, respectively, for the Surgical Pleth Index. The Nasal Photoplethysmography Index clearly distinguished pain (NRS  3) in awake surgical patients with postoperative pain.

Additionally, many of these models are trained and tested on patient cohorts from a single hospital, raising questions about the generalisability of results. We used a Bayesian Markov model to analyse time series data of biomarker measurements taken throughout the duration of a COVID-19 patient's hospitalisation for n=1540 patients from two hospitals in New York: State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Health Sciences University and Maimonides Medical Center. In doing so, we quantified the mortality risk associated with both static (e.g. demographic and patient history variables) and dynamic factors (e.g. changes in biomarkers) throughout hospitalisation. By using our model to make predictions across the hospitals, we assessed how predictive factors generalised between the two cohorts. The individual dynamics of the measurements and their associated mortality risk were remarkably consistent across the hospitals. The model accuracy in predicting patient outcome (death or discharge) was 72.3% (predicting SUNY; posterior median accuracy) and 71.4% (predicting Maimonides) respectively. Model sensitivity was higher for detecting patients who would go on to be discharged (79.2%) versus those who died (61.0%).

This review critically analysed post-operative clinical outcome on open versus laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in paediatric patients. Before initiating the study, recurrence was defined as the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes were early post-operative pain, operation time and surgical site infections. METHODS The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, the following databases were searched: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase (May 2019). Retrospective and uncontrolled studies were excluded. RESULTS Five studies were identified, four randomised controlled trials (n = 272) and one controlled prospective study (n = 85) which included a total of 357 patients. Generally, the studies included few patients, were highly heterogenic and were overall of moderate quality. With a follow-up time ranging from three months to 14 years, there was no difference in recurrence rate after unilateral open (0-2%) versus unilateral laparoscopic (0-4%) or bilateral open versus bilateral laparoscopic repair (n = 281; p > 0.05 in all studies).

The disruption of either branching or differentiation results in severe respiratory deficiencies and often in neonatal death. The molecular mechanisms that control branching patterns and the transition to alveolar differentiation are not completely understood. Here we report on the in vitro and in vivo characterization of the lungs of mouse embryos lacking a functional Svep1 gene. Our data demonstrate that the SVEP1 extracellular matrix protein is critical for airway patterning and for the process of transitioning from branching to alveolar maturation. Svep1-/- embryos on a C57BL/6J genetic background are characterized by hypoplastic lungs and a disorganized increase in distal airway tips which disrupts airway architecture and lobe shape. The lungs of Svep1 knockout embryos also have defects in alveolar differentiation. In vitro lung explant experiments demonstrated that SVEP1 normally inhibits branching morphogenesis and that treatment with a SVEP1 peptide can rescue the branching defects observed in Svep1 knockouts. Our findings reveal for the first time that Svep1 is essential for constructing the basic airway architecture and for the transition from lung branching to alveolar differentiation. Our results suggest therapeutic strategies to enhance lung development in patients with life-threatening respiratory disorders such as the lung hypoplasia and prematurity observed in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).","output":"The extracellular matrix gene, Svep1, orchestrates airway patterning and the transition from lung branching morphogenesis to alveolar maturation in the mouse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intensive conventional agriculture and climate change have induced severe ecological damages and threatened global food security, claiming a reorientation of agricultural management and public policies towards a more sustainable development model. In this context, nanomaterials promise to support this transition by promoting mitigation, enhancing productivity, and reducing contamination. This review gathers recent research innovations on smart nanoformulations and delivery systems improving crop protection and plant nutrition, nanoremediation strategies for contaminated soils, nanosensors for plant health and food quality and safety monitoring, and nanomaterials as smart food-packaging. It also highlights the impact of engineered nanomaterials on soil microbial communities, and potential environmental risks, along with future research directions. Although large-scale production and in-field testing of nano-agrochemicals are still ongoing, the collected information indicates improvements in uptake, use efficiency, targeted delivery of the active ingredients, and reduction of leaching and pollution. Nanoremediation seems to have a low negative impact on microbial communities while promoting biodiversity. Nanosensors enable high-resolution crop monitoring and sustainable management of the resources, while nano-packaging confers catalytic, antimicrobial, and barrier properties, preserving food safety and preventing food waste.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the seasonality and the potential effects of different meteorological factors on the detection rate of the non-SARS coronavirus detection by PCR. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 12,763 respiratory tract sample results (288 positive and 12,475 negative) for non-SARS, non-MERS coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1). The effect of seven single weather factors on the coronavirus detection rate was fitted in a logistic regression model with and without adjusting for other weather factors. Results: Coronavirus infections followed a seasonal pattern peaking from December to March and plunged from July to September. The seasonal effect was less pronounced in immunosuppressed patients compared to immunocompetent patients. Different automatic variable selection processes agreed on selecting the predictors temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover and precipitation as remaining predictors in the multivariable logistic regression model, including all weather factors, with low ambient temperature, low relative humidity, high cloud cover and high precipitation being linked to increased coronavirus detection rates. Conclusions: Coronavirus infections followed a seasonal pattern, which was more pronounced in immunocompetent patients compared to immunosuppressed patients. Several meteorological factors were associated with the coronavirus detection rate. However, when mutually adjusting for all weather factors, only temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and cloud cover contributed independently to predicting the coronavirus detection rate.","output":"Seasonality of Non-SARS, Non-MERS Coronaviruses and the Impact of Meteorological Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The race among countries and companies to develop efficacious vaccines and therapeutics for the COVID-19 is ongoing fast, with many trials underway Among this, cell-based therapy is focused on moderate to severe phases of COVID-19, and there have been promising outcomes Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) due to their pro/anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory behavior, Natural Killer (NK) cells thanks to their capacity of lysing virus-infected cells and regulate the resulting immune response, Dendritic cells thanks to immunotherapy and cell-based vaccine engineering, SARS-CoV2-specific T cells due to stimulate and promote the immune system and MSC-derived exosomes because of cell-free therapy and beneficial manufacturing aspects, hold great promises for cell-based therapy applications for treating COVID-19 and similar viral infections Moreover, recently, an innovative approach to COVID-19 based on engineered human MSC has been introduced, which is continuously evacuated and degraded by the body's immune system during the antigen recognition process However, the economic situation of governments and nations, and the cost of therapeutics influence the clinical approaches to manage and exit from this pandemic This summary describes cell-based clinical trials and the cost-utility aspects of cell therapy In this regard, limited clinical studies have been reported;while, several clinical trials have been approved for starting phases 2 and 3 of their trials for treating COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome Regarding the cost of cell therapy, many believe that the high cost of cell-based therapy will decrease substantially Hence, there are hopes that cellular therapy can be approved soon for the treatment of viral diseases such as COVID-19 Graphical abstract","output":"Cell-Based Therapy for Severe COVID-19 Patients: Clinical Trials and Cost-Utility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT We examine volatility connectedness of 11 sectoral indices in the US using daily data from January 01, 2013 to December 31, 2020 We employ the connectedness measures of Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012, 2014), unveiling changes in sectoral connectedness and stylized facts regarding specific sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic Among several results, we find extraordinary increase in total connectedness, from early stages of international spread to the end of July 2020;some relevant changes in the pairwise connections between sectors, especially among the originally stronger ones However, in a total net connectedness perspective, there is little evidence of structural changes","output":"Sectoral connectedness: New evidence from US stock market during COVID-19 pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glucocorticoids are used widely on a long-term basis in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Their adverse effects include the development of hyperglycemia and osteoporosis, whose molecular mechanisms have been only partially studied in preclinical models. Both these glucocorticoid-induced pathologies have been shown to be mediated at least in part by oxidative stress. The transcription factor nuclear erythroid factor 2-like 2 (NRF2) is a central regulator of antioxidant and cytoprotective responses. Thus, we hypothesized that NRF2 may play a role in glucocorticoid-induced metabolic disease and osteoporosis. To this end, WT and Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2KO) mice of both genders were treated with 2 mg/kg dexamethasone or vehicle 3 times per week for 13 weeks. Dexamethasone treatment led to less weight gain during the treatment period without affecting food consumption, as well as to lower glucose levels and high insulin levels compared to vehicle-treated mice. Dexamethasone also reduced cortical bone volume and density. All these effects of dexamethasone were similar between male and female mice, as well as between WT and Nrf2KO mice. Hepatic NRF2 signaling and gluconeogenic gene expression were not affected by dexamethasone. A 2-day dexamethasone treatment was also sufficient to increase insulin levels without affecting body weight and glucose levels. Hence, dexamethasone induces hyperinsulinemia, which potentially leads to decreased glucose levels, as well as osteoporosis, both independently of NRF2.","output":"Dexamethasone Administration in Mice Leads to Less Body Weight Gain over Time, Lower Serum Glucose, and Higher Insulin Levels Independently of NRF2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For decades artificial intelligence (AI) has been used for various applications in the healthcare industry.

METHODS: Retrospective review of electronic medical records of all patients presenting to the ophthalmology department from March 23, 2020, to July 15, 2020, was compared with that from March 23, 2019, to July 15, 2019. The data between March 23, 2020, to May 31, 2020 (lockdown) and June 06, 2020, to July 15, 2020 (unlock) was compared separately. Parameters evaluated were age, gender, presenting complaints, final diagnosis, treatment advised, and surgical interventions. RESULTS: During the lockdown, routine outpatient flow reduced by 97.14% (P < 0.001), the median age of presentation decreased to 29 years (55 years last year) and males increased by 4.7% (from 61.51% to 66.21%) in 2020. Emergency services decreased by 35.25%, percentage of children decreased by 4.28% (from 34.28% to 30%) and males increased by 13.53% (from 59.97% to 73.5%). Mechanical trauma, microbial keratitis, and conjunctivitis were the most common reasons for presentation. The former lessened by 41.75% while the latter two amplified by 1.25 times and 2 times, respectively.

To prevent the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and treat patients with mild symptoms, sports stadiums and convention centers were reconstructed into mobile hospitals. RESEARCH QUESTION: It is unknown whether a mobile cabin hospital can provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 421 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan from February 9, 2020, to March 5, 2020. Clinical data comprised patient age, sex, clinical presentation, chest imaging, nucleic acid testing, length of hospitalization, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the patients who were discharged from the cabin hospital, 362 (86.0%) were categorized as recovered; 14.0% developed severe symptoms and were transferred to a designated hospital. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (60.6%) and cough (52.0%); 5.2% exhibited no obvious symptoms. High fever (> 39.0C) was more common in severe cases than in recovered cases (18.6% vs 6.6%). The distribution of lung lesions was peripheral in 85.0% of patients, multifocal in 69.4%, and bilateral in 68.2%. The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity (67.7%), followed by patchy shadowing (49.2%). The incidence of patchy shadowing was higher in patients with severe disease (66.1%) than in those who recovered (31.8%, P < .0001).

Previous studies showed that HCoV-NL63 and the genetically distant severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV employ the same receptor for host cell entry, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but it is largely unclear whether ACE2 interactions are sufficient to allow HCoV-NL63 binding to cells. The present study showed that directed expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cells previously resistant to HCoV-NL63 renders them susceptible, showing that ACE2 protein acts as a functional receptor and that its expression is required for infection. However, comparative analysis showed that directed expression or selective scission of the ACE2 protein had no measurable effect on virus adhesion. In contrast, binding of HCoV-NL63 to heparan sulfates was required for viral attachment and infection of target cells, showing that these molecules serve as attachment receptors for HCoV-NL63. IMPORTANCE ACE2 protein was proposed as a receptor for HCoV-NL63 already in 2005, but an in-depth analysis of early events during virus infection had not been performed thus far. Here, we show that the ACE2 protein is required for viral entry but that it is not the primary binding site on the cell surface. Conducted research showed that heparan sulfate proteoglycans function as adhesion molecules, increasing the virus density on cell surface and possibly facilitating the interaction between HCoV-NL63 and its receptor. Obtained results show that the initial events during HCoV-NL63 infection are more complex than anticipated and that a newly described interaction may be essential for understanding the infection process and, possibly, also assist in drug design.","output":"Human coronavirus NL63 utilizes heparan sulfate proteoglycans for attachment to target cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Log messages are widely used in cloud servers and other systems.

Both proteins contain a single transmembrane-spanning segment but are integrated in the membrane with opposite orientations. The G protein has an amino-terminal signal sequence and a stop-transfer sequence located near the carboxy terminus. The HN glycoprotein has a single sequence near the amino terminus that functions as both a signal- sequence and a transmembrane-spanning segment. Membrane insertion was explored using a cell-free system directed by transcribed mRNAs encoding amino-terminal segments of the two proteins. Ribosome-bound nascent polypeptides were assembled, ribonucleotides were removed by gel filtration chromatography, and the ribosomes were incubated with microsomal membranes under conditions of defined ribonucleotide content. Nascent chain insertion into the membrane required the presence of both the signal recognition particle and a functional signal recognition particle receptor. In the absence of ribonucleotides, insertion of nascent membrane proteins was not detected. GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues promoted efficient insertion, while ATP was comparatively ineffective. Surprisingly, the majority of the HN nascent chain remained ribosome associated after puromycin treatment. Ribosome-associated HN nascent chains remained competent for membrane insertion, while free HN chains were not competent.

RESULTS: Before COVID-19, the clinic-level percent of participants receiving any amount of days' supply of take-home doses at each clinic ranged from 56% to 82%, while it ranged from 78% to 100% since COVID-19. The clinic-level percent of participants receiving a take-homes days' supply of a week or longer (i.e., &#8805;6 days) since COVID-19 ranged from 11% to 56%. Among 87 participants who received take-homes since COVID-19, only four reported selling their take-home doses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found variation in experiences of take-home dosing by clinic and little diversion of take-home doses. While SAMSHA guidance should allow expanded access to take-home doses, adoption of these guidelines may vary at the clinic level. The adoption of these policies should be explored further, particularly in the context of benefits to patients seeking OUD treatment.","output":"Take-home dosing experiences among persons receiving methadone maintenance treatment during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Film-forming sprays offer many advantages compared to conventional topical preparations because they can provide uniform drug distribution and dose, increased bioavailability, lower incidence of irritation, continuous drug release, and accelerated wound healing through moisture control. Film-forming sprays consist of polymers and excipients that improve the characteristics of preparations and enhance the stability of active substances. Each type of polymer and excipient will produce films with different features. Therefore, the various types of polymers and excipients and their evaluation standards need to be examined for the development of a more optimal form of film-forming spray. The selected literature included research on polymers as film-forming matrices and the application of these sprays for medical purposes or for potential medical use. This article discusses the types and concentrations of polymers and excipients, sprayer types, evaluations, and critical parameters in determining the sprayability and film characteristics. The review concludes that both natural and synthetic polymers that have in situ film or viscoelastic properties can be used to optimise topical drug delivery.","output":"Film-Forming Sprays for Topical Drug Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alfaxalone is a neurosteroid with anaesthetic effects and it has been used successfully in several animal species.

Two animals treated with alfaxalone at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively, died. At 5 mg/kg alfaxalone produced anaesthesia with a similar onset but a shorter duration of anaesthesia and analgesia than alfaxalone at 10 mg/kg. The medetomidine-alfaxalone combination produced anaesthesia and analgesia of a longer duration than alfaxalone administered alone at 5 mg/kg (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Under this anaesthetic regimen, there was a progressive decrease in pulse rate during the first 30 min before the pulse rate stabilized. Respiratory parameters were maintained at acceptable levels. When tramadol was administered, all the animals exhibited a strong excitation reaction and in no case was the toe-pinch reflex clearly abolished. Thus, alfaxalone plus medetomidine provided safe and effective anaesthesia in ferrets. Alfaxalone, alone or in combination with tramadol, did not produce satisfactory results for use as an anaesthetic for this species.","output":"Anaesthetic effects in the ferret of alfaxalone alone and in combination with medetomidine or tramadol: a pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing therapeutics against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could be guided by the distribution of epitopes, not only on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein but also across the full Spike (S) protein.

Currently existing techniques such as RT-PCR, antigen-antibody-based detection, and CT scans are prompt solutions for diagnosing infected patients. However, the limitations of currently available indicators have enticed researchers to search for adjunct or additional solutions for COVID-19 diagnosis. Meanwhile, identifying biomarkers or indicators is necessary for understanding the severity of the disease and aids in developing efficient drugs and vaccines. Therefore, clinical studies on infected patients revealed that infection-mediated clinical biomarkers, especially pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins, are highly associated with COVID-19. These biomarkers are undermined or overlooked in the context of diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of infected patients. Hence, this review discusses the potential implementation of these biomarkers for COVID-19 electrical biosensing platforms. The secretion range for each biomarker is reviewed based on clinical studies.

Gallium maltolate (GaM), a small metal-organic coordination complex, has been tested in several Phase 1 clinical trials, in which no dose-limiting or other serious toxicity was reported, even at high daily oral doses for several months at a time. For these reasons, GaM may be considered a potential candidate to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and can result in severe, sometimes lethal, inflammatory reactions. In this study, we assessed the ability of GaM to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a culture of Vero E6 cells. METHODS: The efficacy of GaM in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was determined in a screening assay using cultured Vero E6 cells. The cytotoxicity of GaM in uninfected cells was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) colorimetric assay. RESULTS: The results showed that GaM inhibits viral replication in a dose-dependent manner, with the concentration that inhibits replication by 50% (EC(50)) being about 14 M. No cytotoxicity was observed at concentrations up to at least 200 M. CONCLUSION: The in vitro activity of GaM against SARS-CoV-2, together with GaMs known anti-inflammatory activity, provide justification for testing GaM in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Gallium maltolate has in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is a potential treatment for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose RBP-7000 (PERSERIS?) is a once-monthly subcutaneous extended-release risperidone formulation approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. The objective of this study was to describe the long-term impact of RBP-7000 on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), subjective well-being, treatment satisfaction and medication preference in patients with schizophrenia. Patients and methods HRQoL was derived from a 52-week multicentre Phase III single-arm open-label outpatient study that assessed the safety and efficacy of RBP-7000 (120 mg) in patients with schizophrenia. HRQoL was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L and Short-Form Survey SF-36 version 2; well-being using the Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptic Treatment - Short Version (SWN-S); satisfaction using the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire and medication preference using the Preference of Medication questionnaire. Results Of 482 participants at baseline, 234 remained through the end of study (EOS; week 52). Mean HRQoL and well-being scores remained stable between baseline (EQ-5D-5L index: 0.83; SF-36v2 Physical Component Score: 50; SF-36v2 Mental Component Score: 46; total SWN-S score: 89) and EOS (EQ-5D-5L index: 0.86; SF-36v2 Physical Component Score: 49; SF-36v2 Mental Component Score: 47; total SWN-S score: 90). The proportion of participants reporting satisfaction increased between week 4 (66%) and EOS (81%), with a similar trend for the preference of RBP-7000 over previous treatment (week 4: 66%; EOS: 72%). Sensitivity analyses suggested a minor effect of dropout on characterization of change over time in patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures. Conclusion Study participants attained mean HRQoL scores near that of the general US population. Over two-thirds reported high satisfaction with and preference for RBP-7000 across the study period.

METHOD: A DELPHI model study utilizing three rounds of surveys was conducted at four family medicine residency programs in the United States. Resident responses to Survey 1 generated factors perceived to be causing them moral injury or constituting barriers to their seeking help. Thematic analysis identified common themes which were presented to residents in Survey 2 for rating and justification. Results and feedback from Survey 2 were shared with residents in Survey 3, where residents were prompted to reevaluate their ratings for factors and barriers for the purpose of generating consensus among themselves. A ranked list of factors and barriers was thereby created for the participating sites. RESULTS: Residents shared several stories about the factors that most pressured them to violate their moral values. The most severe and frequent factors contributing to moral injury involved disruptions to doctor-patient relationships, patient-family relationships, and relationships with other healthcare professionals. Time was the major barrier to residents seeking help. CONCLUSION: During times of crisis, moral injury among residents may be minimized by protecting and promoting important clinical and professional relationships with patients, colleagues, and other medical professionals.

METHODS: Participants were 181 adolescents (M(age) = 15.23 years; 51% female; 47% Latinx) and their parents. Frequency of parent-adolescent conversations about COVID-19 (i.e., pandemic-related symptoms, health behaviors, and social effects), empathic concern toward vulnerable others, and adolescent HPBs were assessed via surveys in the first months of the pandemic, and empathic concern and HPBs were assessed again nine months later. RESULTS: Results revealed that more frequent parent-adolescent conversations early in the pandemic predicted increased adherence to HPBs throughout the pandemic when adolescents reported low stress (direct effect), but conversation frequency predicted decreased adherence to HPBs via reduced empathic concern when adolescents reported high stress (indirect effect). CONCLUSIONS: Parents and other socialization agents, such as teachers, should be sensitive to adolescents stress prior to engaging them in frequent conversations about the pandemic to mitigate the potential negative impact these conversations may have on adolescents empathic concern and adherence to HPBs. Decreasing adolescents stress may be an initial step in promoting effective message transference.

Performance of many SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR assays is not entirely known due to the lack of a gold standard. We sought to evaluate the false negative rate (FNR) and sensitivity of our laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR targeting the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) genes. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR results at the Public Health Laboratory (Alberta, Canada) from January 21 to April 18, 2020 were reviewed to identify patients with an initial negative rtRT-PCR followed by a positive result on repeat testing within 14 days (defined as discordant results). Negative samples from these discordant specimens were re-tested using three alternate rtRT-PCR assays (targeting the E gene and N1/N2 regions of the nucleocapsid genes) to assess for false negative (FN) results. RESULTS: During the time period specified, 95,919 patients (100,001 samples) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 49 patients were found to have discordant results including 49 positive and 52 negative swabs. Repeat testing of 52 negative swabs found five FNs (from five separate patients). Assuming 100% specificity of the diagnostic assay, the FNR and sensitivity in this group of patients with discordant testing was 9.3% (95% CI 1.5-17.0%) and 90.7% (95% CI 82.6-98.9%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Studies to understand the FNR of routinely used assays are important to confirm adequate clinical performance. In this study, most FN results were due to low amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations in patients with multiple specimens collected during different stages of infection.

The association of NCIEM with the rate of COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 mortality and other potential moderators was assessed using linear regression models. RESULTS: The nationwide number of excess deaths and COVID-19 deaths was 26,701 and 13,710, respectively, with a difference of 12,991.

The obtained foams were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry. Measurements also involved gel fraction, apparent density, air permeability, elastic recovery time, compression set, rebound resilience, and sweat uptake. The results were discussed in the context of modifications to the foam formulation: the isocyanate index (I(NCO)) in the range of 0.6C0.9 and the blowing agent content in the range of 1.2C3.0 php. FTIR analysis revealed a higher level of urea groups with increasing water content in the formulation. Higher I(NCO) and water content levels also led to lower onset temperatures of thermal degradation and higher glass-transition temperatures of the soft phase. A decrease in apparent density and an increase in mean pore sizes of the foams with increasing I(NCO) and water content levels was observed. Functional parameters (air permeability, elastic recovery time, compression set, rebound resilience, and sweat uptake) were also found to be satisfactory at lower I(NCO) and water content levels.","output":"Viscoelastic Polyurethane Foams for Use in Seals of Respiratory Protective Devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, consisting of mRNA, have recently become available The absolute novelty of these vaccines introduces questions about their safety and efficacy, especially in patients who are treated with biological drugs in dermatology The aim of our review was to provide a broad overview of the current use of all available vaccinations in concomitance with biological therapy and to suggest indications for the new mRNA Covid-19 vaccines We conducted a narrative review of the literature regarding the indications and safety of the various types of vaccines currently available in dermatological patients treated with biological therapy The safety and efficacy of administering inactivated vaccines in patients undergoing biological therapy with inhibitors of TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-12/23, and IL-4/13 was confirmed Inactivated vaccines can be administered during therapy with inhibitors of IL-23 and IgE, taking into account that the level of evidence is lower due to the lack of specific studies Live attenuated vaccines were contraindicated in concomitance with all biological therapies considered, except omalizumab According to this evidence, we assume that there are currently no contraindications to the administration of the new Covid-19 BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines during biological therapy with inhibitors of TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-12/23, IL-23, and IL-4/13, since these vaccines are comparable to inactivated ones For patients with chronic urticaria or allergic asthma treated with omalizumab, we currently recommend caution in using the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines (30 min observation) The only contraindications were a previous history of hypersensitivity to the Covid-19 vaccines themself or to their excipients In conclusion, further randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of the antibody response in these patients","output":"Safety and Efficacy of Vaccines during COVID-19 Pandemic in Patients Treated with Biological Drugs in a Dermatological Setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging is a risk factor for progressive fibrotic disorders involving diverse organ systems, including the lung.

Over-expression of the SIRT3 cDNA via airway delivery restored capacity for fibrosis resolution in aged mice, in association with activation of the forkhead box transcription factor, FoxO3a, in fibroblasts, upregulation of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, and recovery of apoptosis susceptibility. While transforming growth factor-1 reduced levels of SIRT3 and FoxO3a in lung fibroblasts, cell non-autonomous effects involving macrophage secreted products were necessary for SIRT3-mediated activation of FoxO3a.

There has been no validation study of the ACE-III in patients with suspected dementia in a Taiwanese population, where the language is traditional Chinese. We aimed to culturally adapt and validate the ACE-III as a cognitive assessment tool for differentiating between people with and without dementia presenting to healthcare professionals in Taiwan with possible dementia. METHODS: We culturally adapted the ACE-III for Taiwan (T-ACE-III) and tested it with consenting patients with suspected dementia in northern Taiwan who had been through the diagnostic process. We calculated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to test the ability of the T-ACE-III to differentiate between dementia and non-dementia cases using clinician diagnosis as the gold standard. We generated the Youden Index to determine the best cut-off score. RESULTS: We recruited 90 Taiwanese individuals aged 49C93 years: 24 males and 33 females had dementia and 12 males and 21 females did not. The area under the ROC curve was 0.99 for distinguishing dementia from non-dementia. The T-ACE-III had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 78.8% when the cut-off score was 86/87. With a cut-off value of 73/74, the specificity was 100.0%, and sensitivity 89.5%. The highest Youden Index was 0.895, indicating the best overall cut-off point to be 73/74.

The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified. This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters. The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23C-25 C than at 4 C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments.

In parallel with the revealed tight association between ASD risk and severity and Zn status, the particular mechanisms linking Zn2+ and ASD pathogenesis like modulation of synaptic plasticity through ProSAP/Shank scaffold, neurotransmitter metabolism, and gut microbiota, have been elucidated. The increasing body of data indicate the potential involvement of Zn2+ metabolism in neurodegeneration. Systemic Zn levels in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease were found to be reduced, whereas its sequestration in brain may result in modulation of amyloid ? and &#945;-synuclein processing with subsequent toxic effects. Zn2+ was shown to possess adipotropic effects through the role of zinc transporters, zinc finger proteins, and Zn-&#945;2-glycoprotein in adipose tissue physiology, underlying its particular role in pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2. Recent findings also contribute to further understanding of the role of Zn2+ in spermatogenesis and sperm functioning, as well as oocyte development and fertilization.

Here, we report preliminary results from a Phase I trial testing BNT162b1 in 144 healthy Chinese participants. The safety profile was broadly comparable to that seen in the American and German trials, with fever the only Grade 3 adverse event reported. Prime-boost vaccination with 10 g or 30 g BNT162b1 induced robust antibody responses in both younger (18 to 55 years of age) and older (65 to 85) Chinese adults, and interferon- T-cell responses to RBD antigen challenge were significantly higher in participants receiving BNT162b1 than those in placebo groups. The 30 g dose induced increased reactogenicity as well as a more favorable vaccine-elicited virus-neutralizing response than the 10 g dose in both younger and older Chinese adults.

Whether reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are beneficial or harmful is controversial. METHODS: We have performed a national retrospective, nonexperimental comparative study from two tertiary hospitals to evaluate the impact of chronic use of RAAS inhibitors in hypertensive COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed to strengthen our findings. RESULTS: Of 849 patients, 422 (49.7%) patients were hypertensive and 310 (73.5%) were taking RAAS inhibitors at baseline. Hypertensive patients were older, had more comorbidities, and a greater incidence of respiratory failure (?0.151 [95% CI ?0.218, ?0.084]). Overall mortality in hypertensive patients was 28.4%, but smaller among those with prescribed RAAS inhibitors before (?0.167 [95% CI ?0.220, ?0.114]) and during hospitalization (0.090 [?0.008,0.188]). Similar findings were observed after two propensity score matches that evaluated the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers among hypertensive patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of hypertensive patients found that age, diabetes mellitus, C-reactive protein, and renal failure were independently associated with all-cause mortality. On the contrary, ACEIs decreased the risk of death (OR 0.444 [95% CI 0.224C0.881]). Meta-analysis suggested a protective benefit of RAAS inhibitors (OR 0.6 [95% CI 0.42C0.8]) among hypertensive COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that RAAS inhibitors may play a protective role in hypertensive COVID-19 patients. This finding was supported by a meta-analysis of the current evidence.

The glutathione S-conjugate is sequentially converted to the cysteinylglycine-, cysteine- and N-acetyl-cysteine S-conjugate (mercapturate). The mercapturate is generally more polar and water soluble than the parent electrophile and is readily excreted. Excretion of the mercapturate represents a detoxication mechanism. Some endogenous compounds, such as leukotrienes, prostaglandin (PG) A2, 15-deoxy-(12,14)-PGJ(2), and hydroxynonenal can also be metabolized to mercapturates and excreted. On occasion, however, formation of glutathione S- and cysteine S-conjugates are bioactivation events as the metabolites are mutagenic and/or cytotoxic. When the cysteine S-conjugate contains a strong electron-withdrawing group attached at the sulfur, it may be converted by cysteine S-conjugate -lyases to pyruvate, ammonium and the original electrophile modified to contain an CSH group. If this modified electrophile is highly reactive then the enzymes of the mercapturate pathway together with the cysteine S-conjugate -lyases constitute a bioactivation pathway. Some endogenous halogenated environmental contaminants and drugs are bioactivated by this mechanism. Recent studies suggest that coupling of enzymes of the mercapturate pathway to cysteine S-conjugate -lyases may be more common in nature and more widespread in the metabolism of electrophilic xenobiotics than previously realized.","output":"Enzymes Involved in Processing Glutathione Conjugates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The U.S. has the highest number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and deaths of any nation.

It is unclear how this Executive Order has affected the spread of COVID-19 in NYC. Methods: A dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission among NYC residents was developed to assess the effect of the Executive Order on face mask use on infections and deaths due to COVID-19 in NYC. Data on daily and cumulative COVID-19 infections and deaths were obtained from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Results: The Executive Order on face mask use is estimated to avert 99,517 (95% CIs: 72,723-126,312) COVID-19 infections and 7,978 (5,692-10,265) deaths in NYC.

WEPs provided food, nutrition, herbs and other plant products for people in underdeveloped areas, such as the Everest region, to maintain their daily lives. Chenthang Town is the only Sherpa ethnic township in Tibet, China. The core purpose of this research is to investigate, collect and record the WEPs and related local knowledge and functions within the Sherpa community. The ultimate goal is to answer the question of why Sherpa people choose these particular plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The field study was carried out in the six Sherpa communities of Chenthang Township from September 2019 to August 2020. The WEPs and related local knowledge were collected through semistructured interviews and direct observations. The field work was performed with the assistance of local guides. During the field survey, we collected plant specimens based on the principle of one plant with one vernacular name. In this study, we utilised a use report (UR) and cultural importance index (CI) to evaluate the comprehensive utilization value of WEPs in the daily diet of Sherpa people. RESULTS: We interviewed 78 people individually who provided us with 1199 use reports. In total, we collected 84 WEPs belonging to 65 genera in 41 families. These species were identified as 78 distinct ethno-species by local people, and the vernacular name of each ethno-species was recorded. Then, these use reports were classified into six use categories. All these plants were native wild plants. In these plants, Arisaema utile, Sorbus cuspidata and Elaeagnus umbellata have been introduced into home gardens by local people. Following the description of the Sherpa people, we articulated a collection calendar for WEPs. The Sherpa collect WEPs throughout nearly the entire year, January and February being the exceptions. CONCLUSION: The collection calendar of wild edible plants reflects the wisdom of the Sherpa in terms of survival. The Sherpa cleverly survive the food shortage periods by harnessing the phenology of different species. In general, WEPs can provide the Sherpa with seasonal carbohydrates, nutrition, healthcare supplements and other products and services necessary for survival, which is likely why the Sherpa choose these plants.","output":"Collection calendar: the diversity and local knowledge of wild edible plants used by Chenthang Sherpa people to treat seasonal food shortages in Tibet, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrhea represents one of the most frequent disorders in dogs.

Research has shown that apart from the breast cancer cells themselves, other cells and molecules in the vicinity (the tumor microenvironment) also greatly contribute to the ability of breast cancer to metastasize. In this review article, we discuss recent advances in research about how breast cancer cells interact with other cells and molecules around them. We also highlight some new technologies to further unravel the nature of this interaction and how this could be beneficial in developing more effective treatments for advanced breast cancer patients. ABSTRACT: The tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in the tumorigenesis, progression, and metastatic spread of many cancers including breast. There is now increasing evidence to support the observations that a bidirectional interplay between breast cancer cells and stromal cells exists within the tumor and the tumor microenvironment both at the primary tumor site and at the metastatic site. This interaction occurs through direct cell to cell contact, or by the release of autocrine or paracrine factors which can activate pro-tumor signaling pathways and modulate tumor behavior. In this review, we will highlight recent advances in our current knowledge about the multiple interactions between breast cancer cells and neighboring cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes, innate and adaptive immune cells) in the tumor microenvironment that coordinate to regulate metastasis. We also highlight the role of exosomes and circulating tumor cells in facilitating breast cancer metastasis. We discuss some key markers associated with stromal cells in the breast tumor environment and their potential to predict patient survival and guide treatment. Finally, we will provide some brief perspectives on how current technologies may lead to the development of more effective therapies for the clinical management of breast cancer patients.","output":"The Breast Tumor Microenvironment: A Key Player in Metastatic Spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Visual exploration of gene product behavior across multiple omic datasets can pinpoint technical limitations in data and reveal biological trends. Still, such exploration is challenging as there is a need for visualizations that are tailored for the purpose. RESULTS: The OmicLoupe software was developed to facilitate visual data exploration and provides more than 15 interactive cross-dataset visualizations for omics data. It expands visualizations to multiple datasets for quality control, statistical comparisons and overlap and correlation analyses, while allowing for rapid inspection and downloading of selected features. The usage of OmicLoupe is demonstrated in three different studies, where it allowed for detection of both technical data limitations and biological trends across different omic layers. An example is an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on two previously published studies, where OmicLoupe facilitated the identification of gene products with consistent expression changes across datasets at both the transcript and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: OmicLoupe provides fast exploration of omics data with tailored visualizations for comparisons within and across data layers. The interactive visualizations are highly informative and are expected to be useful in various analyses of both newly generated and previously published data.

However, a design strategy for antidote sequences against bivalent aptamers has not been established. OBJECTIVES: To develop bivalent TBAs using M08, which exhibits higher anticoagulant activity than the previously reported exosite Cbinding DNA aptamers, such as HD1, an exosite Cbinding DNA aptamer (HD22) was linked to M08 with various types of linkers. In addition, short\\\\length complementary ssDNAs were designed to neutralize the optimized bivalent aptamer effectively and rapidly. RESULTS: Among the bivalent aptamers of M08 linked to HD22 with various types of linkers, M08\\\\T15\\\\HD22 possessed approximately 5\\\\fold higher anticoagulant activity than previously reported bivalent aptamers. To neutralize the activity of the 87\\\\meric M08\\\\T15\\\\HD22, complementary ssDNA sequences with different lengths and hybridization segments were designed. The complementary sequence against the M08 moiety played a more important role in neutralizing than that against the HD22 moiety. Hybridization of the T15 linker in the M08\\\\T15\\\\HD22 with the A15 sequence in the antidote accelerated neutralization due to toehold\\\\mediated strand displacement. Interestingly, some shorter\\\\length antidotes showed higher neutralizing activity than the full complementary 87\\\\meric antidote, and the shortest, 34\\\\meric antidote, neutralized most effectively. CONCLUSIONS: A pair comprising an 87\\\\meric bivalent TBA containing M08 and a 34\\\\meric short\\\\length antidote with high anticoagulant and rapid neutralizing activities was developed.

For proper translation of these results to clinical guidelines, it is essential to determine how well the general population is reflected in the study populations of these trials. This study was conducted among 7162 participants (age-range: 51C106 years; 58% women) from the Rotterdam Study. We quantified the proportion of participants that would be eligible for the nine ongoing phase-III trials. We further quantified the eligibility among participants at high risk to develop severe COVID-19. Since many trials were not explicit in their exclusion criterion with respect to acute or unstable preexisting diseases, we performed two analyses. First, we included all participants irrespective of this criterion. Second, we excluded persons with acute or unstable preexisting diseases. 97% of 7162 participants was eligible for any trial with eligibility for separate trials ranging between 11C97%. For high-risk individuals the corresponding numbers were 96% for any trial with separate trials ranging from 5C96%. Importantly, considering persons ineligible due to acute or unstable pre-existing disease drastically dropped the eligibilities for all trials below 43% for the total population and below 36% for high-risk individuals. The eligibility for ongoing vaccine trials against SARS-CoV-2 can reduce by half depending on interpretation and application of a single unspecified exclusion criterion.

Classrooms are one of the suspected places, where usually students are closely placed to learn together as in times before the pandemic. To reduce the infection rate in classrooms, an air purifier was designed around a commercial filter which removes 99, 9% of particles with 3m. A baseline optical study of air purification was carried out to ensure effectiveness of the purifier during operation in closed environment. With conclusive evidence of microscopic images, breathing tests and aerosol penetration test using oil, the filter effectiveness was recorded. Optical values for suspended particle counts are recorded for variations in air flow rates of the air purifier and the gradual change is helping to understand the filter performance. Already around 70% minimum effectiveness of one flattened tissue layer removed from the filter was recorded during the tests, where the functional filter is folded in zigzags and 25 times thicker than a single layer. Furthermore, microscopic images showed solids deposited on the filter fabric and fuzzy spots on the tissue could indicate possible dried aerosol spots. This could be the hint supporting the hypothesis that aerosols can be effectively filtered reducing the virus load thus also risk of super-spreading of potential infection risk to an acceptable level. Beyond this research, and with the same group, measurements were made finding out the degree of reduction in potential aerosols particles in a classroom with a continuously aerosol emitting person.

Little is known about which therapeutic interventions are more cost-effective. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was carried out to identify and critically appraise the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of CFS/ME interventions. METHODS: The review protocol was prespecified (PROSPERO: CRD42018118731). Searches were carried out across two databasesMEDLINE (1946C2020) and EMBASE (1974C2020). Additional studies were identified by searching reference lists. Only peer-reviewed journal articles of full economic evaluations examining CFS/ME interventions were included. Trial- and/or model-based economic evaluations were eligible. Data extraction and screening were carried out independently by two reviewers. The methodological quality of the economic evaluation and trial were assessed using the Consensus Health Economic Criteria checklist (CHEC-list) and Risk of Bias-2 (RoB-2) tool, respectively. A narrative synthesis was used to summarise the economic evidence for interventions for adults and children in primary and secondary care settings. RESULTS: Ten economic evaluations, all based on data derived from randomised controlled trials, met our eligibility criteria. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was evaluated across five studies, making it the most commonly evaluated intervention. There was evidence from three trials to support CBT as a cost-effective treatment option for adults; however, findings on CBT were not uniform, suggesting that cost-effectiveness may be context-specific. A wide array of other interventions were evaluated in adults, including limited evidence from two trials supporting the cost effectiveness of graded exercise therapy (GET). Just one study assessed intervention options for children. Our review highlighted the importance of informal care costs and productivity losses in the evaluation of CFS/ME interventions. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a limited patchwork of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of interventions for CFS/ME. Evidence supports CBT as a cost-effective treatment option for adults; however, cost-effectiveness may depend on the duration and frequency of sessions. Limited evidence supports the cost effectiveness of GET. Key weaknesses in the literature included small sample sizes and short duration of follow-up. Further research is needed on pharmacological interventions and therapies for children.

Sequence analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12) sequences from 30,366 different isolates were analysed for possible mutations. FDA-approved and investigational drugs were screened for interaction with both mutant and wild-type Nsp12CNsp8 interfaces. Sequence analysis revealed that 70.42% of Nsp12 sequences showed conserved P323L mutation, located in the Nsp8 binding cleft. Compounds were screened for interface interaction, any with XP GScores lower than ?7.0 kcal/mol were considered as possible interface inhibitors. RX-3117 (fluorocyclopentenyl cytosine) and Nebivolol had the highest binding affinities in both mutant and wild-type enzymes, therefore they were selected and resultant proteinCligand complexes were simulated for analysis of stability over 100 ns. Although the selected ligands had partial mobility in the binding cavity, they were not removed from the binding pocket after 100 ns. The ligand RX-3117 remained in the same position in the binding pocket of the mutant and wild-type enzyme after 100 ns MD simulation. However, the ligand Nebivolol folded and embedded in the binding pocket of mutant Nsp12 protein.

One negative consequence of the ongoing pandemic is anxiety brought about by uncertainty and the COVID-19 disease. Increased anxiety is a potential risk factor for wellbeing at work. This study investigated psychological, situational, and socio-demographic predictors of COVID-19 anxiety using longitudinal data. Methods: A nationally representative sample of Finnish workers (N = 1308) was collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Eighty percent of the participants responded to the follow-up study (N = 1044). COVID-19 anxiety was measured with a modified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Psychological and situational predictors included perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, personality, social support received from the work community, and remote working. A number of socio-demographic factors were also investigated. Results: Perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, and neuroticism were identified as robust psychological predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. Increase in psychological distress and technostress during the COVID-19 crisis predicted higher COVID-19 anxiety. A recent change in their field of work and decreased social support from work communities predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Women and young people experienced higher anxiety. Conclusions: Different factors explain workers' COVID-19 anxiety.

Methods: We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and the Cochrane criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL, and pre-print services (medRxiv) from January 1, 2020 to December 27, 2020. Findings: Our review included 14 studies with 11,746 HCWs from 16 countries. The estimated overall prevalence of adverse events among HCWs was 78% (95% CI: 66.7-87.5%) with a range from 42.8% to 95.1% among studies. The prevalence of adverse events was higher for the studies with poor quality compared to those with moderate quality (83.5% vs. 67.1%), while increased sample size was related to decreased prevalence (p<0.001). The most frequent adverse events were headache (55.9%), dry skin (54.4%), dyspnoea (53.4%), pressure injuries (40.4%), itching (39.8%), hyperhidrosis (38.5%), and dermatitis (31.0%).

Previous studies investigating community\\\\level relationships between plant functional trait characteristics and stream environmental characteristics remain scarce. Here, we used community\\\\weighted means to identify how plant traits link to lowland stream typology and how agricultural intensity in the catchment affects trait composition. 2. We analysed plant trait characteristics in 772 European lowland streams to test the following two hypotheses: (i) trait characteristics differ between plant communities in small and medium\\\\sized streams, reflecting adaptations to different habitat characteristics, and (ii) trait characteristics vary with the intensity of agricultural land use in the stream catchment, mediated either directly by an increase in productive species or indirectly by an increase in species that efficiently intercept and utilize light. 3. We found that the communities in small streams were characterized by a higher abundance of light\\\\demanding species growing from single apical meristems, reproducing by seeds and rooted to the bottom with floating and/or heterophyllous leaves, whereas the community in medium\\\\sized streams was characterized by a higher abundance of productive species growing from multi\\\\apical and basal growth meristems forming large canopies. 4. We also found indications that community trait characteristics were affected by eutrophication. We did not find enhanced abundance of productive species with an increasing proportion of agriculture in the catchments. Instead, we found an increase in the abundance of species growing from apical and multi\\\\apical growth meristems as well as in the abundance of species tolerant of low light availability. The increase in the abundance of species possessing these traits likely reflects different strategies to obtain greater efficiency in light interception and utilization in nutrient\\\\enriched environments. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings challenge the general assumption of the EU Water Framework Directive compliant assessment systems that plant community patterns in streams reflect the nutrient preference of the community. Instead, light availability and the ability to improve interception and utilization appeared to be of key importance for community composition in agricultural lowland streams. We therefore suggest moving from existing approaches building on species\\\\specific preference values for nutrients to determine the level of nutrient impairment to trait\\\\based approaches that provide insight into the biological mechanisms underlying the changes.

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding. RESULTS: Among 99 patients, 61 patients had SARS-CoV-2 clearance (virus-negative group), but 38 patients had sustained positive results (virus-positive group). The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 excretion was 15 (interquartile range, 12-19) days among the virus-negative patients. The shedding time was significantly increased if the fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA test result was positive. Male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .35-.98]), immunoglobulin use (HR, 0.42 [95% CI, .24-.76]), APACHE II score (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, .84-.96]), and lymphocyte count (HR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.05-3.1]) were independent factors associated with a prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding. Antiviral therapy and corticosteroid treatment were not independent factors. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance time was associated with sex, disease severity, and lymphocyte function. The current antiviral protocol and low-to-moderate dosage of corticosteroid had little effect on the duration of viral excretion.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Factors Associated With Long-Term Viral Excretion in Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: a Single-Center 28-Day Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Major trauma reduced by over a third during the institution of UK level-4 national lockdown (Rajput K. et al;2020). Easing of lockdown on a societal level posed unprecedented uncertainties. With the easing of restrictions, it is expected that the quantity of trauma would increase. In the absence of 'normality' it remains uncertain about the extent of the quantity, severity and aetiology of the trauma. The effect of lockdown easing on patterns of traumatic admissions has not been studied and it has important implications upon service provision. Method: A retrospective cohort study using the data from 2017-2019 were used as a 3-year control to compare each month of 2020. Regional trauma data (TARN data) from Aintree level-1 Major Trauma Centre, the regional tertiary Specialist Units. Easing of restrictions to the regional tier system began in May-July. This index 3months was compared to the control data. Results: Following easing of restrictions there was a significant increase in the Incident Severity Scores from trauma admissions. The %mortality during the level-4 lockdown decreases but as restrictions are eased there is an increase in the % mortality. The number of stabbings and road traffic collisions are also seen to increase following the ease of restrictions. Conclusions: There is a decrease in the number of trauma calls seen following the easing of restrictions, yet the severity of the incident and the mortality rate has increased. Therefore, is the trauma more severe of does COVID-19 influence this? .","output":"Characterising the escalation in hospital trauma admission during the easing of the CIVID-19 level 4 lockdown restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Socialist cooperation is as morally preferable as it is pragmatically necessary.

Moreover, widespread adoption of socialist cooperation would ensure compensation of the workforce at levels adequate to overcoming any impending crisis of overproduction, also eliminating the free rider dynamic which holds back cooperatively enhanced R&D as well as the availability of the resulting technological development to all, and educational opportunities.

AIMS: To evaluate mental health outcomes among Egyptian healthcare workers (HCW) treating patients with confirmed or suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) to direct the promotion of mental wellbeing, by screening for symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, depression and stress, and analyzing potential risk factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional, hospital-based survey study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 502 HCW dealing with COVID-19. HCW were surveyed in 20 hospitals (Fever, Chest, and Quarantine hospitals) in different parts of Egypt, in April and May 2020. RESULTS: Among the 502 HCW surveyed; 60.0% were physicians, 16.1% were specialized nurses, and 23.9% were non-specialized nurses. About 35.3% worked in chest hospitals, 17.5% in fever hospitals, and 47.2% in quarantine hospitals. A considerable proportion of HCW had symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, depression, and stress. Females were at higher risk of experiencing symptoms of severe anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.12-3.05; p = .016), severe depression (OR, 2.013; 95% CI, 1.17-3.4; p = .011), and severe stress (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6; p < .001). Fever hospital workers were at higher risk of severe depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; p < .01), compared to Quarantine hospital workers.

To the author's knowledge, there are several indicators of skeletal maturity, but there remains a lack of consensus regarding their application when determining surgical timing. The purpose of this study was to determine the most accurate skeletal maturity indicator in predicting facial growth maturation. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review was done to determine the most predictive indicator for facial growth maturity. We hypothesized that menses' onset was the most predictive of these maturity indicators. This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus databases, and Google Scholar, was done in October 2020 to identify citations related to maturity indicators assessing craniofacial growth. The quality of evidence was determined using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Cohort Studies. RESULTS Of the 13,289 articles screened, 1 retrospective and 1 prospective study met inclusion criteria. No articles were identified that provided evidence for our hypothesis. Based on the 2 included studies, it was concluded that a handwrist x-ray was more predictive of facial growth cessation (compared to other skeletal maturity indicators). CONCLUSIONS Based on the literature, handwrist radiography serves as the most predictive method in determining the facial growth maturity.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consultations and diagnoses in gastroenterology practices in Germany. To this end, we retrospectively analyzed data from the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). We included all patients aged 18 years with at least one visit to one of 48 gastroenterology practices in Germany between April and September 2019 and April and September 2020. A total of 63,914 patients in the 2nd quarter of 2019, 63,701 in the 3rd quarter of 2019, 55,769 in the 2nd quarter of 2020, and 60,446 in the 3rd quarter of 2020 were included. Overall, a clear downward trend in the number of visits to gastroenterologists was observed in the 2nd quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 (?13%, p = 0.228). The decrease in consultations was particularly pronounced in patients &gt;70 years of age (?17%, p = 0.096). This trend was evident for all gastrointestinal diagnoses except for tumors. Most notably, rates of gastrointestinal infections (?19%) or ulcers (?43%) were significantly lower in this period than in the same quarter of 2019. Reflecting the course of the pandemic, the differences between the 3rd quarter of 2020 and that of 2019 were less pronounced (?5%, p = 0.560). Our data show that the pandemic changed patients' behavior with respect to the health care system.

This is largely due to the action of coenzyme A-independent transacylase (CoA-IT), which transfers the AA primarily from diacyl choline-containing phospholipids to ethanolamine-containing phospholipids. In this work we have comparatively analyzed glycerophospholipid changes leading to AA mobilization in mouse peritoneal macrophages responding to either zymosan or serum-opsonized zymosan (OpZ). These two phagocytic stimuli promote the cytosolic phospholipase A2-dependent mobilization of AA by activating distinct surface receptors. Application of mass spectrometry-based lipid profiling to identify changes in AA-containing phospholipids during macrophage exposure to both stimuli revealed significant decreases in the levels of all major choline phospholipid molecular species and a major phosphatidylinositol species. Importantly, while no changes in ethanolamine phospholipid species were detected on stimulation with zymosan, significant decreases in these species were observed when OpZ was used. Analyses of CoA-IT-mediated AA remodeling revealed that the process occurred faster in the zymosan-stimulated cells compared with OpZ-stimulated cells. Pharmacological inhibition of CoA-IT strongly blunted AA release in response to zymosan but had only a moderate effect on the OpZ-mediated response. These results suggest a hitherto undescribed receptor-dependent role for CoA-independent AA remodeling reactions in modulating the eicosanoid biosynthetic response of macrophages. Our data help define novel targets within the AA remodeling pathway with potential use to control lipid mediator formation.","output":"Phospholipid Arachidonic Acid Remodeling During Phagocytosis in Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Efforts have been devoted to screening various prevalent diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is currently the most widely used, has high accuracy, but it requires several facilities and takes a relatively long time to check; so, new testing technology is necessary for a higher test efficiency. A chemiluminescence (CL) sensor is a relatively simple device and suitable as an alternative because it can detect very precise specimens. However, in measurements via CL, the quantitative formulation of reagents that cause color development is important. In the case of mixing using micropipettes, precise analysis is possible, but this technique is limited by uncontrollable errors or deviations in detection amounts. In addition, in using a microfluidic chip to increase field applicability, a syringe pump or other quantification injection tools are required, so problems must be overcome for practical use. Therefore, in this study, a microchip was designed and manufactured to supply a sample of a certain volume by simply blowing air and injecting a sample into the chamber. By utilizing the luminescence reaction of luminol, CuSO(4) and H(2)O(2) the performance of the prepared chip was confirmed, and the desired amount of the sample could be injected with a simple device with an error rate of 2% or less.

Comparative data that define humoral responses to the Oxford-AstraZeneca (AZ) and BNT162b2(Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccines are limited. METHODS: We recruited 920 kidney transplant patients receiving at least 1 dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine excluding patients with virus preexposure. Serological status was determined with the COVID-SeroKlir ELISA (Kantaro-EKF Diagnostics). Patients with a corrected antibody level of <0.7 AU/mL were considered seronegative. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-five AZ and 141 Pfizer patients had a sample analyzed after first and 593 after second dose (346 AZ versus 247 Pfizer). After first dose, 25.7% of patients seroconverted (26.6% AZ, 22.8% Pfizer). After second dose 148 (42.8%) of AZ seroconverted compared with 130 (52.6%) of Pfizer (P = 0.02; hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.06). When negative responders were excluded, Pfizer patients were shown to have significantly higher response than AZ patients (median 2.6 versus 1.78 AU/mL, P = 0.005).Patients on mycophenolate had a reduced seroconversion rate (42.2% versus 61.4%; P < 0.001; hazard ratio, 2.17) and reduced antibody levels (0.47 versus 1.22 AU/mL, P = 0.001), and this effect was dose dependent (P = 0.05). Prednisolone reduced the seroconversion from 58.2% to 43.6% (P = 0.03) among Pfizer but not in AZ recipients.

We cover aspects on preclinical, clinical, and population pharmacokinetics of different drugs used for drug-susceptible TB and multidrug-resistant TB. Moreover, we include available data to support therapeutic drug monitoring of these drugs and known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets that can be used for optimization of therapy. We have identified a wide range of population pharmacokinetic models for first- and second-line drugs used for TB, which included models built on NONMEM, Pmetrics, ADAPT, MWPharm, Monolix, Phoenix, and NPEM2 software.

Wearing gloves after using hand sanitizers may cause skin irritation and dryness. Wearing masks were effective in reducing the probability of infection with COVID-19, but wearing them for long time cause many problems. This paper was aimed to compare between Saudi and Egyptian HCWs upon using sanitizers and personal protective equipment (PPE) during COVID-19 pandemic. Data was collected through a well-structured questionnaire, among Saudi HCWs (online) and Egyptian HCWs through paper questionnaire interview. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions about Socio-demographic, types of masks, gloves and sanitizers they used during their works. It includes the adverse skin reactions on hands and face upon using PPE for long periods during COVID 19 pandemic. Our results revealed that most of Saudi & Egyptian HCWs wearing surgical masks (57.8% & 63.6%), &gt; N95 (12.9% & 18.2%), using latex surgical gloves (44.9% & 56.8%), &gt; plastic gloves (11.1% & 18.2%) respectively. The most affected area from wearing PPE are hands (49.8% & 54.5%) followed by Auricular area (44% & 40.9%), nasal bridge (28.9% & 22.7%), check (16.9% & 13.6%), whole face (15.6% & 25%) among Saudi & Egyptian HCWs respectively. About 70% of Egyptian HCWs from our participants used alcohol 70% in form of gel as sanitizer which was significantly higher than Saudi HCWs (59.1%). While no significant differences were found from using other sanitizers such as liquid alcohol 70% or Dettol. The most adverse reaction due to using sanitizers was skin dryness (55.1% & 63.6%) among Saudi & Egyptian HCWs respectively. We can conclude that significant increase was found among HCWs in Egypt either in wearing surgical and N95 masks or in wearing surgical and plastic gloves when compared to Saudi HCWs. According to the side effects on hands and face due to wearing PPE among HCWs either from KSA or Egypt, there were some variations by increase or decrease in the percentages. The most adverse reaction due to using sanitizers (specially alcohol 70% in form of gel) was skin dryness.","output":"Comparative Study upon using Sanitizers and Personal Protective Equipment during COVID-19 Pandemic between Saudi and Egyptian Health Care Providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic diseases are not a new phenomenon, but easy access to transport in the modern world has accelerated their spread.

Samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS, n=10), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=47) with or without rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP2) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=10) with or without RF, were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using 17 commercially available lateral flow assays (LFA), two ELISA kits and one in-house developed IgG multiplex bead-based assay. Six LFA and the in-house validated IgG assay correctly produced negative results for all samples. However, the majority of assays (n=13), gave false positive signal for samples from patients with RA and SLE. This was most notable in samples from RF positive RA patients. No false positive samples were detected in any assay using samples from patients with MS. Poor specificity of commercial serological assays could possibly be, at least partly, due to interfering antibodies in samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

To overcome this limitation, we incorporate a new source of individual sentiment, emojis, which contain thousands of graphic symbols and are increasingly being used for expressing emotion in online conversations. We examined popular sentiment analysis algorithms, including rule-based and classification algorithms, to evaluate the impact of supplementing emojis as additional features to improve the algorithm performance. Emojis were also translated into corresponding sentiment words when constructing features for comparison with those directly generated from emoji label words. In addition, considering different functions of emojis in texts, we classified all posts in the dataset by their emoji usage and examined the changes in algorithm performance. We found that emojis are effective as expanding features for improving the accuracy of sentiment analysis algorithms, and the algorithm performance can be further increased by taking different emoji usages into consideration. In this study, we developed an improved emoji-embedding model based on Bi-LSTM (namely, CEmo-LSTM), which achieves the highest accuracy (around 0.95) when analyzing online Chinese texts. We applied the CEmo-LSTM algorithm to a large dataset collected from Weibo from December 1, 2019 to March 20, 2020 to understand the sentiment evolution of online users during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Besides probing PPIs with immunoprecipitation-based techniques, peptide pull-downs are an alternative tool specifically useful to study interactome changes induced by post-translational modifications. Peptides for pull-downs can be chemically synthesized and thus offer the possibility to include amino acid exchanges and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the pull-down reaction. The combination of peptide pull-down and analysis of the binding partners with mass spectrometry offers the direct measurement of interactome changes induced by PTMs or by amino acid exchanges in the interaction site. The possibility of large-scale peptide synthesis on a membrane surface opened the possibility to systematically analyze interactome changes for mutations of many proteins at the same time. Short linear motifs (SLiMs) are amino acid patterns that can mediate protein binding. A significant number of SLiMs are located in regions of proteins, which are lacking a secondary structure, making the interaction motifs readily available for binding reactions. Peptides are particularly well suited to study protein interactions, which are based on SLiM-mediated binding.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess myths, beliefs, perceptions, and information gaps about COVID-19 in Ethiopia. METHODS: An internet-based survey was conducted in Ethiopia from April 22 to May 04, 2020. The survey link was promoted through emails, social media, and the Jimma University website. Perceptions about COVID-19 have considered the World Health Organization (WHO) resources and local beliefs. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 20.0. Classifications and lists of factors for each thematic perception of facilitators, inhibitors, and information needs were generated. Explanatory factor analysis (EFA) was executed to assist categorizations. Standardized mean scores of the categories were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests. A significant difference was claimed at p-value <0.05. RESULTS: A total of 929 responses were gathered during the study period. The EFA generated two main categories of perceived facilitators of COVID-19 spread: behavioral non-adherence (55.9%) and lack of enablers (86.5%). Behavioral non-adherence was illustrated by fear of stigma (62.9%), not seeking care (59.3%), and hugging and shaking (44.8%). Perceived lack of enablers of precautionary measures includes staying home impossible due to economic challenges (92.4%), overcrowding (87.6%), and inaccessible face masks (81.6%) and hand sanitizers (79.1%). Perceived inhibitors were categorized into three factors: two misperceived, myths (31.6%) and false assurances (32.9%), and one correctly identified; engagement in standard precautions (17.1%). Myths about protection from the virus involve perceived religiosity and effectiveness of selected food items, hot weather, traditional medicine, and alcohol drinking, ranging from 15.1% to 54.7%. False assurances include peoples perception that they were living far away from areas where COVID-19 was rampant (36.9%), and no locally reported cases were present (29.5%). There were tremendous information needs reported about COVID-19 concerning protection methods (62.6%), illness behavior and treatment (59.5%), and quality information, including responses to key unanswered questions such as the origin of the virus (2.4%). Health workers were perceived as the most at-risk group (83.3%). The children, adolescents, youths were marked at low to moderate (45.1%-62.2%) risk of COVID-19. Regional, township, and access to communication showed significant variations in myths, false assurances, and information needs (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Considering young population as being at low risk of COVID-19 would be challenging to the control efforts, and needs special attention. Risk communication and community engagement efforts should consider regional and township variations of myths and false assurances. It should also need to satisfy information needs, design local initiatives that enhance community ownership of the control of the virus, and thereby support engagement in standard precautionary measures.

The hormone oxytocin has been shown to increase HRV in non-clinical samples, but its potential impact on HRV in persons with chronic pain is unknown. This study investigated the impact of intranasal oxytocin on HRV in persons with chronic neck and shoulder pain. Participants included 24 individuals with chronic neck and shoulder pain lasting >12months and 24 age- and sex-matched pain-free controls. In a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, participants self-administered intranasal oxytocin (24IU) in one session, and placebo in another, before HRV was recorded at rest and during a mental arithmetic task. Intranasal oxytocin did not influence HRV at rest. However, compared to placebo, intranasal oxytocin elicited small decreases in low-frequency and high-frequency HRV in both groups during the mental arithmetic task. These results suggest that intranasal oxytocin may enhance the salience of the mental arithmetic task, leading to reduced engagement of the parasympathetic nervous system when completing the task. Further investigation and replication of these findings are required to improve our understanding of the effects of intranasal oxytocin on autonomic functioning both at rest and under cognitive stress.","output":"Intranasal oxytocin reduces heart rate variability during a mental arithmetic task: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An effective lithium-ion battery (LIB) recycling infrastructure is of great importance to alleviate the concerns over the disposal of waste LIBs and the sustainability of critical elements for producing LIB components.

METHODS: Five non-duplicate isolates of different species, carrying tmexCD-toprJ gene clusters or novel subtypes, were isolated from patients across China between November 2018 and June 2019. WGS was performed using Illumina and Nanopore platforms. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using a dataset of 77 sequences carrying the tmexCD-toprJ gene clusters, 72 of which were downloaded from NCBI with a blastn identity cut-off of 95%. RESULTS: We detected six different transfer units and two novel subtypes (tmexC1D1.2-toprJ1 and tmexC2D2.2-toprJ2) of the tmexCD-toprJ gene clusters. Among the six transfer units, three were mediated by IS26, while the rest were presumably mediated by Tn5393, hypothetical integrases (xerD-hp clusters-umuC-integrases-tnfxB2-tmexC2D2-toprJ2-umuC) and hypothetical units (hp-hp-hp-tnfxB2-tmexC2D2.2-toprJ2-Tn5393-Tn6292).

Reperfusion may cause blood-brain barrier disruption and a risk for cerebral edema and secondary parenchymal hemorrhage (PH). We aimed to investigate the effect of recanalization on development of early CED and PH after recanalization therapy. Methods- From the SITS-International Stroke Treatment Registry, we selected patients with signs of artery occlusion at baseline (either Hyperdense Artery Sign or computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging angiographic occlusion). We defined recanalization as the disappearance of radiological signs of occlusion at 22 to 36 hours. Primary outcome was moderate to severe CED and secondary outcome was PH on 22- to 36-hour imaging scans. We used logistic regression with adjustment for baseline variables and PH. Results- Twenty two thousand one hundred eighty-four patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (n=18 318 received intravenous thrombolysis, n=3071 received intravenous thrombolysis+thrombectomy, n=795 received thrombectomy). Recanalization occurred in 64.1%. Median age was 71 versus 71 years and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 15 versus 16 in the recanalized versus nonrecanalized patients respectively.

The overproduction of various inflammatory factors is involved in the pathogenesis of DN. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) modulates the expression of a series of cytokines and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) activity. cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and lysine methyltransferase 5A (KMT5A) have been reported to participate in the maintenance of a healthy endothelium. In the present study, we hypothesise that CREB associates with KMT5A to modulate PTP1B expression, thus contributing to high glucose-mediated glomerular endothelial inflammation. Our analyses revealed that plasma inflammatory factor levels, glomerular endothelial p65 phosphorylation and PTP1B expression were increased in DN patients and rats. In vitro, high glucose increased endothelial inflammatory factor levels and p65 phosphorylation by augmenting PTP1B expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, high glucose decreased CREB and KMT5A expression. CREB overexpression and KMT5A overexpression both inhibited high glucose-induced PTP1B expression, p65 phosphorylation and endothelial inflammatory factor levels. si-CREB- and sh-KMT5A-induced p65 phosphorylation and endothelial inflammatory factor levels were reversed by si-PTP1B. Furthermore, CREB was associated with KMT5A. Mechanistic research indicated that CREB and histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me1, a downstream target of KMT5A) occupy the PTP1B promoter region. sh-KMT5A augmented PTP1B promoter activity and activated the positive effect of si-CREB on PTP1B promoter activity. Our in vivo study demonstrated that CREB and KMT5A were downregulated in glomerular endothelial cells of DN patients and rats. In conclusion, CREB associates with KMT5A to promote PTP1B expression in vascular endothelial cells, thus contributing to hyperglycemia-induced inflammatory factor levels in DN patients and rats.","output":"The CREB/KMT5A complex regulates PTP1B to modulate high glucose-induced endothelial inflammatory factor levels in diabetic nephropathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automated assays for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics have recently come available.

In this study, differences in glucose metabolism between adeno- and squamous cell NSCLCs were quantified using the hypoxia and glycolysis-related markers glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and 4 (MCT4) vasculature, and 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG)-uptake. Relevance of these markers for disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed. METHODS Patients with curatively resected stage I to II and resectable stage IIIA, cN0-1 adeno- or squamous cell NSCLC, of whom fresh-frozen lung resection biopsies and pretreatment FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) scans were available, were included in this study (n = 108). FDG-uptake was quantified by calculating total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Metabolic marker expression was measured by immunofluorescent staining (protein) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA]). Patients were retrospectively evaluated for DFS. RESULTS mRNA and protein expression of metabolic markers, with the exception of MCT4, and TLG were higher in squamous cell carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas, whereas adenocarcinomas were better vascularized. Adenocarcinomas had a worse DFS compared with squamous cell carcinomas (p = 0.016) based on the potential to metastasize. High TLG was associated with a worse DFS only in adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that the adenocarcinomas exhibit glycolysis under normoxic conditions, whereas squamous cell carcinomas are exposed to diffusion-limited hypoxia resulting in a very high anaerobic glycolytic rate. Although squamous cell carcinomas have a higher FDG-uptake, in general regarded as a poor prognostic factor, adenocarcinomas have a higher metastatic potential and a worse DFS. These findings show that FDG-PET should be interpreted in relation to histology. This may improve the prognostic potential of FDG-PET and may aid in exploiting FDG-PET in treatment strategies allied to histology.","output":"Glucose metabolism in NSCLC is histology-specific and diverges the prognostic potential of 18FDG-PET for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrhea is the second largest cause of mortality worldwide in children from the perinatal period to the age of 5 years.

As-purchased SiC aggregates were efficiently pulverized from 20 to less than 1 micro-meter in a median value (D50). CNT pastes for field emitters were distinctively formulated by a mixing process of the pulverized SiC aggregates and pre-dispersed CNTs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies showed that the optimally pulverized SiC-CNT paste-emitter had a stronger Si 2p3/2signal in the Ni2Si phase than the as-purchased one. The Si 2p3/2signal would represent interfacial reaction of the SiC nano-particle onto Ni from the CNT paste and the Kovar substrate, forming the supporting layer for CNT emitters. The optimal paste-emitter even in a vacuum-sealed tube exhibited a highly reliable field emission current with a high current density of 100 mA/cm2for over 50 h along with good reproducibility.

Covid-19 exposed the need for timely response and data sharing on fast spreading global pandemics. In this study, we investigate the scientific research response from the early stages of the pandemic, and we review key findings on how the early warning systems developed in previous epidemics responded to contain the virus. METHODS: We conducted data mining of scientific literature records from the Web of Science Core Collection, using the topics Covid-19, mortality, immunity, and vaccine. The individual records are analysed in isolation, and the analysis is compared with records on all Covid-19 research topics combined. The data records are analysed with commutable statistical methods, including R Studio's Bibliometrix package, and the Web of Science data mining tool. RESULTS: From historical analysis of scientific data records on viruses, pandemics and mortality, we identified that Chinese universities have not been leading on these topics historically. However, during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese universities are strongly dominating the research on these topics. Despite the current political and trade disputes, we found strong collaboration in Covid-19 research between the US and China. From the analysis on Covid-19 and immunity, we wanted to identify the relationship between different risk factors discussed in the news media. We identified a few clusters, containing references to exercise, inflammation, smoking, obesity and many additional factors. From the analysis on Covid-19 and vaccine, we discovered that although the USA is leading in volume of scientific research on Covid-19 vaccine, the leading 3 research institutions (Fudan, Melbourne, Oxford) are not based in the USA. Hence, it is difficult to predict which country would be first to produce a Covid-19 vaccine.

We evaluated whether syndromic surveillance detects local outbreaks of lower-respiratory infections (LRIs) without swamping true signals by false alarms. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using retrospective hospitalization data, we simulated prospective surveillance for LRI-elevations. Between 1999C2006, a total of 290762 LRIs were included by date of hospitalization and patients place of residence (>80% coverage, 16 million population). Two large outbreaks of Legionnaires disease in the Netherlands were used as positive controls to test whether these outbreaks could have been detected as local LRI elevations. We used a space-time permutation scan statistic to detect LRI clusters. We evaluated how many LRI-clusters were detected in 1999C2006 and assessed likely causes for the cluster-signals by looking for significantly higher proportions of specific hospital discharge diagnoses (e.g. Legionnaires disease) and overlap with regional influenza elevations. We also evaluated whether the number of space-time signals can be reduced by restricting the scan statistic in space or time. In 1999C2006 the scan-statistic detected 35 local LRI clusters, representing on average 5 clusters per year. The known Legionnaires' disease outbreaks in 1999 and 2006 were detected as LRI-clusters, since cluster-signals were generated with an increased proportion of Legionnaires disease patients (p:<0.0001). 21 other clusters coincided with local influenza and/or respiratory syncytial virus activity, and 1 cluster appeared to be a data artifact. For 11 clusters no likely cause was defined, some possibly representing as yet undetected LRI-outbreaks. With restrictions on time and spatial windows the scan statistic still detected the Legionnaires' disease outbreaks, without loss of timeliness and with less signals generated in time (up to 42% decline). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first study that systematically evaluates the performance of space-time syndromic surveillance with nationwide high coverage data over a longer period. The results show that syndromic surveillance can detect local LRI-outbreaks in a timely manner, independent of laboratory-based outbreak detection.

The pyroptosis is mediated by the protein executioner Gasdermin D (GSDMD), which forms pores at the plasma membrane to facilitate IL-1/IL-18 secretion and causes pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in response to a large number of pathogenic and sterile insults. However, an uncontrolled inflammasome activation may drive inflammation-associated diseases. Initially, inflammasome-competent cells were believed to be limited to macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), and monocytes. However, emerging evidence indicates that neutrophils can assemble inflammasomes in response to various stimuli with functional relevance. Interestingly, the regulation of inflammasome in neutrophils appears to be unconventional. This review provides a broad overview of the role and regulation of inflammasomesand more specifically NLRP3in neutrophils.","output":"Specific NLRP3 Inflammasome Assembling and Regulation in Neutrophils: Relevance in Inflammatory and Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has caused disasters and disorders all over the world. India is also going through a challenging situation as the number of infected/positive cases is increasing day by day. Due to the crisis of COVID-19 education system has come to a halt as schools and colleges are closed to slow down and prevent the spread of infection. Nursing institution also closed down and online mode of teaching was done. Hands on training is required to relate theory in to practice which was thwarted due to the pandemic COVID-19. Nursing students were panic and apprehensive about the situation even though they were asked to stay in the hostel. OBJECTIVE: To assess the level of stress and anxiety among the nursing students and to associate the level of stress and anxiety with selected demographic variables. METHODS: The study design was descriptive cross-sectional. The study was conducted in College of Nursing CIHSR among the 3rd Year GNM, 3rd Year and 4th Year B. Sc. Nursing Students. Total enumerative sampling method was used and sample size was 95. Standardized instrument on Perceived stress scale for assessing stress and Corona anxiety scale for assessing anxiety regarding COVID - 19 were used for the study. The study was approved by nursing research committee and informed consent was taken. Data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: The study found that 80(84.2%) had moderate stress out of 95 respondents, 8 (8.4%) had high perceived stress, and 7(7.4%) had low level of stress. In the Coronavirus anxiety scale majority of the respondents, 91(95.8%) have little to no dysfunctional anxiety out of 95 respondents, 2 (2.1%) had possible dysfunctional anxiety and 2 (2.1%) had probable dysfunctional anxiety.

Fifty-six children with ADHD were recruited from Shenzhen Children's Hospital. Participants wore an accelerometer for seven consecutive days to measure physical activity and sleep quality. Activity counts were analyzed to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Four sleep parameters, including sleep latency (SL), sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and wake after sleep onset were recorded from the actigraph. Three core executive functions, inhibitory control; working memory (WM); and cognitive flexibility (CF), were assessed from computer-based tasks: the flanker task, and the Tower of London and Trail Making Tests, respectively. The regression results showed that MVPA was negatively associated with SL (-0.169; 95%CI [-0.244, -0.112]). WM (total scores) was positively related to MVPA (0.028, 95%CI [0.008, 0.048]), but negatively related to SL (-0.105, 95%CI [-0.167, -0.030]).

The indirect effect of SL was found for MVPA and WM (0.018, 95%CI [0.015, 0.034]), supporting the indirect partial mediation. Similarly, the indirect effect of SL was found between MVPA and CF (-0.031, 95%CI [-0.060, -0.012]), supporting the indirect partial mediation.

Using pharmacoinformatics-based analysis, we explored the relevance of bioactive chemicals found in Rasam (a South Indian cuisine) against oxidative stress-induced human malignancies. The Rasam is composed of twelve main ingredients, each of which contains a variety of bioactive chemicals. Sixty-six bioactive compounds were found from these ingredients, and their structures were downloaded from Pubchem. To find the right target via graph theoretical analysis (mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6)) and decipher their signaling route, a network was built. Sixty-six bioactive compounds were used for in silico molecular docking study against MAPK6 and compared with known MAPK6 inhibitor drug (PD-173955). The top four compounds were chosen for further study based on their docking scores and binding energies. In silico analysis predicted ADMET and physicochemical properties of the selected compounds and were used to assess their drug-likeness. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation modelling methodology was also used to analyse the effectiveness and safety profile of selected bioactive chemicals based on the docking score, as well as to assess the stability of the MAPK6-ligand complex. Surprisingly, the discovered docking scores against MAPK6 revealed that the selected bioactive chemicals exhibit varying binding ability ranges between ? 3.5 and ? 10.6 kcal mol(?1). MD simulation validated the stability of four chemicals at the MAPK6 binding pockets, including Assafoetidinol A (ASA), Naringin (NAR), Rutin (RUT), and Tomatine (TOM). According to the results obtained, fifty of the sixty-six compounds showed higher binding energy (? 6.1 to ? 10.6 kcal mol(?1)), and four of these compounds may be used as lead compounds to protect cells against oxidative stress-induced human malignancies.","output":"Pharmacoinformatics-based investigation of bioactive compounds of Rasam (South Indian recipe) against human cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the essential role of palliative care to support the delivery of compassionate, goal-concordant patient care. We created the web-based application, PalliCOVID (https://pallicovid.app/), in April 2020 to provide all clinicians with convenient access to palliative care resources and support. PalliCOVID features evidence-based clinical guidelines, educational content, and institutional protocols related to palliative care for COVID-19 patients. It is a publicly available resource accessible from any mobile device or desktop computer that provides clinicians with access to palliative care guidance across a variety of care settings, including the emergency department, hospital ward, intensive care unit, and primary care practice. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate usage patterns of PalliCOVID to understand user behavior in relation to this palliative care content platform during the period of the local peak of COVID-19 infection in Massachusetts. DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed de-identified usage data collected by Google Analytics from the first day of PalliCOVIDs launch on April 7, 2020 until May 1, 2020, the time period that encompassed the local peak of the COVID-19 surge in Massachusetts. MEASURE: ments: User access data was collected and summarized by Google Analytics software that had been integrated into the PalliCOVID web application. RESULTS: 2,042 users accessed PalliCOVID and viewed 4,637 pages from April 7 to May 1, 2020. Users spent an average of 2 minutes and 6 seconds per session. 81% of users were first-time visitors, while the remaining 19% were return visitors. The majority of users accessed PalliCOVID from the United States (87%), with a large proportion of users coming from Boston and the surrounding cities (32% of overall users). CONCLUSIONS: PalliCOVID is one example of a scalable digital health solution that can bring palliative care resources to frontline clinicians. Analysis of PalliCOVID usage patterns has the potential to inform the improvement of the platform to better meet the needs of its user base and guide future dissemination strategies. The quantitative data presented here, although informative about user behavior, should be supplemented with future qualitative research to further define the impact of this tool and extend our ability to deliver clinical care that is compassionate, rational, and well-aligned with patients values and goals.","output":"Usage Patterns of a Web-Based Palliative Care Content Platform (PalliCOVID) during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health behavior is a critical measure in controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We estimated the effect of health behaviors against air pollution on reducing the risk of COVID-19 during the initial phase of the pandemic. The attack rates of COVID-19 in 159 mainland Chinese cities during the first 2 weeks after the closure of major cities was estimated; air pollution level as a surrogate indicator of the mask-wearing rate. Data on air pollution levels and meteorologic factors 2 weeks prior to the closure were obtained. The attack rate was compared with the level of air pollution using a generalized linear model after adjusting for confounders. When fine particulates (PM(2.5)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) levels increased by one unit of air quality index (AQI), the infection risk decreased by 0.7% and 3.4%, respectively. When PM(2.5) levels exceeded 150 (level 4), the infection risk decreased (relative risk, RR = 0.635, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.442 to 0.912 for level 4; RR = 0.529, 95% CI: 0.337 to 0.830 for level 5; respectively). After controlling for the number of high-speed railway routes, when PM(2.5) and NO(2) levels increased by one AQI, relative risk for PM(2.5) and NO(2) was 0.990 (95% CI, 0.984 to 0.997) and 0.946 (95% CI, 0.911 to 0.982), respectively, demonstrating a consistently negative association. It is postulated that, during the early phase of the pandemic, the cities with higher air pollution levels may represent the higher practice of mask-wearing to protect from air pollution, which could have acted as a barrier to the transmission of the virus.

However, there is evidence of hesitancy and unwillingness to receive the booster vaccine, even in fully vaccinated adults. Identifying factors associated with COVID-19 booster vaccine intentions specifically in this population is therefore critical. METHODS: We used data from 22,139 fully vaccinated adults who took part in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Multinomial logistic regression examined predictors of uncertainty and unwillingness (versus willingness) to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccine (measured 22 November 2021 to 6 December 2021), including (i) socio-demographic factors, (ii) COVID-19 related factors (e.g., having been infected with COVID-19), and (iii) initial intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the four months following the announcement in the UK that the vaccines had been approved (2 December 2020 to 31 March 2021). FINDINGS: 4% of the sample reported that they were uncertain about receiving a COVID-19 booster vaccine, and a further 4% unwilling. Initial uncertainty and unwillingness to accept the first COVID-19 vaccine in 2020-21 were each associated with over five times the risk of being uncertain about and unwilling to accept a booster vaccine. Healthy adults (those without a pre-existing physical health condition) were also more likely to be uncertain or unwilling to receive a booster vaccine. In addition, low levels of current stress about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, consistently low compliance with COVID-19 government guidelines during periods of strict restrictions (e.g., lockdowns), lower levels of educational qualification, lower socio-economic position, and age below 45 years were all associated with uncertainty and unwillingness. INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight that there are a range of factors that predict booster intentions, with the strongest predictor being previous uncertainty and unwillingness. Two other concerning patterns also emerged from our results. First, administration of booster vaccinations may increase social inequalities in experiences of COVID-19 as adults from lower socio-economic backgrounds are also most likely to be uncertain or unwilling to accept a booster vaccine as well as most likely to be seriously affected by the virus. Second, some of those most likely to spread COVID-19 (i.e., those with poor compliance with guidelines) are most likely to be uncertain and unwilling. Public health messaging should be tailored specifically to these groups.

RESULTS A total of 567 patients were recruited and 1000 pairs of readings were obtained. The incidence of fever, defined as tympanic temperature (in rectal model) >38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F), was 12.3%. The mean difference between NIFT and tympanic temperature was 2.34 degrees C (4.21 degrees F) and the 95% limit of agreement between NIFT and tympanic temperature was 0.26-4.42 degrees C (0.47-7.96 degrees F). NIFT was significantly lower than tympanic temperature readings. The optimal cut-off point of NIFT derived from the receiver-operator characteristics curve for fever definition was 35.1 degrees C (95.2 degrees F).

Differences between the pre-isolation and isolation period were calculated using the related paired T-tests. When statistically significant differences were found, the effect size was estimated using the Cohens d index (d). The reduction in physical activity levels during confinement were related to the increase in total number of minutes of screen consumption from 433.49 min to 623.97 min per day (d = 0.67; 44.01%). The CISS scores were increased by more than 43% during confinement. The increase in convergence insufficiency was 100% after the studied isolation period of 25 days. The 92.19% increase in television use during 25 days of confinement is not responsible for the increase in convergence insufficiency. However, due to the increase in the use of PCs in this period, there is a notable increase in convergence insufficiency.

An ICU-dedicated (V500) and a lower-level ventilator (Elisee 350) were attached to two test-lungs (QuickLung) through a dedicated flow-splitter. A 50 mL/cmH2O Compliance (C) and 5 cmH2O/L/s Resistance (R) were set in both A and B lungs (step1), C50R20 in A / C20R20 in B (step 2), C20R20 in A / C10R20 in B (step 3), and C50R20 in A / C20R5 in B (step 4). Each ventilator was set in volume and pressure control mode to deliver 0.8L VT. We assessed VT from a pneumotachograph placed immediately before each lung, rebreathed volume, and expiratory resistance (circuit and valve). Values are median (1st-3rd quartiles) and compared between ventilators by non-parametric tests. Between Elisee 350 and V500 in volume control VT in A/B patients were 0.381/0.387 vs. 0.412/0.433L in step 1, 0.501/0.270 vs. 0.492/0.370L in step 2, 0.509/0.237 vs. 0.496/0.332L in step 3, and 0.496/0.281 vs. 0.480/0.329L in step 4.

In this work, the origin of the long-term storage stability and sustained NO release mechanism of S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d-penicillamine (SNAP)-doped CarboSil 20 80A polymer, a biomedical thermoplastic silicone-polycarbonate-urethane, is explored. Long-term (22 days) localized NO release is achieved by utilizing a cross-linked silicone rubber as topcoats, which can greatly reduce the amount of SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide leaching from the SNAP-doped CarboSil films, as measured by LCCMS. Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction characterization of SNAP-doped CarboSil films demonstrate that a polymerCcrystal composite is formed during the solvent evaporation process when SNAP exceeds its solubility in CarboSil (ca. 3.4C4.0 wt %). Further, when exceeding this solubility threshold, SNAP exists in an orthorhombic crystal form within the bulk of the polymer. The proposed mechanism of sustained NO release in SNAP-doped CarboSil is that the solubilized SNAP in the polymer matrix decomposes and releases NO, primarily in the water-rich regions near the polymer/solution interface, and the dissolved SNAP in the bulk polymeric phase becomes unsaturated, resulting in the dissolution of crystalline SNAP within the bulk of the polymer. This is a very slow process that ultimately leads to NO release at the physiological flux levels for >3 weeks. The increased stability of SNAP within CarboSil is attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the SNAP molecules that crystallize. This crystallization also plays a key role in maintaining RSNO stability within the CarboSil polymer for >8 months at 37 C (88.5% remains). Further, intravascular catheters fabricated with this new material are demonstrated to significantly decrease the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm (a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections) (in vitro) over a 7 day period, with 5 log units reduction of viable cell count on catheter surfaces. It is also shown that the NO release catheters can greatly reduce thrombus formation on the catheter surfaces during 7 h implantation in rabbit veins, when compared to the control catheters fabricated without SNAP. These results suggest that the SNAP-doped CarboSil system is a very attractive new composite material for creating long-term NO release medical devices with increased stability and biocompatibility.","output":"Origin of Long-Term Storage Stability and Nitric Oxide Release Behavior of CarboSil Polymer Doped with S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-d-penicillamine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review highlights literature from the past year and explores the impact on current understanding of celiac disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. RECENT FINDINGS In contrast to earlier clinical trials, recent data suggests that early gluten introduction may protect against the development of celiac disease. Celiac disease is underdiagnosed, associated with high burden of disease and linked to excess mortality risk, yet, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the utility of mass screening in asymptomatic individuals. The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in celiac disease pathogenesis, although the exact mechanism is undefined. Probiotics have been proposed as a disease-modifying option for celiac disease but most studies assessing efficacy are of low-quality. Patients with celiac disease do not appear to be at increased risk of contracting or developing adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Little is known about the pathogenesis of nonceliac gluten sensitivity; however, recent findings suggest an autoimmune basis for the condition.

Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study using data from the EMR at a public hospital in the Bronx, New York. Included patients were aged 13 and over that had STI testing from Aug. 1, 2019 to Feb. 1, 2020 (Period 1) and Aug. 1, 2020 to Feb. 1, 2021 (Period 2) in any hospital setting. Periods 1 and 2 are 6 month periods before and after the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic in NYC, respectively. Counts and percents were used to quantify STI tests (HIV point of care, HIV 4th generation serum, Gonorrhea Amplification, Chlamydia Amplification, and Treponema Pallidum Ab screen) and positive results during Period 1 vs. Period 2. A chi-squared test of independence determined significance of positivity rates in Period 1 vs Period 2 with a p-value of.05. Results: In Period 1, there were 11,752 distinct patients, 33,183 total STI tests, and a mean age of 38 years (S.D.  16). They were 58% female, 18% male, and 23% unknown or other self-identified sex. Period 2 had 10,313 distinct patients, 29,797 total STI tests, and a mean age of 37 years (S.D.  16). They were 51% female, 18% male, and 31% unknown or other self-identified sex. As described in Table 1, fewer tests were done in Period 2 than Period 1 for all STI categories at our hospital. Gonorrhea had a significantly increased positivity rate in Period 2 than Period 1. There were no significant differences in positivity rates for other STIs between the two time periods. Conclusion: A lower number of STI tests was done at our hospital in Period 2 vs. Period 1. This may be due to a fear of using health care resources during the pandemic. Gonorrhea positivity rates were higher in Period 2 than Period 1, with no difference for other STIs. A stable or increased positivity rate could imply that despite new SARS-CoV-19 guidelines on social behavior, patients in our population continued to engage in condomless sexual relations.

The present study explains the structural aspects associated with the involvement of nucleocapsid C-terminal domain in the subunit assembly that helps the RNA binding and further stabilizing the virus assembly by protecting RNA from the hosts exonucleases degradation.

However, the structural features of the complete PSV genome remain largely unknown. To analyze the structural features of PSV genomes, the full-length nucleotide sequences of three Korean PSV strains were determined and analyzed using bioinformatic techniques in comparison with other known PSV strains. The Korean PSV genomes ranged from 7,542 to 7,566 nucleotides excluding the 3 poly(A) tail, and showed the typical picornavirus genome organization; 5untranslated region (UTR)-L-VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1-2A-2B-2C-3A-3B-3C-3D-3UTR. Three distinct cis-active RNA elements, the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5UTR, a cis-replication element (CRE) in the 2C coding region and 3UTR were identified and their structures were predicted. Interestingly, the structural features of the CRE and 3UTR were different between PSV strains. The availability of these first complete genome sequences for PSV strains will facilitate future investigations of the molecular pathogenesis and evolutionary characteristics of PSV.","output":"Full-Length Genomic Analysis of Korean Porcine Sapelovirus Strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Waste ashes from three types of hospital waste (HW) incinerators, built in SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) period and currently running in China, were collected and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) properties in the ashes were investigated.

Among the three types of incinerators, two medium-scale incinerators generated relatively high levels of PAHs (mean PAH 22.50 and 198.92 mg kg(? 1)) compared to small-scale and large-scale incinerators (mean PAH 4.16 and 16.43 mg kg(? 1)). Bottom ashes were dominated by low molecular weight PAHs (LM-PAH; containing two- to three-ringed PAHs) and medium molecular weight PAHs (MM-PAH; containing four-ringed PAHs), while fly ashes were abundant in MM-PAH and high molecular weight PAHs (HM-PAH, containing five- to six-ringed PAHs). Statistical analysis indicated that there was a positive relationship (R(2 )= 0.88) between organic matter and total PAHs thus it has the potential to be used as an indicator for PAHs in HW ashes. Moreover, it was found that PAHs in the ashes correlated highly with some metallic elements either positively (e.g. Fe, Ti, Mg) or negatively (Ca), indicating that these elements might promote or prevent PAH formation during HW combustion. Although bottom ash resulted from HW incinerators has not been classified as hazardous material, the results of this study indicated that this type of waste ash contained high levels of PAHs thus need special treatment before landfill.","output":"Levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in different types of hospital waste incinerator ashes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Iman Nuwayhid talks to Gary Humphreys about building a cross-disciplinary public health institution out of the rubble of war and efforts to rebuild Beirut in the aftermath of the August 2020 explosion.","output":"Iman Nuwayhid: on building and rebuilding public health in Beirut"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protection of infant mice against experimental E. coli B41 diarrhoea by immunization of the mothers with homologous E. coli strain was studied. The influence of the number, dose, route and moment of vaccination(s) on protection, measured by the reduced mortality rate of infant mice during the 15 days following oral challenge, was tested. The highest dose of vaccine, namely 10(8) formalin-killed E. coli by parenteral routes or 3 X 10(9) live E. coli by peroral (p.o.) route resulted in the best effect, whatever the immunization procedure used. A single vaccination of the mothers mainly delayed death without marked reduction of the mortality rate. Subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization with 10(8) formalin-killed E. coli was nevertheless more efficient than p.o. vaccination with 3 X 10(8) live E. coli. Equal levels of protection were observed when the above s.c. vaccination occurred either 15 days before the onset of gestation or on the 8th day or 15th day. In contrast, the p.o. immunization resulted in no effect when done on the 15th day of gestation. Great improvement in protection was obtained with two vaccinations, when priming occurred 15 days before the onset of gestation and boosting on the 8th day, except with two combined p.o. vaccinations with 3 X 10(8) live E. coli. Both dosages of priming and boosting seemed to matter. Peroral, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal priming with about 10(8) E. coli resulted in nearly equal effects, when boosting occurred subcutaneously with 10(8) killed E. coli. However, i.p. priming probably resulted in some non-specific effect, as shown by the slower clinical evolution of the controls. A tenfold dosage increase in p.o. priming alone led to the best protective effect observed when boosting was done three weeks after priming. The occurrence of s.c. boosting one week later, namely four weeks after priming, markedly improved protection with every route tested, and more particularly with the s.c. one. However, complete protection was never obtained. Protective effect was mostly transmitted after birth by the colostrum and the milk of the immune mothers, as demonstrated by cross-fostering experiments. Using the best immunization procedures, variability of the model was studied, by repeating experiments several times. Clinical evolution of the controls was very similar from one experiment to another, whatever the route and the moment of immunizations. In contrast, vaccinated groups showed variations which increased with time, especially on and after seven days following inoculation.

METHODS : 4000 patients (1900 men and 2100 women) with mild, moderate or chronic disease, appealing to our Second Opinion Medical Consultation Network, signed an informed consent and were injected subcutaneously with C.parvum . The treatment was followed up at 6 months after therapy, filling the short form of the medical outcome health survey questionnaire (SF-36), directly by the patients or its parents and monitoring the health regularly via telemedicine (Skype, WhatsApp, mail, etc) or physicians visit. RESULTS: The main efficacy endpoints, as assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire, are significant improvements in the mental and physical role functioning score (p< 0.02), in general health, in social role functioning (p < 0.02), vitality (p < 0.03), and a significant reduction in bodily pain (p< 0.03). There was a quick (48-72 hours) symptoms improvement and/or complete regression of the herpetic eruptions observed in 1000 affected patients and of herpetic neuralgia (reduced in 80% of cases), also full recovery or frequency reduction (30%) of recurrent cystitis and prostatitis in 120 affected patients, and last, but not least, a life quality improvement in 100 oncologic patients of overall 200 cases. A significant increase in the lymphocyte count (p<0.01), mainly Helper and Killer lymphocytes, was noted after 6 months by Parvulan injection vs. the baseline.The asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients, incidentally, enrolled in our survey, were tested at sixth months for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and 14 patients occurred high level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that C.parvum is quite safe and effective to support immune-compromised patients when epidemic or pandemic events rise the life risk and any kind of infections and complications rate.Further double-blind placebo evidence-based studies are urgently required, and our numerically substantial not sponsored spontaneous observation aims exclusively to promote further evidence based double blind institutional studies.","output":"Innate Immunity Stimulation During COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, lung cancer was estimated to be the leading cause of cancer deaths in humans. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known to increase the risk of lung cancer. PAHs are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A subfamily, comprised of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 monooxygenases. These enzymes bioactivate PAHs into reactive metabolites that induce mutagenic DNA adducts, which can lead to cancer. Past studies have investigated the role of CYP1A1 in PAH bioactivation; however, the individual roles of each CYP1A enzyme are still unknown. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that mice lacking the genes for Cyp1a1 or Cyp1a2 will display altered susceptibilities to PAH-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis. Wild-type (WT), Cyp1a1-null (Cyp1a1-/-), and Cyp1a2-null (Cyp1a2-/-) male and female mice were treated with 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) for cancer initiation and tumor formation studies. In WT mice, CYP1A1 and 1A2 expression was induced by MC. Cyp1a1-/- and Cyp1a2-/- mice treated with PAHs displayed a compensatory pattern, where knocking out one Cyp1a gene led to increased expression of the other. Cyp1a1-/- mice were resistant to DNA adduct and tumor formation, while Cyp1a2-/- mice displayed increased levels of both. UALCAN analysis revealed that lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with high levels of CYP1A2 expression survive significantly better than patients with low/medium expression. In conclusion, Cyp1a1-/- mice were less susceptible to PAH-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis, while Cyp1a2-/- mice were more susceptible. Additionally, high CYP1A2 expression was found to be protective for LUAD patients. These results support the need to develop novel CYP1A1 inhibitors to mitigate human lung cancer.","output":"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH)-Induced Pulmonary Carcinogenesis in Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1- and 1A2-null Mice: Roles of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE Due to the COVID-19 pandemic all schools in Poland were closed and obliged to conduct lessons remotely. The aim of the study is to present the demographic analysis of difficulties with remote learning, as perceived by students during coronavirus pandemic in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS In April 2020, a nationwide online survey was conducted among adolescents aged 11-18 (N=2408). Quantitative and qualitative data were used. Teenagers were asked about the problems connected with remote learning. In order to examine the overall level of remote learning difficulties, a scale of remote learning difficulties (RLD) was devised (range 0-23 points). Differences connected with gender, age and place of residence were analysed. RESULTS More than a half of the teenagers surveyed rated the increased demands from teachers as a major problem. This answer appeared statistically more often among girls than boys (59.6% v. 53.2%). Almost every third adolescent saw the lack of consultation (31.6%) as a significant problem. Difficulties related to learning in the remote system were most often described as considerable by the oldest students (17-18-years-old) and those living in rural areas. The big problem for them was usually much higher requirements of teachers and poor organization of distance learning. The mean level on the scale of remote learning burden was M=11.9 (SD=7.1). Technical difficulties and insufficient skills in using software constituted additional problems most frequently mentioned by students. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to pay particular attention to organizing appropriate technical conditions for remote learning, especially in rural areas, where students have complained more often than in cities about equipment and problems with access to the Internet during the pandemic.","output":"Demographic analysis of difficulties related to remote education in Poland from the perspective of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During these uncertain and unprecedented times, the use of technology has become paramount to staying connected to friends, family, work and society.

The 2012 ESPGHAN guidelines suggested a no-biopsy pathway (NBP) for symptomatic children with IgA-based Tissue Transglutaminase (TGA-IgA) -10x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN). Biopsy confirmation remained mandatory for all other cases. Objectives This retrospective case note study was aimed at evaluating the extent of adherence to the ESPGHAN 2012 guidelines for diagnosing CD in our unit. Methods 179 cases with positive TGA-IgA were identified from the laboratory database between January'2013 to December' 2020. 17/179 (9%) patients were not referred to secondary care after the finding of positive TTG in primary care. Data was collected on the diagnostic pathways followed, and adherence was compared with the existing ESPGHAN 2012 guidelines. Results 129 cases assessed for CD were included and 124 children diagnosed with CD. 68/129 (53%) were diagnosed via the NBP. 57/68 were diagnosed via NBP until December 2019 and 24/57 (42%) children did not meet triple criteria as per 2012 ESPGHAN guidelines. HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing wasn't done for 16/57 NBP cases and other 3/57 had a negative EMA result. In 2020, 13 patients were diagnosed via NBP, 11 in adherence to the 2020 ESPGHAN guidelines, other 2 [TGA-IgA <10xULN] were via regional interim COVID-19 pathway. Conclusions Adherence to the recommended diagnostic guidelines need to be tightened up to ensure firm diagnosis of CD. Regular educational sessions at regional/local level are needed to improve the referral, understanding and implementation of the diagnostic pathways.

Apoptosis is coordinated by a family of cysteine proteases, called caspases, that are activated during apoptosis and participate in dismantling the cell by cleaving key structural and regulatory proteins. We have explored the caspase activation events that are initiated upon infection of the human rectal tumor cell line HRT18 with TGEV. We show that TGEV infection results in the activation of caspase-3, -6, -7, -8, and -9 and cleavage of the caspase substrates eIF4GI, gelsolin, and alpha-fodrin. Surprisingly, the TGEV nucleoprotein (N) underwent proteolysis in parallel with the activation of caspases within the host cell. Cleavage of the N protein was inhibited by cell-permeative caspase inhibitors, suggesting that this viral structural protein is a target for host cell caspases. We show that the TGEV nucleoprotein is a substrate for both caspase-6 and -7, and using site-directed mutagenesis, we have mapped the cleavage site to VVPD(359) downward arrow.

Clinical guidelines recommend temperature measurement in these children, but little is known about parents experiences of and beliefs about temperature measurement. This study aimed to explore parents concerns and beliefs about temperature measurement in children. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted from May 2017 to June 2018 with 21 parents of children aged 4 months to 5.5 years, who were purposively sampled from the METRIC study (a method comparison study comparing non-contact infrared thermometers to axillary and tympanic thermometers in acutely ill children). Data analysis followed a thematic approach. RESULTS: Parents described the importance of being able to detect fever, in particular high fevers, and how this then influenced their actions. The concept of accuracy was valued by parents but the aspects of performance which were felt to reflect accuracy varied. Parents used numerical values of temperature in four main ways: determining precision of the thermometer on repeat measures, detecting a bad fever, as an indication to administer antipyretics, or monitoring response to treatment. Family and social networks, the internet, and medical professionals and resources, were all key sources of advice for parents regarding fever, and guiding thermometer choice. CONCLUSIONS: Temperature measurement in children has diagnostic value but can either empower, or cause anxiety and practical challenges for parents. This represents an opportunity for both improved communication between parents and healthcare professionals, and technological development, to support parents to manage febrile illness with greater confidence in the home.

Most of the datasets have a high dimension in many issues since all features are not crucial to the problem, which reduces the algorithm's accuracy and efficiency. This article presents a hybrid feature selection approach to solve the low precision and tardy convergence of the butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA). The proposed method is dependent on combining the algorithm of BOA and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) as a search methodology using a wrapper framework. BOA is started with a one\\\\dimensional cubic map in the proposed approach, and a non\\\\linear parameter control technique is also implemented. To boost the basic BOA for global optimization, PSO algorithm is mixed with the butterfly optimization algorithm (BOAPSO). A 25 dataset evaluates the proposed BOAPSO to determine its efficiency with three metrics: classification precision, the selected features, and the computational time. A COVID\\\\19 dataset has been used to evaluate the proposed approach. Compared to the previous approaches, the findings show the supremacy of BOAPSO for enhancing performance precision and minimizing the number of chosen features. Concerning the accuracy, the experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed model converges rapidly and performs better than with the PSO, BOA, and GWO with improvement percentages: 91.07%, 87.2%, 87.8%, 87.3%, respectively.

Here, we investigated the prophylactic effect of ketamine and guanosine against corticosterone (CORT C 20 mg/kg, p.o.)-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Furthermore, we characterized if the prophylactic response may be associated with mTORC1-driven signaling in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. A single administration of ketamine (5 mg/kg, i.p.), but not guanosine (1 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.), given 1 week before the pharmacological stress prevented CORT-induced depressive-like behavior in the tail suspension test (TST) and splash test (SPT). Fluoxetine treatment for 3 weeks did not prevent CORT-induced behavioral effects. A single administration of subthreshold doses of ketamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) plus guanosine (5 mg/kg, p.o.) partially prevented the CORT-induced depressive-like behavior in the SPT. Additionally, CORT reduced Akt (Ser473) and GSK-3 (Ser9) phosphorylation and PSD-95, GluA1, and synapsin immunocontent in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex. No alterations on mTORC1/p70S6K immunocontent were found in both regions in any experimental group.

MATERIALS AND METHODS There were 45 metastases in 20 patients treated. After 24 hours, imaging of the ablation zones was performed with contrast-enhanced PET/CT. Three independent radiologists prospectively assessed contrast-enhanced CT and combined PET/CT images to identify three patterns: pattern I, no tissue enhancement or fluorodeoxyglucose uptake between the ablation zone and the liver parenchyma; pattern II, a rimlike pattern; and pattern III, a peripheral nodule. PET/CT images obtained after 8-10 weeks were evaluated for LTP. The patterns were analyzed for their sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for predicting LTP. RESULTS Pattern I was most frequently observed (81% for contrast-enhanced CT and 61% for PET/CT) as well as for ablation zones that showed LTP (52% and 37%, respectively). Conversely, pattern II was observed for tumors that were completely ablated (6% and 29%, respectively). Patterns II and III together had the highest sensitivity for predicting LTP (48% and 63%, respectively); pattern III had the highest specificity (94% and 95%, respectively). For nodular patterns, test characteristics were better for PET/CT compared with contrast-enhanced CT, but the difference was not significant. Nodular patterns > 1 cm achieved high positive predictive value (both 100%). CONCLUSIONS Inflammation and hyperemia can hinder interpretation on imaging 24 hours after RF ablation, especially on PET/CT. Nodular patterns around the ablation zone on early contrast-enhanced CT and PET/CT have a high predictive value for LTP and should be taken into account for disease management.","output":"Predictive value of pattern classification 24 hours after radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases on CT and positron emission tomography/CT."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).

Objective: To assess temporal trends in rates of primary care provider (PCP) diagnosis and treatment of school-aged children with ADHD in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to pre-pandemic years, and to investigate disparities in care. Method: We retrospectively analyzed electronic health records from all primary care visits (in-person and telehealth) of children ages 6-17 years seen between 01/2016 and 03/2021 in a community-based primary healthcare network in California (n=77,298 patients). Study Outcomes: (1) # of primary care visits, (2) # of visits with ADHD diagnosis (ADHD-related visits), (3) # of first ADHD diagnoses, (4) # of PCP prescriptions for ADHD medications (stimulants, alpha-2 agonists, atomoxetine), (5) # of first PCP prescriptions of ADHD medications. Interrupted time-series analysis evaluated changes in rates of study outcomes during 4 quarters of the pandemic year (3/15/2020-3/15/2021) compared to pre-pandemic years. Patient demographic characteristics were compared pre-pandemic to pandemic year. Results: In the first quarter (Q1) of the pandemic year, all primary care visits dropped by 62% (CI 54.9-67.2%); ADHD-related visits dropped by 33% (95% CI 22.2-43.6%). In Q2-4, while all primary care visits remained significantly below pre-pandemic rates, ADHD-related visits returned to pre-pandemic rates. Conversely, rates of first ADHD diagnoses remained at half of pre-pandemic rates throughout the year (Q1-4). ADHD medication prescription rates remained stable throughout the pandemic year. The proportion of patients living in low-income neighborhoods who received ADHD-related care (ADHD-related visits and first ADHD diagnoses) were lower during the pandemic year compared to pre-pandemic years.

We found that a surgical mask is potentially less irritating to facial skin than the KN95 respirator, as it applies lower forces and facilitates faster return of facial temperatures to their basal levels. Further, we demonstrated that use of dressing cuts for padding under a KN95 respirator considerably reduced localized forces and did not worsen the thermal and SEM readings at the skin-device contact sites.

This virus affects mainly the respiratory system, but the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is also a target, meanwhile SARS-CoV-2 was already detected in oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, rectum, and in fecal samples from COVID-19 patients. Prolonged GIT manifestations in COVID-19, mainly the diarrhea, were correlated with decreased richness and diversity of the gut microbiota, immune deregulation and delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance. So, the bidirectional interactions between the respiratory mucosa and the gut microbiota, known as gut-lung axis, are supposed to be involved in the healthy or pathologic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. In accordance, the intestinal dysbiosis is associated with increased mortality in other respiratory infections, due to an exacerbated inflammation and decreased regulatory or anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the lungs and in the gut, pointing to this important relationship between both mucosal compartments. Therefore, since the mucous membranes from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are affected, in addition to dysbiosis and inflammation, it is plausible to assume that adjunctive therapies based on the modulation of the gut microbiota and re-establishment of eubiosis conditions could be an important therapeutic approach for constraining the harmful consequences of COVID-19. Then, in this review, we summarized studies showing the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal system and the related digestive COVID-19 manifestations, in addition to the literature demonstrating nasopharyngeal, pulmonary and intestinal dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients.

They have to first understand the meaning of the quests, then go and find them in the environment.

Furthermore, the review covers several important resulting effects of ZIKV infection to the ER and cellular processes including ER stress, reticulophagy, and paraptosis-like death. Pharmacological targeting of ZIKV-affected ER-resident proteins and ER-associated components demonstrate promising signs of combating ZIKV infection and rescuing host organisms from severe neurologic sequelae.","output":"Endoplasmic reticulum: a focal point of Zika virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the recent emergence of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S., many states are seeing rising cases and hospitalizations after a period of steady decline. As We used the COVID-19 Simulator, an interactive online tool that utilizes a validated mathematical model, to simulate the trajectory of COVID-19 at the state level in the U.S. COVID-19 Simulators forecasts are updated weekly and included in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ensemble model. We employed our model to analyze scenarios where the Delta variant becomes dominant in every state. The combination of high transmissibility of the Delta variant, low vaccination coverage in several regions, and more relaxed attitude towards social distancing is expected to result in as surge in COVID-19 deaths in at least 40 states. In several states - including Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Washington, and West Virginia - the projected daily deaths in 2021 could exceed the prior peak daily deaths under current social distancing behavior and vaccination rate. The number of COVID-19 deaths across the U.S. could exceed 1600 per day. Between August 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021, there could be additional 157,000 COVID-19 deaths across the U.S. Of note, our model projected approximately 20,700 COVID-19 deaths in Texas, 16,000 in California, 12,400 in Florida, 12,000 in North Carolina, and 9,300 in Georgia during this period. In contrast, the projected number of COVID-19 deaths would remain below 200 in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, and Rhode Island. We project COVID-19 deaths based on the current vaccination rates and social distancing behavior. Our hope is that the findings of this report serve a warning sign and people revert to wearing masks and maintain social distancing to reduce COVID-19 associated deaths in the U.S. Our projections are updated weekly by incorporating vaccination rates and social distancing measures in each state; the latest results can be found at the COVID-19 Simulator website.","output":"Changing Dynamics of COVID-19 in the U.S. with the Emergence of the Delta Variant: Projections of the COVID-19 Simulator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article considers the problem of attitude of the youth to vaccine prevention of influenza The study was organized on the basis of qualitative research methods (focus groups) of students of two universities in the Central and Volga Federal Okrugs The data about attitudes towards vaccination and refusal motivation was obtained The need in increasing awareness of the youth about vaccine prevention as an actual health-preserving technology was substantiated","output":"[The attitude of the youth to vaccine prevention of influenza in conditions of COVID-19 pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Medical Equipment Network Documentation System (MENDS) provides a simple communication network for equipment servicing from failure to restoration.

He was on ventilatory support during his first week in the hospital and then received supplemental oxygenation as he recovered from his COVID-19 pneumonia. Nearly a month and a half after his initial presentation, he quickly decompensated and was started on supplemental oxygen and the necessary treatments. It was then, with the aid of lab work and imaging, that we determined that he had developed necrotizing Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia with pneumothorax.

This single-center retrospective study evaluated the correlation between serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels at admission with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, as determined by admission to the intensive Care Unit (ICU). MATERIAL/METHODS: Patients admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College in Bengbu City, Anhui Province, China, in January and February 2020 for COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in this study. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in throat swab samples using real-time fluorescent reverse transcription PCR. Serum IL-6 concentrations at admission were measured by ELISA. Correlations between serum IL-6 concentrations and ICU admission due to the development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. RESULTS: This study enrolled 68 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia. IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with more severe than less severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eight of 40 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia became critically ill and required ICU admission. IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were than who were not treated in the ICU. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.816 (P<0.01), indicating that IL-6 was prognostic of disease severity in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

We sought to determine the extent and the determinants of exercise limitation in patients with COVID-19 at the time of hospital discharge. Eighteen consecutive patients with COVID-19 and 1:1 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched controls underwent: spirometry, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test and exercise echocardiography for the study of pulmonary circulation. Arterial blood was sampled at rest and during exercise in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 lie roughly on the same oxygen consumption isophlets than controls both at rest and during submaximal exercise, thanks to supernormal cardiac output (P < 0.05). Oxygen consumption at peak exercise was reduced by 30% in COVID-19 (P < 0.001), due to a peripheral extraction limit. In addition, within COVID-19 patients, hemoglobin content was associated with peak oxygen consumption (R2 = 0.46, P = 0.002). Respiratory reserve was not exhausted (median [IRQ], 0.59 [0.15]) in spite of moderate reduction of forced vital capacity (79  40%). Pulmonary artery pressure increase during exercise was not different between patients and controls. Ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide were higher in patients with COVID-19 than in controls (39.5 [8.5] vs. 29.5 [8.8], P < 0.001), and such an increase was mainly explained by increased chemosensitivity. When recovering from COVID-19, patients present with reduced exercise capacity and augmented exercise hyperventilation. Peripheral factors, including anemia and reduced oxygen extraction by peripheral muscles were the major determinants of deranged exercise physiology. Pulmonary vascular function seemed unaffected, despite restrictive lung changes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY At the time of hospital discharge, patients with COVID-19 present with reduced functional capacity and exercise hyperventilation. Peripheral factors, namely reduced oxygen extraction (myopathy) and anemia, which are not fully compensated by a supernormal cardiac output response, account for exercise limitation before exhaustion of the respiratory reserve. Enhanced chemoreflex sensitivity, rather increased dead space, mainly accounts for exercise hyperventilation. The pulmonary vascular response to exercise circulation of survived patients with COVID-19 does not present major pathological changes.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on exercise pathophysiology: a combined cardiopulmonary and echocardiographic exercise study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the Philippine government eased the community quarantine restrictions on June 2020, the healthcare system was overwhelmed by the surge in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.

Measures taken to slow the spread of the virus have fostered significant strain between authorities and citizens, leading to waves of social unrest and anti-government demonstrations. We study the temporal nature of pandemic-related disorder events as tallied by the COVID-19 Disorder Tracker initiative by focusing on the three countries with the largest number of incidents, India, Israel, and Mexico. By fitting Poisson and Hawkes processes to the stream of data, we find that disorder events are inter-dependent and self-excite in all three countries. Geographic clustering confirms these features at the subnational level, indicating that nationwide disorders emerge as the convergence of meso-scale patterns of self-excitation. Considerable diversity is observed among countries when computing correlations of events between subnational clusters; these are discussed in the context of specific political, societal and geographic characteristics. Israel, the most territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the shortest period of influence following an event, as well as the strongest nationwide synchrony. In Mexico, where complete lockdown orders were never mandated, reactivity and nationwide synchrony are lowest.

Since S, the virion's major spike glycoprotein, is known to facilitate the spread of infection due to its syncytiogenic properties, we decided to investigate the role of this viral structural protein in resistance by primary SJL/J glial cells.

Induction of neurologic disease in SJL/J mice following intracranial inoculation with either wt JHMV or the S deletion variant, AT11f cord, was age-dependent, occurring only in animals inoculated under 4 weeks of age. Resistance in older animals to wt and variant viruses could be abrogated by immunosuppression with cyclosporin A. However, both disease incidence and viral brain titers were higher in animals receiving the JHM variant AT11f cord virus, suggesting that SJL/J resistance to neurologic disease may manifest itself through interactions between inefficient cell-to-cell spread of the infection and protective aspects of the immune response.","output":"SJL/J resistance to mouse hepatitis virus-JHM-induced neurologic disease can be partially overcome by viral variants of S and host immunosuppression()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heart disease is one of the most complicated diseases, and it affects a large number of individuals throughout the world. In healthcare, particularly cardiology, early and accurate detection of cardiac disease is critical. The Heart Disease Data Set-UCI repository collects data on heart disease. The search space and complexity of the classification models are increased by this raw dataset, which contains redundant and inconsistent data.

As a consequence, feature selection approaches might be useful for reducing the cost of diagnosis by identifying the most important qualities. This research developed an ensemble classification model based on a feature selection approach in which selected features play a role in classification. Accordingly, a classification approach was introduced using ensemble learning with a genetic algorithm, feature selection, and biomedical test values to diagnose heart disease. Based on the results, it is deduced that the benefits of using the feature selection method vary depending on the utilized machine learning technique. However, the best-proposed model based on the combination of genetic algorithm and the ensemble learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.57% on the considered datasets.

As periods of economic and emotional burden have proven to detrimentally affect peoples psychological health, healthcare officials warned that the strict measures could have a serious impact on psychological health, leading to an increase in suicide attempts. Thus, the objective was to provide evidence for this assumption. METHODS: All adult patients admitted to the trauma resuscitation room of the Medical University of Vienna during the lockdown period following a suicide attempt were included in this analysis, forming the study group. Suicidal patients treated during the same period in 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 were pooled to create the control group. The year 2017 was excluded because another major hospital in Vienna was partially closed due to a change in infrastructure, resulting in an increased number of severely injured patients treated at our department. As the lockdown caused a markedly decreased number of patients admitted due to other reasons than suicide the actual number was replaced with the average number of patients admitted in the relevant previous 4 years. RESULTS: By comparing the study and the control group based on this realistic estimate we revealed an increase in attempted suicides during the lockdown period (p = 0.001). Demographic, mental health-related, and injury specific patient data did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: The results strongly urge for an improvement in crisis intervention and suicide prevention measures in the event of a future lockdown.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on suicide attempts: A retrospective analysis of the springtime admissions to the trauma resuscitation room at the Medical University of Vienna from 2015C2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exodus of around 5 million people from Syria has evolved into a transnational 'social question', requiring a transnational response.

Using the dataset we determined most prevailing pathogen groups and plant and animal hosts that carried the highest number of pathogens. The most numerous pathogens were bacteria Xylella fastidiosa (plants) and Rabies virus (animals). The principal pathogen groups among plant hosts were Arthropoda (phylum), Insecta (class) and Hemiptera (order), and among animal hosts C Platyhelminthes (phylum), Trematoda (class) and Plagiorchiida/Strongylida (order).

Efforts have been made to categorise the delirium spectrum into clinically meaningful subgroups (subphenotypes), using psychomotor subtypes such as hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed, for example, and also inflammatory and non-inflammatory delirium. Delirium remains, however, a constellation of symptoms resulting from a variety of risk factors and precipitants with currently no successful targeted pharmacological treatment.

This will facilitate risk factor mitigation, identification of potential methods for interventional studies, and informed patient and family counselling. Here, we review evidence to date and propose a framework to identify subphenotypes. Endotype identification may be done by clustering symptoms with their biological mechanism, which will facilitate research of targeted treatments.

The suicide risk was higher among patients with HCC than the general population. Hence, the purpose of this study was to confirm the suicide rates, standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), and the potential risk factors associated with suicide among HCC patients. METHODS: HCC patients were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database during 1975C2016. Suicide rates and SMRs among these patients were calculated, and the general population of the United States (U.S.) during 1975C2016 was used as a reference. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression were taken to find out the underlying risk factors of suicide in HCC patients. RESULTS: There were 70 suicides identified among 102,567 individuals with HCC observed for 160,500.88 person years. The suicide rate was 43.61 per 100,000 person-years, and SMR was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.78C2.84). On Cox regression, year of diagnosis (1975C1988 vs. 2003C2016, HR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.01C8.89, P = 0.047; 1989C2002 vs. 2003C2016, HR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.10C3.34, P = 0.021), gender (male vs. female, HR: 8.72, 95% CI: 2.73C27.81, P < 0.001), age at diagnosis (63C105 years old vs. 0C55 years old, HR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.21C4.31, P = 0.011), race (white race vs. American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, HR: 3.02, 95% CI: 1.35C6.76, P = 0.007) were independent risk factors of suicide among HCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosed in the early years (1975C2002), male sex, the older age (63C105 years old), white race, survival months (2 months) were significantly associated with suicide among HCC patients. For the sake of preventing suicide behaviors, the government, clinicians, and family members should take adequate measures to decrease the rate of suicide, especially in patients with high-risk factors of suicide.","output":"Risk factors associated with suicide among hepatocellular carcinoma patients: A surveillance, epidemiology, and end results analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work presents the interpretation of a polymer injectivity test performed in a heavy-oil field (50-200 cP), located in a challenging arctic environment, during the first half of 2019 to assess the feasibility of the polymer injection process. Following the positive results achieved with the injectivity test, a polymer interwell pilot test started in the last months of 2019, but it was suspended in April 2020 due to Covid restrictions. Thanks to the acquired data during the pilot test, polymer model was tuned into a dedicated sector of the reservoir model, including one injector and two producers. Using internal company EOR-screening tools, polymer flooding was identified as the most suitable technology for the asset. An integrated study of 3D-modeling and in-house laboratory activities was performed to assess polymer injection potentialities and select the best chemical product for the asset. 3D dynamic analyses confirm the benefits of polymer injection with a significant oil production gain. Four representative horizontal wells were selected for the injectivity test in order to confirm the injection effectiveness. The selection of injectors was based on an extensive analyses of wells status and performance. The test strategy consisted of 2-weeks polymer injection per well, at constant injection rate and increasing polymer concentration steps. A detailed real-Time surveillance plan was realized to monitor injector pressures and polymer solution properties. The injectivity test was concluded successfully: Target viscosity, defined during the laboratory and modeling analyses, was achieved with a limited impact on injectivity. Pressure increase and stabilization during polymer injection confirmed the feasibility of the technique for the reservoir. Well test and temperature profile acquired before and after polymer injection were interpreted. Once assessed the feasibility of polymer injectivity, a 1-year inter-well pilot started in November 2019. Injection took place up to March 2020 and was suspended due to Covid restrictions. The re-start is planned for mid-2021. During the test several injection and production data were gathered, analyzed and interpreted. In addition to that, starting from the full reservoir model, a detailed sector model was set up in order to match pressures and water cut and forecast the performances of polymer injection. ?

Higher INR targets are often used in Western compared with East Asian countries. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence for the efficacy and safety of lower versus higher INR targets in Western and East Asian left-sided mechanical heart valve patients. We searched Western databases including Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline, and Embase as well as Chinese databases including SinoMed, CNKI, and Wanfang Data in addition to grey literature for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and observational studies. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) using random-effects model. Low and high INR targets were defined by the individual studies. We identified nine RCTs, including six Western (n = 5496) and three East Asian (n = 209) trials, and 17 observational studies, including two Western (n = 3199) and 15 East Asian (n = 5485) studies. In the RCTs, lower compared with higher targets were associated with similar rates of thromboembolism (2.4 vs. 2.3%; RR: 1.14, 95% CI 0.82, 1.60, I2 = 0%) and lower rates of both total bleeding (21.9 vs. 40.9%, RR: 0.46, 95% CI 0.28, 0.78, I2 = 88%) and major bleeding. RCT data showed no statistical heterogeneity by region. These effects were consistent in the observational data. We downgraded the quality of evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision.

Usually, viral protein targets host proteins in an organized fashion. The pathogen may target cell signaling pathways to disrupt the pathway genes regular activities, resulting in disease. Understanding the interaction mechanism of viral and host proteins involved in different signaling pathways may help decipher the attacking mechanism on the signal transmission during diseases, followed by discovering appropriate therapeutic solutions. The expression of any viral gene depends mostly on the host translational machinery. Recent studies report the great significance of codon usage biases in establishing host-viral protein-protein interactions (PPI). Exploiting the codon usage patterns between a pair of co-evolved host and viral proteins may present novel insight into the host-viral protein interactomes during disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the codon usage pattern similarity (and dissimilarity), we propose a computational scheme to recreate the hostviral protein interaction network (HVPPI). We use seventeen (17) essential signaling pathways for our current work and study the possible targeting mechanism of SARS-CoV2 viral proteins on such pathway proteins. We infer both negatively and positively interacting edges in the network. We can find a relationship where one host protein may target by more than one viral protein. Extensive analysis performed to understand the network topologically and the attacking behavior of the viral proteins. Our study reveals that viral proteins, mostly utilize codons, rare in the targeted host proteins (negatively correlated interaction). Among non-structural proteins, NSP3 and structural protein, Spike (S) protein, are the most influential proteins in interacting multiple host proteins. In ranking the most affected pathways, MAPK pathways observe to be worst affected during the COVID-19 disease. A good number of targeted proteins are highly central in host protein interaction networks.

Surgical treatment of the primary tumor is crucial since it provides the only curative approach in most cases, but management of patients is highly complex, especially in the presence of new antiplatelet drugs and/or anticoagulants. Paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) represent a frequent complication of renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and include different hematological symptoms in patients, whilst occlusion of arterial blood vessels displays a rare form of PNS accompanying renal tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 62-year old man who was initially hospitalized due to acute coronary syndrome. He subsequently underwent coronary angioplasty treatment including multiple stenting and treatment with ticagrelor and aspirin. Post-interventional, acute arterial thrombotic emboli of several limb arteries required thrombectomy. By computer tomography we identified a renal lesion suspicious for an RCC and suspected a PNS as underlying cause of the thrombotic complications. Triple anticoagulant therapy was maintained with therapeutic dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), aspirin, and clopidogrel, by which we replaced ticagrelor. Surgery was postponed for 4 weeks. We paused LMWH, aspirin and clopidogrel only at the day of surgery and perioperatively restored hemostasis by transfusion of two platelet concentrates. Laparoscopic nephrectomy was uneventful. Pathology confirmed a clear cell RCC. The patient fully recovered whilst slowly reducing anticoagulation dose. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary team approach of experts in urology, cardiology and hemostasis was key in managing this patient since a personalized thrombosis consult was needed to minimize the risk of reinfarction due to in-stent thrombosis. We report a therapeutic protocol that may be helpful for the management of similar cases. Furthermore, the finding of thrombotic arterial occlusions in larger blood vessels represents a novel complication of PNS in RCC and adds to the varied possible manifestations of this clinical chameleon.","output":"Acute myocardial infarction and arterial embolism in a patient with newly diagnosed renal mass: management dilemmas!

Aims To find the proportion of vaccine recipients with adverse events following the first and second doses of Covishield vaccination along with assessment of the symptom profile and timeline of appearance of symptoms following vaccination with each dose along with association of adverse events with comorbidity status of the respondents. Materials & Methods Cross-sectional study with secondary data taken from the AEFI database of the Covid Cell ,Directorate of Medical Education of the Kerala state.The database is formed with responses collected as online self-reporting forms collected from the health workers (doctors, nurses, students, paramedical, housekeeping and clerical staff) who received vaccination from vaccination centres in government owned Medical Colleges in Kerala for a period of three months from the date of rolling out vaccination in the state. Results A total of 4402 healthworkers submitted the forms after taking the vaccination,either first dose or second dose.Out of this 3656(83.1%)responders were after first dose and 746(16.9%)participants responded after second dose 63.3% respondents after first dose & 24.3% after second dose reported they had experienced adverse events following vaccination with first or second dose of the vaccine respectively.The first symptom to be noticed in those who reported the adverse event after first dose was body ache (17.9%) followed by headache in 15.1 % of participants. 11% (403 out of 3656 )of the responders after first dose were having comorbidities and 8.3 % were taking concomitant medications. History of being an asthmatic was found to be of increased risk for developing symptoms following first dose of vaccination(p value 0.004 ,OR-1.269,95% CI 1.127-1.429) whereas diabetes mellitus is not identified as a risk factor for development of adverse events though a significant association is found,might be due to a decreased reactogenicity.Among those who responded after receiving second dose of vaccination,24.3% reported they had adverse events(at least one post vaccination symptom),of which the first symptom experienced was headache (25.5%),followed by fever(20.9%) as compared to bodyache and headache after the first dose.

Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a cluster epidemic with a specific group of overseas returnees and their contacts. The objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model to predict the epidemic in Sri Lanka incorporating measures taken for social distancing and prevention of social gatherings. Methods: A hybrid model incorporating both exponential and polynomial features was developed and parameters were estimated. The developed model was validated using the datasets of three reference countries. Finally, the model was applied to the Sri Lankan data to simulate the epidemic behaviour. Additional features were incorporated to the model to examine the effects of current control measures. Findings: Sri Lanka will have a peak of 177 COVID-19 active cases at the end of second incubation period from the index case of our projection, if the same trend continues. At 10% risk, we project a peak of 263 COVID-19 active cases at the end of third incubation period, and a peak of 353 at the end of fourth incubation period. Should the risk level reach 20%, the peak will be above 1000 active cases after 90 days. Simulations incorporating control measures predict that, deviation from the control measures currently in place could trigger exponential behaviour of the epidemic. Interpretation: The hybrid model combining exponential and polynomial functions showed promising results to predict COVID-19 epidemic. Projections indicate that any early relaxation of control measures is not advisable.

This symptom can lead to poor quality of life for the person who lives with dementia, as well as for his or her caregiver, who might be exposed to sexual assault. AIM This study aimed to highlight the experience of an older woman living and coping with a spouse who exhibits dementia-related hypersexuality. METHOD A narrative case-study of a single case was designed, composed of four semi-structured interviews conducted over a 10-month period. The data were analyzed through thematic, structural, and performance analysis. FINDINGS Four phases were revealed, depicting the experience of being a partner and caregiver of a spouse with dementia-related hypersexuality: a) \\"I need help\\": A distress call; b) \\"It depends how long I agree to go on with it\\": Living with the ambiguous reality of dementia-related hypersexual behavior within an ongoing intimate relationship; c) \\"It's as if I'm hugging someone who's no longer alive\\": The transition from the previous couplehood identity to a new couplehood identity; and d) \\"I am just taking care of him as if he is a child\\": A compassionate couplehood identity construction. CONCLUSIONS Living with a partner with dementia-related hypersexuality is a distressing experience for the caregiver-spouse. Yet, positive memories from a long intimate relationship can lead to the creation of a compassionate identity, which supports the caregiving process, and creates a sense of acceptance and meaning making. This, in turn, enables a positive aging experience.

We observed that intestinal epithelial cells, unlike hematopoietic cells of this organ, express only very low levels of functional IFN-/ receptors. Accordingly, after oral infection of IFN-/ receptor-deficient mice, human reovirus type 3 specifically infected cells in the lamina propria but, strikingly, did not productively replicate in gut epithelial cells.

In suckling mice with IFN- receptor deficiency, reovirus replicated in the gut epithelium and additionally infected epithelial cells lining the bile ducts, indicating that infants may use IFN- for the control of virus infections in various epithelia-rich tissues. Thus, IFN- should be regarded as an autonomous virus defense system of the gut mucosa and other epithelial barriers that may have evolved to avoid unnecessarily frequent triggering of the IFN-/ system which would induce exacerbated inflammation.","output":"Leukocyte-Derived IFN-/ and Epithelial IFN- Constitute a Compartmentalized Mucosal Defense System that Restricts Enteric Virus Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From 2010 to 2013, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Disaster Information Management Research Center (DIMRC) continued to build its programs and services on the foundation laid in its starting years, 2008C2010.

Trend in the winter of 2019-2020 was compared with those in the previous 4 years in order to identify unexpected signals potentially associated with the occurrence of the pandemic. Aggregated data were analysed using a Poisson regression model adjusted for seasonality and influenza outbreaks. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURESa?: Daily pneumonia-related visits in EDs.

PEDV replication is completed and results in a large amount of RNA in the cytoplasm. Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic cytosolic RNA granules formed under various stress conditions, including viral infections. Several previous studies suggested that SGs were involved in the antiviral activity of host cells to limit viral propagation. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to delineate the molecular mechanisms regulating the SG response to PEDV infection. SG formation is induced early during PEDV infection, but as infection proceeds, this ability is lost and SGs disappear at late stages of infection (>18 h postinfection). PEDV infection resulted in the cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) mediated by caspase-8. Using mutational analysis, the PEDV-induced cleavage site within G3BP1 was identified, which differed from the 3C protease cleavage site previously identified. Furthermore, G3BP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D168 and D169 was confirmed in vitro as well as in vivo The overexpression of cleavage-resistant G3BP1 conferred persistent SG formation and suppression of viral replication. Additionally, the knockdown of endogenous G3BP1 abolished SG formation and potentiated viral replication. Taken together, these data provide new insights into novel strategies in which PEDV limits the host stress response and antiviral responses and indicate that caspase-8-mediated G3BP1 cleavage is important in the failure of host defense against PEDV infection.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are drawing extensive attention again since the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. CoVs are prone to variation and own the transmission capability by crossing the species barrier resulting in reemergence. How CoVs manipulate the antiviral responses of their hosts needs to be explored. Overall, the study provides new insight into how porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) impaired SG assembly by targeting G3BP1 via the host proteinase caspase-8. These findings enhanced the understanding of PEDV infection and might help identify new antiviral targets that could inhibit viral replication and limit the pathogenesis of PEDV.","output":"Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection Induces Caspase-8-Mediated G3BP1 Cleavage and Subverts Stress Granules To Promote Viral Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital image feature recognition is significant to industrial information applications, such as bioengineering, medical diagnosis, and machinery industry.

RESULTS: Of 93 included individuals (mean age 62.6  11 years), 52 (56%) had a history of mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Post-pandemic MoCA decay was worse in seropositive individuals. Cognitive decline was recognized in 11/52 (21%) seropositive and 1/41 (2%) seronegative individuals. In multivariate analyses, the odds for developing cognitive decline were 18.1 times higher among SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals (95% confidence interval 1.75-188; p = 0.015). Exposure-effect models confirmed this association (? = 0.24; 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.41; p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of cognitive decline among individuals with mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathogenesis of this complication remains unknown.","output":"Cognitive decline among individuals with history of mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection: A longitudinal prospective study nested to a population cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic COVID-19 presents a major challenge to identify effective drugs for treatment. Clinicians need evidence based on randomized trials regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Currently no effective therapies exist for the progression of the mild forms to severe disease. Knowledge however is rapidly expanding. Remdesivir, an anti- retroviral agent has in vitro activity against this virus and has shown to decrease the duration of ICU care in patients with severe disease, while low dose dexamethasone also showed a decrease in the duration of stay in cases of severe disease requiring assisted ventilation. At the time of writing this article, two mRNA-based vaccines have shown an approximate 95% efficacy in preventing infection in large clinical trials. At least one of these drugs has regulatory permission for vaccination in high-income countries. Low and middle-income countries may have difficulties in initiating vaccine programs on large scales because of availability, costs, refrigeration and dissemination. Adequately powered randomized trials are required for drugs with in vitro activity against the virus. Supportive care should be provided for stable, hypoxia and pneumonia free patients on imaging. Vaccines are of obvious benefit and given the preliminary evidence of the efficacy of over 95%, Low and middle-income countries must develop links with the WHO COVAX program to ensure global distribution of vaccines.","output":"Covid-19 Pandemic: Perspectives on Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay offers a glimpse into implementing and facilitating a 6-week psychoeducational health group inside a womens correctional facility.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to develop the EVT-modified Lee-Carter model which is an amalgamation of the classical Lee-Carter model and the Extreme Value Theory (EVT). The hybrid model aims to cater for mortality jumps which usually occur during extreme mortality events. The forecasting accuracy of the EVT-modified Lee-Carter model is investigated against that of the classical Lee-Carter model, the Age-Period-Cohort model and the Cairns-Blake-Dowd model. The mortality datasets from four European countries are considered for two modelling periods, (1) the unstable period (1900-1960) during which extreme mortality events such as World War I, World War II and the Spanish flu pandemic occurred and (2) the stable period (1961-2017) where no significant mortality jump is observed. The EVT-modified Lee-Carter model evidently outperforms the other benchmark models for the unstable period while for the stable period (1960-2017), the classical Lee-Carter model performs best. The findings highlight the adequacy of the novel EVT-modified Lee-Carter model to capture mortality jumps and leptokurtic features which may be caused by extreme mortality events. In the context of the recent Covid-19 pandemic, the novel model may be an interesting tool for life insurance companies in the valuation of insurance products, mortality derivatives and solvency requirements.","output":"A novel EVT-modified Lee-Carter model for mortality forecasting : An application to extreme mortality events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought the issue of rationing finite healthcare resources to the fore. There has been much academic debate, media attention, and conversation in the homes of everyday individuals about the allocation of medical resources, diagnostic testing kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. Yet decisions to prioritize treatment for some individuals over others occur implicitly and explicitly in everyday practices. The pandemic has propelled the socially taboo and unavoidably prickly issue of healthcare rationing into the public spotlight-and as such, healthcare rationing demands ongoing public attention and transparent discussion. This article concludes that in the aftermath of COVID-19, policymakers should work towards normalizing rationing discussions by engaging in transparent and honest debate in the wider community and public domain. Further, injecting greater openness and objectivity into rationing decisions might go some way towards dismantling the societal taboo surrounding rationing in healthcare.","output":"We Need to Talk About Rationing: The Need to Normalize Discussion About Healthcare Rationing in a Post COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a public health emergency, affecting frail populations including cancer patients. This poses the question as to whether cancer treatments can be postponed or modified without compromising their efficacy, especially for highly curable cancers such as germ cell tumors (GCTs). MATERIALS AND METHODS To depict the state of art management of GCTs during the COVID-19 pandemic a survey including 26 questions was circulated by e-mail among the physicians belonging to 3 cooperative groups: 1. Italian Germ cell cancer Group (IGG); 2. European G3 Domain (Rare male genito-urinary cancers); 3. Genitourinary Medical Oncologists of Canada (GUMOC). Percentages of agreement between I vs C, I vs E and E vs C were compared by using Fisher's exact tests for dichotomous answers and Chi square-test for trends for the questions with 3 or more options. RESULTS Fifty-three GCT experts responded to the survey: 20 Italian (I), 6 in other European (E) countries and 27 from Canada (C). Telemedicine was broadly utilized; there was high consensus to interrupt chemotherapy in COVID-positive patients (I=75%, C=55% and E=83.3%) and for G-CSF primary prophylaxis use for neutropenia (I=65%, C=62.9% and E=50%). Main differences emerged regarding the management of stage I and stage IIA disease, likely due to cultural and geographical differences. CONCLUSIONS Our study highlights the common efforts of GCT experts in Europe and Canada to maintain high standards of treatment for GCT patients with few changes in their management during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Despite the chaos, disruptions and fears fomented by the Covid-19 illness, oncology care teams in Italy, other European countries and Canada are delivering the enormous promise of curative management strategies for patients with testicular cancer and other germ cell tumors. At the same time, these teams are applying safe and innovative solutions to minimize frequency and intensity on patient contacts with thinly stretched health care capacity and sharing best practices.","output":"Management of germ cell tumors during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease-19 pandemic: a survey of international expertise centers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The aim of this study is to develop a scale to assess the psychiatric symptoms that may emerge owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period in children and adolescents aged 4-18 years Material and Methods: To develop the scale, first, interviews with children, adolescents, and their parents were conducted, and the possible psychiatric symptom clusters were detected The items were written with reference to the literature and reviewed by the experts A 40-item scale form was shared as an online survey, and a factor analysis of the scale was carried out with data obtained from 441 participants The test-retest reliability of the scale was carried out with data obtained from the 51 participants who filled the scale again after 14 days Results: According to the item-total correlations and factor analysis results with 40 items, 5 items with low correlation and factor load or loaded same under the two factors were removed from the scale The final form had 35 items and had a two-factor structure The internal consistency coefficient of the scale was calculated as 0 96, and the test-retest correlation coefficient was 0 98 Conclusion: Coronavirus-related psychiatric symptom scale in children - parental form is a valid and reliable scale for measuring perceived psychiatric symptoms associated with COVID-19 pandemic in children aged 4-18 years by their parents","output":"Validity and reliability study of coronavirus-related psychiatric symptom scale in children - parental form"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ever-vulnerable medication supply chain is being further strained by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In an adult cohort with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, we integrated glucose data upon hospital admission with fasting blood glucose (FBG) in the year prior to COVID-19 and during postdischarge follow-up. METHODS: From February 25 to May 15, 2020, 660 adults with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy). Through structured interviews/ medical record reviews, we collected demographics, clinical features, and laboratory tests upon admission and additional data during hospitalization or after discharge and in the previous year. Upon admission, we classified participants according to American Diabetes Association criteria as having (1) preexisting diabetes, (2) newly diagnosed diabetes, (3) hyperglycemia not in the diabetes range, or (4) normoglycemia. FBG prior to admission and during follow-up were classified as normal or impaired fasting glucose and fasting glucose in the diabetes range. RESULTS: In patients with confirmed COVID (n = 589), the proportion with preexisting or newly diagnosed diabetes, hyperglycemia not in the diabetes range and normoglycemia was 19.6%, 6.7%, 43.7%, and 30.0%, respectively. Patients with dysglycemia associated to COVID-19 had increased markers of inflammation and organs injury and poorer clinical outcome compared to those with normoglycemia. After the infection resolved, the prevalence of dysglycemia reverted to preadmission frequency. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19Cassociated dysglycemia is unlikely to become a lasting public health problem.

As a result, the CSSD staff may have experienced psychological stress, however, the mental state of the CSSD staff during the COVID-19 epidemic has been rarely studied. We aim to investigate the mental state of the CSSD staff and relevant influencing factors experienced during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: The survey utilising a general information questionnaire, Chinese perceived stress scale (CPSS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) was conducted with 423 CSSD staff members from 35 hospitals in Sichuan Province, China. Data was analysed in SPSS24.0. Classification and regression tree (CART) was utilised to analyse variables and find variation between groups. A chi-square test was performed on enumeration data, and t-test and analysis of variance were performed on measurement data. RESULTS: The CSSD staffs SAS score was 37.39  8.458, their CPSS score was 19.21  7.265, and their CD-RISC score was 64.26  15.129 (Tenacity factor score: 31.70  8.066, Strength factor score: 21.60  5.066, Optimism factor scores: 10.96  3.189). The CPSS score was positively correlated with the SAS score (r = 0.66; P < 0.01), the CPSS score was negatively correlated with the CD-RISC score (r = ? 0.617, P < 0.01), and the SAS score was negatively correlated with the CD-RISC score (r = ? 0.477, P < 0.01). The job position, age, and political status of the CSSD staff were the main factors affecting their mental state; for example, the CPSS score and SAS score of the CSSD nurses were significantly different from those of the CSSD logistic staff (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: During the epidemic, the CSSD staffs psychological resilience was at a low level; the anxiety level of the CSSD nurses was higher than that of the CSSD logistic staff.

Benefit from anticoagulation is well established in hospitalized patients. But since there is a lack of data on coagulopathy resolution: there is no consensus in guidelines if extended anticoagulation is required. PURPOSE: The purpose of our work was to analyze coagulation abnormalities at 2 to 5 months after moderate to severe COVID-19. METHODS: COVID-19 reconvalescents (CR), discharged from our hospital, were called for follow-up at 2C3 (CR1 group, 21 patients) or 5C6 (CR2 group, 26 patients) months after discharge. All CR were not on the anticoagulation therapy by that time. In addition to clinical examination and standard lab tests, we performed an FMD-test to analyze endothelial function, impedance aggregometry to analyze platelet aggregation, and a thrombodynamics test to assess thrombogenesis and fibrinolysis. The control group was recruited before the pandemic started. RESULTS: All CR were free from thrombotic complications after discharge from the hospital. Endothelial function was not significantly impaired in CR compared with control, and was still in the normal range (7,07, IQR (3,36; 11,56) vs. 7,87 (5,42; 13,45)). Platelet aggregation was significantly lower in CR1 than in the control group in ADP-induced mode (37, IQR (19; 47) vs. 46, IQR (41; 50), p=0,02) and didn't differ in other groups and other modes (Asa, TRAP-induced). Thrombodynamics tests revealed suppression of the clot formation process in both CR1 and CR2 compared with control. There were decreased clot growth rates (m/min) (CR1/CR2: 27,1, IQR (26,1; 29,2)/27,6, IQR (26,4; 30,0) vs. 32,2, IQR (30,0; 35,1), both p<0,001); decreased clot size (m) (CR1/CR2: 1099, IQR (1069; 1194)/1199, IQR (1058; 1221) vs. 1304, IQR (1164; 1380), both p<0,001), and decreased optical density (arb units) (CR1/CR2: 21'607, IQR (20'363; 24'545)/22'741, IQR (21'344; 25'961) vs. 26'556, IQR (24'672; 29'387, p<0,001 and p=0,09 respectively. Fibrinolysis was enhanced in CR groups compared with control (lysis progression was significantly higher for CR2 only, CR1/CR2: 2,9, IQR (2,5; 3,8)/3,8, IQR (2,6; 5,4) vs. 2,5, IQR (1,1; 3,4) %/min, p=0,087 and p=0,007 respectively; expected clot lysis time was shorter in both CR1 and CR2: 36,5, IQR (29,8; 44,2)/31,7, IQR (24,3; 42,7) vs. 65,9. IQR (36,3; 95,5) min, p=0,019 and p=0,016 respectively). There was no statistical difference in clot formation and in fibrinolysis between CR1 and CR2. CONCLUSION: In the deferred period (2C5 months) of COVID-19 the fibrinolysis process remains still active whereas the process of clot formation is mostly suppressed. Endothelial function assessed via the FMD test is within the normal range in the post COVID period.

Anasarca is a rare manifestation of this disease and is associated with a more severe and refractory course, requiring increased immunosuppression. Early recognition of this atypical presentation of JDM may lead to earlier treatment and better outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION We present two female patients, ages 11 years old and 4 years old, who presented to the ED with anasarca and were subsequently diagnosed with JDM.

We sought the true prevalence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 on the ICU, with or without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. DESIGN We undertook a single-center, retrospective analysis of 72 critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome admitted to ICU. CT angiography of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis were performed at admission as per routine institution protocols, with further imaging as clinically indicated. The prevalence of thrombotic complications and the relationship with coagulation parameters, other biomarkers, and survival were evaluated. SETTING Coronavirus disease 2019 ICUs at a specialist cardiorespiratory center. PATIENTS Seventy-two consecutive patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICU during the study period (March 19, 2020, to June 23, 2020). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS All but one patient received thromboprophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation. Among 72 patients (male:female = 74%; mean age: 52  10; 35 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), there were 54 thrombotic complications in 42 patients (58%), comprising 34 pulmonary arterial (47%), 15 peripheral venous (21%), and five (7%) systemic arterial thromboses/end-organ embolic complications. In those with pulmonary arterial thromboses, 93% were identified incidentally on first screening CT with only 7% suspected clinically. Biomarkers of coagulation (e.g., D-dimer, fibrinogen level, and activated partial thromboplastin time) or inflammation (WBC count, C-reactive protein) did not discriminate between patients with or without thrombotic complications. Fifty-one patients (76%) survived to discharge; 17 (24%) patients died. Mortality was significantly greater in patients with detectable thrombus (33% vs 10%; p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS There is a high prevalence of thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary, among coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to ICU, despite anticoagulation. Detection of thrombus was usually incidental, not predicted by coagulation or inflammatory biomarkers, and associated with increased risk of death. Systematic CT imaging at admission should be considered in all coronavirus disease 2019 patients requiring ICU.","output":"Prevalence of Thrombotic Complications in ICU-Treated Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Detected With Systematic CT Scanning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Undoubtedly, the 2019 novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has put mental health clinicians under stress.

The population and health care system in Mexico City experienced the first and greatest early burden of critical illness. OBJECTIVE To describe baseline characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of consecutive critically ill patients in Mexico hospitals that treated the majority of such patients with confirmed, probable, or suspected 2009 influenza A(H1N1). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Observational study of 58 critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) at 6 hospitals between March 24 and June 1, 2009. Demographic data, symptoms, comorbid conditions, illness progression, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected using a piloted case report form. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was mortality. Secondary outcomes included rate of 2009 influenza (A)H1N1-related critical illness and mechanical ventilation as well as intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay. RESULTS Critical illness occurred in 58 of 899 patients (6.5%) admitted to the hospital with confirmed, probable, or suspected 2009 influenza (A)H1N1. Patients were young (median, 44.0 [range, 10-83] years); all presented with fever and all but 1 with respiratory symptoms. Few patients had comorbid respiratory disorders, but 21 (36%) were obese. Time from hospital to ICU admission was short (median, 1 day [interquartile range {IQR}, 0-3 days]), and all patients but 2 received mechanical ventilation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and refractory hypoxemia (median day 1 ratio of Pao(2) to fraction of inspired oxygen, 83 [IQR, 59-145] mm Hg). By 60 days, 24 patients had died (41.4%; 95% confidence interval, 28.9%-55.0%). Patients who died had greater initial severity of illness, worse hypoxemia, higher creatine kinase levels, higher creatinine levels, and ongoing organ dysfunction. After adjusting for a reduced opportunity of patients dying early to receive neuraminidase inhibitors, neuraminidase inhibitor treatment (vs no treatment) was associated with improved survival (odds ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-62.8). CONCLUSION Critical illness from 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in Mexico occurred in young individuals, was associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock, and had a high case-fatality rate.","output":"Critically Ill patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in Mexico."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of COVID-19 has had a profound impact on many spheres of social life across the world. One of them has been the deepening of social inequalities and the aggravating of discrimination based on gender. Emerging studies in the field of education and occupation systems point to the fact that women seem to have been particularly affected, along with layoffs in those sectors of the economy where female staffs prevail. Additionally, in many countries, the burden of combining professional careers and supporting the education of young children falls disproportionately on mothers. These transformations pose a challenge to meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, wherein gender equality is an important factor. This article uses official statistical data to examine gender and educational structures during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland, set against the backdrop of other European nations and analyzed in the context of sustainability. Have educational and gender inequalities been exacerbated as data from other countries suggest? In order to answer this question, the article traces changes in the education system in Poland and their implications for gender structures. The latter have also been affected by transformations on the labor market in various sectors of the economy, therefore, the second part of the analysis focuses on the labor market changes during the pandemic. The final section offers conclusions on the implications of the pandemic for the studied issues. Throughout the article, we apply the principles of unobtrusive research.

The participants were grouped according to being diagnosed with COVID-19 infection or not, and having previous or new-onset headaches. The COVID-19 related headache features and their associations with other clinical features were investigated. A binary logistic regression model was performed to differentiate the characteristics of headache related to COVID-19. Findings A total of 3458 participants (2341 females;67.7%, 1495 healthcare workers;43.2%) with a mean age of 43.2111.2 years contributed to the survey. Among them, 262 participants had COVID-19 diagnosis and 126 (48.1%) were male. The rate of males in the group without COVID-19 was 31% (991 out of 3196 participants) showing significant gender difference between groups (p<0.000). COVID-19 related headaches were more closely associated with anosmia/ageusia and gastrointestinal complaints (p<0.000 and p<0.000), and showed different characteristics like pulsating, pressing, and even stabbing quality. Logistic regression analyses showed that bilateral headache, duration over 72 hours, analgesic resistance and having male gender were significant variables to differentiate COVID-19 positive patients from those without COVID-19 (p=0.04 for long duration and p<0.000 for others). A worsening of previous primary headaches due to the pandemic-related problems was not reported in the majority of patients.Interpretation Bilateral, long-lasting headaches, resistance to analgesics and having male gender were more frequent in people with COVID-19 in conjunction with anosmia/ageusia and gastrointestinal complaints.

Brazil has implemented voluntary sodium reduction targets with food industries since 2011. This study aimed to analyse the potential health and economic impact of these sodium reduction targets in Brazil from 2013 to 2032. METHODS We developed a microsimulation of a close-to-reality synthetic population (IMPACTNCD-BR) to evaluate the potential health benefits of setting voluntary upper limits for sodium content as part of the Brazilian government strategy. The model estimates CVD deaths and cases prevented or postponed, and disease treatment costs. Model inputs were informed by the 2013 National Health Survey, the 2008-2009 Household Budget Survey, and high-quality meta-analyses, assuming that all individuals were exposed to the policy proportionally to their sodium intake from processed food. Costs included costs of the National Health System on CVD treatment and informal care costs. The primary outcome measures of the model are cardiovascular disease cases and deaths prevented or postponed over 20 years (2013-2032), stratified by age and sex. RESULTS The study found that the application of the Brazilian voluntary sodium targets for packaged foods between 2013 and 2032 could prevent or postpone approximately 110,000 CVD cases (95% uncertainty intervals (UI): 28,000 to 260,000) among men and 70,000 cases among women (95% UI: 16,000 to 170,000), and also prevent or postpone approximately 2600 CVD deaths (95% UI: - 1000 to 11,000), 55% in men. The policy could also produce a net cost saving of approximately US$ 220 million (95% UI: US$ 54 to 520 million) in medical costs to the Brazilian National Health System for the treatment of CHD and stroke and save approximately US$ 71 million (95% UI: US$ 17 to170 million) in informal costs. CONCLUSION Brazilian voluntary sodium targets could generate substantial health and economic impacts.

Unlike envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, the transmembrane glycoprotein El is glycosylated normally in the presence of tunicamycin. This suggests that glycosylation of El does not involve transfer of core oligosaccharides from dolichol pyrophosphate intermediates to asparagine residues, but may occur by 0-linked glycosylation of serine or threonine residues. Synthesis of the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 is not readily detectable in the presence of tunicamycin. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of E2 by tunicamycin either prevents synthesis or facilitates degradation of the protein moiety of E2. Radiolabeling with carbohydrate precursors and borate gel electrophoresis of glycopeptides show that different oligcsaccharide side chains are attached to El and E2. The two coronavirus envelope glycoproteins thus appear to be glycosylated by different mechanisms. In tunicamycin-treated cells, noninfectious virions lacking peplomers are formed at intracytoplasmic membranes and released from the cells. These virions contain normal amounts of nucleocapsid protein and glycosylated El, but lack E2. Thus the transmembrane glycoprotein El is the only viral glycoprotein required for the formation of the viral envelope or for virus maturation and release. The peplomeric glycoprotein E2 appears to be required for attachment to virus receptors on the plasma membrane. The coronavirus envelope envelope glycoprotein E1 appears to be a novel type of viral glycoprotein which is post-translationally glycosylated by a tunicamycin-resistant process that yields oligosaccharide side chains different from those of N-linked glycoproteins. These findings suggest that El may be particularly useful as a model for studying the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and intracellular transport of 0-linked glycoproteins.","output":"Tunicamycin resistant glycosylation of a coronavirus glycoprotein: Demonstration of a novel type of viral glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little doubt exists among numerous cultural and political theorists and practitioners that the world has entered a new stage organized around a new system of meaning, where uncertainty and distance rule and the other is a figure of contagion: we will call this new stage viral culture  Predictions abound about the huge cultural and political influence of new viruses, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19) that, like all viruses, is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism Traditional cultural institutions and lifestyles are experiencing rapid political transformation Concepts of protection and mobility, authoritarian populism, extermination, normality, operation, the city, biopolitics, language, life, the image, utopia, leisure, and even the idea of other people are just a few","output":"Viral Culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In hematological neoplasms associated with COVID-19, immunological dysfunction, including reduced count of non-classical monocytes, has been suggested as a primary driver of morbidity and mortality. In this work, we investigated the contribution of absolute monocyte count to clinical outcome of COVID-19 in 120 patients affected by hematological neoplasms that tested positive to SARS-CoV-2. We found that there was no statistical difference in 30-day mortality, rate of hospitalization for intensive cure and viral clearance at 14 days between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Increased 30-day mortality was associated with presence of active/progressing disease and absolute monocyte count lower than 400 cells/uL. Reduced absolute counts of monocytes should be used as an alert of increased risk of severe/critical forms of COVID-19 in patients with hematological malignancies, even when the full vaccination cycle has been completed. ABSTRACT: Background: Clinical course of COVID-19 depends on several patient-specific risk factors, including immune function, that is largely compromised in cancer patients. Methods: We prospectively evaluated 120 adult consecutive patients (including 34 cases of COVID-19 breakthrough after two full doses of BNT162b2 vaccine) with underlying hematological malignancies and a SARS-CoV-2 infection, in terms of patients clinical outcome. Results: Among fully vaccinated patients the achievement of viral clearance by day 14 was more frequent than in unvaccinated patients. Increased 30-day mortality was associated with presence of active/progressing disease and absolute monocyte count lower than 400 cells/uL. Results of multivariable analysis in unvaccinated patients showed that the pre-infection absolute count of monocytes less or equal to 400 cells/mmc, active or progressive disease of the underlying hematological malignancy, the COVID-19 severity identified by hospitalization requirement and lack of viral clearance at 14 days were independent predictors of 1-year overall survival. Conclusions: Taken together, our results indicate that absolute monocyte count determined one month before any documented SARS-CoV-2 infection could identify patients affected by hematological neoplasms with increased risk of inferior overall survival.","output":"Reduced Absolute Count of Monocytes in Patients Carrying Hematological Neoplasms and SARS-CoV2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease that targets the hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230/bullous pemphigoid antigen 1e (BPAG1e).

METHODS: An international sample of oncology professionals (n = 118) completed an online questionnaire with validated measures of present-centered awareness and attention, empathy, compassion fatigue, and burnout. Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to model relations among the independent variable (present-centered awareness and attention) and the criterion variables of burnout (disengagement, exhaustion) and compassion fatigue (compassion satisfaction, compassion burnout, secondary traumatic stress) after statistically controlling for empathy, age, gender, years of experience, and patient contact hours. RESULTS: Mean hours of patient contact per week was 23.52 (SD = 13.62), with 26 (22.03%) reporting 40 h or more. Higher hours of patient contact per week were positively associated with secondary traumatic stress. Present-centered awareness and attention was associated with lower disengagement, lower emotional exhaustion, higher compassion satisfaction, lower secondary traumatic stress, and lower compassion burnout.

Intracellular fluoride concentrations of fluoride tolerance strains were higher compared to UA159 strain as demonstrated by 18F analysis. Further validation with rat caries models showed that UA159-T caused more severe caries lesions under fluoride exposure compared with its parental UA159 strain. Overall, the identified -36GaT mutation in the promoter region of F0F1-ATPase gene drastically contributed to the fluoride tolerance and enhanced cariogenicity of S. mutans. These findings provided new insights into the mechanism of microbial fluoride tolerance, and suggested F0F1-ATPase as a potential target for suppressing fluoride resistant strains.","output":"F0F1-ATPase Contributes to the Fluoride Tolerance and Cariogenicity of Streptococcus mutans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne particles. These particles are generated when infected persons exhale and they spread throughout the room, resulting in a high concentration and thus a high risk of infection of non-infected persons.

Since many studies are conducted in generic rooms, the question of the cleaning performance of such room air cleaners in real rooms arises. In order to investigate this, measurements of the effectiveness were carried out in a total of 4 different rooms of the \\"Obermenzinger Gymnasium\\" (Obermenzinger high school) in Munich.

We aim to review the new developments in diagnostics, prevention, and management strategies of CMV infection in Allo-HSCT recipients. RECENT FINDINGS: The approval of the novel anti-CMV drug letermovir in 2017 has led to an increase in the use of antiviral prophylaxis as a preferred approach for prevention in many centers. Real-world studies have shown efficacy similar to the clinical trial. CMV-specific T cell-mediated immunity assays identify patients with immune reconstitution and predict disease progression. Phase 2 trials of maribavir have shown its efficacy as preemptive therapy and treatment of resistant and refractory CMV infections. Adoptive T cell therapy is an emerging option for treatment of refractory and resistant CMV. Of the different CMV vaccine trials, PepVax has shown promising results in a phase 1 trial. SUMMARY: CMV cell-mediated immunity assays have potential to be used as an adjunctive test to develop individualized management plan by identifying the patients who develop immune reconstitution; however, further prospective interventional studies are needed.

METHODS: Data regarding provisional death counts and estimates of excess deaths for COVID-19 according to state and territory were downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics website. Reporting included the six-month-long period of March 1 - August 31, 2020. Excess mortality rates were calculated as the number of excess deaths per 100,000 persons in each state population using 2019 US Census Bureau data. Mean values for state and territorial NHSPI domain indices were compared to state and territorial rates of COVID-19-related excess mortality using multiple linear regression, including analysis of variance. Correlations between the 51 state and territorial NHSPI values and corresponding COVID-19 excess mortality rates were calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: These calculations revealed a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.02 and 0.25) and poor correlation (P = .16 and .08) among values for the overall NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico.There was also a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.001 and 0.03) and poor correlation (P values ranging from .09 to .94) for values for the six individual domains of the NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico.

As a result, people with CF were classed as clinically extremely vulnerable and were advised to shield at home. In this hospital outpatient clinics were halted;however, the adultCF service had started using the NuvoAir Home remote monitoring solution with 162 patients already established with home spirometry, video consultations, and data sharing with the clinical team. Our aim was to evaluate our experience of replacing all face-to-face clinical reviews with video consultations supported by self-monitoring, at pace and scale during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods:FromApril2020, 2 members of the CF MDT started contacting all patients not on the NuvoAir Home platform (n=418)to discuss the virtual service and askiftheywere interested in joining. Onconsent, patients were given access to the platform, taught how to download the app, and told how to set up the spirometers (which were posted to them) and how often to perform spirometry. A dedicated email address and telephone line were set up for technical support. Patients were sent an SMS reminder via the platform to complete their spirometry prior to a video clinic appointment but also encouraged to monitor their spirometry at other times to build a personalized trend. Results: To date (March 31, 2021) 558 patients have been onboarded to the remote monitoring program. Pre-pandemic (month of March 2020), 417 spirometry sessions were recorded and 82 video consultations performed. Midway through (in the month of August 2020) n = 539 spirometry sessions had been recorded, with n = 325 video consultations, and in the month of March 2021, n = 609 spirometry sessions and n = 438 video consultations were recorded. Twenty-eight percent of spirometry sessions were unrelated to a video clinic. Total spirometry sessions for April 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021, were n = 6,969. Using ATS criteria n = 5,264 (76%) sessions were graded acceptable (A-D), and n = 1,705 (24%) sessions graded E+F. Reasons patients performed extra spirometry included: checking the effectiveness of treatment change, pre-clinic consultation, feeling unwell, and recovery after an exacerbation. Conclusion: We now have 558 adults with CF onboarded to the virtual platform. Although patients are reminded to do spirometry before an appointment, many also choose to self-monitor their health between clinic consultations. Clinician confidence in self-monitoring is supported by the grading of spirometry sessions using ATS criteria;the best is selected by the software. The platform is now also widely used by the CF MDT for one-to-one or small group support and education sessions. There are a small number of patients (n = 5) who do not wish to use this service for various reasons, including reluctance to change the status quo, hearing impairment, and access to technology. Alternatives are in place for those individuals. Moving the service forward we have added weighing scales and activity trackers, and organized postal, self-administered finger prick blood tests (e.g., liver function tests) and sputum samples. Patients have reported high satisfaction with the service as they are gaining more time for work, education, and family life, as well as saving money. However, they have also reported missing face-to-face contact. We are therefore working closely with patients to devise a hybrid virtual/face-to-face service for the future.","output":"116 Implementing a digital clinic review service in a national lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]COVID-19 accelerated digitization, as consumers leapt forward five years in digital adoption in just two months of the pandemic (McKinsey & Co , 2020a) The rapid development of information technology facilitates the sharing of consumer-service experiences and their positive or negative reflections as part of co-creation activities that potentially informs brand development and reputation (Binkhorst and Den Dekker, 2009;Au et al , 2014), with brand reputation being of a particular importance, as it has a direct impact on competitiveness and profitability (Anagnostopoulou et al , 2020;Viglia et al , 2016) Numerous studies in tourism and hospitality have discussed brand management and co-creation separately, but academic attempts to integrate two important themes have been more limited [ ]the purpose of this special issue of Journal of Product and Brand Management is to explore brand management and co-creation in tourism and hospitality contexts using a variety of issues, concepts and examples Govers and Go (2009) defined place brands as representations of place identity, building a favourable internal (public, private and civil society stakeholders) and external (tourists, investors, traders, migrants) image, leading to brand equity;that is, brand satisfaction and loyalty;name awareness;perceived quality;and other favourable brand associations (that is, positive image and reputation) attached to a name or symbol representing a country, city or region","output":"Guest editorial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cohort study analyzed persistent symptoms among adults with coronavirus disease 2019 up to 9 months after illness onset.","output":"Sequelae in Adults at 6 Months After COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was responsible for over 4 million confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, of which more than 300,000 cases were confirmed to be dead as of May 2020.

The growing literature of adverse suture material reactions provided the objective of this study, to use in vitro assays to quantify levels of inflammation produced by seven commonly used suture materials in surgical procedures. METHODS Human monocyte/macrophage THP-1 cells were exposed to suture materials for 1, 3 and 5 days. Gene expression and protein secretion of six inflammatory cytokines and two cell surface markers were assessed using qPCR and ELISA respectively, with LPS exposure providing a positive control. Furthermore, a IL-1/IL-1RA marker ratio was assessed to determine the balance between pro-/anti-inflammatory expression. RESULTS The findings from our in vitro study suggest that four commonly used suture materials cause upregulation of pro-inflammatory markers indicative of an early foreign body reaction, with no balance from anti-inflammatory markers.

However, it is often measured visually with considerable bias and inaccuracy. OBJECTIVES Firstly, to compare distribution and accuracy of electronically measured RR (EMRR) and visually measured RR (VMRR). Secondly, to determine whether, and how far in advance, continuous electronic RR monitoring can predict oncoming hypoxic and pyrexic episodes in infectious respiratory disease. APPROACH A retrospective cohort study analysing the difference between EMRR and VMRR was conducted using patient data from a large tertiary hospital. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether continuous, EMRR measurements could predict oncoming hypoxic (SpO2 <92%) and pyrexic (temperature >38 C) episodes. MAIN RESULTS Data were gathered from 34 COVID-19 patients, from which a total of 3445 observations of VMRR (independent of Hawthorne effect), peripheral oxygen saturation and temperature and 729117 observations of EMRR were collected. VMRR had peaks in distribution at 18 and 20 breaths per minute. 70.9% of patients would have had a change of treatment during their admission based on the UK's National Early Warning System if EMRR was used in place of VMRR. An elevated EMRR was predictive of hypoxic (hazard ratio: 1.8 (1.05 to 3.07)) and pyrexic (hazard ratio: 9.7 (3.8 to 25)) episodes over the following 12 hours. SIGNIFICANCE Continuous EMRR values are systematically different VMRR values, and results suggest it is a better indicator of true RR as it has lower kurtosis, has higher variance, a lack of peaks at expected values (18 and 20) and it measures a physiological component of breathing directly (abdominal movement). Results suggest EMRR is a strong marker of oncoming hypoxia and is highly predictive of oncoming pyrexic events in the following 12 hours. In many diseases, this could provide an early window to escalate care prior to deterioration, potentially preventing morbidity and mortality.","output":"The effectiveness of continuous respiratory rate monitoring in predicting hypoxic and pyrexic events: a retrospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Ariel mission will characterise the chemical and thermal properties of the atmospheres of about a thousand exoplanets transiting their host star(s).

DESIGN Scoping review of peer-reviewed articles and editorials published from database inception to February 2021. DATA SOURCES PubMed and Ovid Medline, and snowballing techniques. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We included articles that discussed key focus concepts of SPHS: (1) definitions, (2) measurement, (3) identified challenges, (4) identified solutions for improvement and (5) scaling successful solutions to maintain SPHS. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS After title/abstract screening, full-text articles were reviewed, and relevant information extracted and synthesised under the five focus concepts. RESULTS Of 142 included articles, 38 (27%) provided a definition of SPHS. Definitions were based mainly on financial sustainability, however, SPHS was also more broadly conceptualised and included acceptability to patients and workforce, resilience through adaptation, and rapid absorption of evidence and innovations. Measures of SPHS were also predominantly financial, but recent articles proposed composite measures that accounted for financial, social and health outcomes. Challenges to achieving SPHS included the increasingly complex patient populations, limited integration because of entrenched fragmented systems and siloed professional groups, and the ongoing translational gaps in evidence-to-practice and policy-to-practice. Improvement strategies for SPHS included developing appropriate workplace cultures, direct community and consumer involvement, and adoption of evidence-based practice and technologies. There was also a strong identified need for long-term monitoring and evaluations to support adaptation of healthcare systems and to anticipate changing needs where possible. CONCLUSIONS To implement lasting change and to respond to new challenges, we need context-relevant definitions and frameworks, and robust, flexible, and feasible measures to support the long-term sustainability and performance of healthcare systems.","output":"How can the healthcare system deliver sustainable performance?

This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by a cohort of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD) after a seven-week period of lockdown measures, and to analyze serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels as a potential predictor of distress severity. METHODS: Fifty-nine remitted MDD and fifty-three euthymic BD patients were enrolled. An online dedicated survey was administered to obtain lockdown-related information and to evaluate COVID-19 related distress by using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Patients' medical records were reviewed to collect sociodemographic and clinical data, including serum 25(OH)D levels dosed in the three months preceding the outbreak. A multivariate general linear model was adopted to test the effect of factors of interest on psychological distress. RESULTS: In our sample (na?=a?112), 29 subjects (25.9 %) reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 35 (31.2 %) and 48 (42.9 %) displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood of psychological distress, respectively. Low serum 25(OH)D levels (pa?=a?0.005) and MDD diagnosis (pa?=a?0.001) specifically predicted the severity of psychological distress. Living alone during the lockdown, a longer duration of illness, and smoking habits were more frequently detected in subjects with COVID-19 related distress. CONCLUSIONS: Low serum 25(OH)D levels and MDD diagnosis predicted an increased vulnerability to the stressful impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Because the diagnostic procedure for the detection of cystic oviducts by postmortem examinations in IBV-positive replacement pullet flocks could involve the unnecessary sacrifice of numerous healthy pullets without reproductive tract anomalies, the development of a noninvasive and nonlethal diagnostic procedure would be desirable. The first objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a transcutaneous ultrasonography method to predict the presence of cystic oviducts compared to postmortem examinations in a commercial pullet flock positive for an IBV genotype Delmarva (DMV) variant. The second objective was to evaluate the performance of the same ultrasonography method to later detect false layers in the same flock in sexually mature hens by identifying the presence of an egg in the oviduct due to the presence of atretic oviducts undetectable by ultrasonography and the absence of cystic oviducts at that age. In replacement pullets, the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the ultrasonography (index test) compared to the postmortem examination (reference standard test) were 73% and 91%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 67% and 93%.

Many physicians across the globe are changing practice patterns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine the practice changes among rheumatologists and what they perceive the impact to be on their most vulnerable patients. METHODS: We administered an online survey to a convenience sample of rheumatologists worldwide during the initial height of the pandemic (between 8 April and 4 May 2020) via social media and group emails. We surveyed rheumatologists about their opinions regarding patients from low SES and racial/ethnic minority groups in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mainly, what their specific concerns were, including the challenges of medication access; and about specific social factors (health literacy, poverty, food insecurity, access to telehealth video) that may be complicating the management of rheumatologic conditions during this time. RESULTS: 548 rheumatologists responded from 64 countries and shared concerns of food insecurity, low health literacy, poverty and factors that preclude social distancing such as working and dense housing conditions among their patients. Although 82% of rheumatologists had switched to telehealth video, 17% of respondents estimated that about a quarter of their patients did not have access to telehealth video, especially those from below the poverty line. The majority of respondents believed these vulnerable patients, from racial/ethnic minorities and from low SES groups, would do worse, in terms of morbidity and mortality, during the pandemic.

A 26-year male patient was admitted to the Emergency Department with fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain. Radiographic imaging of the patient revealed pneumothorax on the right and peripherally distributed non-homogenous opacification. The patient underwent right lateral tube thoracostomy. COVID-19 was diagnosed on testing of nasopharyngeal swab. In conclusion, spontaneous pneumothorax is one of the rare presentations of COVID-19 pneumonia and should be kept in mind in patients presenting with shortness of breath and chest pain.

AIM: The present study aimed to analyze the impact of lockdown on the monitoring and care of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in a Moroccan population from the Doukkala region. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study including 121 T2DM patients recruited from the Diabetes Diagnosis and Treatment Center of El Jadida city. Demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical data of our T2DM patients were recorded before and after lockdown that lasted 82 days. All patients have signed an informed consent after being informed about the purely scientific aims of the study. RESULTS: Our sample involved 84 women and 37 men with an age average of 57.31  0.91 years. The effects of lockdown were more marked in women than in men: women showed a significant tendency to gain weight (from 78.13  1.36 kg to 81.80  1.45 kg; p-value < 0.000), that impacted the body mass index (p-value < 0.000); they also showed significant increases in HbA1c values (p-value = 0.001), significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (p-value = 0.0302) and a surprising increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p-value = 0.0132). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the women sample increased from 46.4% to 54.8% after the lockdown. In men, the negative effect of lockdown was observed only in HbA1c that values increased significantly from 8.66  0.21% to 9.51  0.25% (p-value = 0.0127). CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that lockdown had impacted negatively the health status of T2DM patients, especially women. We suggest an urgent development of programs aiming to improve the hygiene of life and to reduce the impact of future crises on patients suffering chronic diseases such as T2DM.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic: Effects of national lockdown on the state of health of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Moroccan population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper reports a qualitative study to reveal how preservice science teachers' decision making (DM) processes on socioscientific issue (SSI) in a referendum case compare between unsophisticated (Group U) and sophisticated (Group S) views in terms of nature of science (NOS) understandings.

Inflammatory cytokines are key elements in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, and the occurrence of an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines leads to additional non-pulmonary organ dysfunction which contributes to excess mortality rates. Treatment of these patients includes nutrition support with lipids, usually soybean oil-based lipid emulsions, which are rich in omega (n)-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and deficient in n-3 PUFAs; however, too much n-6 PUFAs are detrimental due to their pro-inflammatory effects. Conversely, a large amount of experimental studies and some randomized clinical trials showed the benefits of the n-3 PUFA administration in the context of ALI because of their anti-inflammatory properties. Based on these data, several scientific societies recommended in their guidelines, with an A or B grade of recommendation, the use of n-3 PUFAs in ALI/ARDS patients. However, at present, the issue of lipid therapy in ALI/ARDS is still controversial due, at least in part, to inconclusive or contradicting results in several recent clinical trials using n-3 PUFAs.","output":"Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Cytokines: Their Relationship in Acute Lung Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solution-gated graphene field-effect transistors (SG-GFETs) provide an ideal platform for sensing biomolecules owing to their high electron/hole mobilities and 2D nature. However, the transfer curve often drifts in an electrolyte solution during measurements, making it difficult to accurately estimate the analyte concentration. One possible reason for this drift is that p-doping of GFETs is gradually countered by cations in the solution, because the cations can permeate into the polymer residue and/or between graphene and SiO(2) substrates. Therefore, we propose doping sufficient cations to counter p-doping of GFETs prior to the measurements. For the pre-treatment, GFETs were immersed in a 15 mM sodium chloride aqueous solution for 25 h. The pretreated GFETs showed that the charge neutrality point (CNP) drifted by less than 3 mV during 1 h of measurement in a phosphate buffer, while the non-treated GFETs showed that the CNP was severely drifted by approximately 50 mV, demonstrating a 96% reduction of the drift by the pre-treatment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed the accumulation of sodium ions in the GFETs through pre-treatment. Our method is useful for suppressing drift, thus allowing accurate estimation of the target analyte concentration.","output":"Drift Suppression of Solution-Gated Graphene Field-Effect Transistors by Cation Doping for Sensing Platforms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations are associated with viral infections. We wished to determine if respiratory viral infection of children in the community was associated with hospital admissions of patients with exacerbations of COPD.

We studied the relationship between upper respiratory infections in children and COPD admissions. We also examined the role of school holidays. RESULTS: Correlations were seen between the frequency of all viral infections in children and the number of adult COPD hospitalizations [Formula: see text]. Subgroup analysis showed distinct relationships with epidemics of; influenza A [Formula: see text] , influenza B [Formula: see text] , adenovirus [Formula: see text] , respiratory syncytial virus [Formula: see text] and hospital admissions of patients with COPD. There were significantly fewer COPD admissions in the week after the start of a school holiday period [Formula: see text]. CONCLUSIONS: When children are hospitalized with viral respiratory infection there is an associated rise in adult COPD admissions.

Few reports exist in Latin America, a current epicenter of transmission. Here, we aim to describe the epidemiology and outcomes associated with COVID-19 in Honduras. METHODS: Baseline clinical and epidemiological information of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases detected between March 17th-May 4th in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan area was collected, and, for hospitalized cases, clinical data was abstracted. Logistic regression models were fit to determine factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: 877 COVID-19 cases were identified of which 25% (n=220) were hospitalized. The 19-44-year age group (57.8%) and males (61.3%) were predominant in overall COVID-19 cases. 34% of the cases (n=299) had at least one pre-existing medical condition.

We argue that the power-law exponent of the latter regime, which measures how quickly the curve approaches the plateau, is directly related to control measures, in the sense that the less strict the control, the smaller the exponent and hence the slower the diseases progresses to its end. The power-law saturation uncovered here is an important result, because it signals to policymakers and health authorities that it is important to keep control measures for as long as possible, so as to avoid a slow, power-law ending of the disease. The slower the approach to the plateau, the longer the virus lingers on in the population, and the greater not only the final death toll but also the risk of a resurgence of infections.","output":"Power law behaviour in the saturation regime of fatality curves of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical devices are subject to strict regulatory and approval processes to enter the market and to be used by operators and patients.

AIM OF THE WORK: The aim of this prospective pilot study was to assess the effectiveness of a video-based outpatient consultation service, technical feasibility and control of patient flow under both lockdown and post-lockdown conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The initial evaluation was conducted up to 14 December 2020 when the second restrictive measures were implemented by the state government. The quality of the connections regarding sound and image was documented. Furthermore, the consequences of the conversations were documented. Distinctions were made in four categories: 1. no follow-up visit, 2. follow-up via video consultation, 3. operative intervention and 4. in-person follow-up visit for clinical examination. RESULTS: There were 236 video-based outpatient consultations, 182 (82%) consultations were without restrictions and 47 (21%) consultations were initial presentations. There were no follow-up consultations in 41 (18%) patients. Video-based follow-up was scheduled in 36 (16%) patients, direct referral for surgery in 36 (16%) patients, and in-person follow-up in 105 (47%) patients. DISCUSSION: In 40% of the patients a definite decision could be made by the initial video-based consultation alone. On the other hand, 47% of the patients needed in-person follow-up for a clinical examination. Thus, video consultation is a very useful measure to manage patient volume and visibly support direct doctor-patient contact.","output":"Die Videosprechstunde in einer unfallchirurgisch/orthop?dischen Spezialsprechstunde: Effektive erg?nzende Ma?nahme in Lockdown- und Post-Lockdown-Szenarien C eine prospektive Pilotstudie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Increasing suicide rates across the United States are disproportionate among populations most impacted by mass incarceration. We sought to determine if incarceration is associated with risk of suicide and firearm suicide after release from prison. METHODS: Using a population-based Washington cohort from Department of Corrections and vital statistics administrative records 1990-2017, individuals were compared to the sex-, age-, and race-matched population of Washington using Poisson regression. Among previously incarcerated individuals, we included incarceration history characteristics to calculate sub-hazard ratios using Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: Of 140,281 individuals released from prison, 484 died by suicide. Suicide risk was 62% higher among previously incarcerated individuals compared with the general population (RR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.46-1.79). Suicide risk was higher among individuals convicted of firearm-involved crimes (RR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.79-2.89). Individuals released prior to age 18 had substantially higher risk of firearm suicide than those whose first release occurred between ages 18-24 (sHR: 11.91; 95% CI: 4.30-32.96).

It also occurs frequently as a building block in other functional RNA structures in many different sequence and structural contexts. U-turns induce sharp changes in the direction of the RNA backbone and often conform to the 3-nt consensus sequence 5-UNR-3 (N = any nucleotide, R = purine). The canonical U-turn motif is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the N3 imino group of the U residue and the 3 phosphate group of the R residue as well as a hydrogen bond between the 2-hydroxyl group of the uridine and the N7 nitrogen of the R residue. Here, we demonstrate that a protonated cytidine can functionally and structurally replace the uridine at the first position of the canonical U-turn motif in the apical loop of the neomycin riboswitch. Using NMR spectroscopy, we directly show that the N3 imino group of the protonated cytidine forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone phosphate 3 from the third nucleotide of the U-turn analogously to the imino group of the uridine in the canonical motif. In addition, we compare the stability of the hydrogen bonds in the mutant U-turn motif to the wild type and describe the NMR signature of the C+-phosphate interaction. Our results have implications for the prediction of RNA structural motifs and suggest simple approaches for the experimental identification of hydrogen bonds between protonated C-imino groups and the phosphate backbone.","output":"Building a stable RNA U-turn with a protonated cytidine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has prevented students from contributing towards the economic growth of Pakistan.

Originally, trastuzumab had to be administered intravenously (IV) over 30 min every 3 weeks for 1 year. Since 2012, a formulation for the subcutaneous (SC) administration of trastuzumab has been available, which has not yet been approved in the USA. Advocates claim that the SC formulation saves time and money, despite higher costs. The purpose of this study is to review existing literature concerning the comparative efficacy and risk of harms of trastuzumab IV and SC concerning patient-relevant health outcomes. METHODS We conducted searches in the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE for articles published through May 2018 in English or German. In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished studies. We dually reviewed the abstracts and full-text articles based on a priori defined inclusion criteria, rated the risk of bias of included studies, and assessed the strength of the evidence for each outcome of interest. Because data was insufficient for quantitative synthesis, we summarized results narratively. RESULTS We identified three RCTs (randomized controlled trials) meeting our eligibility criteria, which included data on 1003 patients. We found moderate evidence for similar event rates (20.05% vs. 18%, HR (hazard ratio) 0.88, CI 95% = 0.62-1.27), and mortality rates (10% vs. 8%, HR 0.76, CI 95% = 0.44-1.32) after 1.7 years for patients receiving trastuzumab IV and for patients receiving SC. Results remained similar after 3.3 years, though evidence lacked strength due to a high dropout rate. All trials reported more adverse events among the SC group than in the IV group. Evidence for these findings was of moderate strength. Nevertheless, more than 85% of the patients preferred trastuzumab SC over IV. Results concerning serious adverse events appeared to be heterogeneous. CONCLUSION Results of studies indicate similar efficacy between the two routes of administration. The higher rates of adverse events for SC administration were mainly attributable to injection site-related events. The clinical decision of whether to administer trastuzumab SC or IV requires the consideration of several factors and should be determined individually.","output":"The comparative efficacy and risk of harms of the intravenous and subcutaneous formulations of trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer: a rapid review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Picture naming tasks are currently the gold standard for identifying and preserving language-related areas during awake brain surgery. With multilingual populations increasing worldwide, patients frequently need to be tested in more than one language. There is still no reliable testing instrument, as the available batteries have been developed for specific languages.

Mothers, fathers, and grandmothers reported their depressive symptoms at Wave 1; at Wave 2 (during the COVID-19 pandemic), caregivers reported household chaos and child routines. The results revealed that child routines were negatively predicted by parents' joint depressive symptoms rather than grandmothers' depressive symptoms. In the associations, household chaos acted as a mediator rather than a moderator.

METHODS: This prospective study used a pre- and post-intervention design without a comparison group. The intervention was routine Ministry of Health (MOH) approved the management of COVID-19 for all patients. The study was conducted in a public healthcare setting in Baghdad, Iraq from March 1st to May 25, 2020. The study outcome measures included the changes in clinical and biochemical parameters during the hospitalisation period. Paired t-test and Chi-square test were used to compare the measures of vital signs, lab tests and symptoms before and after treatment. RESULTS: The study included 161 patients who were admitted with positive RT-PCR and clinical symptoms of COVID-19. In terms of severity, 53 (32.9%) patients had amild condition, 47 (29.2%) had moderate condition, 35 (21.7%) had severe condition and 26 (16.1%) had critical condition. Most patients (84.5%) recovered and were discharged without symptoms after testing negative with RT-PCR, while 11 (6.8%) patients died during the study period. The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were reduced significantly in response to a therapy regimen containing HCQ and azithromycin. The most common reported side effects were stomach pain, hypoglycemia, dizziness, itching, skin rash, QT prolongation, arrhythmia, and conjunctivitis. CONCLUSIONS: This natural trial showed that the COVID-19 regimen containing both HCQ and azithromycin can be helpful to promote the recovery of most patients and reduced their signs and symptoms significantly. It also shows some manageable side effects mostly those related to heart rhythm. In the absence of FDA-approved medications to treat COVID-19, the repurposing of HCQ and azithromycin to control the disease signs and symptoms can be useful.","output":"Assessment of COVID-19 Treatment containing both Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin: A natural clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the viral pathogen causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. No effective treatment for COVID-19 has been established yet. The serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for viral spread and pathogenicity by facilitating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. The protease inhibitor camostat, an anticoagulant used in the clinic, has potential anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities against COVID-19. However, the potential mechanisms of viral resistance and antiviral activity of camostat are unclear. Herein, we demonstrate high inhibitory potencies of camostat for a panel of serine proteases, indicating that camostat is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of serine proteases. In addition, we determined the crystal structure of camostat in complex with a serine protease (uPA [urokinase-type plasminogen activator]), which reveals that camostat is inserted in the S1 pocket of uPA but is hydrolyzed by uPA, and the cleaved camostat covalently binds to Ser195. We also generated a homology model of the structure of the TMPRSS2 serine protease domain. The model shows that camostat uses the same inhibitory mechanism to inhibit the activity of TMPRSS2, subsequently preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread. IMPORTANCE Serine proteases are a large family of enzymes critical for multiple physiological processes and proven diagnostic and therapeutic targets in several clinical indications. The serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) was recently found to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host. Camostat mesylate (FOY 305), a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2 and used for the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma and chronic pancreatitis, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung cells. However, the direct inhibition mechanism of camostat mesylate for TMPRSS2 is unclear.

Second, iCAT displayed 100% accuracy classifying na?ve and monkeypox vaccinated mice. Finally, we demonstrate the use of iCAT on human samples before and after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Evidence points to a bidirectional relationship, in that circadian disruption increases disease severity and many diseases can disrupt circadian rhythms. Importantly, circadian disruption can increase the risk for the expression and development of neurologic, psychiatric, cardiometabolic, and immune disorders. Thus, harnessing the rich findings from preclinical and translational research in circadian biology to enhance health via circadian-based approaches represents a unique opportunity for personalized/precision medicine and overall societal well-being. In this Review, we discuss the implications of circadian disruption for human health using a bench-to-bedside approach. Evidence from preclinical and translational science is applied to a clinical and population-based approach. Given the broad implications of circadian regulation for human health, this Review focuses its discussion on selected examples in neurologic, psychiatric, metabolic, cardiovascular, allergic, and immunologic disorders that highlight the interrelatedness between circadian disruption and human disease and the potential of circadian-based interventions, such as bright light therapy and exogenous melatonin, as well as chronotherapy to improve and/or modify disease outcomes.","output":"Circadian disruption and human health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental health professionals across the globe foresaw the mental health impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Despite our collective reliance on this group (particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic), quality of life for caregivers is often poor and there is an urgent need for disruptive innovations. The aim of this study was to explore what a future roadmap for innovation could look like through a multi-stakeholder consultation and evaluation. An online survey was developed and distributed through convenience sampling, targeting both the informal caregiver and professionals/innovators interested in the caregiver demographic. Data were analysed using both quantitative (summary statistics) and qualitative (inductive thematic analysis) methods in order to develop recommendations for future multi-stakeholder collaboration and meaningful innovation. The survey collected 174 responses from 112 informal caregivers and 62 professionals/innovators. Responses across these stakeholder groups identified that there is currently a missed opportunity to harness the value of the voice of the caregiver demographic. Although time and accessibility issues are considerable barriers to engagement with this stakeholder group, respondents were clear that regular contributions, ideally no more than 20 to 30 min a month could provide a realistic route for input, particularly through online approaches supported by community-based events. In conclusion, the landscape of digital health and wellness is becoming ever more sophisticated, where both industrial and academic innovators could establish new routes to identify, reach, inform, signpost, intervene and support vital and vulnerable groups such as the caregiver demographic. Here, the findings from a consultation with caregivers and professionals interested in informal caring are presented to help design the first stages of a roadmap through identifying priorities and actions that could help accelerate future research and policy that will lead to meaningful and innovative solutions.","output":"Building a Research Roadmap for Caregiver Innovation: Findings from a Multi-Stakeholder Consultation and Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a pandemic in which aerosol and droplet transmission is possible, such as the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, the demand for face masks that meet medical or workplace standards can prevent most individuals from obtaining suitable protection Cloth masks are widely believed to impede droplet and aerosol transmission, but most are constructed from materials with unknown filtration efficiency, airflow resistance and water resistance Here we provide data on a range of common fabrics that might be used to construct masks, complimenting existing studies by largely considering particles in the micron range (a plausible challenge size for human generated aerosols) None of the materials were suitable for N95 masks, but many could provide useful filtration (&gt;90%) of 3 micron particles, with low pressure drop These were: nonwoven sterile wraps, dried baby wipes and some double-knit cotton materials Decontamination of N95 masks using isopropyl alcohol produces the expected increase in particle penetration, but for 3 micron particles, filtration efficiency is still well above 95% Tightly woven thin fabrics, despite having the visual appearance of a good particle barrier, had remarkably low filtration efficiency and high pressure drop The better material structures expose individual fibers to the flow while the poor materials may have small fundamental fibers but these are in tightly bundled yarns Despite the complexity of the design of a very good mask, it is clear that for the larger aerosol particles, any mask will provide substantial protection to the wearer and those around them Copyright ? 2020 American Association for Aerosol Research","output":"Properties of materials considered for improvised masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak that unfolded across Europe in 2020, the World Health Organisation called for repurposing existing influenza surveillance systems to monitor COVID-19. This analysis aimed to compare descriptively the extent to which influenza surveillance systems were adapted and enhanced, and how COVID-19 surveillance could ultimately benefit or disrupt routine influenza surveillance. Methods: We used a previously developed framework in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom to describe COVID-19 surveillance and its impact on influenza surveillance. The framework divides surveillance systems into 7 sub-systems and 20 comparable outcomes of interest, and uses 5 evaluation criteria based on WHO guidance. Information on influenza and COVID-19 surveillance systems were collected from publicly available resources shared by European and national public health agencies. Results: Overall, non-medically attended, virological, primary care and mortality surveillance were adapted in most countries to monitor COVID-19, whilst community, outbreak, and hospital surveillance were reinforced in all countries. Data granularity improved, with more detailed demographic and medical information recorded. A shift to systematic notification for cases and deaths enhanced both geographic and population representativeness whilst the sampling strategy benefited from the roll out of widespread molecular testing. Data communication was greatly enhanced, contributing to improved public awareness. Conclusions: Well-established influenza surveillance systems are a key component of pandemic preparedness and their upgrade allowed European countries to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, uncertainties remain on how both influenza and COVID-19 surveillance can be jointly and durably implemented.","output":"A comparison of coronavirus disease 2019 and seasonal influenza surveillance in five European countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity and its determinants have been the topic of broad research.

While the majority of patients are asymptomatic or have mild disease [3], approximately 14% develop more severe disease including hypoxemic respiratory failure and/or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) [3]. Prone positioning is a life-saving intervention for mechanically ventilated patients with moderate-severe ARDS [4]. Based on this, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend these patients be considered for a trial of prone positioning [5]. Recently the use of prone positioning in awake non-intubated COVID-19 patients has been recommended by several notable organizations with the goal of preventing intubation and potentially improving patient-oriented outcomes [6, 7]. In contrast to prone positioning for intubated mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS, there have been no randomized control trials examining the role of awake prone positioning for non-intubated patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. To further explore this question we used rapid review methodology (Tricco et al., 2015 [8]) to quickly identify and synthesize studies examining the effect of awake prone positioning on patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure (including those with ARDS and/or COVID-19). METHODS: We have elected to use rapid review methodology rather than systematic review methodology primarily due to the speed and efficiency through which we are able to conduct this review, as previously described [8]. In the absence of an EQUATOR guidance document, we used PRISMA guidelines where applicable [9]. Studies were included if they met the following criteria 1) population C non-intubated patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, 2) intervention C prone positioning, 3) comparator C usual management, 4) outcomes C intubation, survival, change in respiratory parameters, adverse events, 5) setting C hospitalized patients 6) study design C observational or randomized control trial. Studies were not limited to ARDS or COVID-19 patients. The search strategy was developed by a critical care physician (KP), a critical care epidemiologist (KF) and a medical librarian (NL) (See search details in Online Supplement). Briefly, the search strategy involved combinations of keywords and subject headings relating to the concepts of, 1) SARS-Cov-2 or COVID-19 or coronavirus, 2) awake prone positioning, and 3) hypoxemic respiratory failure, including but not limited to ARDS and other potentially relevant conditions.

Nowadays, it has been clearly demonstrated that Apo D expression is induced and its subcellular location undergoes modifications in stressful and pathological conditions that characterize aging processes and neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of the present work was to study in detail the effect of H2O2 on the subcellular location of Apo D, in the hippocampal cell line HT22, by structural, ultrastructural, immunocytochemical, and molecular techniques in order to characterize the Apo D distribution pattern in neurons during oxidative stress. Our results indicate that Apo D is located in the cytoplasm under physiological conditions but treatment with H2O2 induces apoptosis and causes a displacement of Apo D location to the nucleus, coinciding with DNA fragmentation. In addition, we demonstrated that Apo D tends to accumulate around the nuclear envelope in neurons and glial cells of different brain areas in some neurodegenerative diseases and during human aging, but never inside the nucleus. These data suggest that the presence of Apo D in the nucleus, which some authors related with a specific transport, is a consequence of structural and functional alterations during oxidative stress and not the result of a specific role in the regulation of nuclear processes.","output":"Apolipoprotein D subcellular distribution pattern in neuronal cells during oxidative stress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about the genetic diversity and pathogenicity of trypanosomes in Australian bats.

The study the effect of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) on cardiac reverse remodelling and contractile status in HFrEF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Symptomatic HFrEF patients with iron deficiency and a persistently reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF <45%) at least 6 months after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implant were prospectively randomized to FCM or standard of care (SOC) in a double-blind manner. The primary endpoint was the change in LVEF from baseline to 3-month follow-up assessed by three-dimensional echocardiography. Secondary endpoints included the change in left ventricular end-systolic (LVESV) and end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Cardiac performance was evaluated by the forceCfrequency relationship as assessed by the slope change of the cardiac contractility index (CCI = systolic blood pressure/LVESV index) at 70, 90, and 110 beats of biventricular pacing. A total of 75 patients were randomized to FCM (n = 37) or SOC (n = 38). At baseline, both treatment groups were well matched including baseline LVEF (34  7 vs. 33  8, P = 0.411). After 3 months, the change in LVEF was significantly higher in the FMC group [+4.22%, 95% confidence interval (CI) +3.05%; +5.38%] than in the SOC group (?0.23%, 95% CI ?1.44%; +0.97%; P < 0.001). Similarly, LVESV (?9.72 mL, 95% CI ?13.5 mL; ?5.93 mL vs. ?1.83 mL, 95% CI ?5.7 mL; 2.1 mL; P = 0.001), but not LVEDV (P = 0.748), improved in the FCM vs. the SOC group. At baseline, both treatment groups demonstrated a negative forceCfrequency relationship, as defined by a decrease in CCI at higher heart rates (negative slope). FCM resulted in an improvement in the CCI slope during incremental biventricular pacing, with a positive forceCfrequency relationship at 3 months. Functional status and exercise capacity, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and peak oxygen consumption, were improved by FCM.

INTERVENTION: A program package called cchsflow was developed to transform and harmonize CCHS variables to consistent formats across multiple survey cycles. An open science approach was used to maintain transparency, reproducibility and collaboration. OUTCOMES: The cchsflow R package uses CCHS survey data between 2001 and 2014. Worksheets were created that identify variables, their names in previous cycles, their category structure, and their final variable names. These worksheets were then used to recode variables in each CCHS cycle into consistently named and labelled variables. Following, survey cycles can be combined. The package was then added as a GitHub repository to encourage collaboration with other researchers. IMPLICATION: The cchsflow package has been added to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and contains support for over 160 CCHS variables, generating a combined data set of over 1 million respondents.

These behaviours can be problematic for owners but are also welfare concerns for the dogs because they mean the dog is in a negative emotional state. Many dog owners have been able to spend more time at home with their pets during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there have been concerns this will increase risks of SRB when dogs are left alone for longer again. Here, we surveyed a group of dog owners in the United Kingdom (UK) twice during 2020. In the first survey, we asked owners about their dogs behaviour before the pandemic, in February 2020, and at the time of the first lockdown; we then surveyed them again in October 2020 when restrictions had eased. Whether dogs showed SRBs or not changed considerably over the months of the study, and whilst one in two dogs with pre-existing SRBs were no longer showing them in October 2020, one in ten dogs who had previously not shown SRBs before the pandemic were found to have developed SRBs in October. Risk of developing SRBs was found to be linked to the change in time left alone during the lockdown, with dogs whose time alone reduced the most being most at risk of developing new SRBs in October. ABSTRACT: Separation-related behaviours (SRBs), including but not limited to vocalisation, pacing, destruction and toileting, occur in the absence of human company. As well as being problematic for the dogs owners, such behaviours indicate that the dogs emotional state is compromised. As part of the COVID-19 pandemic, time spent alone decreased considerably for many pet dogs, leading to concerns about the development of SRBs when dogs are left alone more again. The main aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that dogs whose time left alone decreased most (compared to a February 2020 pre-COVID baseline) would be at greatest risk of developing new signs of SRB when time left alone increased again. To achieve this aim, we utilised survey data gathered from dog owners between 4th May and 3rd July 2020, during the first COVID-19 lockdown period in the United Kingdom (UK), and a follow-up survey of the same dog-owner cohort, completed when restrictions had eased between 10th October and 2nd November 2020. Individual dogs fluctuated considerably in whether they showed signs of SRB or not across the study period (n = 1807). Overall, the prevalence of SRB in the population decreased from 22.1% to 17.2%, as did the time dogs were left alone for between February and October 2020. However, 9.9% of dogs had developed new signs of SRB by the follow-up survey in October 2020, with dogs whose leaving hours decreased most during lockdown restrictions being at increased risk of developing SRBs. These findings have implications for our understanding of the etiology of SRB, by showing a link between changes in owner routine and SRB risk.","output":"Impact of Changes in Time Left Alone on Separation-Related Behaviour in UK Pet Dogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous ?3-herpesvirus with latent and lytic cycles. EBV replicates in the stratified epithelium but the nasopharynx is also composed of pseudostratified epithelium with distinct cell types. Latent infection is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we show with nasopharyngeal conditionally reprogrammed cells cultured at the air-liquid interface that pseudostratified epithelial cells are susceptible to EBV infection. Donors varied in susceptibility to de novo EBV infection, but susceptible cultures also displayed differences with respect to pathogenesis. The cultures from one donor yielded lytic infection but cells from two other donors were positive for EBV-encoded EBERs and negative for other lytic infection markers. All cultures stained positive for the pseudostratified markers CK7, MUC5AC, &#945;-tubulin in cilia, and the EBV epithelial cell receptor Ephrin receptor A2. To define EBV transcriptional programs by cell type and to elucidate latent/lytic infection-differential changes, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on one EBV-infected culture that resulted in alignment with many EBV transcripts. EBV transcripts represented a small portion of the total transcriptome (~0.17%). All cell types in the pseudostratified epithelium had detectable EBV transcripts with suprabasal cells showing the highest number of reads aligning to many EBV genes. Several restriction factors (IRF1, MX1, STAT1, C18orf25) known to limit lytic infection were expressed at lower levels in the lytic subcluster. A third of the differentially-expressed genes in NPC tumors compared to an uninfected pseudostratified ALI culture overlapped with the differentially-expressed genes in the latent subcluster. A third of these commonly perturbed genes were specific to EBV infection and changed in the same direction. Collectively, these findings suggest that the pseudostratified epithelium could harbor EBV infection and that the pseudostratified infection model mirrors many of the transcriptional changes imposed by EBV infection in NPC.","output":"A primary nasopharyngeal three-dimensional air-liquid interface cell culture model of the pseudostratified epithelium reveals differential donor- and cell type-specific susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION In Mexico, there is a syndemic in pregnant women, where the epidemic of obesity and chronic diseases coexists with that of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been associated with a higher risk of maternal mortality.

RESULTS A total of 29,416 pregnant women were evaluated, out of which 39% were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); the risk of maternal mortality was 3.24 times higher (p < 0.01) for positive in comparison with negative women. COVID-19 is the leading cause of maternal death since July 2020 and explains more than 50% of total deaths in 2021. Chronic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR]: 4.11; p < 0.01) and diabetes (OR: 2.53; p < 0.01) were the two main comorbidities that were positively associated with maternal death from COVID-19. CONCLUSION Comorbidities during pregnancy that are possibly associated with an increase in the inflammatory response and an alteration of the immune response increase the risk of maternal death from COVID-19 in Mexican pregnant women.","output":"Comorbidities associated with maternal mortality from COVID-19 in Mexico."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is more prevalent in rural than urban areas in China, and delineating TB transmission patterns in rural populations could improve TB control. Methods We conducted a prospective population-based study of culture-positive pulmonary TB patients diagnosed between July 1, 2009 and December 31, 2020 in two rural counties in China. Genomic clusters were defined with a threshold distance of 12-single-nucleotide-polymorphisms, based on whole-genome sequencing. Risk factors for clustering were identified by logistic regression. Transmission links were sought through epidemiological investigation of genomic-clustered patients. Findings Of 1517 and 751 culture-positive pulmonary TB patients in Wusheng and Wuchang counties, respectively, 1289 and 699 strains were sequenced. Overall, 624 (31.4%, 624/1988) patients were grouped into 225 genomic clusters. Epidemiological links were confirmed in 41.8% (196/469) of clustered isolates, including family (32.7%, 64/196) and social contacts (67.3%, 132/196). Social contacts were generally within the relatives, the community or in shared aggregated settings outside the community, but the proportion of clustered contacts in each category differed between the two sites. The time interval between diagnosis of student cases and contacts was significantly shorter than family and community contacts, probably due to enhanced student contact screening. Transmission of multidrug-resistant strains was likely responsible for 81.4% (83/102) of MDR-TB cases, with minimal acquisition of additional resistance mutations. Interpretation A large proportion of TB transmission in rural China occurred among social contacts, suggesting that active screening and aggressive contact tracing could benefit TB control, but contact screening should be tailored to local patterns of social interactions.

It was hypothesized that there may be a cumulative effect of stress, with parents expressing lower well-being during the pandemic due to the accumulation of stress related to their childs illness and the pandemic. In total, 310 parents participated in the study. Following propensity score matching, 111 pairs were established.

METHODS Epidemiological investigations, patients' measles serology, and phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (H) and nucleoprotein (N) genes of measles virus isolates were conducted. RESULTS In total, 29 HKIA staff of diverse ranks and working locations were infected with measles within 1 month. Significantly fewer affected staff had history of travel than non-HKIA-related measles patients [10 of 29 (34.5%) vs 28 of 35 (80%); P < .01]. Of 9 airport staff who could recall detailed exposure history, 6 (66.7%) had visited self-service food premises at HKIA during the incubation period, where food trays, as observed during the epidemiological field investigation, were not washed after use. Furthermore, 1 airport baggage handler who was admitted to hospital A before rash onset infected 2 healthcare workers (HCWs) known to have 2 doses of MMR vaccination with positive measles IgG and lower viral loads in respiratory specimens. Infections in these 2 HCWs warranted contact tracing of another 168 persons (97 patients and 71 HCWs). Phylogenetic comparison of H and N gene sequences confirmed the clonality of outbreak strains. CONCLUSION Despite good herd immunity with overall seroprevalence of >95% against measles, major outbreaks of measles occurred among HKIA staff having daily contact with many international pssengers. Lessons from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and measles outbreaks suggested that an airport can be a strategic epidemic center.

To assess whether a tick bite puts someone at risk for LD, adequate tick identification skills are needed. We surveyed residents of a high LD-incidence state, Wisconsin, on their ability to distinguish ticks from insects and to identify the specimens that could transmit the LD causative agent. Surveys were conducted using resin blocks with four insects and four tick specimens embedded. About half of the participants (64 of 130) recognized all of the ticks, and 60% of those individuals chose only ticks and no insects. Younger participants (18- to 44-yr old) were more likely to identify ticks correctly compared with those 45 yr and older. Participants who agreed strongly with the statement 'I know a lot about ticks\` were also likelier to correctly identify ticks. When asked to identify which specimens could transmit LD, less than 25% of participants chose both the Ixodes scapularis Say adult female and nymph and about half of those (15% of participants) picked only those two and no other specimens. Although the relatively small convenience sample was biased toward younger participants who consider themselves 'outdoorsy', results showed that further assessments of tick recognition skills are needed to understand what determines whether people can recognize medically important ticks and to evaluate the potential benefits of enhanced education. In addition to the value of the resin blocks as research tools, the blocks may be useful as training tools to improve tick check efficacy.","output":"Assessing Recognition of the Vector of Lyme Disease Using Resin-Embedded Specimens in a Lyme Endemic Area."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unprecedented number of hospitalizations in general wards and intensive care units (ICU). Severe and critical COVID-19 patients suffer from extensive pneumonia; therefore, long-term respiratory sequelae may be expected. RESEARCH QUESTION: We conducted a cohort study to determine respiratory sequelae in patients with severe and critical COVID-19. We aimed at evaluating the proportion of patients with persisting respiratory symptoms and/or abnormalities in pulmonary function tests (PFT) or in lung imaging. STUDY DESIGN: and methods: This is a single center cohort study including COVID-19 survivors who underwent a three-month follow-up with clinical evaluation, PFT and lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). All clinical, functional, and radiological data were centrally reviewed. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with residual lesions on HRCT. RESULTS: Full clinical evaluation, PFT and lung HRCT were available for central review in 126, 122 and 107 patients, respectively. At follow-up, 25% of patients complained from dyspnea and 35% from fatigue, lung diffusion capacity (DLCO) was decreased in 45%, 17% had HRCT abnormalities affecting more than 5% of their lung parenchyma while signs of fibrosis were found in 21%. In multiple linear regression model, number of days in ICU were related to the extent of persisting lesions on HRCT, while intubation was associated with signs of fibrosis at follow-up (P = 0.0005, Fisher's exact test). In contrast, the severity of lung imaging or PFT changes were not predictive of fatigue and dyspnea. INTERPRETATION: Although most hospitalized COVID-19 patients recover, a substantial proportion complains from persisting dyspnea and fatigue.

OBJECTIVE: Directly compare outcomes among resident, APC, and solo hospitalist inpatient general medicine teams. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using multivariable analysis adjusted for time of admission, interhospital transfer, and comorbidities that compares clinical outcomes, cost, and resource utilization. SUBJECTS: Patients 18 years or older discharged from an inpatient medicine service between July 2015 and July 2018 (N = 12,716). MAIN MEASURES: Length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission, inpatient mortality, normalized total direct cost, discharge time, and consultation utilization. KEY RESULTS: Resident teams admitted fewer patients at night (32.0%; P < .001) than did APC (49.5%) and hospitalist (48.6%) teams. APCs received nearly 4% more outside transfer patients (P = .015). Hospitalists discharged patients 26 minutes earlier than did residents (mean hours after midnight [95% CI], 14.58 [14.44-14.72] vs 15.02 [14.97-15.08]). Adjusted consult utilization was 15% higher for APCs (adjusted mean consults per admission [95% CI], 1.00 [0.96-1.03]) and 8% higher for residents (0.93 [0.90-0.95]) than it was for hospitalists (0.85 [0.80-0.90]). No differences in LOS, readmission, mortality, or cost were observed between the teams. CONCLUSION: We observed similar costs, LOS, 30-day readmission, and mortality among hospitalist, APC, and resident teams.

It affects multiple organ systems - particularly cardiac, gastrointestinal, dermatologic and neurologic. Clinicians may have difficulty diagnosing MIS-C due to its novelty and similarity to Kawasaki disease. Our goal was to use machine learning to predict whether children would have MIS-C based on symptoms and laboratory values. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients admitted to Loma Linda University Childrens Hospital who were suspected of having MIS-C. Demographic, symptom (such as fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, shock, etc), and laboratory data were collected from the electronic medical record. For the 115 patients and 20 laboratory values, there was a total of 130 missing values (5.7%). Missing laboratory values were imputed using the median value based on the presence or absence of MIS-C. The data were split into a training (93 patients, 80%) and testing (22 patients, 20%) set. The training set was used to train a random forest model and the testing set was used to evaluate model performance. R 4.0.2 was used for modeling with the following packages: tidymodels and randomForest. RESULTS: There were 115 patients of which 49 were females, and 77 were diagnosed with MIS-C. The median age of the patients with MIS-C was 115 months and 79 months for those without MIS-C. In the testing set, all 15 patients with MIS-C were classified correctly but of the 7 without MIS-C, the model predicted 4 of the patients correctly. This gives a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 57%. When changing the seed and testing set, the sensitivity remained 100% but the specificity improved to 86%. The random forest algorithm showed that the most important features were pro-calcitonin, ferritin, pro-BNP, and CRP. CONCLUSION: During the height of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many children were being admitted with suspected MIS-C, but clinicians struggled to confirm the diagnosis. We have found a model predicting which of these patients had MIS-C with high sensitivity. This model is a first step of many toward creating the foundation of personalized medicine for children.

Human landing catches (HLC) are ethically questionable where arboviral transmission occurs. The host decoy trap (HDT) is an exposure-free alternative outdoor sampling device. To determine HDT efficacy for local culicids, and to characterize local mosquito fauna, the trapping efficacy of the HDT was compared to that of HLCs in one peri-urban (Lakkang) and one rural (Pucak) village in Sulawesi, Indonesia. RESULTS: In Lakkang the outdoor HLCs collected significantly more Anopheles per night (n = 22  9) than the HDT (n = 3  1), while the HDT collected a significantly greater nightly average of Culex mosquitoes (n = 110  42), than the outdoor HLC (n = 15.1  6.0). In Pucak, there was no significant difference in Anopheles collected between trap types; however, the HDT collected significantly more Culex mosquitoes than the outdoor HLC nightly average (n = 53  11 vs 14  3). Significantly higher proportions of blood-fed mosquitoes were found in outdoor HLC (n = 15  2%) compared to HDT (n = 2  0%). More blood-fed culicines were collected with outdoor HLC compared to the HDT, while Anopheles blood-fed proportions did not differ. For the HDT, 52.6%, 36.8% and 10.5% of identified blood meals were on cow, human, and dog, respectively. Identified blood meals for outdoor HLCs were 91.9% human, 6.3% cow, and 0.9% each dog and cat. Mosquitoes from Pucak were tested for arboviruses, with one Culex pool and one Armigeres pool positive for flavivirus, and one Anopheles pool positive for alphavirus. CONCLUSIONS: The HDT collected the highest abundance of culicine specimens. Outdoor HLCs collected the highest abundance of Anopheles specimens.

This report examines those from whom adequate acute and convalescent sera were available at the time of the LRI. Two groups were compared: those in whom culture and/or antigen detection yielded an etiologic agent (N = 110); and those who did not (culture negative, N = 124). Seroconversions (> or = 4-fold titer rise) to respiratory syncytial virus; influenza virus types A and B; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3; or adenovirus were found in only 0 to 5% of the culture negative group. No significant differences between groups with regard to frequencies of seroconversion to influenza type C, parainfluenza virus type 4, human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 or cytomegalovirus were detected, which suggests that these agents may not be frequent primary causes of LRIs among otherwise healthy children. Significant differences in seroconversions to Epstein-Barr virus were detected, suggesting that Epstein-Barr virus may contribute to LRI morbidity; however, its exact role remains to be defined.","output":"Acute lower respiratory illnesses during the first three years of life: potential roles for various etiologic agents.

Very recently, it has been demonstrated that their photothermal conversion can be boosted by appending rather long alkyl chains. Despite this behavior being tentatively associated with the population of a nonradiative twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state driven by an intramolecular motion, the precise mechanisms and the role played by the environment, and most notably aggregation, still remain elusive. In this context, we carried out a series of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to achieve a realistic description of the isolated and aggregated systems. Our theoretical models unambiguously evidence that the population of CT states is very unlikely in both cases, whereas the light-triggered heat dissipation can be ascribed to the activation of specific vibrational degrees of freedom related to the relative motion of the peripheral chains. Overall, our results clearly corroborate the active role played by the alkyl substituents in the photothermal conversion through vibrational motion, while breaking from the conventional picture, which invokes the formation of dark TICT states in loosely packed aggregates.","output":"Competition between the Photothermal Effect and Emission in Potential Phototherapy Agents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A previous editorial by the Editor-in-Chief discusses public health and steps towards recovery from the COVID-19 disaster.1 In addition to the current public health disasters, and multiple disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and hurricanes, worldwide recession, and global morbidity and mortality, the authors would like to highlight the need for responses to deal with the well-being of the homeless population due to their condition and vulnerability in the society.

To gain an understanding of the evolution of the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2, we herein analyzed the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we compared the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 with that of other viruses belonging to the subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae. We found that SARS-CoV-2 has a high AU content that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be better adapted to the human host. We also studied the evolutionary pressures that influence the codon usage of five conserved coronavirus genes encoding the viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and natural selection that affect the codon usage of these genes. Moreover, we show here that the two integral membrane proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their corresponding genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins (S), although they are regarded as are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster in comparison to the two genes mentioned above. Overall, our results suggest that the higher divergence observed for the latter three genes could represent a significant barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Codon Usage and Phenotypic Divergences of SARS-CoV-2 Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article offers a look at how several U S musicians are coping wit the coronavirus shutdowns Alex Rainer, a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and composer based in New York City is planning to create another album and he has been writing some new songs Acoustic folk and jazz guitarist Grant Gordy has just launched his latest album \\"Interpreter \\"","output":"The Dangling Days"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its first description in China, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading all over the world causing millions of 31 infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths.

Early guidelines have discouraged the use of high flow nasal oxygen therapy in this setting due to the risk of viral spread to healthcare workers. However, there is the need to balance the relative risks of increased aerosol generation and virus transmission to healthcare workers against the role high flow nasal oxygen has in reducing hypoxaemia when managing the airway in high-risk patients during intubation or sedation procedures. The authors of this article undertook a narrative review to present results from several recent papers. Surrogate outcome studies suggest that the risk of high flow nasal oxygen in dispersing aerosol-sized particles is probably not as great as first perceived. Smoke laser-visualisation experiments and particle counter studies suggest that the generation and dispersion of bio-aerosols via high flow nasal oxygen with flow rates up to 60 l/min is similar to standard oxygen therapies. The risk appears to be similar to oxygen supplementation via a Hudson mask at 15 l/min and significantly less than low flow nasal prong oxygen 1-5 l/min, nasal continuous positive airway pressure with ill-fitting masks, bilevel positive airway pressure, or from a coughing patient. However, given the limited safety data, we recommend a cautious approach. For intubation in the COVID-positive or suspected COVID-positive patient we support the use of high flow nasal oxygen to extend time to desaturation in the at-risk groups, which include the morbidly obese, those with predicted difficult airways and patients with significant hypoxaemia, ensuring well-fitted high flow nasal oxygen prongs with staff wearing full personal protective equipment. For sedation cases, we support the use of high flow nasal oxygen when there is an elevated risk of hypoxaemia (e.g. bariatric endoscopy or prone-positioned procedures), but recommend securing the airway with a cuffed endotracheal tube for the longer duration procedures when theatre staff remain in close proximity to the upper airway, or considering the use of a surgical mask to reduce the risk of exhaled particle dispersion.","output":"Airway management in the adult patient with COVID-19: High flow nasal oxygen or not?

METHODS: Among 15 patients with left-sided breast cancer, partial wide tangential 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) delivered in conventional fractionation (CF) or hypofractionated (HF) schedules; PBT delivered in a CF schedule; and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) delivered in an HF schedule, each under continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and free-breathing (FB) conditions, were examined. Target volume coverage and doses to organs-at-risk (OARs) were calculated for each technique. Outcomes were compared with one-way analysis of variance and the Bonferroni test, with p-values <0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Target volume coverage was within acceptable levels in all interventions, except for the internal mammary lymph node D95 (99% in PBT, 90% in VMAT-CPAP, 84% in VMAT-FB, and 74% in 3DCRT). The mean heart dose (MHD) was the lowest in PBT (<1 Gy) and VMAT-CPAP (2.2 Gy) and the highest in 3DCRT with CF/FB (7.8 Gy), respectively. The mean lung dose (MLD) was the highest in 3DCRT-CF-FB (20 Gy) and the lowest in both VMAT-HF-CPAP and PBT (approximately 5C6 Gy). VMAT-HF-CPAP and PBT delivered a comparable maximum dose to the left ascending artery (7.2 and 6.13 Gy, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Both proton and VMAT in combination with CPAP can minimize the radiation exposure to heart and lung with optimal target coverage in regional RT for left-sided breast cancer.

Objectives: To describe maternal, pregnancy and infant characteristics among neonates born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy by neonatal SARS-CoV-2 testing results. Methods: : Using aggregated data from the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET) from March 29, 2020CAugust 6, 2021, we identified neonates who were: 1) born to women who were SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-PCR at any time during their pregnancy, and 2) tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR during the birth hospitalization. Results: : Among 25,896 neonates of mothers with SARS-CoV-2-infection, 3,381 (13%) underwent PCR testing. One hundred thirty-six neonates (4%) were PCR-positive. Neonates testing positive were born to both symptomatic and asymptomatic women, and 95% were born to women with infection identified  with 14 days of delivery. Conclusions: : While perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection was uncommon among neonates born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, nearly all cases of neonatal infection occurred in pregnant women infected around the time of delivery. These findings underline the need for infection prevention and control measures in delivery and outpatient pediatric settings, as well as counselling for persons who acquire COVID-19 during pregnancy about potential risk to their neonates.

The use of intraoperative lung protective ventilation (LPV) strategies, usually including the use of a low V(t), low PEEP and low plateau pressure, seem to reduce the risk of PPC and are strongly recommended in almost all surgical procedures. Nonetheless, feasibility of LPV strategies in neurosurgical patients are still debated because the use of low Vt during LPV might result in hypercapnia with detrimental effects on cerebrovascular physiology. Aim of our study was to determine whether LPV strategies would be feasible compared with a control group in adult patients undergoing cranial or spinal surgery. METHODS: This single-centre, pilot randomized clinical trial was conducted at the University Hospital Maggiore della Carit (Novara, Italy). Adult patients undergoing major cerebral or spinal neurosurgical interventions with risk index for pulmonary post-operative complications > 2 and not expected to need post-operative intensive care unit (ICU) admission were considered eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to either LPV (Vt = 6 ml/kg of ideal body weight (IBW), respiratory rate initially set at 16 breaths/min, PEEP at 5 cmH2O and application of a recruitment manoeuvre (RM) immediately after intubation and at every disconnection from the ventilator) or control treatment (Vt = 10 ml/kg of IBW, respiratory rate initially set at 6C8 breaths/min, no PEEP and no RM). Primary outcomes of the study were intraoperative adverse events, the level of cerebral tension at dura opening and the intraoperative control of PaCO(2.) Secondary outcomes were the rate of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications, the number of unplanned ICU admissions, ICU and hospital lengths of stay and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients, 30 for each group, were randomized. During brain surgery, the number of episodes of intraoperative hypercapnia and grade of cerebral tension were similar between patients randomized to receive control or LPV strategies. No difference in the rate of intraoperative adverse events was found between groups. The rate of postoperative pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications and major clinical outcomes were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: LPV strategies in patients undergoing major neurosurgical intervention are feasible. Larger clinical trials are needed to assess their role in postoperative clinical outcome improvements.

Overcrowded and under-resourced healthcare centres have had to design different strategies to treat these patients, what includes the control of the electrocardiogram (ECG), as some drugs that have been used to treat these patients may prolong the QT interval as a side effect. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we designed a protocol for monitoring the QT interval using a portable device with Bluetooth connectivity. After a validation study with 50 patients, we found a very good correlation between the QT interval measured both with this device and with the conventional body surface ECG. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the protocol and then analyse the QT changes observed in a group of patients during their hospitalization and treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 81 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in the protocol (age 63.4 SD 17.2 years; 70.3% men), while being treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, both individually or combined. Ten patients developed long drug-related QT interval, and the QT prolongation was statically significant for all treatment schemes, except for lopinavir/ritonavir alone. All patients with drug induced QT prolongation corrected the QT interval following the indications of the protocol, and no patients died of arrhythmic causes after its implementation. In our experience, a protocol for the electrocardiographic monitoring of these patients minimizes the risk of iatrogenic QT interval prolongation and consequently reduces sudden death events, and for that purpose, portable devices like the one used in this protocol may constitute a useful tool to minimize the contact with such patients.","output":"Qt interval measurement with portable device during covid-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid\\\\19 has focused attention on the importance of urban green and blue spaces (such as parks and watercourses) for human wellbeing.

Leptin, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, activates Trp conversion into Kyn. However, leptin association with down-stream Kyn metabolites in MDD is unknown. METHODS: Fasting plasma samples from 29 acutely ill drug-na?ve (n = 16) or currently non-medicated (?6 weeks; n = 13) MDD patients were analyzed for leptin, Trp, Kyn, its down-stream metabolites (anthranilic [AA], kynurenic [KYNA], xanthurenic [XA] acids and 3-hydroxykynurenine [3HK]), C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, body mass index (BMI), and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Depression severity was assessed by HAM-D-21. RESULTS: In female (n = 14) (but not in male) patients HAM-D-21 scores correlated with plasma levels of AA (but not other Kyn metabolites) (rho = ?0.644, P = .009) and leptin (Spearmans rho = ?0.775, P = .001). Inclusion of AA into regression analysis improved leptin prediction of HAM-D from 48.5% to 65.9%.

Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease that struck the entire world leaving millions of people dead and more infected. Although COVID-19 vaccines have been made available, and quite a large number of world populations have already been immunized, the viral infection rates remained in acceleration, which continues to provoke major concern about the vaccines' efficacy. The belief in the ineffectiveness of the vaccine has been attributed in part to the recurrent mutations that occur in the epitope determinant fragments of the virus. Coronavirus envelope surface is extensively glycosylated being covered by more than sixty N-linked oligomannose, composite, and hybrid glycans with a core of Man3GlcNAc2Asn. In addition some OClinked glycans are also detected. Of these glyco-chains, many have also been exposed to several mutations, and a few remained conserved. Therefore, numerous plant lectins with a specificity directed towards these viral envelope sugars have been found to interact preferentially with them and are suggested to be scrutinized as a possible future tool to combat coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through blocking the viral attachment to the host cells.

In order to address this concern, I will argue that such courses should supplement the traditional focus on theoretical reason with an analysis of the practical reasoning employed by scientists in advisory contexts. Later sections of this paper outline a teaching strategy by which this can be achieved that consists of two steps: the first examines idealized examples of scientific advising in order to highlight the irreducible role played by moral reasoning in justifying policy recommendations. The second employs argument analysis to reveal implicit moral assumptions in actual advisory reports that form the basis for class discussion.

Yet, the unstable, restricted, or even risky contexts in which many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and SDP agencies sometimes operate often leave researchers to face important challenges to develop effective or feasible methods to work with such organizations. This study aimed to address the ontological and epistemological questions about what should be known about a given context in an organization before setting off on fieldwork. We propose a methodology, based on an actantial model (AM), as a method to analyze the nature and context of a project, to assess the actors involved in the project, and to establish if the global cost (i.e., material, temporal, financial, and physical) for conducting fieldwork is realistic and feasible of all the parties involved in the potential project. To illustrate this process, we analyzed the nature and context of an SDP project in Madagascar as the first step for potential collaborative research. As researchers, we do not want to invest time and energy to build up a fully developed field research project with an NGO in a context where it would not be realistic or feasible to conduct such research. Actually in this context, developing a research protocol without an implementation strategy might not only be detrimental to the researchers, but also to the NGO itself, where resources are often limited. Accordingly, the results from this preliminary field research demonstrate that an AM is a relevant analytical tool for obtaining insights about the context, the actors, and their relationships within an NGO.

This study was designed to assess the interplay of antibodies with the cytokine response in SARS-CoV-2 patients. We demonstrate that significant levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody to receptor binding domain (RBD), nucleocapsid, and spike S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 develop over the first 10 to 20 days of infection. The majority of patients produced antibodies against all three antigens (219/255 SARS-CoV-2(+) patient specimens, 86%), suggesting a broad response to viral proteins. Antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 antigens were different based on patient mortality, sex, blood type, and age. Analyses of these findings may help explain variation in immunity between these populations. To better understand the systemic immune response, we analyzed the levels of 20 cytokines by SARS-CoV-2 patients throughout infection. Cytokine analysis of SARS-CoV-2(+) patients exhibited increases in proinflammatory markers (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, IL-18, and gamma interferon [IFN-]) and chemotactic markers (IP-10 and eotaxin) relative to healthy individuals. Patients who succumbed to infection produced decreased IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, RANTES, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), GRO-, and MIP-1 relative to patients who survived infection. We also observed that the chemokine CXCL13 was particularly elevated in patients who succumbed to infection. CXCL13 is involved in B cell activation, germinal center development, and antibody maturation, and we observed that CXCL13 levels in blood trended with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Furthermore, patients who succumbed to infection produced high CXCL13 and had a higher ratio of nucleocapsid to RBD antibodies. This study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 immunity implicating the magnitude and specificity of response in relation to patient outcomes. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is continuing to impact the global population, and knowledge of the immune response to COVID-19 is still developing. This study assesses the interplay of different parts of the immune system during COVID-19 disease. We demonstrate that COVID-19 patients produce antibodies to three proteins of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) and identify many other immunological proteins that are involved during infection. The data suggest that one of these proteins (CXCL13) may be a novel biomarker for severe COVID-19 that can be readily measured in blood. This information combined with our broad-scale analysis of immune activity during COVID-19 provides new information on the immunological response throughout the course of disease and identifies a novel potential marker for assessing disease severity.","output":"Interplay of Antibody and Cytokine Production Reveals CXCL13 as a Potential Novel Biomarker of Lethal SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is challenging international public health and healthcare efforts. As hospitals work to acquire enough personal protective equipment and brace for potential cases, the role of infection prevention efforts and programs has become increasingly important. Lessons from the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak in Toronto and 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea have unveiled the critical role that hospitals play in outbreaks, especially of novel coronaviruses. Their ability to amplify the spread of disease can rapidly fuel transmission of the disease and often those failures in infection prevention and general hospital practices contribute to such events. While efforts to enhance infection prevention measures and hospital readiness are underway in the United States, it is important to understand why these programs were not able to maintain continued, sustainable levels of readiness. History has shown that infection prevention programs are primarily responsible for preparing hospitals and responding to biological events but face under-staffing and focused efforts defined by administrators. The current U.S. healthcare system though, is built upon a series of priorities that often view biopreparedness as a costly endeavor. Awareness of these competing priorities and the challenges infection prevention programs face when working to maintain biopreparedness is critical in adequately addressing this critical infrastructure in the face of an international outbreak.","output":"Roadblocks to Infection Prevention Efforts in Healthcare SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than 2.7 million children in the United States are raised in kinship families, with the majority of these caregivers, grandparents.

The classification accuracy reaches ~91% with the ~3-10 kB of RAM used on the Arduino microcontroller. Using the LogNNet network trained on a publicly available database of the Israeli Ministry of Health, a service concept for COVID-19 express testing is provided. A classification accuracy of ~95% is achieved, and ~0.6 kB of RAM is used. In all examples, the model is tested using standard classification quality metrics: precision, recall, and F1-measure.

Chronic inflammation of gingiva and periodontium is believed to be an important etiological factor in the development of FORL. In this context, various feline viruses have been discussed to play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of these lesions. The aim of this project was to determine in a blinded study the incidence of FORL in 10 cats which were infected for several years with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), but were otherwise free of feline viral infections (feline leukemia virus, feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus, feline syncytium-forming virus). Nine age-matched controls were kept under identical conditions, but free of FIV. Subgingival resorptive lesions were found in six of 10 FIV-positive cats, but in three of nine controls only. FIV-positive cats had significantly more often gingivae with an increased tendency for bleeding upon probing than FIV-negative cats (p=0.0055), and they had slightly more often hyperplastic gingivae (p=0.0867). In conclusion, signs characteristic of FORL such as subgingival lesions, granulomatous or hyperplastic gingivae with a tendency for bleeding, were found significantly more often in FIV-positive cats than in the controls (p=0.0198). Therefore, it was concluded that FIV infection is an important factor for the occurrence of FORL, possibly through immune suppression or changes of the (sub)gingival micro-environment. However, non-infected control cats also showed some evidence of FORL in the absence of all tested viral infections.

Rapid diagnosis kits to detect SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. STUDY DESIGN: Three monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein were used to develop an antigen-antibody-based immunochromatographic kit to detect SARS-CoV-2. These assays were evaluated using nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from patients suspected of having COVID-19. RESULTS: These assays detected recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein at concentrations >0.2 ng/ml within 10 minutes after protein loading, but did not detect the N proteins of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 299E (HCoV-229E) and other pathogens causing respiratory infections.

In China, a country stereotyped as a major source of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases, research on the public understanding of animal influenza is limited to the Han, the main ethnic group. The present qualitative study in Southwest China investigated awareness of animal influenza among the Dai, an ethnic minority. The participants (15 men and 10 women, ages 18C83) were smallholder farmers of pigs and poultry in rural areas of Jinghong, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province. A mixture of interviews and group discussions took place in homes and villages. The participants were asked about their knowledge of avian influenza (H7N9), swine influenza (H1N1), precautions taken to protect against influenza, procedures when animals were sick and perceived risk of animal influenza. The data were analysed following coding and thematic analysis. The findings demonstrated a limited understanding of animal health and welfare among participants. Specifically, they were largely unaware of animal influenza (H7N9, H1N1) including its causes, symptoms, prevention and treatment. The farmers were also uninformed of the risks they faced and unknowingly engaged in behaviours which increased direct or indirect exposure to infected animals, a risk factor for human infection. They also reported poor usage of veterinary services.

WHO has recommended that a single low dose of primaquine could be added to artemisinin-based combination therapies to reduce Plasmodium falciparum transmission in areas aiming for elimination of malaria or areas facing artemisinin resistance. We aimed to determine the efficacy of pyronaridineCartesunate and dihydroartemisininCpiperaquine with and without single low-dose primaquine for reducing gametocyte density and transmission to mosquitoes. METHODS: We conducted a four-arm, single-blind, phase 2/3, randomised trial at the Oulessbougou Clinical Research Unit of the Malaria Research and Training Centre of the University of Bamako (Bamako, Mali). Participants were aged 5C50 years, with asymptomatic P falciparum malaria mono-infection and gametocyte carriage on microscopy, haemoglobin density of 95 g/dL or higher, bodyweight less than 80 kg, and no use of antimalarial drugs over the past week. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to one of four treatment groups: pyronaridineCartesunate, pyronaridineCartesunate plus primaquine, dihydroartemisininCpiperaquine, or dihydroartemisininCpiperaquine plus primaquine. Treatment allocation was concealed to all study staff other than the trial pharmacist and treating physician. DihydroartemisininCpiperaquine and pyronaridineCartesunate were administered as per manufacturer guidelines over 3 days; primaquine was administered as a single dose in oral solution according to bodyweight (025 mg/kg; in 1 kg bands). The primary endpoint was percentage reduction in mosquito infection rate (percentage of mosquitoes surviving to dissection that were infected with P falciparum) at 48 h after treatment compared with baseline (before treatment) in all treatment groups. Data were analysed per protocol. This trial is now complete, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04049916. FINDINGS: Between Sept 10 and Nov 19, 2019, 1044 patients were assessed for eligibility and 100 were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups (n=25 per group). Before treatment, 66 (66%) of 100 participants were infectious to mosquitoes, with a median of 158% (IQR 54C319) of mosquitoes becoming infected. In individuals who were infectious before treatment, the median percentage reduction in mosquito infection rate 48 h after treatment was 1000% (IQR 1000 to 1000) for individuals treated with pyronaridineCartesunate plus primaquine (n=18; p<00001) and dihydroartemisininCpiperaquine plus primaquine (n=15; p=00001), compared with ?87% (?548 to 932) with pyronaridineCartesunate (n=17; p=088) and 504% (138 to 709) with dihydroartemisininCpiperaquine (n=16; p=013). There were no serious adverse events, and there were no significant differences between treatment groups at any point in the frequency of any adverse events (Fisher's exact test p=096) or adverse events related to study drugs (p=064). The most common adverse events were headaches (40 events in 32 [32%] of 100 participants), rhinitis (31 events in 30 [30%]), and respiratory infection (20 events in 20 [20%]). INTERPRETATION: These data support the use of single low-dose primaquine as an effective supplement to dihydroartemisininCpiperaquine and pyronaridineCartesunate for blocking P falciparum transmission. The new pyronaridineCartesunate plus single low-dose primaquine combination is of immediate relevance to regions in which the containment of partial artemisinin and partner-drug resistance is a growing concern and in regions aiming to eliminate malaria.

Thromboembolic disease and coagulopathy are common and have been seen in COVID-19 patients. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens had been reported in previous cases associated with malignancy which is a known cause of a procoagulable state. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may also induce a procoagulable state and be associated with PCD. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old man presented with a painful, swollen limb and gangrene, findings consistent with a diagnosis of PCD due to venous thrombosis. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection after a nasopharyngeal swab sample using the XPRSARS-COV2-10 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction kit. He had bilateral leg swelling with a gangrenous left fourth digit in the presence of a palpable peripheral pulse. His venous duplex showed bilateral acute deep venous thrombosis, whereas his arterial Doppler scan was normal and his skin biopsy was negative for vasculitis. One of our screening blood tests was suggestive of an antiphospholipid-like syndrome. These clinical and radiologic findings were consistent with PCD. This patient was promptly anticoagulated; other supportive treatments were also initiated. He had a significant resolution of his pedal swelling with the associated revitalization of his previously gangrenous toe.

Whole-blood-platform tests based on the immune response detection to SARS-CoV2 peptides is a new approach to discriminate COVID-19-patients from uninfected-individuals and to evaluate the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates, monitoring the immune response in vaccine trial and supporting the serological diagnostics results. Here, we aimed to identify in the whole-blood-platform the best immunogenic viral antigen and the best immune biomarker to identify COVID-19-patients. METHODS: Whole-blood was overnight-stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools of nucleoprotein-(NP) Membrane-, ORF3a- and Spike-protein. We evaluated: IL-1?, IL-1Ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL- 15, IL-17A, eotaxin, FGF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-?3, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1&#945;, MIP-1?, PDGF, RANTES, TNF-&#945;, VEGF. By a sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis we identified the most important soluble factors discriminating COVID-19- from NO-COVID-19-individuals. RESULTS: We identified a COVID-19 signature based on six immune factors: IFN-?3, IP-10 and IL-2 induced by Spike; RANTES and IP-10 induced by NP and IL-2 induced by ORF3a. We demonstrated that the test based on IP-10 induced by Spike had the highest AUC (0.85, p < 0.0001) and that the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19-patients did not affect IP-10 production. Finally, we validated the use of IP-10 as biomarker for SARS-CoV2 infection in two additional COVID-19-patients cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: We set-up a whole-blood assay identifying the best antigen to induce a T-cell response and the best biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infection evaluating patients with acute COVID-19 and recovered patients. We focused on IP-10, already described as a potential biomarker for other infectious disease such as tuberculosis and HCV.

METHODS We examined data collected over 4 years from consecutive patients referred to a tertiary care bariatric center for upper endoscopy after RYGB. We used linear regression analysis to determine the association between the gastrojejunal stoma diameter and weight regain. We applied a logistic regression model using clinical and endoscopic parameters to develop a prediction rule for weight gain after RYGB. RESULTS Among 165 patients included in our study, 59% had significant weight regain ( 20% of maximum weight lost after the RYGB) and 41% did not. The mean percentage of maximal weight lost after RYGB that was regained in the entire cohort was 30%  22%. Gastrojejunal stoma diameter was associated significantly with weight regain after RYGB surgery in univariate analysis ( = .31, P < .0001).

In Brazil, the process of development and updating of the clinical guidelines for the Brazilian Unified Health System (Sistema nico de Sade, SUS) is already well systematized by the Ministry of Health. However, the implementation process of those guidelines has not yet been discussed and well structured. Therefore, the first step of this project and the primary objective of this study was to summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of strategies used to promote clinical practice guideline implementation and dissemination. METHODS This overview used systematic review methodology to locate and evaluate published systematic reviews regarding strategies for clinical practice guideline implementation and adhered to the PRISMA guidelines for systematic review (PRISMA). RESULTS This overview identified 36 systematic reviews regarding 30 strategies targeting healthcare organizations, healthcare providers and patients to promote guideline implementation. The most reported interventions were educational materials, educational meetings, reminders, academic detailing and audit and feedback. Care pathways-single intervention, educational meeting-single intervention, organizational culture, and audit and feedback-both strategies implemented in combination with others-were strategies categorized as generally effective from the systematic reviews. In the meta-analyses, when used alone, organizational culture, educational intervention and reminders proved to be effective in promoting physicians' adherence to the guidelines. When used in conjunction with other strategies, organizational culture also proved to be effective. For patient-related outcomes, education intervention showed effective results for disease target results at a short and long term. CONCLUSION This overview provides a broad summary of the best evidence on guideline implementation. Even if the included literature highlights the various limitations related to the lack of standardization, the methodological quality of the studies, and especially the lack of conclusion about the superiority of one strategy over another, the summary of the results provided by this study provides information on strategies that have been most widely studied in the last few years and their effectiveness in the context in which they were applied. Therefore, this panorama can support strategy decision-making adequate for SUS and other health systems, seeking to positively impact on the appropriate use of guidelines, healthcare outcomes and the sustainability of the SUS.","output":"Strategies for the implementation of clinical practice guidelines in public health: an overview of systematic reviews."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We evaluated our SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike recombinant protein vaccine (CoV2 preS dTM) with different adjuvants, unadjuvanted, and in a one-injection and two-injection dosing schedule in a previous phase 1C2 study. Based on interim results from that study, we selected a two-injection schedule and the AS03 adjuvant for further clinical development. However, lower than expected antibody responses, particularly in older adults, and higher than expected reactogenicity after the second vaccination were observed. In the current study, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of an optimised formulation of CoV2 preS dTM adjuvanted with AS03 to inform progression to phase 3 clinical trial. METHODS: This phase 2, randomised, parallel-group, dose-ranging study was done in adults (18 years old), including those with pre-existing medical conditions, those who were immunocompromised (except those with recent organ transplant or chemotherapy) and those with a potentially increased risk for severe COVID-19, at 20 clinical research centres in the USA and Honduras. Women who were pregnant or lactating or, for those of childbearing potential, not using an effective method of contraception or abstinence, and those who had received a COVID-19 vaccine, were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using an interactive response technology system, with stratification by age (18C59 years and 60 years), rapid serodiagnostic test result (positive or negative), and high-risk medical conditions (yes or no), to receive two injections (day 1 and day 22) of 5 7mu;g (low dose), 10 7mu;g (medium dose), or 15 7mu;g (high dose) CoV2 preS dTM antigen with fixed AS03 content. All participants and outcome assessors were masked to group assignment; unmasked study staff involved in vaccine preparation were not involved in safety outcome assessments. All laboratory staff performing the assays were masked to treatment. The primary safety objective was to describe the safety profile in all participants, for each candidate vaccine formulation. Safety endpoints were evaluated for all randomised participants who received at least one dose of the study vaccine (safety analysis set), and are presented here for the interim study period (up to day 43). The primary immunogenicity objective was to describe the neutralising antibody titres to the D614G variant 14 days after the second vaccination (day 36) in participants who were SARS-CoV-2 naive who received both injections, provided samples at day 1 and day 36, did not have protocol deviations, and did not receive an authorised COVID-19 vaccine before day 36. Neutralising antibodies were measured using a pseudovirus neutralisation assay and are presented here up to 14 days after the second dose. As a secondary immunogenicity objective, we assessed neutralising antibodies in non-naive participants. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04762680) and is closed to new participants for the cohort reported here. FINDINGS: Of 722 participants enrolled and randomly assigned between Feb 24, 2021, and March 8, 2021, 721 received at least one injection (low dose=240, medium dose=239, and high dose=242). The proportion of participants reporting at least one solicited adverse reaction (injection site or systemic) in the first 7 days after any vaccination was similar between treatment groups (217 [91%] of 238 in the low-dose group, 213 [90%] of 237 in the medium-dose group, and 218 [91%] of 239 in the high-dose group); these adverse reactions were transient, were mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and occurred at a higher frequency and intensity after the second vaccination. Four participants reported immediate unsolicited adverse events; two (one each in the low-dose group and medium-dose group) were considered by the investigators to be vaccine related and two (one each in the low-dose and high-dose groups) were considered unrelated. Five participants reported seven vaccine-related medically attended adverse events (two in the low-dose group, one in the medium-dose group, and four in the high-dose group). No vaccine-related serious adverse events and no adverse events of special interest were reported. Among participants naive to SARS-CoV-2 at day 36, 158 (98%) of 162 in the low-dose group, 166 (99%) of 168 in the medium-dose group, and 163 (98%) of 166 in the high-dose group had at least a two-fold increase in neutralising antibody titres to the D614G variant from baseline. Neutralising antibody geometric mean titres (GMTs) at day 36 for participants who were naive were 2189 (95% CI 1744C2746) for the low-dose group, 2269 (1792C2873) for the medium-dose group, and 2895 (2294C3654) for the high-dose group. GMT ratios (day 36: day 1) were 107 (95% CI 85C135) in the low-dose group, 110 (87C140) in the medium-dose group, and 141 (111C179) in the high-dose group. Neutralising antibody titres in non-naive adults 21 days after one injection tended to be higher than titres after two injections in adults who were naive, with GMTs 21 days after one injection for participants who were non-naive being 3143 (95% CI 836C11 815) in the low-dose group, 2338 (593C9226) in the medium-dose group, and 7069 (1361C36 725) in the high-dose group. INTERPRETATION: Two injections of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 showed acceptable safety and reactogenicity, and robust immunogenicity in adults who were SARS-CoV-2 naive and non-naive. These results supported progression to phase 3 evaluation of the 10 7mu;g antigen dose for primary vaccination and a 5 7mu;g antigen dose for booster vaccination.

Overdose results in severe hypotension and is the fourth most common cause of toxicity-related deaths in the United States. Management is mostly supportive, with currently no standard role for targeted drug removal. The protein-bound nature of these medications presents the option of utilizing albumin dialysis for their removal and for the reversal of associated shock. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We present two cases of life-threatening intentional amlodipine overdoses successfully treated with albumin dialysis. Both patients experienced profound distributive shock in the setting of preserved cardiac contractility that was refractory to maximal vasoactive agent support. INTERVENTIONS AND RESULTS: After initiation of albumin dialysis, the patients showed rapid hemodynamic improvement and were able to be weaned off vasopressor support. CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate the safety and efficacy of albumin dialysis in the management of near-fatal calcium channel blocker overdoses related to amlodipine and offer an additional therapeutic option apart from conventional supportive care. Importantly, these cases were not associated with impaired cardiac contractility, thereby making venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation a less preferable option.

The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of timing of remdesivir initiation (symptom-onset to remdesivir treatment [SORT] interval) on in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted between June 25, 2020 and October 3, 2020, at a tertiary care dedicated COVID center in India. Consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (moderate: SpO2 <94%; severe: SpO2 <90%) were included. Data were collected from the health records of the hospital. Remdesivir was administered along with other standard medications as per protocol. The main outcome was the impact of SORT interval on in-hospital all-cause mortality. Subgroups were formed based on SORT interval. Other measures analyzed included overall in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and safety. Results: Of 350 patients treated with remdesivir, 346 were included for the final analysis (males: 270 [78.0%]; median [range] age: 60 [24-94] years). Overall, 243 (70.2%) patients had []1 comorbidity; 109 (31.5%) patients had moderate disease, 237 (68.5%) had severe disease, and 50 (14.5%) patients required mechanical ventilation.

The objective of this study was to assess complete disintegration time of three different doses of sublingual fentanyl tablets in opioid-tolerant patients. METHODS This was a single-center, non-randomized, open-label study. Opioid-tolerant adult patients (N = 30) with chronic pain were assigned to one of three dose groups and self-administered a single 100, 200, or 300 g sublingual fentanyl tablet (Abstral(?), Galena Biopharma, Portland, OR, USA). Time to complete disintegration was measured by each patient with a stopwatch and independently verified by study personnel.

Gone were Monday through Friday routines of school day, extracurricular activities, and evening homework; schools scrambled to launch alternative delivery systems, expecting parents to step in and spend significant amounts of time helping children continue to learn. This study examines the sudden shift to distance learning using data from U.S. Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey. Conducted weekly from April through July 2020, the survey tracked COVID-related shocks to employment, health, food and housing security, and education in the U.S. population. We use Pulse data on 200,000 households with K-12 children to examine how school systems shifted, how parents stepped up and spent time helping children learn, how parental time inputs varied with parent education, and how education changes intersected with other pandemic shocks, including job loss and food insecurity. We find that parents and children spent significantly more time in learning activities when their schools provided diversified educational inputs, especially live contact time with teachers; live contact hours also facilitated children learning on their own. Given the type of alternative schooling, less educated parents spent no less time helping children than better educated parents, although they faced significantly more problems with computer and internet access. Thus, parents generally tried to help children continue learning in the pandemic, albeit with potentially wide variation in the resources they could supply to mitigate the drop in learning.","output":"Covid-19 shocks to education supply: how 200,000 U.S. households dealt with the sudden shift to distance learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: During public health emergencies, people often scramble to buy scarce goods, which may lead to panic behavior and cause serious negative impacts on public health management. Due to the absence of relevant research, the internal logic of this phenomenon is not clear. This study explored whether and why public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic stimulate consumers' preference for scarce products. Methods: Applying the questionnaire survey method, two online surveys were conducted on the Credamo data platform in China. The first survey was launched in February and collected psychological and behavioral data from 1,548 participants. Considering the likelihood of population relocation due to the pandemic, a follow-up survey was conducted in August with 463 participants who had participated in the first survey and had not relocated to other cities between February and August. The hypotheses were tested with these data through stepwise regression analysis, bootstrapping, and robustness testing. Results: Pandemic severity was found to positively affect scarce consumption behavior and the effect was found to be situational; this indicates that the impact of the pandemic on scarce consumption was only significant during the pandemic. Further, it was found that materialism plays a mediating role in the relationship between pandemic severity and scarce consumption. Finally, the need to belong was found to play a moderating role between pandemic severity and materialism. Conclusion: This study findings imply that the scarce consumption behavior during public health emergencies can be reduced by decreasing materialism and increasing the need to belong. These findings may aid government leaders in managing public health emergencies.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 and Public Health Emergencies on Consumer Purchase of Scarce Products in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacterial foraging optimization has drawn great attention and has been applied widely in various fields. However, BFO performs poorly in convergence when coping with more complex optimization problems, especially multimodal and high dimensional tasks. Aiming to address these issues, we therefore seek to propose a hybrid strategy to improve the BFO algorithm in each stage of the bacterias foraging behavior. Firstly, a non-linear descending strategy of step size is adopted in the process of flipping, where a larger step size is given to the particle at the very beginning of the iteration, promoting the rapid convergence of the algorithm while later on a smaller step size is given, helping enhance the particles global search ability. Secondly, an adaptive adjustment strategy of particle aggregation is introduced when calculating step size of the bacterias swimming behavior. In this way, the particles will adjust the step size according to the degree of crowding to achieve efficient swimming. Thirdly, a roulette strategy is applied to enable the excellent particles to enjoy higher replication probability in the replication step. A linear descent elimination strategy is adopted finally in the elimination process. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved algorithm performs well in both single-peak function and multi-peak function, having strong convergence ability and search ability.","output":"Adaptive Bacterial Foraging Optimization Based on Roulette Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La dificultad inicial de realizar autopsias clnicas en pacientes fallecidos por COVID-19 hizo necesaria la utilizacin de mtodos alternativos para la obtencin de material de los rganos afectos.

Drug delivery systems, bone plates, screws, cranial, and dental devices are the popular examples of these implants - the potential alternatives for human life survival. However, the processing techniques of an engineered implant largely determine its preciseness, surface characteristics, and interactive ability with the adjacent tissue(s) in a particular biological environment. Moreover, the high cost-effective manufacturing of an implant under tight tolerances remains a challenge. In this regard, several subtractive or additive manufacturing techniques are employed to manufacture patient-specific implants, depending primarily on the required biocompatibility, bioactivity, surface integrity, and fatigue strength. The present paper reviews numerous non-degradable and degradable metallic implant biomaterials such as stainless steel (SS), titanium (Ti)-based, cobalt (Co)-based, nickel-titanium (NiTi), and magnesium (Mg)-based alloys, followed by their processing via traditional turning, drilling, and milling including the high-speed multi-axis CNC machining, and non-traditional abrasive water jet machining (AWJM), laser beam machining (LBM), ultrasonic machining (USM), and electric discharge machining (EDM) types of subtractive manufacturing techniques. However, the review further funnels down its primary focus on Mg, NiTi, and Ti-based alloys on the basis of the increasing trend of their implant applications in the last decade due to some of their outstanding properties. In the recent years, the incorporation of cryogenic coolant-assisted traditional subtraction of biomaterials has gained researchers attention due to its sustainability, environment-friendly nature, performance, and superior biocompatible and functional outcomes fitting for medical applications. However, some of the latest studies reported that the medical implant manufacturing requirements could be more remarkably met using the non-traditional subtractive manufacturing approaches. Altogether, cryogenic machining among the traditional routes and EDM among the non-traditional means along with their variants, were identified as some of the most effective subtractive manufacturing techniques for achieving the dimensionally accurate and biocompatible metallic medical implants with significantly modified surfaces.","output":"A comprehensive review on metallic implant biomaterials and their subtractive manufacturing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Transmission within families and multiple spike protein mutations have been associated with the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to: (1) describe full genome characterization of SARS-CoV-2 and correlate the sequences with epidemiological data within family clusters, and (2) conduct phylogenetic analysis of all samples from Yogyakarta and Central Java, Indonesia and other countries. METHODS: The study involved 17 patients with COVID-19, including two family clusters. We determined the full-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using the Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using a dataset of 142 full-genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from different regions. RESULTS: Ninety-four SNPs were detected throughout the open reading frame (ORF) of SARS-CoV-2 samples with 58% (54/94) of the nucleic acid changes resulting in amino acid mutations. About 94% (16/17) of the virus samples showed D614G on spike protein and 56% of these (9/16) showed other various amino acid mutations on this protein, including L5F, V83L, V213A, W258R, Q677H, and N811I. The virus samples from family cluster-1 (n = 3) belong to the same clade GH, in which two were collected from deceased patients, and the other from the survived patient. All samples from this family cluster revealed a combination of spike protein mutations of D614G and V213A. Virus samples from family cluster-2 (n = 3) also belonged to the clade GH and showed other spike protein mutations of L5F alongside the D614G mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first comprehensive report associating the full-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with the epidemiological data within family clusters. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three viruses from family cluster-1 formed a monophyletic group, whereas viruses from family cluster-2 formed a polyphyletic group indicating there is the possibility of different sources of infection.

Following the pandemic, it will be critical to identify the characteristics that were associated with adoption of telehealth prior to the pandemic as key drivers of adoption and outside of a public health emergency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined three data sources: The American Telemedicine Association's 2019 state telehealth analysis, the American Hospital Association's 2018 annual survey of acute care hospitals and its Information Technology Supplement. Telehealth adoption was measured through five telehealth categories. Independent variables included seven hospital characteristics and five reimbursement policies. After bivariate comparisons, we developed a multivariable model using logistic regression to assess characteristics associated with telehealth adoption. RESULTS: Among 2923 US hospitals, 73% had at least one telehealth capability. More than half of these hospitals invested in telehealth consultation services and stroke care. Non-profit hospitals, affiliated hospitals, major teaching hospitals, and hospitals located in micropolitan areas (those with 10-50,000 people) were more likely to adopt telehealth. In contrast, hospitals that lacked electronic clinical documentation, were unaffiliated with a hospital system, or were investor-owned had lower odds of adopting telehealth. None of the statewide policies were associated with adoption of telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth policy requires major revisions soon, and we suggest that these policies should be national rather than at the state level.

This study explored perceptions of face coverings, including motivations and barriers for use, and examined reactions to messaging promoting the use of face coverings. Six virtual focus groups were conducted with 34 North Carolina residents in July 2020. Participants reported high compliance with face covering recommendations but often did not wear them around family, friends, and colleagues. The most prevalent motivation for the use of face coverings was to protect or respect other people, including high-risk populations and individuals. Other motivators were self-protection, responsibility, desire for control, requirements, and expert advice. Barriers included physical and social discomfort, confusion or misinformation, low perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and perceptions of identity and autonomy.

Therefore, it is important to understand COVID-19 characteristics across different countries. Methods: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study of 525 hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 patients, from the central federal hospital in Dubai-UAE during period of March to August 2020. Results: UAE's COVID-19 patients were relatively young; mean (SD) of the age 49(15) years, 130 (25%) were older than 60 and 4 (<1%) were younger than 18 years old. Majority were male(47; 78%). The mean (SD) BMI was 29 (6) kg/m2. While the source of contracting COVID-19 was not known in 369 (70%) of patients, 29 (6%) reported travel to overseas-country and 127 (24%) reported contact with another COVID-19 case/s. At least one comorbidity was present in 284 (54%) of patients and 241 (46%) had none. The most common comorbidities were diabetes (177; 34%) and hypertension (166; 32%). The mean (SD) of symptoms duration was 6 (3) days. The most common symptoms at hospitalization were fever (340; 65%), cough (296; 56%), and shortness of breath (SOB) (243; 46%). Most of the laboratory values were within normal range, but (184; 35%) of patients had lymphopenia, 43 (8%) had neutrophilia, and 116 (22%) had prolong international normalized ratio (INR), and 317 (60%) had high D-dimer. Chest x ray findings of consolidation was present in 334 (64%) of patients and CT scan ground glass appearance was present in 354 (68%). Acute cardiac injury occurred in 124 (24%), acute kidney injury in 111 (21%), liver injury in 101 (19%), ARDS in 155 (30%), acidosis in 118 (22%), and septic shock in 93 (18%). Consequently, 150 (29%) required ICU admission with 103 (20%) needed mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: The study demonstrated the special profile of COVID-19 in UAE.

The underlying reasons why a smaller percentage of patients present with severe pulmonary symptoms whereas the majority is only mildly affected are to date not well understood. Comparing the immunological phenotype in healthy donors and patients with mild versus severe COVID-19 shows that in COVID-19 patients, NK-/B-cell activation and proliferation are enhanced independent of severity. As an important precondition for effective antibody responses, T-follicular helper cells and antibody secreting cells are increased both in patients with mild and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond this, T cells in COVID-19 patients exhibit a stronger activation profile with differentiation toward effector cell phenotypes. Importantly, when looking at the rates of pulmonary complications in COVID-19 patients, the chemokine receptor CCR4 is higher expressed by both CD4 and CD8 T cells of patients with severe COVID-19. This raises the hypothesis that CCR4 upregulation on T cells in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 promotes stronger T-cell attraction to the lungs leading to increased immune activation with presumably higher pulmonary toxicity. Our study contributes significantly to the understanding of the immunological changes during COVID-19, as new therapeutic agents, preferentially targeting the immune system, are highly warranted.","output":"Upregulation of CCR4 in activated CD8+ T cells indicates enhanced lung homing in patients with severe acute SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare-associated infections are well-studied in the literature, but remain a significant challenge for healthcare workers (HCWs) in dental practice.

The study was conducted in a mixed commercial-residential neighborhood in Somerville (MA, USA), where traffic is the dominant source of air pollution. Measurements were made between March 27 and May 14, 2020, coinciding with a dramatic reduction in traffic (71% drop in car and 46% drop in truck traffic) due to business shutdowns and a statewide stay-at-home advisory. Indicators of fresh vehicular emissions (ultrafine particle number concentration [PNC] and black carbon [BC]) were measured with a mobile monitoring platform on an interstate highway and major and minor roadways. Our results show that depending on road class, median PNC and BC contributions from traffic were 60-68% and 22-46% lower, respectively, during the lockdown compared to pre-pandemic conditions, and corresponding reductions in total on-road concentrations were 45-69% and 22-56%, respectively. A higher BC: PNC concentration ratio was observed during the lockdown period likely indicative of the higher fraction of diesel vehicles in the fleet during the lockdown. Overall, the scale of reductions in ultrafine particle and BC concentrations was commensurate with the reductions in traffic. This natural experiment allowed us to quantify the direct impacts of reductions in traffic emissions on neighborhood-scale air quality, which are not captured by the regional regulatory-monitoring network. These results underscore the importance of measurements of appropriate proxies for traffic emissions at relevant spatial scales.

A typical power-law model of social interactions from network science reproduces the observation that individuals with a high number of contacts, hubs or superspreaders, can become the primary conduits for transmission. Conversely, once the tail of the distribution is saturated, herd immunity sets in at a smaller overall recovered fraction than in the analogous SIR model.

Today our understanding of this ancient part of innate immunity has changed substantially and we know now that complement plays an undisputed pivotal role in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity. The complement system consists of over 50 blood-circulating, cell-surface expressed and intracellular proteins. It is key in the recognition and elimination of invading pathogens, also in the removal of self-derived danger such as apoptotic cells, and it supports innate immune responses and the initiation of the general inflammatory reactions. The long prevailing classic view of complement was that of a serum-operative danger sensor and first line of defence system, however, recent experimental and clinical evidences have demonstrated that local tissue and surprisingly intracellular complement (the complosome) activation impacts on normal cell physiology. This review will focus on novel aspects of intracellular complement activation and its unexpected roles in basic cell processes such as metabolism.

In accordance with mandated city-wide infection control measures, the Hospital for Sick Children (HSC) drastically reduced all services while maintaining a fully operational emergency department. Because of the GTA health service suspensions and the overlap of SARS-like symptoms with many common childhood illnesses, this introduced the potential for a change in the volumes of patients visiting the emergency department of the only regional tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS We compared HSC emergency department patient volumes, admission rates and length of stay in the emergency department in the baseline years of 2000-2002 (non-SARS years) with those in 2003 (SARS year). The data from the prior years were modeled as a time series. Using an interrupted time series analysis, we compared the 2003 data for the periods before, during and after the SARS periods with the modeled data for significant differences in the 3 aforementioned outcomes of interest. RESULTS Compared with the 2000-2002 data, we found no differences in visits, admission rates or length of stay in the pre-SARS period in 2003. There were significant decreases in visits and length of stay (p < 0.001) and increases in admission rates (p < 0.001) during the periods in 2003 when there were new and active cases of SARS in the GTA. All 3 outcomes returned to expected estimates coincident with the absence of SARS cases from September to December 2003. INTERPRETATION During the SARS outbreak in the GTA, the HSC emergency department experienced significantly reduced volumes of patients with low-acuity complaints.

Methods: Secondary analysis from a prospective cohort including COVID-19 hospitalized patients from Hospital Universitario La Princesa between November 2020 and January 2021. Serial plasma samples were collected from admission until discharge. Viral load was quantified by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction and IL6 levels with an enzyme immunoassay. To represent the evolution over time of both variables we used the graphic command twoway of Stata. Results: A total of 57 patients were recruited, with median age of 63 years (IQR [53-81]), 61.4% male and 68.4% caucasian. The peak of viremia appeared shortly after symptom onset in patients with persistent viremia (more than 1 sample with >1.3 log10 copies/ml) and also in those with at least one IL6>30 pg/ml, followed by a progressive increase in IL6 around 10 days later. Persistent viremia in the first week of hospitalization was associated with higher levels of IL6. Both IL6 and SARS-CoV-2 viral load were higher in males, with a quicker increase with age. Conclusions: In those patients with worse outcomes, an early peak of SARS-CoV-2 viral load precedes an increase in IL6 levels.

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in patients followed for rare autoimmune diseases as well as the predictors of COVID-19 and disease flare-ups. METHODS: Cross-sectional phone survey from April 9, 2020, to July 2, 2020, during which patients with autoimmune diseases followed at the National Reference Center for Rare Autoimmune diseases of Strasbourg were systematically contacted by phone and sent a prescription for a SARS-CoV-2 serology. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred thirty-two patients were contacted. One thousand fifty-five patients with a confirmed diagnosis of systemic autoimmune disease were included (4 unreachable, 4 moves abroad, 5 deaths before pandemic, 50 without consent, and 114 without autoimmune disease). Among them, 469 (44.5%) patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology. Thirty-nine patients (7.9%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection (either through chest CT-scan [n = 5], RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab [n = 14], or serology [n = 31]) among the 496 who underwent at least one of those 3 diagnosis modalities. Of the 39 proven cases, 33 had clinical manifestations (6 asymptomatic patients were diagnosed through systematic serology testing), 31 were managed by home care, 3 were hospitalized due to a need for oxygenation, two required admission to an intensive care unit, and one died. Among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported flares were more frequent than in uninfected patients (26.3% [10/38] vs. 7.0% [32/457], p < 0.0001). Preventive sick leave had no significant impact on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (5.8% [3/53]) compared to work continuation (7.6% [30/397], p = 0.64). Overall, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.6% (31/469) which was numerically lower to the Grand-Est general population estimated to be 9.0%. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic survey of more than 1000 patients with rare systemic autoimmune diseases reports a low prevalence of proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and very rare severe infections, probably related to good compliance with prophylactic measures in these patients.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became pandemic within weeks and the number of human infections and severe cases is increasing. We aimed to investigate the susceptibilty of potential animal hosts and the risk of anthropozoonotic spill-over infections. METHODS: We intranasally inoculated nine fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), ferrets (Mustela putorius), pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), and 17 chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) with 10(5) TCID(50) of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate per animal. Direct contact animals (n=3) were included 24 h after inoculation to test viral transmission. Animals were monitored for clinical signs and for virus shedding by nucleic acid extraction from nasal washes and rectal swabs (ferrets), oral swabs and pooled faeces samples (fruit bats), nasal and rectal swabs (pigs), or oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs (chickens) on days 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 21 after infection by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). On days 4, 8, and 12, two inoculated animals (or three in the case of chickens) of each species were euthanised, and all remaining animals, including the contacts, were euthanised at day 21. All animals were subjected to autopsy and various tissues were collected for virus detection by RT-qPCR, histopathology immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridisation. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies was tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay and virus neutralisation test in samples collected before inoculation and at autopsy. FINDINGS: Pigs and chickens were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. All swabs, organ samples, and contact animals were negative for viral RNA, and none of the pigs or chickens seroconverted. Seven (78%) of nine fruit bats had a transient infection, with virus detectable by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridisation in the nasal cavity, associated with rhinitis. Viral RNA was also identified in the trachea, lung, and lung-associated lymphatic tissue in two animals euthanised at day 4. One of three contact bats became infected. More efficient virus replication but no clinical signs were observed in ferrets, with transmission to all three direct contact animals. Mild rhinitis was associated with viral antigen detection in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium. Prominent viral RNA loads of 0C10(4) viral genome copies per mL were detected in the upper respiratory tract of fruit bats and ferrets, and both species developed SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies reaching neutralising titres of up to 1/1024 after 21 days. INTERPRETATION: Pigs and chickens could not be infected intranasally by SARS-CoV-2, whereas fruit bats showed characteristics of a reservoir host. Virus replication in ferrets resembled a subclinical human infection with efficient spread. Ferrets might serve as a useful model for further studieseg, testing vaccines or antivirals.

We followed up this cohort until death from COVID-19 or discharge from hospital. RESULTS: A total of 5,473 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were analyzed, including 495 with type 2 diabetes and 4,978 without diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes were more likely to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) (P<0.0001). The incidence of in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with type 2 diabetes (P<0.0001). After adjustment for age, sex, insurance status, and comorbidities, odds of ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 2.49; P=0.0416) and in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.13 to 3.21; P=0.0161) among patients with COVID-19 infection were significantly higher in those with type 2 diabetes.

In this study, we planned to investigate whether the pandemic really resulted in an increase in facial paralysis cases admitted to the hospital by evaluating the cases who applied to our hospital due to facial paralysis in the COVID-19 pandemic year and in the previous 4 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who applied to our hospital due to facial paralysis between March 2016-February 2017 (Group 1), between March 2017-February 2018 (Group 2), between March 2018-February 2019 (Group 3), between March 2019-February 2020 (Group 4), and between March 2020-February 2021 (Group 5) were investigated and detailed data were noted.

To determine the incidence of reactive FDG uptake and its contributing factors, we retrospectively studied a cohort of subjects who were vaccinated at our hospital. METHODS: Whole-body FDG-PET/CT examinations performed in 237 subjects out of 240 subjects with a definite history of COVID-19 vaccination (BNT162b2; BioNTech-Pfizer) were analyzed. Positivity and SUVmax of FDG uptake in the ALN and DM ipsilateral to vaccination, various subject characteristics, and the grade of the pathological FDG-PET/CT findings were evaluated using a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: FDG uptake in the ALN and DM ipsilateral to vaccination was seen in about 60% of the subjects even soon (0C4 days) after the first vaccination, with percentages reaching 87.5% and 75.0%, respectively, after the second vaccination. DM uptake had almost disappeared at around 2 weeks, while ALN uptake persisted for 3 weeks or longer. A multivariate analysis showed that a short duration since vaccination, a younger age, a female sex, and a low FDG-PET/CT grade (minimal pathological FDG uptake) contributed significantly to positive ALN uptake, while a short duration since vaccination and a female sex were the only significant contributors to positive DM uptake. This study is the first to identify factors contributing to positive FDG uptake in ALN and DM after COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSION: A high incidence of FDG uptake in ALN and DM was observed after vaccination. ALN uptake seemed to be associated with a younger age, a female sex, and minimal pathological FDG uptake. After vaccination, an acute inflammatory reaction in DM followed by immune reaction in ALN linked to humoral immunity may be speculated.","output":"[(18)F]FDG uptake in axillary lymph nodes and deltoid muscle after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination: a cohort study to determine incidence and contributing factors using a multivariate analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in respiratory inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Furthermore, PBMCs and neutrophils obtained from healthy volunteers were stimulated with RSV, LPS (TLR4 agonist), and Pam3Cys (TLR2 agonist) in vitro. Disease severity of viral lower respiratory tract infections in children is associated with increased expression levels of the MMP\\\\8 and MMP\\\\9 genes in both PBMCs and granulocytes.

Once the vacuole is brought to the bud cortex via the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex, Vac17 is degraded and the vacuole is released from Myo2. However, mechanisms governing dissociation of the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex are not well understood. Ubiquitylation of the Vac17 adaptor at the bud cortex provides spatial regulation of vacuole release. Here, we report that ubiquitylation alone is not sufficient for cargo release. We find that a parallel pathway, which initiates on the vacuole, converges with ubiquitylation to release the vacuole from Myo2. Specifically, we show that Yck3 and Vps41, independent of their known roles in homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS)-mediated vesicle tethering, are required for the phosphorylation of Vac17 in its Myo2 binding domain. These phosphorylation events allow ubiquitylated Vac17 to be released from Myo2 and Vac8. Our data suggest that Vps41 is regulating the phosphorylation of Vac17 via Yck3, a casein kinase I, and likely another unknown kinase. That parallel pathways are required to release the vacuole from Myo2 suggests that multiple signals are integrated to terminate organelle inheritance.","output":"Cargo Release from Myosin V Requires the Convergence of Parallel Pathways that Phosphorylate and Ubiquitylate the Cargo Adaptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define chronic diseases as conditions that last 1 year or more and that require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living, or both (1). Chronic diseases may be influenced by a combination of genetics, lifestyle and social behaviors, health care system factors, community influences, and environmental determinants of health (2). These risk factors often coexist and interact with each other. Therefore, a better understanding of determinants of chronic diseases such as tobacco use, unhealthy eating, and physical inactivity stands to benefit from effective strategies for improving primary, secondary, and tertiary disease prevention and management in diverse global settings (3). Strategies to prevent and manage chronic disease outcomes such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have global commonalities (4-7). The impact of chronic diseases is disproportionately evident in Black and Brown communities (8,9). Chronic disease prevention and management typically focus on behavioral interventions such as healthy eating, increased physical activity, and cessation of unhealthy practices such as tobacco and alcohol use (10-15). In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic added to the fact that chronic diseases disproportionately affect low-resource communities, where many Black and Brown populations live (16,17). COVID-19 demonstrated that chronic disease disparities actually present as preexisting conditions in Black and Brown communities, who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 outcomes. Although most of the articles in this Preventing Chronic Disease (PCD) collection were published before the pandemic, the insights they present, combined with the racial and ethnic data on the burden of COVID-19 thus far, support this reality. Many researchers and public health practitioners often consider the need to sufficiently address the relationships between chronic diseases and social, behavioral, and community factors (18). Global lessons in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, therefore, can help researchers and practitioners benefit from the shared lessons and experience derived from research and interventions conducted in different parts of the world. There are more than 7 billion people worldwide, who speak diverse languages and who have different nationalities, identities, and health systems. Yet, if we share challenges and opportunities for chronic disease prevention and management, many of the global adversities to improving health and well-being can be ameliorated, which is the purpose of this collection. The authors in this collection share lessons that represent experiences in diverse contexts across countries and regions of the world.","output":"Global Perspectives on Improving Chronic Disease Prevention and Management in Diverse Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims To study the quality of handover, between nursing staff and doctors, on an inpatient psychiatric unit. Effective handover between professionals is vital to ensure the accurate transfer of useful information to enable quality care and patient safety. Implementation of a handover tool has been shown to improve patient safety, especially when used to structure communication over the phone. Feedback at trainee doctor forums highlighted insufficient handover from nursing staff whilst on-call, a problem which prompted further exploration. Method Standards were developed for the expected quality of handover, consisting of a set of criteria for the minimum information required to ensure a safe and effective handover, stemming from the SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) approach, with adequate identification of patients, clear communication of the current situation and relevant details. In an inpatient psychiatric setting, telephone calls to the on-call doctor were recorded for a two-week period, documenting whether key information was communicated. Result Total number of calls to on-call doctor recorded: 68. The patients name was given in 49% and the ID number in just 10%. Both relevant diagnosis/history and NEWS score was provided in 18%. However, the current issue and recommendation was given in 90% and 95% respectively. Conclusion The results thus far demonstrate a lack of structure and often limited information delivered in handover from nursing staff to the on-call doctor. This leads to difficulties in prioritisation, identifying the urgency of the situation and inefficiencies, as time is spent requesting further information which is not readily available. After nursing colleagues were made aware, results from a further two-week period, from 65 total calls, demonstrated some improvement. Patient name given in 51%, ID number in 18%, relevant diagnosis/history in 12%, NEWS score in 17%, current issue in 92% and recommendation in 51%. It is clear that with marginal improvement, there remains a problem which we aim to address by collaborating further with senior nursing leads whilst implementing a succinct handover proforma. It is likely that with COVID-19 as the priority on the agenda this past year, quality improvement projects such as this has not been the main focus.

Observing imaging features is a well-known objective assessment for knee OA disorder. However, the variety of imaging features is rarely discussed. This study reviews knee OA imaging features with respect to different imaging modalities for traditional OA diagnosis and updates recent image-based machine learning approaches for knee OA diagnosis and prognosis. Although most studies recognized X-ray as standard imaging option for knee OA diagnosis, the imaging features are limited to bony changes and less sensitive to short-term OA changes. Researchers have recommended the usage of MRI to study the hidden OA-related radiomic features in soft tissues and bony structures. Furthermore, ultrasound imaging features should be explored to make it more feasible for point-of-care diagnosis. Traditional knee OA diagnosis mainly relies on manual interpretation of medical images based on the KellgrenCLawrence (KL) grading scheme, but this approach is consistently prone to human resource and time constraints and less effective for OA prevention. Recent studies revealed the capability of machine learning approaches in automating knee OA diagnosis and prognosis, through three major tasks: knee joint localization (detection and segmentation), classification of OA severity, and prediction of disease progression. AI-aided diagnostic models improved the quality of knee OA diagnosis significantly in terms of time taken, reproducibility, and accuracy. Prognostic ability was demonstrated by several prediction models in terms of estimating possible OA onset, OA deterioration, progressive pain, progressive structural change, progressive structural change with pain, and time to total knee replacement (TKR) incidence. Despite research gaps, machine learning techniques still manifest huge potential to work on demanding tasks such as early knee OA detection and estimation of future disease events, as well as fundamental tasks such as discovering the new imaging features and establishment of novel OA status measure. Continuous machine learning model enhancement may favour the discovery of new OA treatment in future.","output":"Discovering Knee Osteoarthritis Imaging Features for Diagnosis and Prognosis: Review of Manual Imaging Grading and Machine Learning Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>The digital transformation towards Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has become imperative for manufacturers, as it makes them more flexible, agile and responsive to customers.

After interaction of reovirus attachment protein 1 with cell-surface carbohydrates and proteinaceous receptors, additional host factors mediate virus internalization.

While integrin-binding motifs in the surface-exposed region of reovirus capsid protein 2 are thought to mediate integrin interaction, evidence for direct 1 integrin-reovirus interactions and knowledge of how integrins function to mediate reovirus entry is lacking.

In situ observations of water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, TAlk, and pH were measured in four different stations of the Hooghly estuary. It was measured once every month during 2015-2016, and subsequently, DIC was estimated. A carbon budget was constructed to quantify carbon flows through the freshwater-marine continuum of the Hooghly estuary, and plausible impacts on the adjacent coastal ocean, the northern Bay of Bengal, were examined. The biogeochemical mass balance box model was used to compute the seasonal flow of carbon flux, and subsequently, the annual budgeting of lateral fluxes of TAlk and DIC to the adjacent coastal ocean was carried out. The net annual TAlk and DIC flux from the Hooghly estuary to the adjacent coastal ocean were 4.45  1.90  1011 mol and 4.59  1.70  1011 mol, respectively. The net annual DIC flux of the Hooghly estuary is about 30 to 60 times higher than surface area integrated air-water CO2 flux, which is an indication of promoting acidification in the adjacent coastal ocean. The present study indicates that the lateral DIC flux has increased substantially in the Hooghly estuary during the last two decades. The increase in inorganic carbon load in the Hooghly estuary due to the enhanced discharge of inorganic and organic matter load in the upper reaches of the estuary led to this increase in lateral DIC flux.

We show -- as proof of concept grounded on rigorous mathematical evidence -- that periodic, high-frequency alternation of into, and out-of, lockdown effectively mitigates second-wave effects, while allowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i) predictability, which is essential for economic sustainability, and (ii) robustness, since lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurements over short time scales. In turn -- while not eliminating the virus -- this fast switching policy is sustainable over time, and it mitigates the infection until a vaccine or treatment becomes available, while alleviating the social costs associated with long lockdowns. Typically, the policy might be in the form of 1-day of work followed by 6-days of lockdown every week (or perhaps 2 days working, 5 days off) and it can be modified at a slow-rate based on measurements filtered over longer time scales.

METHODS This was a rapid implementation action research case study, which also draws on one author's experience as Chief Executive Officer and other members' experience in an emergency management group. RESULTS Sweden experienced similar mortality per million population to the UK, despite the different public health strategy used to address the COVID-19 outbreak. The Stockholm-integrated public primary and community health-care service, serving a population of 2.3 million, made many changes quickly. One change included coordinating non-acute private health-care services, following the local government emergency directive to do so. DISCUSSION It is possible that the fast and effective response by management and services in primary and community health care reduced infection and hospital demand, which contributed to a lower mortality than otherwise expected. The actions and preparations described for Stockholm's response may provide ideas for other health-care systems.

Ventilation in these cases is studied at both low (0.1 m/s) and high (1 m/s) airflow rates corresponding to $Re=5000$ and $Re=50000$. An analysis of the indoor CO$_2$ concentration is carried out as the room is emptied from stale, high CO$_2$ content air. We estimate the air changes per hour (ACH) values for three different room geometries and show that the numerical estimates from 3D CFD simulations may differ by 80-150 % ($Re=50000$) and 75-140 % ($Re=5000$) from the theoretical ACH value based on the perfect mixing assumption. Additionally, the analysis of the CO$_2$ probability distributions (PDFs) indicates a relatively non-uniform distribution of fresh air indoors. Finally, utilizing a time-dependent Wells-Riley analysis, an example is provided on the growth of the cumulative infection risk being reduced rapidly after the ventilation is started.

After the removal of duplicates and selection of articles of interest, 30 studies were eligible to include. If heterogeneity was high (I2>50%), a random-effects model was applied to combine the data. Otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used. Results: A total of 5586 individuals were assessed (1555 patients with severe COVID-19 infection and 3452 with non-severe infection). Platelets, lymphocytes and serum albumin were significantly lower in severe patients while other biochemical and immunological parameters including prothrombin time, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, LDH, procalcitonin, CRP, IL-6, and IgA were significantly higher in patients with severe infection. Neutrophil and monocyte counts as well as hemoglobin level, D-dimer, hypersensitive troponin I, IL-2R, IgG and IgM levels were different between two groups;however, the difference was not statistically significant (All P-values >0.05). Conclusions: Lymphopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and high levels of inflammatory biomarkers are associated with severe COVID-19 infection.","output":"Crucial Laboratory Parameters in Severe COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To determine the clinical outcomes of older COVID-19 patients who received DMB compared to those who did not. We hypothesized that fewer patients administered DMB would require oxygen therapy and/or intensive care support than those who did not. Methodology: Cohort observational study of all consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 50 and above in a tertiary academic hospital who received DMB compared to a recent cohort who did not. Patients were administered oral vitamin D3 1000 IU OD, magnesium 150mg OD and vitamin B12 500mcg OD (DMB) upon admission if they did not require oxygen therapy. Primary outcome was deterioration post-DMB administration leading to any form of oxygen therapy and/or intensive care support. Results: Between 15 January and 15 April 2020, 43 consecutive COVID-19 patients aged []50 were identified. 17 patients received DMB and 26 patients did not. Baseline demographic characteristics between the two groups were similar. Significantly fewer DMB patients than controls required initiation of oxygen therapy subsequently throughout their hospitalization (17.6% vs 61.5%, P=0.006). DMB exposure was associated with odds ratios of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.03 - 0.59) and 0.15 (95% CI: 0.03 - 0.93) for oxygen therapy need and/or intensive care support on univariate and multivariate analyses respectively. Conclusions: DMB combination in older COVID-19 patients was associated with a significant reduction in proportion of patients with clinical deterioration requiring oxygen support and/or intensive care support.

Major cardiac involvement is a potentially lethal feature in severe cases. We sought to describe the underlying pathophysiological mechanism in COVID-19 lethal cardiogenic shock. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report on a 48-year-old male COVID-19 patient with cardiogenic shock; despite extracorporeal life support, dialysis, and massive pharmacological support, this rescue therapy was not successful. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA was detected at autopsy in the lungs and myocardium. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of type II pneumocytes, lymphocytes in the lung interstitium, and pulmonary microemboli. Moreover, patchy muscular, sometimes perivascular, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, were seen in the cardiac tissue. The lymphocytes 'interlocked' the myocytes, resulting in myocyte degeneration and necrosis. Predominantly, T-cell lymphocytes with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 1.7 infiltrated the interstitial myocardium, reflecting true myocarditis. The myocardial tissue was examined for markers of ferroptosis, an iron-catalysed form of regulated cell death that occurs through excessive peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Immunohistochemical staining with E06, a monoclonal antibody binding to oxidized phosphatidylcholine (reflecting lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis), was positive in morphologically degenerating and necrotic cardiomyocytes adjacent to the infiltrate of lymphocytes, near arteries, in the epicardium and myocardium. A similar ferroptosis signature was present in the myocardium of a COVID-19 subject without myocarditis. In a case of sudden death due to viral myocarditis of unknown aetiology, however, immunohistochemical staining with E06 was negative. The renal proximal tubuli stained positively for E06 and also hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a reactive breakdown product of the lipid peroxides that execute ferroptosis. In the case of myocarditis of other aetiology, the renal tissue displayed no positivity for E06 or 4-HNE. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in this case are unique as this is the first report on accumulated oxidized phospholipids (or their breakdown products) in myocardial and renal tissue in COVID-19. This highlights ferroptosis, proposed to detrimentally contribute to some forms of ischaemia-reperfusion injury, as a detrimental factor in COVID-19 cardiac damage and multiple organ failure.","output":"Fatal lymphocytic cardiac damage in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): autopsy reveals a ferroptosis signature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growth performance and physiological responses of nursery piglets when fed enzymatically treated yeast (HY40) and pharmacological ZnO alone or in combination, were investigated. A total of 144 pigs (21d old, BW 7.320.55 kg) were placed in 36 pens (4 pigs/pen). Pigs were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments (n=9): [1] control corn-wheat-soybean meal diet (control), [2] control + HY40 (HY40), [3] control +ZnO and [4] control + HY40 + ZnO (HY40+ZnO). Inclusion of HY40 and ZnO was 0.5% and 3,000 ppm in phase I (d 0 to 14), respectively, and halved in phase II (d 15 to 42). All diets contained 0.2% TiO2 for determination of apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of components. Body weight and feed disappearance was recorded weekly. One pig per pen was sacrificed for organ weights, blood, and tissue samples on d 14. Except for phase II, when HY40+ZnO pigs had greater average daily feed intake (P=0.004) than all other treatments, there were no (P>0.05) interactions between HY40 and ZnO on growth performance. Pigs fed HY40 or ZnO containing diets were heavier (P<0.05) than pigs fed without by the end of the study. On d 14, pigs fed additives exhibited higher (P0.009) ATTD of dry matter (DM) and gross energy (GE) than control pigs. On d 28, pigs fed control, HY40 and HY40+ZnO had greater (P0.022) ATTD of DM, crude protein, and GE than piglets fed ZnO only. Pigs fed HY40+ZnO had lower ileal digesta E. coli concentration (P<0.05) than HY40 and control pigs. Ileal digesta of pigs fed ZnO diets had higher lactobacillus to E. coli ratio (1.44 vs. 1.20; P=0.001), exhibited higher concentrations of acetic (P=0.01) and butyric acid (P=0.01) but lower lactic (P=0.02) and total short chain fatty acids (P=0.033) than pigs fed non-ZnO diets.

It is imperative for facultatives in primary care, for geriatric clinics, and for social care services. In this respect, this article explores the validity of an abbreviated version of the Sociotype Questionnaire (SOCQ), a tool previously developed by the authors for assessing the social relationships of the general population, now specifically addressed to the elderly population. The aim is to construct a 4-item dichotomous scale (SOCG-4) out of the 12 items of the original scale of the SOCQ, so that it can serve to discriminate among the patients in primary care and the geriatric clinic, helping the facultative to find those in need of social care or of psychosocial intervention. The population data have been obtained from a series of previous studies on social relationships in different segments of the elderly population (Ntotal = 915). The resulting abbreviated version of SOCG-4 was extracted by means of confirmatory factor analysis, with the congruence, validity, and relationship with the determinants as close to optimal. The significant correlations with SOCQ (0.82), UCLA (?0.55), Barthel (0.40), and other relevant tests are obtained. The test was also put to trial in a pilot study, being applied to 150 subjects via phone surveys, home visiting, and geriatric clinicit becomes particularly useful for assessing the social relationships in geriatric clinic use.

Suicide rates for health care providers are thought to be higher than for people in other occupations because of job strain and burnout. Despite the National Academy of Medicine's Action Collaborative on Clinician Well-Being and Resilience, which focuses on reducing stress and preventing suicide, a shortage of data limits our understanding of nurse suicide. Neither employers nor professional nursing associations track suicide data. PURPOSE To determine the number of suicides and estimated rate of suicide among RNs, using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). METHODS We extracted data from the NVDRS, which is based on death certificates, coroner reports, and law enforcement reports, for the year 2015. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System was used to code the data. Industry and occupation coding experts reviewed the coding for accuracy. RESULTS Analysis of 2015 NVDRS data from 17 states showed that among civilian employed nurses ages 16 to 64 years, the estimated suicide rates for female and male nurses (11.4 and 29.3 per 100,000 nurses, respectively) were each higher than the rates for the comparable total population (8.2 and 26.1 per 100,000 people, respectively).

One option for mitigating an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the devices. The focus of this study was to develop a new evaluation technique based on 3 major decontamination requirements: (1) inactivating viruses, (2) not altering the respirator properties, and (3) not leaving any toxic byproduct on the FFR. METHODS: Hydrophilic and hydrophobic FFRs were contaminated with MS2 virus. In the solution-based deposition, the virus-containing liquid droplets were spiked directly onto FFRs, while in the vapor-based and aerosol-based depositions, the viral particles were loaded onto FFRs using a bio-aerosol testing system. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) and moist heat (MH) decontamination methods were used for inactivation of viruses applied to FFRs. RESULTS: Both UVGI and MH methods inactivated viruses (>5-log reduction of MS2 virus; in 92% of both method experiments, the virus was reduced to levels below the detection limit), did not alter the respirator properties, and did not leave any toxic byproduct on the FFRs.

All participants underwent ophthalmological examination, including fundus photography and OCTA of the macular region and optic disk. COVID-19 children were examined 4-8 weeks after COVID-19 diagnoses. Demographic data, medical history, and COVID-19 symptoms were noted. OCTA parameters in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) were analyzed according to ETDRS sectors and peripapillary quadrants.

In Indonesia, some coal-fired power plants have been put in reserve shutdown. Plant's competitiveness can be improved with lowering the production cost.

In this study, investigation is conducted to identify the operation and maintenance effects when using LRC, especially related to the plant safety and reliability, on the existing coal power plants. It is found that burning very low coal heating value, some components facilities need to increase their load until greater than its rated capacity in order to keep the maximum rated output capacity from the plants. Other effects of increased coal load are reduced boiler combustion efficiency, decreased mill temperature and increased secondary superheater temperature. These effects will lead to potential boiler failure due to the risks of increased local hotspot and erosion of the tubes.

Results The FDA provided 6158 pages of AERs. Duplicates, non-US, or AERs previously published (Gary, 2006) were excluded. Of the remaining, there were 3197 unique, US-only AERs of which there were 537 (16.80%) with insufficient information to determine clinical severity, leaving 2660 (83.20%) Codable US AERs. (Figure 1). Of these, 20 were Deaths, 529 were Life-threatening, 1957 were Severe, 151 were Moderate, and 3 were Mild. The deaths included: 9 (45.00%) sepsis, 4 (20.00%) drug toxicity/overdose, 1 (5.00%) ruptured ectopic pregnancy, 1 (5.00%) hemorrhage, 3 (15.00%) possible homicides, 1 (5.00%) suicide, 1 (5.00%) unknown.

The development of computer-aided systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs, which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs, even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average norm of an image in the image dataset achieves>85% and>90% success rates for the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example, we show that iterative fine-tuning of the DNN models using UAPs improves the robustness of the DNN models against UAPs.","output":"Vulnerability of deep neural networks for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images to universal adversarial attacks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 outbreak pandemic is a situation without a tested action plan.

The PVX vector was also used to express a base-editor consisting of modified Cas9 fused with cytidine deaminase to introduce targeted nucleotide substitution in regenerated shoots. We also report exogenous DNA-free genome editing by mechanical inoculation of virions comprising the PVX vector expressing Cas9. This simple and efficient virus-vector-mediated delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 could facilitate transgene-free gene editing in plants.","output":"Potato virus X Vector-Mediated DNA-Free genome editing in plants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strengthening pro-environmental behaviors such as green purchasing behavior is important for environmental sustainability. An integrated social cognition model which incorporates constructs from habit theory, health action process approach (HAPA), and theory of planned behavior (TPB) is adopted to understand Iranian adolescents green purchasing behavior. Using a correlational-prospective design, the study recruited Iranian adolescents aged between 14 and 19 years (N = 2374, n = 1362 (57.4%) females, n = 1012 (42.6%) males; Mean (SD) age = 15.56 (1.22)). At baseline (T1), participants self-reported on the following constructs: past behavior; habit strength (from habit theory); action planning and coping planning (from HAPA); and intention, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, and attitude (from TPB) with respect to green purchasing behavior. Six months later (T2), participants self-reported on their actions in terms of purchasing green goods. Our findings reported direct effects of perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, attitude, and past behavior on intention; intention and perceived behavioral control on green purchase behavior; intention on two types of planning (i.e., action and coping planning); both types of planning on green purchase behavior; and past green purchase behavior and habits on prospectively measured green purchase behavior. These results indicate that adolescent green purchasing behavior is underpinned by constructs representing motivational, volitional, and automatic processes. This knowledge can help inform the development of theory-based behavior change interventions to improve green purchasing in adolescents, a key developmental period where climate change issues are salient and increased independence and demands in making self-guided decisions are needed.","output":"Using an Integrated Social Cognition Model to Explain Green Purchasing Behavior among Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal infections are common in children with nephrotic syndrome. Knowledge of the commonly available serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility will help in prevention and appropriate management of pneumococcal sepsis, especially in resource-limited countries. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on children with nephrotic syndrome and pneumococcal infections were extracted from the electronic medical records. RESULTS: Sixty-three isolates of pneumococci obtained from 60 children with nephrotic syndrome, over a period of 14 years, were included in the study. This represented 18% of all pneumococcal infections occurring in children during the same period. Commonly available vaccines covered up to 58% of all the serotypes causing infection. Severe disease, with shock, intensive care admission and/or meningitis, was observed in 38% children and mortality was observed in 10%. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics was not observed, except for erythromycin.

Prior knowledge of genetic variant impact can enable such strategies, but current knowledge of African variants remains scarce. G6PD variants are linked to haemolytic adverse effects for a number of drugs commonly used in African populations. We have investigated a set of G6PD variants with structural bioinformatics techniques to further characterise variants with known effect, and gain insights into variants with unknown impact. We observed wide variations in patterns of root-mean-square deviation between wild-type and variant structures. Variants with known, highly deleterious impact show structural effects which may likely result in the destabilisation of the G6PD homodimer. The V68M and N126D variants (which are both common across African populations, and together form the A- haplotype) induce large conformational shifts in the catalytic NADP+ binding domain. We observed a greater impact for the haplotype than for each of the individual variants in these cases. A novel African variant (M207T) shows the potential to disrupt interactions within the protein core, urging further investigation.

The regulatory mechanisms governing the development of dendrites, however, are insufficiently understood. The evolutionary conserved Ste20/Hippo kinase pathway has been proposed to play an important role in regulating the formation and maintenance of dendritic architecture. A key element of this pathway, Ste20-like kinase (SLK), regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in non-neuronal cells and is strongly expressed throughout neuronal development. However, its function in neurons is unknown. We show that during development of mouse cortical neurons, SLK has a surprisingly specific role for proper elaboration of higher,  3rd, order dendrites. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLK is required to maintain excitation-inhibition balance. Specifically, SLK knockdown caused a selective loss of inhibitory synapses and functional inhibition after postnatal day 15, while excitatory neurotransmission was unaffected. Finally, we show that this mechanism may be relevant for human disease, as dysmorphic neurons within human cortical malformations revealed significant loss of SLK expression. Overall, the present data identify SLK as a key regulator of both dendritic complexity during development and of inhibitory synapse maintenance.","output":"Ste20-like kinase is critical for inhibitory synapse maintenance and its deficiency confers a developmental dendritopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background, Travel characteristics of Saudi women contrast significantly from those in the west.

Methods A total of 54,400 results from 1,716 laboratories were collected from China National EQAS for lymphocyte subset enumeration during the period 2017-2019. The EQA data were grouped according to lower limits of reference intervals for establishing concentration-dependent specifications. The TE value that 80% of laboratories can achieve were considered as TE specifications based on state of the art. The BV studies compliant with Biological Variation Data Critical Appraisal Checklist (BIVAC) were used to calculate the three levels of TE specifications. Then these TE specifications were compared for determining the recommended TE specifications. Results Four parameters whose quality specifications could achieve the optimum criteria were as follows: the percentages of CD3+, CD3 + CD4+ (high concentration) and CD3-CD16/56+ cells, and the absolute count of CD3-CD16/56+ cells. Only the TE specifications of CD3-CD19+ cells could achieve the minimum criteria. The TE specifications of remaining parameters should reach the desirable criteria.

The biggest outbreak city, Daegu was associated with the less negative emotional response on emergency alert text messages. Fear of disclose of contact-tracing information was significantly associated with negative emotional perception on emergency alter text messages. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that effective information providing services with considering vulnerable groups are needed to promote acceptance and eliminate negative emotion for disease related information.","output":"Factors Associated With a Negative Emotional Response to News Media and Nationwide Emergency Text Alerts During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most of the validated events exposure questionnaires are focused on lifetime burden and are hardly applicable to Argentina owing to its sociocultural and natural conditions, where corruption and economic crises have been hitting middle-class peoples lives in a cyclic manner. This prompted us to develop a new questionnaire, validated in Argentina, to assess the occurrence of exposure to events and their severity over a limited period. Deductive (bibliographic search) and inductive (by a Delphi group) selection was used to create an initial group of 24 questions, which were condensed into a final 14-item questionnaire. After administration to 512 inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires and other major cities in Argentina, the questionnaire was shown to have an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.996 and an internal consistency, measured by the omega coefficient, of 0.86. Because this study was conducted during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an additional question on how this situation affected individuals was included. The time span used to measure event exposure was 1 year prior to the study. In the case of an affirmative event exposure, the responder selected the severity of the stress perception generated on a Likert-like scale, ranging from 0 (nothing) to 5 (severe). Fifty-eight per cent of the responders were women, and the mean age was 47.14 years (SD: 13.97). The average annual event incidence per person was 2.5 events (SD: 1.88). Thirty-two per cent (164/512) reported at least one 5-point event on the severity scale.

In subsequent pregnancies, women develop protective immunity to pregnancy-associated malaria and this has been hypothesized to be due to the acquisition of antibodies to the parasite variant surface antigen VAR2CSA. In this systematic review we provide the first synthesis of the association between antibodies to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens and pregnancy and birth outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies (published up to 07 June 2019) of pregnant women living in P. falciparum endemic areas that examined antibody responses to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens and outcomes including placental malaria, low birthweight, preterm birth, peripheral parasitaemia, maternal anaemia, and severe malaria. RESULTS: We searched 6 databases and identified 33 studies (30 from Africa) that met predetermined inclusion and quality criteria: 16 studies contributed estimates in a format enabling inclusion in meta-analysis and 17 were included in narrative form only. Estimates were mostly from cross-sectional data (10 studies) and were heterogeneous in terms of magnitude and direction of effect. Included studies varied in terms of antigens tested, methodology used to measure antibody responses, and epidemiological setting. Antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC and VAR2CSA antigens, measured at delivery, were associated with placental malaria (9 studies) and may therefore represent markers of infection, rather than correlates of protection. Antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC, but not recombinant VAR2CSA antigens, were associated with trends towards protection from low birthweight (5 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst antibody responses to several antigens were positively associated with the presence of placental and peripheral infections, this review did not identify evidence that any specific antibody response is associated with protection from pregnancy-associated malaria across multiple populations. Further prospective cohort studies using standardized laboratory methods to examine responses to a broad range of antigens in different epidemiological settings and throughout the gestational period, will be necessary to identify and prioritize pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens to advance the development of vaccines and serosurveillance tools targeting pregnant women.","output":"Pregnancy-specific malarial immunity and risk of malaria in pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Innovative advancements in lung cancer treatment have developed over the past decade with the advent of targeted and immune therapies. Yes-associated protein (YAP), an effector of the Hippo pathway, promotes the resistance of these targeted drugs and modulates tumor immunity in lung cancer. YAP is involved in autophagy in lung cancer and plays a prominent role in forming the tubular structure in lung organoids and alveolar differentiation. In this review, we discuss the central roles of YAP in lung cancer and present YAP as a novel target for treating resistance to targeted therapies and immunotherapies in lung cancer. ABSTRACT: Despite significant innovations in lung cancer treatment, such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, lung cancer is still the principal cause of cancer-associated death. Novel strategies to overcome drug resistance and inhibit metastasis in cancer are urgently needed. The Hippo pathway and its effector, Yes-associated protein (YAP), play crucial roles in lung development and alveolar differentiation. YAP is known to mediate mechanotransduction, an important process in lung homeostasis and fibrosis. In lung cancer, YAP promotes metastasis and confers resistance against chemotherapeutic drugs and targeted agents. Recent studies revealed that YAP directly controls the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and modulates the tumor microenvironment (TME). YAP not only has a profound relationship with autophagy in lung cancer but also controls alveolar differentiation, and is responsible for tubular structure formation in lung organoids. In this review, we discuss the various roles and clinical implications of YAP in lung cancer and propose that targeting YAP can be a promising strategy for treating lung cancer.","output":"New Insights into the Clinical Implications of Yes-Associated Protein in Lung Cancer: Roles in Drug Resistance, Tumor Immunity, Autophagy, and Organoid Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the clinical syndrome associated with infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has impacted nearly every country in the world.

Because of this lack of data-driven treatment strategies, broad variations in practice patterns have emerged. Observed hypercoagulability in patients with COVID-19 has created debate within the critical care community on the therapeutic utility of heparin. We seek to provide an overview of the data supporting the therapeutic use of heparin, both unfractionated and low molecular weight, as an anticoagulant for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we review preclinical evidence establishing biological plausibility for heparin and synthetic heparin-like drugs as therapies for COVID-19 through antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, we discuss known adverse effects and theoretical off-target effects that may temper enthusiasm for the adoption of heparin as a therapy in COVID-19 without confirmatory prospective randomized controlled trials. Despite previous failures of anticoagulants in critical illness, plausibility of heparin for COVID-19 is sufficiently robust to justify urgent randomized controlled trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of this therapy.","output":"Heparin as a therapy for COVID-19: current evidence and future possibilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) era, when pneumonitis occurs in patients with lung cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a major challenge is to make a rapid and correct differential diagnosis among drug-induced pulmonary toxicity, tumour progression, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced pneumonitis.

She was positive for COVID-19 and transferred to intensive care unit to receive mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Electrocardiogram showed pathological Q wave and ST elevation in inferior and anterior. Troponin I was mildly elevated (5.52 ng/ml). Inflammatory marker CRP and procalcitonin were increased (3.6 mg/dl and 0.235 ng/ml, respectively). Serum cortisol level was 525.8 ng/ml. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 41%), with severe hypokinetic of the apical segments and preserved basal myocardial function consistent with visual signs of apical ballooning in TCM. Her follow-up echocardiography showed normal contractility of the apical myocardial segments, with normalization of the left ventricular systolic function, further supporting the reversibility of acute stress cardiomyopathy. DISCUSSION: Mechanisms of TCM in viral infections include catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity and inflammation related to sepsis. A presumptive diagnosis of TCM was made based on the characteristic echocardiogram findings of apical ballooning, normalization of left ventricular systolic function, unremarkable past cardiac history and spontaneous improvement in serum troponin-I levels in the setting of a severe systemic illness.

Thermal stability and physical adsorption properties of HAU and PAU were assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface measurement. The soil incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of HAU and PAU on nitrogen transformation and gaseous nitrogen loss compared with commercial urea. RESULTS: Nitrogen transformation from FAU and PAU was slowed down compared with urea. After 90 days of incubation, HAU and PAU reduced the cumulative NH3 volatilization (by 9.70% and 6.30%, respectively) and N2 O emission (by 40.48% and 43.00%, respectively) from soil compared with the urea-alone treatment.

Then, S-protein-ACE2 complexes were constructed using the generated homology models. The molecular dynamics simulations and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) were carried out to study the dynamical behavior of the generated S-ACE2 virtual complexes. Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) and Radius of Gyration (Rg) were calculated to evaluate protein stability and compactness. RESULTS: The binding free energies of S protein with ACE2 from Procyon lotor and Camelus dromedarius are about equal to that of humans.

Since APOL1 lacks orthologs in all major model organisms, a wide range of mechanisms frequently in conflict have been described for APOL1-associated nephropathies. The genetic toolkit in Drosophila allows unique in vivo insights into disrupted cellular homeostasis. To perform a mechanistic analysis, we expressed human APOL1 control and gain-of-function kidney risk variants in the podocyte-like garland cells of Drosophila nephrocytes and a wing precursor tissue. Expression of APOL1 risk variants was found to elevate endocytic function of garland cell nephrocytes that simultaneously showed early signs of cell death. Wild-type APOL1 had a significantly milder effect, while a control transgene with deletion of the short BH3 domain showed no overt phenotype. Nephrocyte endo-lysosomal function and slit diaphragm architecture remained unaffected by APOL1 risk variants, but endoplasmic reticulum (ER) swelling, chaperone induction, and expression of the reporter Xbp1-EGFP suggested an ER stress response. Pharmacological inhibition of ER stress diminished APOL1-mediated cell death and direct ER stress induction enhanced nephrocyte endocytic function similar to expression of APOL1 risk variants. We confirmed APOL1-dependent ER stress in the Drosophila wing precursor where silencing the IRE1-dependent branch of ER stress signaling by inhibition with Xbp1-RNAi abrogated cell death, representing the first rescue of APOL1-associated cytotoxicity in vivo. Thus, we uncovered ER stress as an essential consequence of APOL1 risk variant expression in vivo in Drosophila, suggesting a central role of this pathway in the pathogenesis of APOL1-associated nephropathies.","output":"Inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling rescues cytotoxicity of human apolipoprotein-L1 risk variants in Drosophila."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergence of new viral agents is driven by evolution of interactions between viral proteins and host targets.

Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was performed to locate caveolae and cav-1 and -2 in the airway epithelium of rats, mice and humans. Electron-microscopic analysis was used for the identification of caveolae. CLSM-FRET analysis determined the interaction of cav-1 and cav-2 in situ. RESULTS: Western blotting and laser-assisted microdissection identified protein and transcripts, respectively, of cav-1 and cav-2 in airway epithelium. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of abraded tracheal epithelium revealed a higher expression of cav-2 than of cav-1. Immunoreactivities for cav-1 and for cav-2 were co-localized in the cell membrane of the basal cells and basolaterally in the ciliated epithelial cells of large airways of rat and human.

Results: 92% of surgeons reported a cessation of elective inpatient cases during the height of the crisis. The reduction was greatest for surgeries performed in hospital-based sites of care. 91% reported a drop in clinic volume. At the final surveys, these numbers where 7% and 59%, respectively.

Results: A total of 43 patients were included. The median age was 62 years, and 65.1% of patients were male. Overall, 20 patients (46.5%) were identified with viral infection. Of these viruses, influenza virus (n = 8) and adenovirus (n = 7) were more frequently detected, and others included herpes simplex virus, human enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, human coronavirus 229E, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Compared with nonviral nonresponding CAP, only ground-glass opacity combined with consolidation was a more common imaging manifestation in viral nonresponding CAP. However, no obvious differences were found in clinical and laboratory findings between the presence and the absence of viral infections. Conclusions: Viral infections were particularly frequent in adults with nonresponding CAP. The ground-glass opacity combined with consolidation was a specific imaging manifestation for viral nonresponding CAP, while the clinical and laboratory data showed no obvious differences between viral and nonviral nonresponding CAP.","output":"Detection of Viruses by Multiplex Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid of Patients with Nonresponding Community-Acquired Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The lockdown imposed in the UK on the 23rd of March and associated public health measures of social distancing are likely to have had a great impact on care provision. The aim of this study was to explore the decision-making processes of continued paid home care support for dementia in the time of COVID-19. METHODS: Unpaid carers caring for a person living with dementia (PLWD) who were accessing paid home care before COVID-19 and residing in the UK were eligible to take part. Participants were interviewed over the phone and asked about their experiences of using paid home care services before and since COVID-19, and their decision-making processes of accessing paid home care since the outbreak and public health restrictions. RESULTS: Fifteen unpaid carers, who were also accessing paid care support for the PLWD before COVID-19, were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis identified three overarching themes: (1) Risk; (2) Making difficult choices and risk management; and (3) Implications for unpaid carers. Many unpaid carers decided to discontinue paid carers entering the home due to the risk of infection, resulting in unpaid carers having to pick up the care hours to support the person living with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report on the impact of COVID-19 on paid home care changes in dementia. Findings raise implications for providing better Personal Protective Equipment for paid carers, and to support unpaid carers better in their roles, with the pandemic likely to stay in place for the foreseeable future.","output":"Decision-making for receiving paid home care for dementia in the time of COVID-19: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) is bleeding that develops in the oesophagus, stomach or proximal duodenum. Peptic ulcers, caused by Helicobacter pylori infection or use of NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin (LDA), are the most common cause. Although the incidence and mortality associated with NVUGIB have been decreasing owing to considerable advances in the prevention and management of NVUGIB over the past 20 years, it remains a common clinical problem with an annual incidence of 67 per 100,000 individuals in the United States in 2012. NVUGIB is a medical emergency, and mortality is in the range 1-5%. After resuscitation and initial assessment, early (within 24 hours) diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy together with intragastric pH control with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) form the basis of treatment. With a growing ageing population treated with antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant medications, the clinical management of NVUGIB is complex as the risk between gastrointestinal bleeding events and adverse cardiovascular events needs to be balanced. The best clinical approach includes identification of risk factors and prevention of bleeding; available strategies include continuous treatment with PPIs or H. pylori eradication in those at increased risk of developing NVUGIB. Treatment with PPIs and/or use of cyclooxygenase-2-selective NSAIDs should be implemented in those patients at risk of NVUGIB who need NSAIDs and/or LDA.","output":"Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emotional distress (depression, anxiety, and PTS) and unhealthy lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet, limited physical activity, medication adherence) are common in hemorrhagic stroke (HS) survivors and may increase risk for recurrence, morbidity, and mortality. Emotional distress and unhealthy lifestyle factors tend to be interdependent between survivors and their informal caregivers (e.g., family and friends who provide unpaid care; together called dyads), such that one partners lifestyle and coping behaviors influence the others behaviors, yet no research has closely examined this relationship in HS dyads over time. We will conduct a mixed methods study to quantitatively and qualitatively understand the longitudinal relationship between emotional distress and lifestyle factors across time in this population (HS dyads) to identify treatment targets to prevent emotional distress chronicity and stroke recurrence. In aim 1, we will assess emotional distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTS) and lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet, limited physical activity medication adherence/blood pressure control) in dyads of survivors of HS and their caregivers (N = 80), at three separate time points (hospitalization in the Neuro-ICU, 1, and 3 months later). We hypothesize that 1) lifestyle factors and emotional distress will be interrelated within and across time for both survivors and caregivers, and 2) lifestyle factors and emotional distress will be interdependent between survivors and caregivers. We also aim to explore the nuanced interplay between lifestyle factors and emotional distress and gain in depth information on barriers and facilitators for a dyadic intervention to optimize lifestyle behaviors and emotional functioning in HS dyads. Eligible patients will be adults who have a caregiver also willing to participate. Patients will be referred for study participation by the nursing team who will ensure that they are cognitively able to meaningfully participate. Multilevel dyadic modeling (i.e., actor-partner interdependence model; APIM) with distinguishable dyads will be used to determine influences of these factors onto each other over time. In Aim 2, we will conduct live video qualitative dyadic interviews (N = 20 or until theme saturation) at all time points from the same participants with and without emotional distress and at least one lifestyle risk factor, to understand the nuanced relationships between emotional distress and lifestyle behaviors, and barriers and facilitators to engagement in a skills-based psychosocial intervention.

Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study, based on an online survey, collected demographic data and mental distress outcomes from 184 HCWs from May 1st, 2020, to June,15th, 2020, from 45 different countries. The degree of secondary traumatization was assessed using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS), the degrees of perceived stress and burnout were assessed with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk and protective factors for STS. Results: 184 HCWs (M=90; Age mean: 46.45; SD:11.02) completed the survey. A considerable proportion of HCWs had symptoms of secondary traumatic stress (41.3%), emotional exhaustion (56.0%), and depersonalization (48.9%). The prevalence of secondary traumatic stress in frontline HCWs was 47.5% while in HCWs working in other units it was 30.3% (p<.023); additionally, the prevalence of the same outcome was 67.1% for the HCWs exposed to patients' death and 32.9% for those HCWs which were not exposed to the same condition (p<.001). In stepwise multiple regression analysis, perceived stress, emotional exhaustion and exposure to patients' death remained as significant predictors in the final model for secondary traumatic stress (adjusted R2 =0.537, p<0.001).

We hypothesized that variations in the incidence of NEC were random, without clustering. In order to define the pattern of NEC in the United States, we analyzed the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database to evaluate whether NEC cases are distributed randomly or exhibit temporal clustering or periodicity. METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval, we queried the PHIS database for all patients with NEC (ICD-9 code of 777.5) over a 13-year period. Sixteen childrens hospitals were studied, and individual institutional and aggregate data were reviewed. Fishers Kappa and Bartletts KolmogorovCSmirnov tests were used to identify periodicity. RESULTS: During the study interval, there were 2,93,076 neonatal admissions, and 4,559 (1.6%) infants were diagnosed with NEC. Statistical analysis demonstrates a periodicity of 6 months in the occurrence of NEC. Fishers Kappa was 16.924 and Bartletts KolmogorovCSmirnov was 0.281, which translates to a P value of <0.0001.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted at multiple VA hospitals across southern California and Arizona. CAPA cases were identified in inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 based on microbiologic or serologic evidence of aspergillosis and pulmonary abnormalities on imaging, and were classified according to ECMM/ISHAM consensus definitions. Characteristics of interest included immunosuppressive/modulatory agents used prior to onset of CAPA, COVID-19 disease course, length of hospitalization, and mortality. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with probable (18%) or possible (82%) CAPA were identified from April 2020 to March 2021. Values below reported as medians. All patients were male and 13 (76%) were white, with age 74 years and BMI 26 kg/m(2). Baseline comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (47%), cardiovascular disease (65%), and pulmonary disease (71%). Evidence of aspergillosis was mostly based on respiratory culture, with mainly A. fumigatus (75%). Systemic corticosteroids were used in 14 patients, with a total dose of 400 mg prednisone equivalents starting 10 days prior to Aspergillus detection. Patients also received tocilizumab (18%), leflunomide (6%), tacrolimus (6%), mycophenolate (6%), and investigational agent LSALT or placebo (6%); 2 patients (12%) did not receive any immunosuppression/modulation. Length of hospitalization for COVID-19 was 22 days. Death occurred in 12 patients (71%), including all patients with probable CAPA, at 34 days after COVID-19 diagnosis and 16 days after CAPA diagnosis. Eight patients (47%) were treated for aspergillosis; mortality did not appear to differ with treatment (75% vs. 67%). Table 1. COVID-19 Inpatient Characteristics [Image: see text] Table 2. Incidence of Aspergillus Growth on Respiratory Culture [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: This case series reports high mortality among patients with CAPA; the primary contributor to this outcome is unclear. Frequency of lower respiratory tract sampling in patients with COVID-19 may have limited diagnosis of CAPA. Interestingly, inpatient respiratory cultures with Aspergillus spp. increased compared to previous years.

Our objective was to gain a better understanding of the spatial distribution of L. oryzophilus in Louisiana rice fields. Thirteen untreated commercial rice fields in Louisiana were mapped using GPS software, and surveyed for L. oryzophilus larvae over two years (2017 and 2018). An ANOVA, spatial interpolation, hotspot analysis, and multiple linear regression were used to determine where populations of L. oryzophilus were concentrated and whether distributions of the pest were related to edge effects. The results showed that L. oryzophilus larvae are typically aggregated along the edges of rice fields, with populations decreasing toward the center of rice fields. Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus densities were 3.3- and 2.2- fold greater along field edges than in field centers in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Hotspot spatial analysis revealed 59% and 32% of low-density clusters occurred at or near field centers, respectively. Multiple linear regression revealed larval densities decline with increasing distance from overwintering sites and alternative habitats (such as tree lines and levees containing bunch grasses and other alternative noncrop plants).

OBJECTIVES The anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic actions of Diclofenac were compared with apigenin-C-glycosides rich Clinacanthus nutans (CN) leaf extract in osteoporotic-osteoarthritis rats. METHODS Female Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into five groups (n = 6). Four groups were bilateral ovariectomised for osteoporosis development, and osteoarthritis were induced by intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) into the right knee joints. The Sham group was sham-operated, received saline injection and deionized drinking water. The treatment groups were orally given 200 or 400 mg extract/kg body weight or 5 mg diclofenac /kg body weight daily for 28 days. Articular cartilage and bone changes were monitored by gross and histological structures, micro-CT analysis, serum protein biomarkers, and mRNA expressions for inflammation and catabolic protease genes. RESULTS HPLC analysis confirmed that apigenin-C-glycosides (shaftoside, vitexin, and isovitexin) were the major compounds in the extract. The extract significantly and dose-dependently reduced cartilage erosion, bone loss, cartilage catabolic changes, serum osteoporotic-osteoarthritis biomarkers (procollagen-type-II-N-terminal-propeptide PIINP; procollagen-type-I-N-terminal-propeptide PINP; osteocalcin), inflammation (IL-1) and mRNA expressions for nuclear-factor-kappa-beta NF-ʦ, interleukin-1-beta IL-1, cyclooxygenase-2; and matrix-metalloproteinase-13 MMP13 activities, in osteoporotic-osteoarthritis rats comparable to Diclofenac.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the local spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Valencia, Spain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center epidemiological cohort study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 was performed at University General Hospital in Valencia (population in the hospital catchment area, 364 000), a tertiary hospital. The study included all consecutive patients with COVID-19 isolated at home from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic on February 19 until August 31, 2020. EXPOSURES: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the presence of IgM antibodies or a positive polymerase chain reaction test result on a nasopharyngeal swab were included. Cases in which patients with negative laboratory results met diagnostic and clinical criteria were also included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the characterization of dissemination patterns and connections among the 20 neighborhoods of Valencia during the outbreak. To recreate the transmission network, the inbound and outbound connections were studied for each region, and the relative risk of infection was estimated. RESULTS: In total, 2646 patients were included in the analysis. The mean (SD) age was 45.3 (22.5) years; 1203 (46%) were male and 1442 (54%) were female (data were missing for 1); and the overall mortality was 3.7%. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases was higher in neighborhoods with higher household income ((2) [for mean income per household] = 0.197; 95% CI, 0.057-0.351) and greater population density ((1) [inhabitants per km(2)] = 0.228; 95% CI, 0.085-0.387). Correlations with meteorological variables were not statistically significant. Neighborhood 3, where the hospital and testing facility were located, had the most outbound connections (14). A large residential complex close to the city (neighborhood 20) had the fewest connections (0 outbound and 2 inbound). Five geographically unconnected neighborhoods were of strategic importance in disrupting the transmission network. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study of local dissemination of SARS-COV-2 revealed nonevident transmission patterns between geographically unconnected areas. The results suggest that tailor-made containment measures could reduce transmission and that hospitals, including testing facilities, play a crucial role in disease transmission. Consequently, the local dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread might inform the strategic lockdown of specific neighborhoods to stop the contagion and avoid a citywide lockdown.","output":"Trends in Incidence and Transmission Patterns of COVID-19 in Valencia, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ex-utero regulation of the lungs' responses to breathing air and continued alveolar development shape adult respiratory health.

We studied humoral and B cell responses of 35 HC, 44 DP and 40 KTR. Markedly impaired anti-BNT162b2 responses were identified among KTR and DP compared to HC. In DP, the response was delayed (3-4 weeks after boost) and reduced with anti-S1 IgG and IgA positivity in 70.5% and 68.2%, respectively. In contrast, KTR did not develop IgG responses except one patient who had a prior unrecognized infection and developed anti-S1 IgG. The majority of antigen-specific B cells (RBD+) were identified in the plasmablast or post-switch memory B cell compartments in HC, whereas RBD+ B cells were enriched among pre-switch and na?ve B cells from DP and KTR. The frequency and absolute number of antigen-specific circulating plasmablasts in the cohort correlated with the Ig response, a characteristic not reported for other vaccinations. In conclusion, these data indicated that immunosuppression resulted in impaired protective immunity after mRNA vaccination, including Ig induction with corresponding generation of plasmablasts and memory B cells.

However, emerging research has identified novel mediators such as DPP9, TYK2, and CCR2, all playing a critical role in inflammation. We evaluated the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in peripheral leukocytes (n=469), jejunum (n=30), and colon (n=37) of three independent cohorts by real-time PCR, RNA-sequencing, and microarray transcriptomics. We also performed HPCL-MS/MS lipidomics and metabolomics analyses to identify signatures linked to SARS-CoV-2 receptors. We found markedly higher peripheral leukocytes ACE2 expression levels in women compared to men, whereas the intestinal expression of TMPRSS2 was positively associated with BMI. Consistent lipidomics signatures associated with the expression of these mediators were found in both tissues and peripheral leukocytes involving n-3 long-chain PUFAs and arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids, which play a key role in the regulation of inflammation and may interfere with viral entry and replication. Medium- and long-chain hydroxy acids, which have shown to interfere in viral replication, were also liked to SARS-CoV2 receptors.

We evaluated the impact of the lockdown in terms of healthcare provisions, physical health, mental health and social well-being within a multicentre cross-sectional study in India. METHODS: The SMART India study is an ongoing house-to-house survey conducted across 20 regions including 11 states and 1 union territory in India to study diabetes and its complications in the community. During the lockdown, we developed an online questionnaire and delivered it in English and seven popular Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Telegu, Kannada, Bengali, Malayalam) to random samples of SMART-India participants in two rounds from 5 May 2020 to 24 May 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the overall impact on health and healthcare provision in phases 3 and 4 of lockdown in red and non-red zones and their interactions. RESULTS: A total of 2003 participants completed this multicentre survey. The bivariate relationships between the outcomes and lockdown showed significant negative associations. In the multivariable analyses, the interactions between the red zones and lockdown showed that all five dimensions of healthcare provision were negatively affected (non-affordability: OR 1.917 (95% CI 1.126 to 3.264), non-accessibility: OR 2.458 (95% CI 1.549 to 3.902), inadequacy: OR 3.015 (95% CI 1.616 to 5.625), inappropriateness: OR 2.225 (95% CI 1.200 to 4.126) and discontinuity of care: OR 6.756 (95% CI 3.79 to 12.042)) and associated depression and social loneliness.

METHODS: We used mandatory notification data on SARS-CoV-2 cases in Germany and stratified by outbreak cases in hospitals and LTCFs. German vaccination coverage data were analysed. We studied the association of the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and outbreak cases with SARS-CoV-2 cases in Germany throughout the four pandemic waves. We built also counterfactual scenarios with the first pandemic wave as the baseline. FINDINGS: By 21 September 2021, there were 4,147,387 SARS-CoV-2 notified cases since March 2020. About 20% of these cases were reported as being related to an outbreak, with 1% of the cases in hospitals and 4% in LTCFs. The median number of outbreak cases in the different phases was smaller (5) in hospitals than in LTCFs (>10). In the first and second pandemic waves, we observed strong associations in both facility types between SARS-CoV-2 outbreak cases and total number of notified SARS-CoV-2 cases. However, during the third pandemic wave we observed a decline in outbreak cases in both facility types and only a weak association between outbreak cases and all cases.

We conducted 20 in-depth, face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with neonatologists. Data analysis followed the qualitative analysis guide of Leuven. RESULTS: The main principles guiding participants decision-making were EPIs best interest and respect for parents autonomy. Participants agreed that justice as resource allocation should not be considered in resuscitation decision-making. The main ethical challenge for participants was dealing with the conflict between EPIs best interest and respect for parents autonomy. This conflict was most prominent when parents and clinicians disagreed about births within the gray zone (24C25 weeks). Participants coping strategies included setting limits on extent of EPI care provided and rigidly following established guidelines. However, these strategies were not always feasible or successful. Although rare, these situations often led to long-lasting moral distress. CONCLUSIONS: Participants clinicalCethical reasoning for resuscitation of EPIs can be mainly characterized as an attempt to balance EPIs best interest and respect for parents autonomy. This approach could explain why neonatologists considered conflicts between these principles as their main ethical challenge and why lack of resolution increases the risk of moral distress.

The distribution of viral loads in individuals with and without symptoms remains uncertain. Comprehensive cross-sectional screening of all individuals in a given setting provides an unbiased way to assess viral loads independent of symptoms, which informs transmission risks. COVID-19 cases initially peaked in Massachusetts in mid-April 2020 before declining through June, and congregate living facilities were particularly affected during this early surge. We performed a retrospective analysis of data from a large public health-directed outbreak response initiative that involved comprehensive screening within nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts to compare nasopharyngeal (NP) viral loads (as measured by RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) levels) in residents and staff to inform our ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with or without symptoms in the population. Methods Between April 9 and June 9, 2020, we tested NP swabs from 32,480 unique individuals comprising staff and residents of the majority of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts. Under the direction of the MA Department of Public Health (MDPH), symptomatology at the time of sampling and demographic information was provided by each facility for each individual to facilitate reporting to health officials. NP swabs were collected, RNA extracted, and SARS-CoV-2 testing performed using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results The nursing home and assisted living facilities resident cohort (N =16,966) was 65% female with a mean age of 82 years (SD 13 yrs). The staff cohort (N = 15,514) was 76% female with a median age of 45 (SD 15 yrs). A total 2654 residents (15.5%) and 624 staff (4.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 12.7% of residents and 3.7% of staff without symptoms tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, compared to 53.1% of residents and 18.2% of staff with symptoms. Of the individuals who tested positive, 70.8% of residents and 92.4% of staff lacked symptoms at the time of testing. In aggregate, the distributions of Cts for viral probes used in the qRT-PCR assay were very similar, with a statistically but not meaningfully different mean ({triangleup}Ct 0.71 cycles, p = 0.006) and a similar range (12-38 cycles), between populations with and without symptoms over the entire time period, across all sub-categories examined (age, race, ethnicity, sex, resident/staff). Importantly, the Ct mean values and range were indistinguishable between the populations by symptom class during the peak of the outbreak in Massachusetts, with a Ct gap appearing only later in the survey period, reaching >3 cycles (p [] 0.001) for facilities sampled during the last two weeks of the study. Conclusions In a large cohort of individuals screened for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR, we found strikingly similar distributions of viral load in patients with or without symptoms at the time of testing during the local peak of the epidemic; as the epidemic waned, individuals without symptoms at the time of testing had lower viral loads. The size of the study population, including both staff and residents spanning a wide range of ages, provides a comprehensive cross-sectional point prevalence measurement of viral burden in a study spanning 2 months. Because the distributions of viral loads in infected individuals irrespective of symptomatology are very similar, existing testing modalities that have been validated for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in symptomatic patients should perform similarly in individuals without symptoms at the time of testing.","output":"Comparison of viral levels in individuals with or without symptoms at time of COVID-19 testing among 32,480 residents and staff of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Despite the World Health Organizations publication of different measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, new cases are reported daily These protective control measures put in place assumed that transmission of COVID-19 was mediated essentially through droplets released from the nasal and respiratory secretions of infected persons Recent scientific evidence however puts forward the occurrence and shedding of active COVID-19 virus in stools of infected persons The present study tested the acceptability of an improved version of the Yellow soup which contains ingredients/spices with known antibacterial/antiviral properties (Figure presented) Methods: Star Yellow was made by using a palm oil/limestone base to which was added spices /ingredients rich in zinc and known for their antiviral/antibacterial activity Sensory evaluation of the resulting mixture was done by a taste panel comprising habitual eaters of Yellow soup using a hedonic scale of 1 to 5 Results and Conclusion: Sensory assessment of Star Yellow showed a mean acceptability of 77 4% compared to 54 8% obtained for the commercial Yellow Soup served in restaurants This indicates the acceptable taste of Star Yellow and opens up potential new avenues of research in the control of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission via feces ?FFC 2020","output":"The acceptability of Star Yellow, a Cameroonian functional food that could curb the spread of the COVID-19 via feces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: As the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic developed there was a paucity of data relevant to people living with rheumatic disease. This led to the development of a global, online registry to meet these information needs. This manuscript provides a detailed description of the coronavirus disease 2019 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry development, governance structure, and data collection, and insights into new ways of rapidly establishing global research collaborations to meet urgent research needs. METHODS: We use previously published recommendations for best practices for registry implementation and describe the development of the Global Rheumatology Alliance registry in terms of these steps. We identify how and why these steps were adapted or modified. In Phase 1 of registry development, the purpose of the registry and key stakeholders were identified on online platforms, Twitter and Slack. Phase 2 consisted of protocol and data collection form development, team building and the implementation of governance and policies. RESULTS: All key steps of the registry development best practices framework were met, though with the need for adaptation in some areas. Outputs of the registry, two months after initial conception, are also described. CONCLUSION: The Global Rheumatology Alliance registry will provide highly useful, timely data to inform clinical care and identify further research priorities for people with rheumatic disease with coronavirus disease 2019. The formation of an international team, easily able to function in online environments and resulting in rapid deployment of a registry is a model that can be adapted for other disease states and future global collaborations.","output":"The COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance: evaluating the rapid design and implementation of an international registry against best practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have applied a computational strategy, using a combination of virtual screening, docking and molecular dynamics techniques, aimed at identifying possible lead compounds for the non-covalent inhibition of the main protease 3CLpro of the SARS-CoV2 Coronavirus.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the electrophysiology (EP) lab activity in a referral center in Iran during the COVID-19 era. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted on EP lab activity in Shahid Chamran Heart Center, Isfahan, Iran. Two periods of COVID-19 occurrence peaks in Iran were compared with same date in 2019. Information was collected on number of diagnostic and therapeutic electrophysiology studies (EPSs) and implantation of intracardiac devices such as permanent pacemaker (PPM), implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Results: In the first peak of COVID-19 pandemic, both of EPSs and intracardiac device implantations decreased by 80% compared to the same period in 2019. The most common type of device implanted during this period was PPM (70%);however, at the time of control, the ICD (73%) was the most common. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (PSVT) was the best indication for diagnostic and therapeutic EPSs in covid and control periods. In the second peak of prevalence of COVID-19 virus infection in Iran, 6% and 36% decreases in device implantations and EPSs were seen, respectively. During this period, the number of procedures increased, although it was still lower than in 2019.

To accurately assess this symptom burden, we developed a valid, reliable patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of C19 symptoms combined with a known measure of cancer symptom burden. Methods: Within the institutional initiative on COVID-19 and cancer named Data- Driven Determinants for COVID-19 Oncology Discovery Effort (D3CODE), patients with cancer and PCR-positive C19 tests were invited to participate in this longitudinal study after providing consent. Pts completed the EQ-5D-5L and the 13 symptom severity and 6 interference items of the core MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) plus 14 COVID-specific symptom items generated from literature and expert review. Items were measured on a 0-10 scale, 0 = none to 10 = worst imaginable symptom or interference. Demographic and disease information was collected. Psychometric procedures determined validity and reliability of the MDASI-COVID. Results: 600 pts enrolled, mean age 56.5y (range 20 to 91y). 59% female, 80% white. 78% solid tumors, 19% heme cancers. 12.5% required hospitalization for C19. Median number of days between positive C19 test and PRO completion was 17 days. Mean overall health rating on EQ-5D-5L was 78.3 (SD 19.6), best being 100. Highest mean (M) severity symptoms on the MDASI-COVID were fatigue (M 3.45, SD 2.17), drowsiness (M 2.50, SD 2.89), sleep disturbance (M 2.44, SD 2.99), malaise (M 2.37, SD 3.05), and distress (M 2.27, SD 2.90). Most severe ( 7) symptoms) reported were fatigue (21.3% of pts), change in taste (14.8%), change in smell (14.4%), malaise (14.3%), sleep disturbance (14.3%), and drowsiness (14%). Internal consistency (Cronbach ) of the 27 symptom items was 0.957, of the 6 interference items was 0.937. Mean severity of the 27 symptom items was significantly correlated with overall EQ-5D-5L health rating (correlation = -0.45, P &lt; 0.0005), demonstrating concurrent validity. Mean symptom severity and interference showed known-group validity between patients who required C19 hospitalization (symptom M 2.32, SD 2.09;interference M 3.29, SD 3.02) and those who did not (symptom M 1.69, SD 1.85;interference M 2.20, SD 2.64) (symptom P 0.007;interference P 0.004). Conclusions: We have validated a novel PRO, the MDASI-COVID, to quantify the combined symptom burden in patients with cancer and COVID-19. This measure allows longitudinal evaluation of COVID-19 on cancer symptom burden and provide clinicians with an accurate tool for ongoing symptom assessment and management.

The clinical characteristics, treatment regimen and duration of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients remain unclear in Ghana. METHODS: we retrospectively reviewed the secondary data of 307 discharged COVID-19 patients to characterize their demographics, clinical symptoms, treatment regimen given and duration of hospitalization. RESULTS: the mean age and temperature of the patients were 37.9 years and 36.3C, respectively. The majority (85.7%) of the cases reviewed were asymptomatic; for those presenting with symptoms, the main ones were cough (50%), fever (29.6%), headache (27.3%), and sore throat (22.7%). Comorbidities were present in 25.1% of the patients; the popularly reported comorbidities were hypertension (71.4%), asthma (7.8%) and diabetes (6.5%). The average duration of hospitalization was 13.8 days, and the duration of hospitalization for patients managed with azithromycin + chloroquine (AZ+CQ) was 10.4 days, followed closely by those managed with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) only, 11.0 days. There was longer duration of hospitalization among patients who received AZ only compared to patients receiving AZ + CQ (3.24  1.10 days, p=0.037; 95% CI 0.11, 6.37). Linear regression analysis showed that the duration of hospitalization for patients who received AZ only was 2.7 days, which was higher than that of patients who received AZ+CQ and HCQ only (95% CI 0.44, 4.93; p=0.019). CONCLUSION: in this cohort of COVID-19 patients, the common symptoms were cough, fever, headache, and sore throat.

In this work we show a simple strategy for short-term prediction of COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, that has proved very effective during the Italian outbreak in February to May 2020. Our approach is based on an optimal ensemble of two simple methods: a generalized linear mixed regression model, which pools information over different areas, and an area-specific nonstationary integer autoregressive methodology. Optimal weights are estimated using a leave-last-out rationale. The approach has been set up and validated during the first epidemic wave in Italy.

Estimating the expected impact of lockdown and exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. METHODS: We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in ?le-de-France to (i) assess the epidemic in the region, (ii) evaluate the impact of lockdown, and (iii) propose possible exit strategies and estimate their effectiveness. The model is calibrated to hospital admission data before lockdown. Interventions are modeled by reconstructing the associated changes in the contact matrices and informed by mobility reductions during lockdown evaluated from mobile phone data. Different types and durations of social distancing are simulated, including progressive and targeted strategies, with large-scale testing. RESULTS: We estimate the reproductive number at 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and at 0.68 [0.66, 0.69] during lockdown, thanks to an 81% reduction of the average number of contacts. Model predictions capture the disease dynamics during lockdown, showing the epidemic curve reaching ICU system capacity, largely strengthened during the emergency, and slowly decreasing. Results suggest that physical contacts outside households were largely avoided during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave overwhelming the healthcare system, if conditions return to normal. Extensive case finding and isolation are required for social distancing strategies to gradually relax lockdown constraints. CONCLUSIONS: As France experiences the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity.

However, the stair-case artifacts of Total variation (TV) based ones have restricted the usage of the reconstructed images. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to propose and test an accurate and efficient algorithm to improve reconstruction quality under the idea of synergy between local and nonlocal regularizations. METHODS: The total variation combining the nonlocal means filtration is proposed and the alternating direction method of multipliers is utilized to develop an efficient algorithm. The first order approximation of linear expansion at intermediate point is applied to overcome the computation of the huge CT system matrix. RESULTS: The proposed method improves root mean squared error by 25.6% compared to the recent block-matching sparsity regularization (BMSR) on simulation dataset of 19 views. The structure similarities of image of the new method is higher than 0.95, while that of BMSR is about 0.92. Moreover, on real rabbit dataset of 20 views, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the new method is 36.84, while using other methods PSNR are lower than 35.81.

It adapts the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) and the quantile regression techniques to effectively exploit the non-linear estimates of the data in order to derive non-biased point estimates at each quantile and make interquantile comparisons. This is particularly useful in recommending which societal variables become most significant at catastrophic levels of a pandemic like COVID-19 when existing health systems become overwhelmed. These estimators are applied to panel data for 196 countries over days of infection from the first recorded case. The COVID-19-related data is from Our World in Data, and the socio-economic variables are from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. The results establish that an improved adequate health infrastructure for both testing and treatment is necessary, but not sufficient. Health systems ultimately become overwhelmed and ineffective in managing cases and reducing mortality in the face of the rising pandemic. Complementary social, economic, physical and environmental factors are necessary for curbing deaths. These factors relate to improving the health stock of the population through reductions in both communicable and non-communicable comorbidities; enhancing sanitation and hygiene; and improving the nutrition of the population. Socio-economic and environmental measures are the reduction of household and ambient air pollution; reduction of exposure to alcohol and cigarettes; reduction of poverty and ensuring economic inclusion; and learning from the past to fine-tune governments' control measures in order to minimize harm to the population while effectively curbing mortality.","output":"Socio-economic determinants of global COVID-19 mortalities: policy lessons for current and future pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for the infectious disease caused by coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).

Health literacy, such as infectious-disease-specific health literacy, is associated with anxiety, but the mechanism of such association is not clear. This study explored the relationship between infectious-disease-specific health literacy and anxiety. METHODS: We conducted an online survey in Hubei province, the early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1038 COVID-19-negative participants accomplished a battery of online survey tools determining their sociodemographic characteristics, perceived risk of acquiring COVID-19, infectious-disease-specific health literacy, resilience, and anxiety symptoms. We examined the moderated mediation models, in which the mediator was resilience and the moderator was gender. RESULTS: Most (63%) of the study participants experienced at least mild anxiety. The indirect effect of infectious-disease-specific health literacy on anxiety through resilience was ?0.282 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [?0.511, ?0.083]), contributing to 32.7% of the total effect of health literacy on anxiety. Resilience fully mediated the association. The mediation effect of resilience tended to be stronger for the male participants than for the female participants as the moderation effect of gender remained until we included perceived risk of acquiring COVID-19 in the model. CONCLUSION: Resilience was found to mediate the association between infectious-disease-specific health literacy and anxiety. Individuals with good infectious-disease-specific health literacy are more likely to acquire higher resilience, which may in turn decrease their anxiety level. Males may benefit more from the mediation effect of resilience during the current pandemic.

The \\"DEC-RSV\\" study was a multi-centre, prospective, observational study in children under 2 years presenting with viral respiratory symptoms. A nasopharyngeal aspirate sample was tested using the point-of-care test and standard laboratory-based procedures. The primary outcome was accuracy of respiratory syncytial virus detection. The cost implications of adopting a point-of-care test were modelled using study data. A total of 186 participants were recruited, with both tests performed on 177 samples. The point-of-care test was invalid for 16 samples (diagnostic yield 91%) leaving 161 available for primary analysis. After resolving discrepancies, the cobas? Liat? respiratory syncytial virus test had 100.00% (95% CI 96.07%-100.00%) sensitivity and 98.53% (95% CI 92.08%-99.96%) specificity. Median time to result was 0.6 h (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5-1) for point-of-care testing and 28.9 h (IQR 26.3-48.1) for standard laboratory testing. Estimated non-diagnostic cost savings for 1000 patients, based on isolation decision-making on point-of-care test result, were 57 010, which would increase to 94 847 when cohort nursing is used. In young children the cobas? Liat? point-of-care respiratory syncytial virus test has high diagnostic accuracy using nasopharyngeal aspirates (currently an off-licence sample type). Time to result is clinically important and was favourable compared to laboratory-based testing.

There is limited evidence about the effect of this change in behavior on women's health. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis, treatment and complications of women presenting with a tubal Ectopic Pregnancy (EP). STUDY DESIGN: This is a single centre retrospective cohort study. We compared the clinical presentation, treatment modalities and complications of all women presenting in our institution with a tubal EP during the COVID-19 pandemic between 15 March and 15 June 2020, with women who were treated in our institution with the same diagnosis in the corresponding period for the years 2018C2019. RESULTS: The study group included 19 cases of EP (N = 19) that were treated between the 15 March 2020 and 15 June 2020. The control group included 30 cases of EP (N = 30) that were admitted to in the corresponding period during 2018 and 2019. Maternal age, parity, gravity and mode of conception (natural vs. assisted) were similar between the two groups. There was no difference in the mean gestational age (GA) according to the last menstrual period. In the study group more women presented with sonographic evaluation of high fluid volume in the abdomen than in the control group (53 % vs 17 %, P value 0.01). This finding is correlated with a more advanced disease status. In the study group there was a highly statistically significant 3-fold increase in rupture among cases (P < 0.005) and a 4-fold larger volume of blood in the entrance to the abdomen (P < 0.002). We found that there were no cases of ruptured EP in the group of women who were pregnant after assisted reproduction. CONCLUSION: We found a higher rate of ruptured ectopic pregnancies in our institution during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The brief analysis reveals that agricultural access to bulk ocean freight, rail movement, and trucking has generally improved in the pandemic, bolstered by the reduced demand for these transportation services by other sectors of the economy. The intermodal containerized movement of grains and food products has seen some disruption from the lack of empty containers in North America. The widespread consumer adoption of physical distancing measures has vastly increased the demand for retail food pickup and delivery services to the point where these services are being rationed by long wait times. From a policy perspective, there is an apparent need for (a) continued supply chain monitoring and industry engagement, (b) the proactive development of strategies to deal with absenteeism and other potential threats to the supply chain, and (c) an assessment of the economic and health merits of providing additional public resources to provide greater access to grocery pickup and delivery services.","output":"Agriculture, transportation, and the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the outdoor air pollutants that are major factors in diseases, causing especially adverse respiratory effects in humans.

The present literature review was aimed at assessing the potential effects of air pollutants on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections. We have reviewed the scientific literature regarding the association of outdoor air pollution and respiratory viruses on respiratory diseases. Evidence supports a clear association between air concentrations of some pollutants and human respiratory viruses interacting to adversely affect the respiratory system. Given the undoubted importance and topicality of the subject, we have paid special attention to the association between air pollutants and the transmission and severity of the effects caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19. Although to date, and by obvious reasons, the number of studies on this issue are still scarce, most results indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants delays/complicates recovery of patients of COVID-19 and leads to more severe and lethal forms of this disease.

We use the C19 ISWS Greek dataset to examine self-reported depression in relation to alcohol and tobacco use, social contacts, relationship status and perceived risk of infection. Methods Online survey data was collected between May-June 2020. Eligible participants were higher education students in Greece and 889 students participated. We performed frequency analysis on the participants who completed the questionnaire (N = 585). Weights were applied to eliminate response bias and adjust the sample survey means and proportions to the student population in the country. Results Findings suggest that depressive symptoms are more frequent among female students, first generation migrant students and those in their first year of study. Students who were anxious about getting infected with COVID-19 reported higher rates of depressive symptoms. However, students with slightly higher rates of depression were not very worried about getting severely ill from an infection. The share of students who drunk systematically did not change during the COVID-19 outbreak, their rate is low (0% - 2.2%) and they do not report high rates of depressive symptoms. Depression scores seem to be affected by relationship status, the degree of contacts with friends, and the availability of a trusted person. Results indicate that the fewer the contacts with friends are, the higher the mean depression score is. Conclusions The results confirm the gender-gap in depression and are in line with evidence indicating the high prevalence of depression among women in Greece in the aftermath of austerity and recession. As Greece was one of the South-European countries hardest hit by economic crisis, it is possible that negative effects of the crisis have had a cumulative effect on students' mental health in the pandemic.","output":"Depression among higher education students in Greece during the first C19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein microbicides containing neutralizing antibodies and antiviral lectins may help to reduce the rate of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) if it is possible to manufacture the components in large quantities at a cost affordable in HIV\\\\endemic regions such as sub\\\\Saharan Africa.

The COVID-19 pandemic, like a natural disaster, brought uncertainties and instability to the economic development of the society and social distancing, which might lead to child maltreatment. This study aims to investigate whether job loss, income reduction and parenting affect child maltreatment. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 600 randomly sampled parents aged 18 years or older who had and lived with a child under 10 years old in Hong Kong between 29 May to 16 June 2020. Participants were recruited from a random list of mobile phone numbers of a panel of parents. Of 779 recruited target parents, 600 parents completed the survey successfully via a web-based system after obtaining their online consent for participating in the survey. Results: Income reduction was found significantly associated with severe (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.06, 10.25) and very severe physical assaults (OR = 7.69, 95% CI = 2.24, 26.41) towards children. Job loss or large income reduction were also significantly associated with severe (OR= 3.68, 95% CI = 1.33, 10.19) and very severe physical assaults (OR = 4.05, 95% CI = 1.17, 14.08) towards children. However, income reduction (OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.15, 0.53) and job loss (OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.28, 0.76) were significantly associated with less psychological aggression. Exposure to intimate partner violence between parents is a very strong and significant factor associated with all types of child maltreatment. Having higher levels of difficulty in discussing COVID-19 with children was significantly associated with more corporal punishment (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.34), whereas having higher level of confidence in managing preventive COVID-19 behaviors with children was negatively associated with corporal punishment (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.76, 0.99) and very severe physical assaults (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58, 0.93).

In Germany, a minimum volume threshold of 50 TKAs/hospital/year was implemented to ensure outcome quality. This study, embedded within a systematic review, aimed to investigate the perspectives of potential TKA patients on the hospital volume-outcome relationship for TKA (higher volumes associated with better outcomes). METHODS: A convenience sample of adults with knee problems and heterogeneous demographic characteristics participated in the study. Qualitative data were collected during a focus group prior to the systematic review (n = 5) and during telephone interviews, in which preliminary results of the systematic review were discussed (n = 16). The data were synthesised using content analysis. RESULTS: All participants (n = 21) believed that a hospital volume-outcome relationship exists for TKA while recognising that patient behaviour or the surgeon could also influence outcomes. All participants would be willing to travel longer for better outcomes. Most interviewees would choose a hospital for TKA depending on reputation, recommendations, and service quality. However, some would also choose a hospital based on the results of the systematic review that showed slightly lower mortality/revision rates at higher-volume hospitals. Half of the interviewees supported raising the minimum volume threshold even if this were to increase travel time to receive TKA. CONCLUSIONS: Potential patients believe that a hospital volume-outcome relationship exists for TKA. Hospital preference is based mainly on subjective factors, although some potential patients would consider scientific evidence when making their choice. Policy makers and physicians should consider the patient perspectives when deciding on minimum volume thresholds or recommending hospitals for TKA, respectively.

Here we show that clofazimine-an anti-leprosy drug with a favourable safety profile3-possesses inhibitory activity against several coronaviruses, and can antagonize the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV in a range of in vitro systems. We found that this molecule, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, inhibits cell fusion mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein, as well as activity of the viral helicase. Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of clofazimine in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis led to reduced viral loads in the lung and viral shedding in faeces, and also alleviated the inflammation associated with viral infection. Combinations of clofazimine and remdesivir exhibited antiviral synergy in vitro and in vivo, and restricted viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract. Clofazimine, which is orally bioavailable and comparatively cheap to manufacture, is an attractive clinical candidate for the treatment of outpatients and-when combined with remdesivir-in therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, particularly in contexts in which costs are an important factor or specialized medical facilities are limited.

A two-stage triage pathway was used to prioritise lower gastrointestinal (LGI) endoscopy for suspected CRC during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: All patients referred for an LGI endoscopy via a 2ww referral pathway between March 2020 and July 2020 were assessed. The first stage triaged patients to high, standard or low risk of CRC based on symptoms and faecal immunochemical test (FIT), and offered CT scans to those at high risk. The second stage, endoscopy prioritisation (EP), incorporated the CT results, FIT and symptoms to triage into four groups, EP1CEP4; with EP1 being the most urgent and EP4 the least. The primary outcome measure was CRC detection. RESULTS: 514 patients were included. The risk of CRC was triaged as high in 190/514 patients (37%), standard in 274/514 patients (53%) and low in 50/514 (10%) patients. 422/514 patients (82%) underwent endoscopy with triage to EP1 in 52/422 (12%), EP2 in 105/422 (25%), EP3 in 210/422 (50%) and EP4 in 55/422 (13%). CRC was detected in 23 patients (5.4%). CRC was significantly more frequent in the EP1 group (23.1%, relative risk (RR)=16.2) and EP2 group (6.7%, RR=4.7) compared with EP3 group (1.4%). All CRC lesions were identified by CT imaging when performed prior to LGI endoscopy. CONCLUSION: This triage pathway designated 83% of patients with CRC to either EP1 or EP2.

It is not clear how prefrontal TMS affects pain perception, but previous findings suggest that ventral lateral and medial prefrontal circuits may comprise an important part of a circuit of perceived controllability regarding pain, stress, and learned helplessness. Although the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is a common TMS target for treating clinical depression as well as modulating pain, little is known about whether TMS over this area may affect perceived controllability. The present study explored the immediate effects of fast TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on the analgesic effects of perceived pain controllability. Twenty-four healthy volunteers underwent a laboratory pain task designed to manipulate perception of pain controllability. Real TMS, compared with sham, suppressed the analgesic benefits of perceived control on the emotional dimension of pain, but not the sensory/discriminatory dimension. Findings suggest that, at least acutely, fast TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may interrupt the perceived-controllability effect on the emotional dimension of pain experience. Although it is not clear whether this cortical area is directly involved with modulating perceived controllability or whether downstream effects are responsible for the present findings, it appears possible that left dorsolateral prefrontal TMS may produce analgesic effects by acting through a cortical perceived-control circuit regulating limbic and brainstem areas of the pain circuit. Despite evidence that prefrontal TMS can have analgesic effects, fast left prefrontal TMS appears to acutely suppress analgesia associated with perceived-control. This effect may be limited to the emotional dimension of pain experience.","output":"Fast left prefrontal rTMS acutely suppresses analgesic effects of perceived controllability on the emotional component of pain experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare their outcome with case matched controls from the pre-pandemic phase.

Results The total number of patients matched in each arm was 118. The length of hospital stay (8 days versus 5 days, p<0.001), transit time from emergency room to operation room (150 minutes versus 97 minutes, p=0.271), anesthesia induction time (75 minutes versus 45 minutes, p=0.002) and operative duration (275 minutes versus 180 minutes, p=0.002) were longer in Arm-A.

However, the application of these approaches in hospitals and the impact of a pandemic shock remain largely unknown. This paper aims to assess hospital purchasers' procurement strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of factor-market rivalry (FMR) on strategies and the effectiveness of purchasing portfolio categorizations in this situation. Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative study of hospital purchasing in the Netherlands is supported by secondary data from official government publications. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 hospital purchasers at large hospitals. An interpretative approach is used to analyze the interviews and present the results. Findings - The findings reveal that product scarcity forces purchasers to treat them as (temporary) bottleneck items at the hospital level. The strategies adopted largely aligned with expected behavior based on Kraljic's commodity management model. Adding the FMR perspective to the model helped to further cluster crisis strategies into meaningful categories. Besides inventory management, increasing supply, reducing demand and increasing resource coordination were the other common strategies. An important finding is that purchasers and governments serve as gatekeepers in channeling FMR, thereby reducing potential harmful competition between and within hospitals. Social implications - The devastating experience of the COVID-19 pandemic is unveiling critics' weaknesses of public health-care provision in times of Crisis. This study assesses the strategies hospital purchasers apply to counteract shortages in the supply chain. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of gatekeepers in times of crisis and present strategies purchases can take to assure the supply of resources. Originality/value - No research has been conducted on purchasing portfolio models and FMR implications for hospitals during pandemics. Therefore, the authors offer several insights: increasing the supply risk creates temporary bottleneck strategies, letting purchasers adopt a short-terse perspetive and emphasizing the high mobility of commodities in the Kraljic commodity matrix. Additionally, despite more collaboration uncovered in other studies regarding COVID-19, strong rivalry arose at the beginning of the pandemic, leading to increased competition and less collaboration. Given such increased FMR, procurement managers and governments become important gatekeepers to balance resource allocation during pandemics both within and between hospitals.","output":"A Kraljic and competitive rivalry perspective on hospital procurement during a pandemic (COVID-19): a Dutch case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study was performed to develop Near-infrared spectroscopy based prediction method for the quantification of the maize flour adulteration in chickpea flour.

This study integrated liver function data and ILs data in patients with COVID-19 and found that liver injury and two ILs, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were closely related to the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. This study may give more exact information to clinicians about the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. In addition, this correlational study between liver disorder and ILs may provide a new vision to diagnosis and treatment in patients.","output":"Liver Injury and Elevated Levels of Interleukins, Interleukin-2 Receptor, and Interleukin-6 Predict the Severity in Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to analyse the effects of the use of educational platforms and student academic stress generated during periods of social confinement by COVID-19.

METHODS: A total of 45 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples and 12 peripheral venous blood samples from patients with retinoblastoma (RB) confirmed by pathological examination at Beijing Tongren Hospital were collected between May 2019 and May 2021. DNA from the samples was extracted, sequenced, and analyzed to detect the mutations in the RB1 gene by designing the targeted capture probes for exons and the flanking sequences of the gene. RESULTS: Of the 45 FFPE tissue samples, 23 were from male patients and 22 were from female patients, all aged between 4 months and 10 years, with an average age of 2.5  1.3 years. Two of these patients had bilateral RB and 43 had unilateral RB (23 in the right eye and 20 in the left eye). Of the 12 peripheral venous blood samples, 7 were from male patients and 5 were from female patients, all aged between 8 months and 4 years, with an average age of 1.3  0.9 years. Two of these patients had bilateral RB and 10 had unilateral RB (8 in the right eye and 2 in the left eye). Three de novo pathogenic mutations were found in the FFPE tissues, along with one de novo potentially pathogenic mutation, while three de novo potentially pathogenic mutations were found in the blood samples. CONCLUSION: Gene capture is a low-cost and efficient method for the gene sequencing of RB. A total of seven de novo mutations were identified through mutation testing of the pathogenic gene RB1 in 56 pediatric patients with RB. This complemented the mutation spectrum of the RB1 gene and helped to improve the molecular diagnosis of RB, thereby providing a basis for genetic counseling and prediction of the clinical phenotype, as well as for the genetic testing of the offspring of patients with RB.

A multi-center, retrospective cross-sectional study was initiated to describe the demographic data, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19 cases across all the regions of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The analysis included all laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 patients from the 1st of March 2020 to 31st of March 2020 across all regions of Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, incubation periods, laboratory findings, and patient outcomes data were retrieved from 1519 cases in the Health Electronic Surveillance Network Database. RESULTS: The median age was 36 years and 54.3% (n = 825) of the patients were men. Patients working in health care facilities represented 12.5% of the cases (n = 190) and 9.3% of cases were asymptomatic. The median incubation period was 6 days. The most common symptoms were cough (89.4%), fever (85.6%), and sore throat (81.6%); 20.1% of the patients had underlying comorbidities. Hypertension was seen in 8.8% and diabetes in 7.6% of all the cases. The percentage of cases with temperatures >38?C was 20.3% (n = 129), and 1.6% of patients had heart rates &#8805;125 beats/min and 4.7% of them had respiratory rates of >24 breaths/min.

As such, an aggressive initial innate immune response favors the host in contrast to a detrimental prolonged inflammation. The complement pathway bridges innate and adaptive immune system and contributes to the response by directly clearing pathogens or infected cells, as well as recruiting proinflammatory immune cells and regulating inflammation. However, the impact of modulating complement activation in viral infections is still unclear. In this work, we targeted the complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), a surface protein that protects cells from non-specific complement attack, and analyzed its role in IAV infections. We found that DAF modulates IAV infection in vivo, via an interplay with the antigenic viral proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), in a strain specific manner. Our results reveal that, contrary to what could be expected, DAF potentiates complement activation, increasing the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes and T cells. We also show that viral NA acts on the heavily sialylated DAF and propose that the NA-dependent DAF removal of sialic acids exacerbates complement activation, leading to lung immunopathology. Remarkably, this mechanism has no impact on viral loads, but rather on the host resilience to infection, and may have direct implications in zoonotic influenza transmissions.","output":"Complement Decay-Accelerating Factor is a modulator of influenza A virus lung immunopathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The paper aims to disentangle the factors behind territorial disparities in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case fatality ratio, focusing on the pressure put by the pandemic on healthcare services and adopting a spatial perspective.

The authors proved that this approach yields better results, and the MGWR model outperforms traditional regression methods. The selected case studies are two of the biggest UE countries, among the first affected by a high incidence of COVID-19 cases, namely Italy and Germany. Findings: The authors found sizeable regional differences in COVID-19 mortality rates within each of the analysed countries, and the stress borne by local healthcare systems seems to be the most powerful factor in explaining them. In line with other studies, the authors found additional factors of influence, such as age distribution, gender ratio, population density and regional development.

MAIN CONTENT: The diagnosis of this disease is daunting and challenging as it is dependent on emerging clinical symptomatology that continues to increase and change very rapidly. The definitive test is the very expensive and scarce polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral identification technique. The management has remained largely supportive and empirical, as there are no officially approved therapeutic agents, vaccines or antiviral medications for the management of the disease. Severe cases often require intensive care facilities and personnel. Yet there is paucity of facilities including the personnel required for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is against this backdrop that a review of key published reports on the pandemic in SSA and globally is made, as understanding the natural history of a disease and the documented responses to diagnosis and management is usually a key public health strategy for designing and improving as appropriate, relevant interventions. Lead findings were that responses by most nations of SSA were adhoc, paucity of public health awareness strategies and absence of legislations that would help enforce preventive measures, as well as limited facilities (including personal protective equipment) and institutional capacities to deliver needed interventions.

The study's aim is to characterize learning assessment proposals designed, at the beginning of the lockdown, by graduate and postgraduate health sciences teachers. These proposals were developed in the context of a University Institute teacher-training program on virtualizing education. By using a qualitative approach, this descriptive-interpretative study characterizes 51 remote learning assessment proposals made by teachers taking the course. In order to construct interpretative hypotheses, a matrix for their categorization was created to identify the prevalence of pedagogical traits in the designs. An array of different proposals were evidenced, most of which were to assess learning with the intention of certifying knowledge. Individual learning assessments prevailed, mostly favoring an active use of knowledge associated with academic and professional practices. A high percentage of teachers planned asynchronous activities by means of writing and the use of a broad array of digital tools. They also prioritized teacher interventions during the assessment process as a scaffolding for the students. Finally, there was a systematization of the emerging characteristics that structured the designs of remote learning assessment proposals. This provides an input toward reflecting on assessment practices in the context of remote teaching. We hope this contribution transcends the current scenario and helps identify potentials for the development of hybrid assessment practices in post pandemic times.","output":"Evaluacin Remota de Aprendizajes en la Universidad: decisiones docentes para encarar un nuevo desafo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (CoVID-19) has impacted all aspects of urologic training.

COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children. However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease management and navigating through this crisis.","output":"Post-COVID-19 Outbreak of Severe Kawasaki-like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data has become a precious resource, and Twitter is one of the most important sources.

However, although not all abnormalities on TTE result in changes in clinical management, performing TTE in recently infected patients increases disease transmission risks. It remains unknown whether common biomarker tests, such as troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), can help distinguish in which patients with COVID-19 TTE may be safely delayed until infection risks subside. METHODS: Using electronic health records data and chart review, the authors retrospectively studied all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a multisite health care system from March 1, 2020, to January 15, 2021, who underwent TTE within 14 days of their first positive COVID-19 result and had BNP and troponin measured before or within 7 days of TTE. The primary outcome was the presence of one or more urgent echocardiographic findings, defined as left ventricular ejection fraction &#8804; 35%, wall motion score index &#8805; 1.5, moderate or greater right ventricular dysfunction, moderate or greater pericardial effusion, intracardiac thrombus, pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 50 mm Hg, or at least moderate to severe valvular disease. Stepwise logistic regression was conducted to determine biomarkers and comorbidities associated with the outcome. The performance of a rule for classifying TTE using troponin and BNP was evaluated. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-four hospitalized and 151 intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 were included. Urgent findings on TTE were present in 105 patients (24.2%). Troponin and BNP were abnormal in 311 (71.7%). Heart failure (odds ratio, 5.41; 95% CI, 2.61-11.68), troponin > 0.04 ng/mL (odds ratio, 4.40; 95% CI, 2.05-10.05), and BNP > 100 pg/mL (odds ratio, 5.85; 95% CI, 2.35-16.09) remained significant predictors of urgent findings on TTE after stepwise selection. No urgent findings on TTE were seen in 95.1% of all patients and in 91.3% of intensive care unit patients with normal troponin and BNP. CONCLUSIONS: Troponin and BNP were highly associated with urgent echocardiographic findings and may be used in triaging algorithms for determining in which patients TTE can be safely delayed until after their peak infectious window has passed.","output":"Determining Which Hospitalized Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients Require Urgent Echocardiography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to analyse the clinical course of COVID-19 in 300 infants, selected from 1283 children diagnosed with COVID-19 between March and December 2020, registered in the SARSTerPED multicenter database.

At diagnosis, the most common symptoms were fever in 77% of the children, cough in 40%, catarrh in 37%. Pneumonia associated with COVID-19 was diagnosed in 23% of the children, and gastrointestinal symptoms in 31.3%. In 52% of the infants, elevated levels of D-dimers were observed, and in 40%, elevated levels of IL-6 serum concentration were observed. During the second wave of the pandemic, 6 times more infants were hospitalized, and the children were statistically significantly younger compared to the patients during the first wave (3 months vs 8 months, p < 0.0001 respectively). During the second wave, the infants were hospitalized for longer. COVID-19 in infants usually manifests as a mild gastrointestinal or respiratory infection, but pneumonia is also observed with falls in oxygen saturation, requiring oxygen therapy. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in infants infected with SARS-CoV-2, and infant appetite disorders may lead to hospitalization.

Consequently, different countries have reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak, but a uniform global response is necessary for tackling the pandemic. Managing the present or future COVID-19 outbreaks is not impossible but surely difficult. Barring the live-animal trade at the markets; revising the regulations and rules of customs, import or export across borders; supporting and expediting projects to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs; immediate quarantine of the involved regions; and also producing and supplying a large number of protective facemasks and preventing its stockpiling or smuggling are the main actions suggested to deal with the present or a forthcoming COVID-19 outbreaks.

Unfortunately, recent studies have found that DL models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which manipulate models into making incorrect predictions with high confidence. There is a need for better understanding of how adversarial attacks impact the predictive ability of DL models in the medical image domain. Methods: We studied the adversarial attack susceptibility of DL models for three common imaging tasks within oncology. We investigated how PGD adversarial training could be employed to increase model robustness against FGSM, PGD, and BIM attacks. Finally, we studied the utility of adversarial sensitivity as a metric to improve model performance. Results: Our experiments showed that medical DL models were highly sensitive to adversarial attacks, as visually imperceptible degrees of perturbation (<0.004) were sufficient to deceive the model the majority of the time. DL models for medical images were more vulnerable to adversarial attacks compared to DL models for non-medical images. Adversarial training increased model performance on adversarial samples for all classification tasks. We were able to increase model accuracy on clean images for all datasets by excluding images most vulnerable to adversarial perturbation. Conclusion: Our results indicated that while medical DL systems are extremely susceptible to adversarial attacks, adversarial training show promise as an effective defense against attacks. Adversarial susceptibility of individual images can be used to increase model performance by identifying images most at-risk for misclassification. Our findings provide a useful basis for designing more robust and accurate medical DL models as well as techniques to defend models from adversarial attack.","output":"Adversarial Attack Vulnerability of Deep Learning Models for Oncologic Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To understand the sleep quality and psychological status of officers and soldiers in naval force stationed in Hubei, China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, and to explore the influencing factors, so as to maintain the physical and mental health of officers and soldiers during the epidemic. Methods Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scale, patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) and impact of event scale-revised (IES-R) were used to evaluate the sleep and psychological status of officers and soldiers in a naval force stationed in Hubei province. Results A total of 238 questionnaires were sent out, and 232 valid questionnaires were collected, with an effective rate of 97.5%. The median score of PSQI scale was 2.00 (1.00, 5.00), and poor and very poor sleep qualities accounted for 5.6% (13/232) and 0.9% (2/232), respectively. The median score of PHQ-9 was 0.00 (0.00, 2.00), and mild, moderate and severe depression accounted for 12.1% (28/232), 0.9% (2/232) and 0.4% (1/232), respectively.

According to the domain knowledge of screening chest X-rays, the pathological information usually lay on the lung and heart regions. However, it is costly to acquire region-level annotation in practice, and model training mainly relies on image-level class labels in a weakly supervised manner, which is highly challenging for computer-aided chest X-ray screening. To address this issue, some methods have been proposed recently to identify local regions containing pathological information, which is vital for thoracic disease classification. Inspired by this, we propose a novel deep learning framework to explore discriminative information from lung and heart regions. RESULT We design a feature extractor equipped with a multi-scale attention module to learn global attention maps from global images. To exploit disease-specific cues effectively, we locate lung and heart regions containing pathological information by a well-trained pixel-wise segmentation model to generate binarization masks. By introducing element-wise logical AND operator on the learned global attention maps and the binarization masks, we obtain local attention maps in which pixels are are 1 for lung and heart region and 0 for other regions. By zeroing features of non-lung and heart regions in attention maps, we can effectively exploit their disease-specific cues in lung and heart regions. Compared to existing methods fusing global and local features, we adopt feature weighting to avoid weakening visual cues unique to lung and heart regions. Our method with pixel-wise segmentation can help overcome the deviation of locating local regions. Evaluated by the benchmark split on the publicly available chest X-ray14 dataset, the comprehensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. CONCLUSION We propose a novel deep framework for the multi-label classification of thoracic diseases in chest X-ray images. The proposed network aims to effectively exploit pathological regions containing the main cues for chest X-ray screening. Our proposed network has been used in clinic screening to assist the radiologists. Chest X-ray accounts for a significant proportion of radiological examinations.

However, there is much practice variation which could be explained by good practices: practices developed by local health care professionals, which are not evidence-based. Because an overview of good practices is lacking, we performed a scoping review to identify and summarize the available good practices for dialysis education, treatment, and eHealth. METHODS: Embase, Pubmed, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL databases and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles using all synonyms for the words kidney failure, dialysis, and good practice. Relevant articles were structured according to the categories dialysis education, dialysis treatment or eHealth, and assessed for content and results. RESULTS: Nineteen articles (12 for dialysis education, 3 for dialysis treatment, 4 for eHealth) are identified. The good practices for education endorse the importance of providing complete and objective predialysis education, assisting peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in adequately performing PD, educating hemodialysis (HD) patients on self-management, and talking with dialysis patients about their prognosis. The good practices for dialysis treatment focus mainly on dialysis access devices and general quality improvement of dialysis care. Finally, eHealth is useful for HD and PD and affects both quality of care and health-related quality of life. CONCLUSION: Our scoping review identifies 19 articles describing good practices and their results for dialysis education, dialysis treatment, and eHealth.

However, in terms of overall percentages, the releases have been less significant. In India, prisons are overcrowded with nearly 70% under trials. With very poor sanitation and healthcare facilities, there are numerous deaths in custody due to various illnesses, including heart, lung, liver and kidney-related ailments as well as HIV, tuberculosis and cancer. It is in this context that the need to take urgent steps to contain the spread of the contagion inside prisons became apparent to the prison authorities around the time the national lockdown was announced by the Government of India. Some of the measures taken by prison departments include creation of temporary prisons to admit new prisoners and keep them in quarantine for 14 days before transferring them to the regular prisons, transfer of prisoners from congested prisons to less crowded prisons, making prisoners aware of the virus, setting up Corona care centres inside or outside prisons, etc. While prison authorities claim that they were taking necessary preventive steps within existing limitations, there has been some criticism of the inadequacy of these measures and the conditions inside prisons. The Supreme Court of India took suo moto cognizance of the issue and asked state governments to constitute a High Powered Committees to identify categories of prisoners who could be released. The article highlights that the criteria for release was based on the purported seriousness of the offence rather than vulnerability to getting infected. Also, the absence of gender disaggregated data on release of prisoners indicates the lack of importance given to the needs of women prisoners. It can be said that the policies and measures taken towards preventing the spread of COVID 19 pandemic in prisons has reinforced existing biases against prisoners. The major concern of the prison and judicial authorities was to somehow manage the situation without disturbing the dangerousness and risk to law and order narrative about prisoners.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA test was negative and pulmonary embolism was ruled out by CT Angiogram of chest. He underwent Transesophageal Echocardiogram guided cardioversion showing low normal left ventricular function and absence of left atrial appendage or thrombus. He was discharged on a anticoagulant and a diuretic. 2 weeks later he was readmitted with recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was loaded with amiodarone intravenously and then transitioned to oral Amiodarone 400 mg orally twice daily. After 5 days he deteriorated requiring intubation for respiratory failure. CT Chest on day 5 of amiodarone administration showed new changes in form of bilateral ground glass attenuation, septal thickening and bilateral airspace consolidation when compared to previous admission.

METHODS: A prospective, observational, multicentre study was conducted in 2020. All medical students and interim foundation year 1 doctors were eligible to participate. RESULTS: Six hundred forty individuals participated from 32 medical schools. Participants reported a drop in their mood following the onset of the pandemic (p < 0.001). This drop in mood was evident in both May and August. Participants did have an improved mood in August compared to May (p < 0.001). There was a significant decrease in pandemic disease-anxiety (13.8/20 to 12.4/20, p < 0.001) and consequence-anxiety (6.3/10 to 6.0/10, p < 0.001) between May and August.

In comparison to the native condition, the number of polar bonds (comprising both hydrogen bonds and salt bridges) in the poses considered are 10, 6, 6, and 4 for the states ACE2/Spike both native, ACE2 native/Spike glycated, ACE2 glycated/Spike native, ACE2/Spike both glycated, respectively. The analysis highlighted also how the number of non-polar contacts (in this case, van der Waals and aromatic interactions) significantly decreases when the lysine aminoacid residues undergo glycation. Following non-enzymatic glycation, the number of interactions between human ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is decreased in comparison to the unmodified model. The reduced affinity of the Spike protein for ACE2 receptor in case of non-enzymatic glycation may shift the virus to multiple alternative entry routes.","output":"In silico evaluation of the interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in a hyperglycemic environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?sszefoglal.

As the most severe consequence of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cytokine storm - caused by the liberalization of several inflammatory mediators - engenders critical respiratory dysfunction syndrome or multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The most proportion of infections has proven symptomless or with very mild signs of disease so far. Mild, moderate, or rarely intense pain can occur in every phase of the disease, for the treatment of which more than a few analgesic possibilities are readily available. From the start of the pandemic, we have been concerning to ameliorate the symptoms, in either the department of infectology, or operating suites. The post-intensive care pain and post-COVID symptoms should be evaluated and treated after discharge. In this timely and comprehensive article, the role and importance of different analgesics are articulated regarding the COVID-associated painful conditions.

As a critical component of innate immunity, inflammasomes play a prominent role in the inflammatory response. The information on inflammasome biology is rapidly growing, thus creating the need for structuring it into a model that can help visualize and enhance the understanding of underlying biological processes. Causal biological network (CBN) models provide predictive power for novel disease mechanisms and treatment outcomes. We assembled the available literature information on inflammasome activation into the CBN model and scored it with publicly available transcriptomic datasets that address viral infection of the lungs, osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and aging. The scoring inferred pathway activation leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation in these diverse conditions, demonstrating that the CBN model provides a platform for interpreting transcriptomic data in the context of inflammasome activation.","output":"Causal Biological Network Model for Inflammasome Signaling Applied for Interpreting Transcriptomic Changes in Various Inflammatory States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis represent three distinct types of regulated cell death forms, which play significant roles in response to viral and bacterial infections. Whereas apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, bleb formation and retained membrane integrity, necroptosis and pyroptosis exhibit osmotic imbalance driven cytoplasmic swelling and early membrane damage. These three cell death forms exert distinct immune stimulatory potential. The caspase driven apoptotic cell demise is considered in many circumstances as anti-inflammatory, whereas the two lytic cell death modalities can efficiently trigger immune response by releasing damage associated molecular patterns to the extracellular space. The relevance of these cell death modalities in infections can be best demonstrated by the presence of viral proteins that directly interfere with cell death pathways. Conversely, some pathogens hijack the cell death signaling routes to initiate a targeted attack against the immune cells of the host, and extracellular bacteria can benefit from the destruction of intact extracellular barriers upon cell death induction. The complexity and the crosstalk between these cell death modalities reflect a continuous evolutionary race between pathogens and host. This chapter discusses the current advances in the research of cell death signaling with regard to viral and bacterial infections and describes the network of the cell death initiating molecular mechanisms that selectively recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns.","output":"The involvement of regulated cell death forms in modulating the bacterial and viral pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on training and Shared Resource Laboratory (SRL) operations such as staffing, facility access, and social distancing, has affected facilities around the globe to different degrees based on restrictions set by various geographical and institutional settings.

METHODS: Between June 2019 and November 2019, a survey amongst consecutive regular orthopedic and orthopedic trauma patients at the outpatient clinics from three European level I trauma centers was conducted via paper-based questionnaires, composed of participants\` demographics as well as five open and closed questions. Participation was voluntary and anonymity was granted. RESULTS: In total, 780 participants (female 302, 38.7%, male 478, 61.3%) with a mean age of 43.8 years (SD 17.1, range from 14 years to 94 years) were included. The majority of the participants (57,6%) were eager to use a remote consultation. Participants with an age of more than 55 years were significantly less likely to use a remote consultation than their younger counterparts (OR= 0.18, p=0.003. r2=0.141). Among the whole study population, 86.2% stated, that they had a device compatible with an online video consultation. The highest willingness to conduct a video consultation in respect of the participants\` occupation was observed in \\"part-time\\"-jobs (70.6%), whereas the lowest disposition was seen in retired patients (37.1%) (p= 0.0001). The most stated reason why to conduct a video consultation was \\"communication of medical findings\\" (67.8%). The most stated advantage was the \\"reduction of physical consultations\\" (66.4%). \\"No physical examination\\" was the most frequently stated disadvantage (75.9%). CONCLUSION: The majority of orthopedic and orthopedic trauma outpatients would use a video consultation, especially because of commuting and time issues and ideally to communicate medical findings, such as x-ray reports or lab values. Elderly patients appear to be less eager in regard to video consultations. These results may change for even better acceptance in view of a current pandemic situation, as experienced since early 2020.

Previously, most software developers worked in physical offices and new hires onboarded to their teams in the physical office, following a standard onboarding process. However, when companies transitioned employees to work from home due to the pandemic, there was little time to no time to develop new onboarding procedures. In this paper, we present a survey of 267 new hires at Microsoft that onboarded to software development teams during the pandemic. We explored their remote onboarding process, including the challenges that the new hires encountered and their social connectedness with their teams. We found that most developers onboarded remotely and never had an opportunity to meet their teammates in person. This leads to one of the biggest challenges faced by these new hires, building a strong social connection with their team.

We aimed to assess the associations between prior use of RAAS inhibitors and clinical outcomes among Korean patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. Claim records were screened for 69 793 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 until 8 April 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare the clinical outcomes between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers. RESULTS: Among 5179 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 762 patients were RAAS inhibitor users and 4417 patients were nonusers. Relative to nonusers, RAAS inhibitor users were more likely to be older, male, and have comorbidities. Among 1954 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 377 patients were RAAS inhibitor users, and 1577 patients were nonusers. In-hospital mortality was observed for 33 RAAS inhibitor users (9%) and 51 nonusers (3%) (Pa? <a? .001). However, after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, immunosuppression, and hospital type, the use of RAAS inhibitors was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.44; Pa? =a? .60). No significant differences were observed between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers in terms of vasopressor use, modes of ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and acute cardiac events. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that prior use of RAAS inhibitors was not independently associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients in Korea.","output":"Association of Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone System Inhibitors With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)- Related Outcomes in Korea: A Nationwide Population-based Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significant differences may exist among different descents, but the current studies are mainly based on European populations. In the present study, we analyzed the population-specific differences of coronary artery disease (CAD) between European and East Asian descents. In stage 1, we identified CAD susceptibility genes by gene-based tests in European and East Asian populations. We identified two novel susceptibility genes for CAD, namely, CUX2 and OAS3. In stage 2, we carried out meta-analyses for the population-specific variants. rs599839 (PSRC1) represented a protective variant for CAD in East Asian populations (OR(ASN) = 0.72. 95% CI: 0.63-0.81) but a risk factor in European populations (OR(EUR) = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.93-1.36). In stage 3, we enriched the risk genes and explored the population-specific differences in Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), regulatory element, tissues, and cell types. In stage 4, in order to predict genes that showed pleiotropic/potentially causal association with CAD, we integrated summary-level data from independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) by using summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). The results showed that NBEAL1 and FGD6 were population-specific pleiotropic/causal genes. Although some potential mutations and risk genes of CAD are shared, it is still of great significance to elucidate the genetic differences among different populations.

Based on MS signals of 128 differential lipid species with statistically significant level variation between the OC patients and control group, an OPLS-DA model was developed for the recognition of OC with 100% sensitivity and specificity R 2 = 0.87 and Q2 = 0.80.

The viability assay results revealed higher sensitivity of the A549 lung cancer cells to CdCl(2) compared with the normal MRC-9 lung cells. In the normal MRC-9 lung cells, higher expression levels of the cytokines were observed at the lowest CdCl(2) concentration at a shorter exposure time compared with the lung cancer cells. Higher levels of the cytokines were observed in the A549 lung cancer cells at all other times and concentrations compared with the MRC-9 cells, indicating higher levels of inflammation. The cytokine levels were reduced at higher CdCl(2) concentrations and longer exposure durations, demonstrating the toxic effect of cadmium.

RESULTS: 858 orthopedic and trauma surgeons participated in the survey throughout Germany. In the multiple regression analysis, being employed at a hospital was identified as an independent positive predictor in the indices for \\"Preparedness\\", \\"Resources\\", and \\"Informedness\\" and an independent negative predictor regarding \\"Depletion\\". Self-employment was found to be an independent positive predictor of the financial index \\"Depletion\\". Female surgeons were identified as an independent variable for a higher level of \\"Concern\\". CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms a distinct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic and trauma surgery in Germany. The containment measures are largely considered appropriate despite severe financial constraints. A substantial lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) is reported. The multiple regression analysis shows that self-employed surgeons are more affected by this shortage as well as by the financial consequences than surgeons working in hospitals. WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic has a profound impact on orthopedic and trauma surgery as an unrelated specialty. Self-employed surgeons are affected especially by a shortage of PPE and financial consequences. HOW MIGHT IT IMPACT ON CLINICAL PRACTICE IN THE NEAR FUTURE: Political and financial support can now be applied more focused to subgroups in the field of orthopedics and trauma surgery with an increased demand for support. A special emphasis should be set on the support of self-employed surgeons which are a more affected by the shortage of PPE and financial consequences than surgeons working in hospitals.","output":"Collateral effect of COVID-19 on orthopedic and trauma surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anaesthesiology is a high-demand speciality of medicine in terms of long and unpredictable work hours, stressful work requirements, pressure for a cent per cent productivity in academics, clinical work and research.

To date, literature on the prognosis for AGC after LADG is scarce. This study evaluated the procedure's long-term benefits compared with those of the conventional, open distal gastrectomy (ODG). METHODS This study involved 201 patients, 66 of whom underwent LADG, with a mean follow-up period of 49.2 months, from January 1999 to March 2010. A clear set of criteria was used to select patients (including no evidence of lymph node metastasis) and surgeons (subject to their experience). Survival outcomes were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank testing. The postoperative recovery and complications of the patients also were monitored. RESULTS No significant difference was observed between LADG and ODG in terms of overall survival or disease-specific survival. The corresponding 5-year survival rates for individual tumor node metastasis stages also were comparable in each group. The number of lymph nodes harvested was similar in the two groups, although the operation time was significantly shorter for ODG. The postoperative hospital stay was shorter for LADG patients (average stay of 8.4 vs. 18.1 days in the ODG group; p < 0.001), and the postoperative complication rate was almost half that for ODG (13.6 vs. 25.0 %; p = 0.048). CONCLUSION The combination of the long- and short-term data indicates that LADG should be considered as a feasible alternative to ODG for the treatment of AGC. Its widespread integration requires the accumulation of similar results across multiple centers worldwide.","output":"Long-term comparison of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy and open distal gastrectomy in advanced gastric cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue is one of the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral diseases in humans.

DENV2 cultured in C6/36 cell line (culture-DENV2) was injected to Aedes aegypti intrathoracically. Saliva was collected from infected mosquitoes 7 days later. Exploiting the sensitivity of Stat1(-/-) mice to low dose of DENV2 delivered intradermally, we showed that DENV2 collected in infected mosquito saliva (msq-DENV2) induced more severe hemorrhage in mice than their culture counterpart. Msq-DENV2 was characterized by smaller particle size, larger plaque size and more rapid growth in mosquito as well as mammalian cell lines compared to culture-DENV2. In addition, msq-DENV2 was more efficient than culture-DENV2 in inducing Tnf mRNA production by mouse macrophage.

For the wildtype (WT) only a small proportion of those infected emitted large quantities of the virus. The currently prevalent variants of concern, Delta (B1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529), are characterized by higher viral loads and a lower minimal infective dose compared to the WT. We aimed to describe the resulting distribution of airborne viral emissions and to reassess the risk estimates for public settings given the higher viral load and infectivity. METHOD We reran the Monte Carlo modelling to estimate viral emissions in the fine aerosol size range using available viral load data. We also updated our tool to simulate indoor airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by including a CO2 calculator and recirculating air cleaning devices. We also assessed the consequences of the lower critical dose on the infection risk in public settings with different protection strategies. RESULTS Our modelling suggests that a much larger proportion of individuals infected with the new variants are high, very high or super-emitters of airborne viruses: for the WT, one in 1,000 infected was a super-emitter; for Delta one in 30; and for Omicron one in 20 or one in 10, depending on the viral load estimate used. Testing of the effectiveness of protective strategies in view of the lower critical dose suggests that surgical masks are no longer sufficient in most public settings, while correctly fitted FFP2 respirators still provide sufficient protection, except in high aerosol producing situations such as singing or shouting. DISCUSSION From an aerosol transmission perspective, the shift towards a larger proportion of very high emitting individuals, together with the strongly reduced critical dose, seem to be two important drivers of the aerosol risk, and are likely contributing to the observed rapid spread of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern. Reducing contacts, always wearing well-fitted FFP2 respirators when indoors, using ventilation and other methods to reduce airborne virus concentrations, and avoiding situations with loud voices seem critical to limiting these latest waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Higher viral load and infectivity increase risk of aerosol transmission for Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adequate functioning of a sewage treatment plant (STP) is essential to protect the downstream aquatic environment (ECHA 2017), and information on the degradability of chemicals and their toxicity to activated sludge microorganisms is required. An environmental realistic higher tier test is a STP simulation test as described in OECD 303A (2001) which for nanoparticles can also be used to study their sorption behavior to activated sludge. However, information is limited on the influence of synthetic sewage on the microbial community of the activated sludge. A modified community can result in modifications of the sludge floccules affecting the sorption behavior. The main objective of our study was to show whether a representative microbial diversity remains under standardized test conditions as described in OECD 303A (2001) using synthetic sewage as influent. Furthermore, we investigated whether just considering the functional properties of a STP (elimination of dissolved organic carbon; nitrification), is sufficient for an assessment of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) or whether the influence on microbial diversity also needs to be considered. AuNPs were used as a case study due to their rising medical applications and therefore increasing probability to reach the sewer and STP. The results can provide significant input for the interpretation of results from the regulatory point of view. To deliver these objectives, the general changes of the microbial population in activated sludge and its influence on the degradation activity (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic nitrogen) using freshly collected sludge from the municipal STP in an artificial test system as a model STP in accordance with OECD 303A (2001) were assessed. Additionally, we evaluated the potential impact of AuNPs and its dispersant on the microbial composition and the overall impact on the function of the STP in terms of DOC degradation and nitrogen removal to observe if an assessment based on functional properties is sufficient. The bacteria composition in our study, evaluated at a class level, revealed commonly described environmental bacteria. Proteobacteria (?, &#945;, ?) accounted for more than 50% but also nitrifying bacteria as Nitrospira were present. Our results show that mainly within the first 7 days of an acclimatization phase by addition of synthetic sewage, the bacterial community changed. Even though AuNPs can have antibacterial properties, no adverse effects on the function and structure of the microorganisms in the STP could be detected at concentrations of increased modeled PEC values by a factor of about 10,000. Complementary to other metallic nanomaterials, gold nanomaterials also sorb to a large extent to the activated sludge. If activated sludge is used as fertilizer on agricultural land, gold nanoparticles can be introduced into soils.

To investigate the distribution and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in a home with COVID-19 positive occupants, samples were collected from a household with two confirmed COVID-19 cases (one adult and one child). Home surface swab and dust samples were collected two months after symptom onset (and one month after symptom resolution) in the household. The strength of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular signal in fomites varied as a function of sample location, surface material and cleaning practices. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal was detected at several locations throughout the household although cleaning appears to have attenuated the signal on many surfaces. Of the 24 surfaces sampled, 46% were SARS-CoV-2 positive at the time of sampling. The SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in dust recovered from floor and HVAC filter samples ranged from 104-105 N2 gene copies/g dust. While detection of viral RNA does not imply infectivity, this study confirms that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal can be detected at several locations within a COVID-19 isolation home and can persist after symptoms have resolved. In addition, the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 (normalized per unit mass of dust) recovered in home HVAC filters may prove useful for estimating SARS-CoV-2 airborne levels in homes.

ICI-related AEs were defined as adverse reactions in patients using anti-PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab), and anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab and tremelimumab). Neurologic AEs previously reported to be associated with ICI were evaluated in the disproportionality analysis using the reporting odds ratio (ROR). RESULTS: Among 50,406 ICI-related reports, 3619 (7.2%) neurological case was found: 1985 with anti-PD-1, 372 with anti-PD-L1, 366 with anti-CTLA-4, and 896 with the combination of ICIs. In comparison to non-ICI drug use, ICI use demonstrated higher risk for neurologic complication, including hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, myasthenia gravis, encephalitis/myelitis, meningitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, vasculitis, and neuropathy. The risk of neurologic AEs associated with ICI combination therapy was as high as or even higher than ICI monotherapy, most significantly in hypophysitis/hypopituitarism.

We are easily trapped by dominant metaphors, though fresh metaphors may generate significant paradigm shifts. During the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, the war metaphor, standing for our relationship to Covid-19, established itself, like the virus itself, almost universally. This paper details the reasons for the early dominance of the war metaphor and shows how the adoption of the title of wartime leader by Donald Trump and Boris Johnson rebounded on them as it highlighted their subsequent abject failure to perform the roles they attributed to themselves.

It shows how, as the virus took root in most countries and governments had markedly different success in their responses to it, use of the war metaphor declined and people around the world coined a host of mini-metaphors relating to specific, local features, of their experience. It concludes by drawing attention to the potential of metaphors from ecology to generate insights relevant to some of the other major challenges faced by humanity.","output":"How We Escape Capture by the War Metaphor for Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (AZM) is widely used for respiratory infections and has been suggested to be a possible treatment for the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19). However, AZM-associated QT interval prolongation and arrhythmias have been reported. Integrated mechanistic information on AZM actions on human ventricular excitation and conduction is lacking. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the actions of AZM on ventricular cell and tissue electrical activity. The O'Hara- Virag-Varro-Rudy dynamic (ORd) model of human ventricular cells was modified to incorporate experimental data on the concentration-dependent actions of AZM on multiple ion channels, including I(Na), I(CaL), I(Kr), I(Ks), I(K1) and I(NaL) in both acute and chronic exposure conditions. In the single cell model, AZM prolonged the action potential duration (APD) in a concentration-dependent manner, which was predominantly attributable to I(Kr) reduction in the acute condition and potentiated I(NaL) in the chronic condition. High concentrations of AZM also increased action potential (AP) triangulation (determined as an increased difference between APD(30) and APD(90)) which is a marker of arrhythmia risk. In the chronic condition, the potentiated I(NaL) caused a modest intracellular Na (+) concentration accumulation at fast pacing rates. At the 1D tissue level, the AZM-prolonged APD at the cellular level was reflected by an increased QT interval in the simulated pseudo-ECG, consistent with clinical observations. Additionally, AZM reduced the conduction velocity (CV) of APs in the acute condition due to a reduced I(Na), and it augmented the transmural APD dispersion of the ventricular tissue, which is also pro-arrhythmic. Such actions were markedly augmented when the effects of chronic exposure of AZM were also considered, or with additional I(Kr) block, as may occur with concurrent use of other medications. This study provides insights into the ionic mechanisms by which high concentrations of AZM may modulate ventricular electrophysiology and susceptibility to arrhythmia.","output":"In silico investigation of pro-arrhythmic effects of azithromycin on the human ventricle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extant infrastructure for child abuse surveillance, dependent on reporting by schools and healthcare professionals, has been disrupted by the pandemic.

Here we examined the effects of maternal food restriction during pregnancy on offspring in the matrotrophic (i.e. mother-nourishment throughout gestation) live-bearing fish species Phalloptychus januarius (Poeciliidae). We fed pregnant females either with a 'low-food' or 'high-food' ration for six weeks and quantified the consequences for offspring size and body fat at birth and one week after birth. We further measured fast-start escape performance of offspring at birth, as well as swimming kinematics during prey capture at zero, two, and seven days after birth. We found that the length of maternal food restriction during pregnancy negatively affected offspring dry mass and lean dry mass at birth, as well as body fat gain during the first week after birth. Moreover, it impacted the locomotor performance of offspring during prey capture at, and during the first week after, birth. We did not observe an effect of food restriction on fast-start escape performance of offspring. Our study suggests that matrotrophic poeciliid fish are maladapted to unpredictably fluctuating resource environments, because sudden reductions in maternal food availability during pregnancy result in smaller offspring with slower postnatal body fat gain and an inhibition of postnatal improving swimming skills during feeding, potentially leading to lower competitive abilities after birth.","output":"Maternal food restriction during pregnancy affects offspring development and swimming performance in a placental live-bearing fish."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review summarizes the ongoing researches regarding etiology, epidemiology, transmission dynamics, treatment, and prevention and control strategies of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with comparison to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and pandemic H1N1 virus SARS-CoV-2 may be originated from bats, and the patients and asymptomatic carriers are the source of epidemic infection The virus can be transmitted human-to-human through droplets and close contact, and people at all ages are susceptible to this virus The main clinical symptoms of the patients are fever and cough, accompanied with leukocytopenia and lymphocytopenia Effective drugs have been not yet available thus far In terms of the prevention and control strategies, vaccine development as the primary prevention should be accelerated Regarding the secondary prevention, ongoing efforts of the infected patients and close contacts quarantine, mask wearing promotion, regular disinfection in public places should be continued Meanwhile, rapid detection kit for serological monitoring of the virus in general population is expected so as to achieve early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment In addition, public health education on this disease and prevention should be enhanced so as to mitigate panic and mobilize the public to jointly combat the epidemic","output":"[Epidemiology, Treatment, and Epidemic Prevention and Control of the Coronavirus Disease 2019: a Review]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a new type of pneumonia caused by SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan and has been discovered in many countries around the world ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of SARS-Cov-2 into human cells Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs The results indicated that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RBD) domain and ACE2 of RPTEC/SerC cell-binding assays confirmed that SARS-Cov-2 can bind to ACE2 on the surface of these cells Our results suggest that ACE2 expression could contribute to kidney and testis infection after COVID-19 infection Renal function evaluation and special care should be performed during clinical work Clinicians should also pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility","output":"ACE2 Expression in Kidney and Testis May Cause Kidney and Testis Infection in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe, which has affected the health of all populations including antenatal women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single group repeated measures design was conducted on 101 antenatal women who were referred to outpatient antenatal clinics from January 2020 (pre-COVID-19) to April 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). Data were collected using four questionnaires including the HADS, GAD-7 scale, PSS, and BMWS. RESULTS: Antenatal women (n = 101, M(age) = 32.73 years, standard deviation = 5.67) during COVID-19 demonstrated significantly increased (P < 0.001) levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and worry compared with pre-COVID-19 levels. Multiple regression analysis indicated that panic disorder was significantly associated with HADS, PSS, and BMWS scores; pregnancy complications were significantly associated with HADS scores; associated health problems were significantly associated with PSS and BMWS scores; and current anxiety, depression, stress, and worry were significantly associated with HADS, GAD-7, and BMWS scores in antenatal women during COVID-19.

Methods: Observational cohort study of 4 groups;hospitalised, community illness with on-going symptoms (community-symptomatic), community illness now recovered (community-recovered) and controls. Participants underwent extensive clinical assessment involving cardiopulmonary imaging, submaximal and maximal exercise testing, pulmonary function, cognitive assessment, blood tests, electrocardiogram and questionnaires on mental health and physical function. Results: 113 participants (aged 399 and 86% male) were recruited into four groups, Hospitalised (n=35), community-symptomatic (n=34), community-recovered (n=18) and control (n=26), at 15972days following acute illness. Hospitalized and community-symptomatic groups were older, with a higher body mass index, and worse mental health, fatigue, and quality of life scores. Hospitalised and community-symptomatic participants also performed less well on sub-maximal and maximal exercise testing. Hospitalised individuals had impaired ventilatory efficiency (higher VE/V?CO 2 slope), achieved less work at the anaerobic threshold and at peak than other groups and had a significantly reduced forced vital capacity. Clinically significant abnormal cardiopulmonary imaging findings were present in 6% of hospitalised participants. Those who recovered from COVID-19 had no significant differences when compared with controls.

For instance, upon the initial attachment, the receptor binding domain of the S protein forms primarily hydrogen bonds with the protease domain of ACE2 resulting in conformational changes within the secondary structure. These surface interactions are of paramount importance and have been therapeutically exploited for antiviral design, such as monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, we provide an insight into novel therapies that target viral non-structural proteins, such as viral RNA polymerase.

In solution, ultracentrifugation and small angle X-ray scattering (at concentrations up to 9 mg/mL) characterize the protein as compact and stable homodimer without evidence for aggregation. The crystal structure of chicken (C-)GRIFIN at seven pH values from 4.2 to 8.5 is reported, revealing compelling stability. Binding of lactose despite the Arg71Val deviation from the sequence signature of galectins matched the otherwise canonical contact pattern with thermodynamics of an enthalpically driven process. Upon lactose accommodation, the side chain of Arg50 is shifted for hydrogen bonding to the 3-hydroxyl of glucose. No evidence for a further ligand-dependent structural alteration was obtained in solution by measuring hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometrically in peptic fingerprints. The introduction of the Asn48Lys mutation, characteristic for mammalian GRIFINs that have lost lectin activity, lets labeled C-GRIFIN maintain capacity to stain tissue sections.

Ash, the residue from stoves and fires, is a material used for cleaning hands in settings where soap is not widely available. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of hand cleaning with ash compared with hand cleaning using soap or other materials for reducing the spread of viral and bacterial infections. SEARCH METHODS: On 26 March 2020 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO Global Index Medicus, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all types of studies, in any population, that examined hand cleaning with ash compared to hand cleaning with any other material. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles and full texts, and one review author extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias, which another review author double-checked. We used the ROBINS-I tool for observational studies, we used RoB 2.0 for three interventional studies, and we used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We planned to synthesise data with random-effects meta-analyses. Our prespecified outcome measures were overall mortality, number of cases of infections (as defined in the individual studies), severity of infectious disease, harms (as reported in the individual studies), and adherence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 studies described in 19 records using eight different study designs, but only one randomised trial. The studies were primarily conducted in rural settings in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Six studies reported outcome data relevant to our review. A retrospective case-control study and a cohort study assessed diarrhoea in children under the age of five years and self-reported reproductive tract symptoms in women, respectively. It was very uncertain whether the rate of hospital contacts for moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children differed between households that cleaned hands using ash compared with households cleaning hands using soap (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; very low-certainty evidence). Similarly, it was very uncertain whether the rate of women experiencing symptoms of reproductive tract infection differed between women cleaning hands with ash compared with cleaning hands using soap (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.86; very low-certainty evidence) or when compared with handwashing with water only or not washing hands (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.96; very low-certainty evidence). Four studies reported on bacteriological counts after hand wash. We rated all four studies at high risk of bias, and we did not synthesise data due to methodological heterogeneity and unclear outcome reporting.

The multidisciplinary team (MDT) outcome, imaging details, subjective opinion, tumour markers, surgical details, and final histological diagnosis were collected. Diagnostic performance was also determined. Results There were 200 eligible patients in the study period. MDM imaging review demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.4% (95% CI: 94.3% to 99.8%) and a specificity of 52% (95% CI: 40.2% to 63.7%). Thirty-five cases were false positive, either presumed invasive cancers (51%) or borderline tumours (49%). The most common histological types were serous (37%) and mucinous (31%) cystadenomas.

In conclusion, blocking or manipulating the SARS-CoV2-ACE2 binding interface perhaps offers the best tactic against the virus that should be treated as a fundamental subject of future research.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and SARS-CoV-2: Potential therapeutic targeting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of extravasation of iodinated contrast medium (ICM) at the site of intravenous injection in oncology patients submitted to computed tomography (CT). Materials and Methods This was a retrospective, descriptive, single-center study that evaluated all patients who underwent CT with ICM administration and presented ICM extravasation, at a cancer center, between January 2010 and December 2015. Results During the study period, we evaluated a total of 99,076 ICM injections and identified 199 cases of extravasation, the incidence rate therefore being 0.20%. Among the patients who presented extravasation, the mean age was 59.22 years and 60% were female. The extravasation was classified as mild in 94.10% of the patients and as moderate in 5.90%. There were no cases of severe extravasation in the sample. Conclusion The incidence of ICM extravasation in cancer patients submitted to CT in the present study was similar to that reported for the general population, according to other studies in the literature. The vast majority of cases of extravasation were considered mild, and no severe cases were observed in the study sample.","output":"Extravasation of iodinated contrast medium in cancer patients undergoing computed tomography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the treatment of diabetes mellitus, the challenge is to integrate adequate self-management into clinical care. Customization including goal setting, monitoring, and feedback could be achieved through digitization. Digital linking between different devices could simplify and promote self-management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of diabetes treatment assisted by a digital health application compared with standard diabetes therapy. METHODS: The DAVOS study is a 6-month-period prospective, multicentric, randomized controlled trial. In total, 154 diabetes patients (age 18; treated with insulin) will be recruited and randomized into control group or intervention group. Both groups will receive standard diabetes care. The intervention group will additionally use a diabetes app. HbA1c value will be monitored on three separate defined visits. Primary endpoint is the overall reduction of HbA1c value. Secondary endpoints (eg, usability of the app) will be determined through patient-reported outcome questionnaires. DISCUSSION: Through enhanced interaction of health care professionals, providers of the app, and patients, the study aims to demonstrate improvement in the self-management of diabetes. As part of the closure management, all patients will be invited to use the examined application after completion of the study. The DAVOS study will be conducted in accordance with the valid version of the present study protocol and the internationally recognized International Conference on Harmonization-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) Guidelines.

From 142 KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19 infection after Omicron had become the dominant variant in the UK, 116 (78.9%) cases were diagnosed in the community; 47 receiving sotrovimab, 21 molnupiravir and 48 no treatment. 10 (20.8%) non-treated patients were hospitalised following infection, which was significantly higher than the sotrovimab group (2.1%), p=0.0048, but not the molnupiravir treated group (14.3%), p=0.47. The only admission following sotrovimab occurred in a patient infected with BA.2. One patient from the molnupiravir and no-treatment groups required ICU support, and both subsequently died, with one other death in the no-treatment group. No patient receiving sotrovimab died. 6/116 (5.2%) patients required dialysis following their diagnosis; 2 (9.5%) patients receiving molnupiravir and 4 (8.3%) no-treatment. This requirement was significantly higher in the molnupiravir group compared with the sotrovimab treated patients, in whom no patient required dialysis, p=0.035. Both molnupiravir treated patients requiring dialysis had features of systemic thrombotic microangiopathy. Post-vaccination serostatus was available in 110 patients. Seropositive patients were less likely to require hospital admission compared with seronegative patients, 6 (7.0%) and 6 (25.0%) respectively, p=0.023. Seropositive patients were also less likely to require dialysis therapy, p=0.016. In conclusion, sotrovimab treatment in the community was associated with superior patient and transplant outcomes; its clinical efficacy against the BA.2 variant requires a rapid review. The treatment benefit of molnupiravir was not evident, and wider safety reporting in transplant patients is needed.","output":"Kidney Transplant Recipients and Omicron: Outcomes, effect of vaccines and the efficacy and safety of novel treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) C a respiratory contagion spreading through expiratory droplets C has evolved into a global pandemic, severely impacting the public health. Importantly, the emerging of immune evasion SARS-CoV-2 variants and the limited effect of current antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials suggested that alternative strategies in addition to the conventional vaccines and antivirals is required to successfully control the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we propose to use liquid-repellent coatings to prevent the spread of disease in the absence of effective vaccines, anti-microbial agents or therapeutics, wherein the deposition and penetration of pathogen droplets are prohibited. We use SARS-CoV-2 as a model pathogen and find that SARS-CoV-2 remnants are reduced by seven orders of magnitude on coated surfaces, yielding a repelling efficacy far outperforming the inactivation rate of disinfectants. The SARS-CoV-2 remnant scales exponentially with the liquid/solid adhesion, uncovering the mechanism and effective means for minimizing pathogen attachment. The anti-pathogen coating that both repels and inactivates pathogens is demonstrated by incorporating the super-liquid-repellent coating with anti-pathogen additives. Together with its versatility over a wide range of substrates and pathogens, the novel anti-pathogen coating is of considerable value for infection control in everyday life as well as during pandemics.","output":"Liquid Repellency Enabled Anti-Pathogen Coatings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experimentation has been an essential part of teaching and learning biological concepts. Science experiments provide opportunities for students to learn scientific concepts, experience natural phenomena, and explore the world around them. However, this COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the educational system in the Philippines, particularly science education. School facilities and laboratories are temporarily closed or inaccessible for teachers and students. These events hinder the conventional process of doing experiential learning activities, experiments, and scientific investigations. Because of this major disruption, the International Baccalaureate Organization released a memorandum that encourages teachers and students from IB World Schools to utilize other activities other than laboratory experiments such as online simulations, analysis of secondary data, or doing safe and appropriate experiments at home. In response, the biology students of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) of Saint Jude Catholic School utilized home-based biology experiments for their internal assessment. Students investigated the effects of different fruit extracts on gelatin denaturation, effects of kinds of milk on the volume and pH of cheese produced, effects of nutrient solutions on the growth of onion, and effects of the different wavelengths of light on the growth of an aquatic plant. Because of these unpredictable changes in the educational system, it is necessary to document these innovations and practices. This paper aimed to present students experiences on the use of home-based biology experiments. It was shown that household materials and kitchens can be utilized as alternative laboratories in remote learning. Furthermore, it was also revealed that they had trouble finding literature related to their topic. In the paper, they also emphasized the importance of choosing the right topic which fits your interest.

The aim of this study is to systematically review the data available to date regarding the potential risk posed to theatre staff by laparoscopy. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only publications in peer-reviewed journals were considered. PubMed, Ovid Embase, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library were searched. The search period was between 1st January 1980 and 27th April 2020. Bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. RESULTS: 4209 records were identified, resulting in 9 unique studies being selected. The included studies examined viral DNA aerosoliation generated by electrosurgery and CO(2) laser ablation, with one study examining viral DNA aerosolisation following laparoscopy. Each of these demonstrated that viral DNA (Hepatitis B Virus and Human Papilloma Virus) was detectable in the surgical smoke plume. CONCLUSION: The data and analysis reported in this study reflect the most up-to-date evidence available for the surgeon to assess risk towards healthcare staff. It was constrained by heterogeneity of reporting for several outcomes and lack of comparable studies.

Since currently no resolutive therapy for ARDS has been found and given the scientific literature regarding the use of adenosine, its application has been hypothesized. Through its receptors, adenosine is able to inhibit the acute inflammatory process, increase the protection capacity of the epithelial barrier, and reduce the damage due to an overactivation of the immune system, such as that occurring in cytokine storms. These features are known in ischemia/reperfusion models and could also be exploited in acute lung injury with hypoxia.

Low level laser therapy (LLLT) has significant anti-inflammatory effects and reduces inflammatory cytokines. It is noninvasive and approved for pain management and musculoskeletal injuries. Data from human and experimental animal models of respiratory tract disease suggests that LLLT reduces inflammation and promotes lung healing. Case and outcomes: A morbidly obese 32-year-old Asian female with severe COVID-19 received four consecutive once-daily LLLT sessions via a laser scanner. Pulsed 808 nm and 905 nm laser beams were delivered over the posterior chest for 28 min. The patient was evaluated before and after LLLT by radiological assessment of lung edema (RALE) on chest X-ray, oxygen requirements and saturation, pneumonia severity indices (SMART-COP and Brescia-COVID), blood inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, ferritin, and C-Reactive protein (CRP)). Prior to treatment, oxygen saturation (SpO2) via pulse oximetry was 88%-93% on 5-6 L oxygen. Following LLLT, SpO2 increased to 97%-99% on 1-3 L oxygen. Reductions in RALE score from 8 to 3, Brescia-COVID from 4 to 0, and SMART-COP from 5 to 0 were observed. Interleukin-6 decreased from 45.89 to 11.7 pg/mL, ferritin from 359 to 175 ng/mL, and CRP from 3.04 to 1.43 mg/dL. Post-treatment, the patient noted appreciable improvement in respiratory symptoms.

Methods: We compared Italys status at the outbreak stage and control measures with Guangdong Province in China by data observation and analysis. A modi?ed autonomous SEIR model was used to study the COVID-19 epidemic and transmission potential during the early stage of the outbreak in Italy. We also utilized a time-dependent dynamic model to study the future disease dynamics in Italy. The impact of various non-pharmaceutical control measures on epidemic was investigated through uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. Results: The comparison of speci?c measures implemented in the two places and the time when the measures were initiated shows that the initial prevention and control actions in Italy were not suf?ciently timely and effective. We estimated parameter values based on available cumulative data and calculated the basic reproduction number to be 4.32 before the national lockdown in Italy. Based on the estimated parameter values, we performed numerical simulations to predict the epidemic trend and evaluate the impact of contact limitation, detection and diagnosis, and individual behavior change due to media coverage on the epidemic. Conclusions: Italy was in a severe epidemic status and the control measures were not suf?ciently timely and effective in the beginning. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, including contact restrictions and improvement of case recognition, play an important role in containing the COVID-19 epidemic. The effect of individual behavior changes due to media update of the outbreak cannot be ignored.

The recent resolution of the crystal structure of the low-neurovirulence DA virus in complex with the sialic acid mimic sialyllactose demonstrated that four capsid residues make contact with sialic acid through noncovalent hydrogen bonds. To systematically test the importance of these sialic acid-binding residues in viral entry and infection, we mutated three VP2 puff B amino acids proposed to make contact with sialic acid and analyzed the consequences of each amino acid substitution on viral entry and spread. The fourth residue is in the VP3-VP1 cleavage dipeptide and could not be mutated. Our data suggest that residues Q2161 and G2174 are directly involved in BeAn virus attachment to sialic acid and that substitutions of these two residues result in the loss of or reduced viral binding and hemagglutination and in the inability to spread among BHK-21 cells. In addition, a gain of function-revertant virus was recovered with the Q2161A mutation after prolonged passage in cells.","output":"Amino acid substitutions in VP2 residues contacting sialic acid in low-neurovirulence BeAn virus dramatically reduce viral binding and spread of infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest an article from Li colleagues describing The Neuroinvasive Potential of SARS\\\\CoV2 May Play a Role in the Respiratory Failure of COVID\\\\19 Patients.

This study aims to test the hypothesis that magnesium (Mg) treatment leads to DNA methylation changes in TMPRSS2. METHODS: This study is nested within the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial, a double-blind 2  2 factorial randomized controlled trial, which enrolled 250 participants from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. RESULTS: We found that 12 wk of personalized Mg treatment significantly increased 5-methylcytosine methylation at cg16371860 (TSS1500, promoter) by 7.2% compared to the placebo arm (decreased by 0.1%) in those ages < 65 y. The difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex, and baseline methylation as well as correction for false discovery rate (adjusted P = 0.014). Additionally, Mg treatment significantly reduced 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels at cg26337277 (close proximity to TSS200 and the 5' untranslated region, promoter) by 2.3% compared to an increase of 7.1% in the placebo arm after adjusting for covariates in those ages < 65 y (P = 0.003).

To contain spread of the virus, many nations introduced a public lockdown. How the pandemic itself and measures of social restriction affect hospital admissions due to acute cardiac events has rarely been evaluated yet. METHODS AND RESULTS: German public authorities announced measures of social restriction between March 21st and April 20th, 2020. During this period, all patients suffering from an acute cardiac event admitted to our hospital (N = 94) were assessed and incidence rate ratios (IRR) of admissions for acute cardiac events estimated, and compared with those during the same period in the previous three years (2017C2019, N = 361). Admissions due to cardiac events were reduced by 22% as compared to the previous years (n = 94 vs. an average of n = 120 per year for 2017C2019). Whereas IRR for STEMI 1.20 (95% CI 0.67C2.14) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest IRR 0.82 (95% CI 0.33C2.02) remained similar, overall admissions with an IRR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.62C0.98) and IRR for NSTEMI with 0.46 (95% CI 0.27C0.78) were significantly lower. In STEMI patients, plasma concentrations of high-sensitivity troponin T at admission were significantly higher (644 ng/l, IQR 372C2388) compared to 2017C2019 (195 ng/l, IQR 84C1134; p = 0.02).

Recent evidence on the importance of adequately warming and humidifying (conditioning) inhaled air in the nasal cavity for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is discussed, with particular reference to: (i) the relevance of air-borne SARS-CoV-2 transmission, (ii) the nasal epithelium as the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection, (iii) the roles of type 1 and 3 interferons for preventing viral infection of URT epithelial cells, (iv) weaker innate immune responses to respiratory viral infections in URT epithelial cells at suboptimal temperature and humidity, and (v) early innate immune responses in the URT for limiting and eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infections. The available data are consistent with optimal nasal air conditioning reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of the URT and, as a consequence, severe COVID-19. Further studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and viral loads in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in relation to inhaled air temperature, humidity, age, gender, and genetic background are needed in this context. Face masks used for reducing air-borne virus transmission can also promote better nasal air conditioning in cold weather.

To investigate viral spread, primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and host-virus interactions were examined via electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, and gene expression analyses. In HAE cell cultures, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression governed cell tropism and viral load and was up-regulated by infection. Electron microscopy identified intense viral egress from infected ciliated cells and severe cytopathogenesis, culminating in the shedding of ciliated cells packed with virions, providing a large viral reservoir for spread and transmission. Intracellular stores of MUC5AC, a major airway mucin involved in asthma, were rapidly depleted, likely to trap viruses. To mimic asthmatic airways, HAE cells were treated with interleukin-13 (IL-13), which reduced viral titers, viral messenger RNA, and cell shedding, and significantly diminished the number of infected cells. Although mucus hyperproduction played a shielding role, IL-13-treated cells maintained a degree of protection despite the removal of mucus. Using Gene Expression Omnibus databases, bulk RNA-sequencing analyses revealed that IL-13 up-regulated genes controlling glycoprotein synthesis, ion transport, and antiviral processes (albeit not the typical interferon-induced genes) and down-regulated genes involved in cilial function and ribosomal processing. More precisely, we showed that IL-13 reduced ACE2 expression, intracellular viral load, and cell-to-cell transmission while increasing the cilial keratan sulfate coating.

The prevailing COVID-19 pandemic has seen a resurgence of this phenomenon across the world, leaving supermarkets in stockout situations. While panic buying is largely reasoned as a psychological reaction to an extreme event, it is also a socially relevant behaviour as our perception of a crisis can be shaped by our observations and interactions within the society. The social determinants of panic buying behaviour, particularly on how these factors heighten one's perception of scarcity, and trigger panic buying behaviour, are studied. A theoretical model is developed to explain panic buying behaviour in a social context by synthesizing various social and behavioural theories, and the inter-relationship among the latent constructs is analysed using the structural equation modelling approach. Accordingly, an online survey was administered and analysis of the data confirmed that non-coercive social influence, social norm and observational learning directly influence one's perception of scarcity. Additionally, perceived scarcity can motivate panic buying behaviour directly or indirectly through feelings of anticipated regret. This study has contributed to the limited literature on panic buying.

Scopus, Pubmed, Google scholars, Web of Science, and Science direct were used to search all the randomized controlled trials, case-control, and cross-sectional studies that have evaluated the efficacy of Colchicine as a treatment for COVID-19 (up to 28 May 2021). The overall effect of Colchicine versus the control group was determined using a random-effects model meta-analysis where we compared changes (i.e. mean differencesColchicine group vs Control group) between the two conditions in test scores indicative of hospitalization time (day) and mortality rate. The results illustrated Colchicine therapy is associated with a decreased mortality rate in COVID-19 patients and associated with a decrease in hospitalization time (day) in COVID-19 patients. Present preliminary data shows that Colchicine has a beneficial effect on coronavirus disease care in 2019. Therefore, Colchicine can be a good suggestion in the management of COVID-19.","output":"The effectiveness of Colchicine as an anti-inflammatory drug in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019: Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aloe emodin (AE) is a naturally occurring compound with wide spectrum of biological properties, including antimicrobial, vasorelaxant, immunosuppressive and anticancer actions. This anthraquinone induces apoptosis in several tumour cell lines with special affinity to tumours of neuroectodermal origin. High amounts of nitric oxide (NO) released by activated macrophages induce tumour cell death. Therefore, we explored the capacity of AE to modulate NO\\\\mediated antitumour response in vitro. Interestingly, while AE markedly suppressed NO release from macrophages alone, it significantly potentiated NO production in cocultures of macrophages and C6 cells, after 48 h of cultivation. Accordingly, the viability of C6 cells cocultivated with macrophages was reduced in the presence of AE. Moreover, the observed AE\\\\imposed potentiation of NO production in macrophages was closely related to macrophage culture cell density. According to these data, we proposed that NO modulator capacity of AE strongly depended on intercellular contact, indicating that macrophage antitumour response was not compromised but even potentiated by AE.","output":"Capacity of AE to Modulate Nitric Oxide Production Depended on Intercellular Contact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social determinants of health (SDOH) may limit the practice of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk mitigation guidelines with health implications for individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD). Population-based evidence of the association between SDOH and practicing such mitigation strategies in adults with CVD is lacking. We used the National Opinion Research Centers COVID-19 Household Impact Survey conducted between April and June 2020 to evaluate sociodemographic disparities in adherence to COVID-19 risk mitigation measures in a sample of respondents with underlying CVD representing 18 geographic areas of the United States. METHODS: CVD status was ascertained by self-reported history of receiving heart disease, heart attack, or stroke diagnosis. We built de novo, a cumulative index of SDOH burden using education, insurance, economic stability, 30-day food security, urbanicity, neighborhood quality, and integration. We described the practice of measures under the broad strategies of personal protection (mask, hand hygiene, and physical distancing), social distancing (avoiding crowds, restaurants, social activities, and high-risk contact), and work flexibility (work from home, canceling/postponing work). We reported prevalence ratios and 95% CIs for the association between SDOH burden (quartiles of cumulative indices) and practicing these measures adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidity, and interview wave. RESULTS: Two thousand thirty-six of 25 269 (7.0%) adults, representing 8.69 million in 18 geographic areas of the United States, reported underlying CVD. Compared with the least SDOH burden, fewer individuals with the greatest SDOH burden practiced all personal protection (75.6% versus 89.0%) and social distancing measures (41.9% versus 58.9%) and had any flexible work schedule (26.2% versus 41.4%). These associations remained statistically significant after full adjustment: personal protection (prevalence ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.73C0.96]; P=0.009), social distancing (prevalence ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.51C0.94]; P=0.018), and work flexibility (prevalence ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.36C0.79]; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: SDOH burden is associated with lower COVID-19 risk mitigation practices in the CVD population.

Around half of patients were initially asymptomatic and were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 during routine or contact tracing screening. Of them, 33% developed COVID-19 lately. Eventually, predominant part of patients had asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 or mild COVID-19 course. Lymphocytopenia preceding SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a significantly increased risk for severe or critical COVID-19 course. Commonly patients experienced a treatment delay post-SARS-CoV-2; one fifth developed progressive disease (PD) within that time and/or had to undergo therapy modifications following deterioration of the performance status or PD post-COVID-19. This study provides knowledge of real-life clinical courses of SARS-CoV-2 in oncology and contributes to improving therapeutic strategies for cancer patients in the COVID-19 pandemic. ABSTRACT: Oncologists face challenges in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infections and post-SARS-CoV-2 cancer treatment. We analyzed diagnostic, clinical and post-SARS-CoV-2 scenarios in patients from three German cancer centers with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sixty-three patients with SARS-CoV-2 and hematologic or solid neoplasms were included. Thirty patients were initially asymptomatic, 10 of whom developed COVID-19 symptoms subsequently. Altogether 20 (32%) patients were asymptomatic, 18 (29%) had mild, 12 (19%) severe and 13 (20%) critical courses. Lymphocytopenia increased risk of severe/critical COVID-19 three-fold (p = 0.015). Asymptomatic course was not associated with age, remission status, therapies or co-morbidities. Secondary bacterial infection accompanied more than one third of critical COVID-19 cases. Treatment was delayed post-SARS-CoV-2 in 46 patients, 9 of whom developed progressive disease (PD). Cancer therapy was modified in 8 SARS-CoV-2 survivors because of deteriorating performance or PD. At the last follow-up, 17 patients had died from COVID-19 (n = 8) or PD (n = 9) giving an estimated 73% four-month overall survival rate. SARS-CoV-2 infection has a heterogenous course in cancer patients. Lymphocytopenia carries a significant risk of severe/critical COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 disruption of therapy is as serious as SARS-CoV-2 infection itself. Careful surveillance will allow early restart of the anti-cancer treatment.","output":"Diagnostic, Clinical and Post-SARS-CoV-2 Scenarios in Cancer Patients with SARS-CoV-2: Retrospective Analysis in Three German Cancer Centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INDIA- As for reported in 360 COVID-19 cases (till March 22, 2020), seven people were died, and 23 people were treated successfully.1 This virus can easily affect who having respiratory problem and especially who all have been aged older than sixty.

Many cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases use JAKs and STATs to transduce intracellular signals. Mutations in JAK and STAT genes cause a number of immunodeficiency syndromes, and polymorphisms in these genes are associated with autoimmune diseases. The success of small-molecule JAK inhibitors (Jakinibs) in the treatment of rheumatologic disease demonstrates that intracellular signaling pathways can be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity. Tofacitinib, the first rheumatologic Jakinib, is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for rheumatoid arthritis and is currently under investigation for other autoimmune diseases. Many other Jakinibs are in preclinical development or in various phases of clinical trials. This review describes the JAKCSTAT pathway, outlines its role in autoimmunity, and explains the rationale/pre-clinical evidence for targeting JAKCSTAT signaling. The safety and clinical efficacy of the Jakinibs are reviewed, starting with the FDA-approved Jakinib tofacitinib, and continuing on to next-generation Jakinibs.

The result, however, jeopardizes the applicability of the proposition, as exciting as it may be for the academic world; if every company in the world needs to rely on the aforementioned 260 experts, then this will end up an impractical and expensive endeavor.

In the primary analysis, we compared IS patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (IS-COVID) discharged April 1-July 31, 2020 to pre-COVID IS patients discharged in 2019 (IS controls). In a secondary analysis, we compared a matched cohort of IS-COVID patients to patients within the IS controls who had pneumonia (IS-PNA), created with inverse-probability-weighting (IPW). RESULTS: In the primary analysis, we included 166,586 IS controls and 2086 IS-COVID from 312 hospitals in 46 states. Compared to IS controls, IS-COVID were less likely to have hypertension, dyslipidemia, or be smokers, but more likely to be male, younger, have diabetes, obesity, acute renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, venous thromboembolism, intubation, and comorbid intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage (all p&lt;0.05).

The 63-item survey was emailed to members of the Inspire community who had opted-in for research. Results: Out of 19,152 respondents, 4895 (25%) self-reported a cancer diagnosis. Of these, 1337 (27%) were receiving active therapy. Cancer respondents were 66% female, 77% white, 44% college educated, with a median age range 55-65 years. 88% had solid tumors and 12% hematologic malignancies. 241 (5%) had prior COVID-19 and 148 (3%) thought they had had it but were not tested.

A main limitation of current source detection algorithms is that they assume full knowledge of the contact network, which is rarely the case, especially for epidemics, where the source is called patient zero. Inspired by recent contact tracing algorithms, we propose a new framework, which we call Source Detection via Contact Tracing Framework (SDCTF). In the SDCTF, the source detection task starts at the time of the first hospitalization, and initially we have no knowledge about the contact network other than the identity of the first hospitalized agent. We may then explore the network by contact queries, and obtain symptom onset times by test queries in an adaptive way. We also assume that some of the agents may be asymptomatic, and therefore cannot reveal their symptom onset time. Our goal is to find patient zero with as few contact and test queries as possible. We propose two local search algorithms for the SDCTF: the LS algorithm is more data-efficient, but can fail to find the true source if many asymptomatic agents are present, whereas the LS+ algorithm is more robust to asymptomatic agents. By simulations we show that both LS and LS+ outperform state of the art adaptive and non-adaptive source detection algorithms adapted to the SDCTF, even though these baseline algorithms have full access to the contact network. Extending the theory of random exponential trees, we analytically approximate the probability of success of the LS/ LS+ algorithms, and we show that our analytic results match the simulations. Finally, we benchmark our algorithms on the Data-driven COVID-19 Simulator developed by Lorch et al., which is the first time source detection algorithms are tested on such a complex dataset.","output":"Source Detection via Contact Tracing in the Presence of Asymptomatic Patients (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kesadaran masyarakat terhadap masa pandemi ini sangatlah minim, banyak yang menganggap COVID-19 tidak terlalu menyeramkan.

An understanding of barriers to adherence in these populations is needed. In this qualitative study, we examined the patterns of adherence to mitigation measures and reasons underpinning these behaviors. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants from BAME and low-income White backgrounds. The topic guide was designed to explore how individuals are adhering to social distancing and self-isolation during the pandemic and to explore the reasons underpinning this behavior. RESULTS: We identified three categories of adherence to lockdown measures: (i) caution-motivated super-adherence (ii) risk-adapted partial-adherence and (iii) necessity-driven partial-adherence. Decisions about adherence considered potential for exposure to the virus, ability to reduce risk through use of protective measures and perceived importance of/need for the behavior. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights a need for a more nuanced understanding of adherence to lockdown measures. Provision of practical and financial support could reduce the number of people who have to engage in necessity-driven partial-adherence. More evidence is required on population level risks of people adopting risk-adapted partial-adherence.","output":"Understanding patterns of adherence to COVID-19 mitigation measures: a qualitative interview study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the world as we knew it, and medical education is not an exception.

The amplification mechanism relies on plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF) effect. The substrate consists of an assembly of plasmon-coupled and plasmon-uncoupled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) immobilized onto a glass slide. Plasmon-coupled AuNPs are hexagonally arranged along branch patterns whose resonance lies in the red band (675 nm). Plasmon-uncoupled AuNPs are sprinkled onto the substrate, and they exhibit a narrow resonance at 524 nm. Numerical simulations of the plasmonic response of the substrate through the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method reveal the presence of electromagnetic hot spots mainly confined in the interparticle junctions. In order to realize a PEF-based device for potential multiplexing applications, the plasmon resonances are coupled with the emission peak of 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-FAM) fluorophore and with the excitation/emission peaks of cyanine 5 (Cy5). The substrate is implemented in a malaria apta-immunoassay to detect Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH) in human whole blood. Antibodies against Plasmodium biomarkers constitute the capture layer, whereas fluorescently labeled aptamers recognizing PfLDH are adopted as the top layer. The fluorescence emitted by 5-FAM and Cy5 fluorophores are linearly correlated (logarithm scale) to the PfLDH concentration over five decades. The limits of detection are 50 pM (1.6 ng/mL) with the 5-FAM probe and 260 fM (8.6 pg./mL) with the Cy5 probe. No sample preconcentration and complex pretreatments are required. Average fluorescence amplifications of 160 and 4500 are measured in the 5-FAM and Cy5 channel, respectively. These results are reasonably consistent with those worked out by FDTD simulations. The implementation of the proposed approach in multiwell-plate-based bioassays would lead to either signal redundancy (two dyes for a single analyte) or to a simultaneous detection of two analytes by different dyes, the latter being a key step toward high-throughput analysis.","output":"Double-Resonant Nanostructured Gold Surface for Multiplexed Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We provided a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy of available treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: We searched for candidate COVID-19 studies in WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database up to August 19, 2021. Randomized controlled trials for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients published on peer-reviewed journals were included, regardless of demographic characteristics. Outcome measures included mortality, mechanical ventilation, hospital discharge and viral clearance. Bayesian network meta-analysis with fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect sizes using posterior means and 95% equal-tailed credible intervals (CrIs). Odds ratio (OR) was used as the summary measure for treatment effect. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate effect sizes of treatments grouped by the treatment classifications. Results: We identified 222 eligible studies with a total of 102,950 patients. Compared with the standard of care, imatinib, intravenous immunoglobulin and tocilizumab led to lower risk of death; baricitinib plus remdesivir, colchicine, dexamethasone, recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor and tocilizumab indicated lower occurrence of mechanical ventilation; tofacitinib, sarilumab, remdesivir, tocilizumab and baricitinib plus remdesivir increased the hospital discharge rate; convalescent plasma, ivermectin, ivermectin plus doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and proxalutamide resulted in better viral clearance. From the treatment class level, we found that the use of antineoplastic agents was associated with fewer mortality cases, immunostimulants could reduce the risk of mechanical ventilation and immunosuppressants led to higher discharge rates. Conclusions: This network meta-analysis identified superiority of several COVID-19 treatments over the standard of care in terms of mortality, mechanical ventilation, hospital discharge and viral clearance. Tocilizumab showed its superiority compared with SOC on preventing severe outcomes such as death and mechanical ventilation as well as increasing the discharge rate, which might be an appropriate treatment for patients with severe or mild/moderate illness. We also found the clinical efficacy of antineoplastic agents, immunostimulants and immunosuppressants with respect to the endpoints of mortality, mechanical ventilation and discharge, which provides valuable information for the discovery of potential COVID-19 treatments.","output":"Efficacy of COVID-19 Treatments: A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Compassionate use (CU) is a treatment option for patients with serious or life-threatening medical conditions that provides access to locally unlicensed medications (generally free of charge) when all available treatment options have been exhausted and enrollment in a clinical trial is not possible. OBJECTIVE: To examine the disparity in CU access observed across countries and explore the key driving factors. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study analyzed all Novartis CU requests (for individual/named patients and cohort programs) received between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2020, and investigated selected country-specific factors for association with request activity. Data analysis was performed from February 2021 to February 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Country-specific request activity was quantified using request counts and rates per million population and examined in stratified and multivariable analyses (negative-binomial regression) for association with the following covariates: existence of local CU regulations and their public availability, clinical trial activity, population size, and gross domestic product. RESULTS: During the 36-month observation period, 31 711 CU requests were received from 110 countries, 23 194 (73%) of which came from only 10 high-income countries. All high-income countries combined accounted for 27 612 (87%) of all requests, while lower-middle-income and low-income countries contributed only 1021 (3%). Of all requests, 29 870 (94%) were from countries with CU regulations made publicly available on the internet, and higher request activity was demonstrated in countries conducting more clinical trials. Presence and public availability of CU regulations, population size, gross domestic product, and clinical trial activity were independently associated with the CU request activity in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study analyzing Novartis CU requests over a 3-year period, existence and public availability of CU regulations and local clinical trial activity were positively associated with higher CU request rates. The analysis also identified an association between macroeconomic factors and CU request activity, despite the generally free provision of unlicensed therapeutic products. Similar analyses of other comparable experiences are needed to supplement these initial observations. Ultimately, better understanding of factors associated with CU request activity would translate into improved early access to novel lifesaving products for patients with unmet medical needs around the world.","output":"International Country-Level Trends, Factors, and Disparities in Compassionate Use Access to Unlicensed Products for Patients With Serious Medical Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with significant risk of acute thrombosis. We present a case report of a patient with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) associated with COVID-19 and performed a literature review of CVST associated with COVID-19 cases. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman was admitted with severe headache and acute altered mental status a week after confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed diffuse venous sinus thrombosis involving the superficial and deep veins, and diffuse edema of bilateral thalami, basal ganglia and hippocampi because of venous infarction. Her neurological exam improved with anticoagulation (AC) and was subsequently discharged home. We identified 43 patients presenting with CVST associated with COVID-19 infection. 56% were male with mean age of 51.818.2 years old. The mean time of CVST diagnosis was 15.623.7 days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Most patients (87%) had thrombosis of multiple dural sinuses and parenchymal changes (79%). Almost 40% had deep cerebral venous system thrombosis. Laboratory findings revealed elevated mean D-dimer level (7.14/mL12.23 mg/L) and mean fibrinogen level (4.711.93 g/L). Less than half of patients had prior thrombotic risk factors. Seventeen patients (52%) had good outcomes (mRS <=2). The mortality rate was 39% (13 patients).

In a climate of social isolation and disconnectedness, online groups could provide a method of delivering healthcare and support that strengthens social connectedness and reduces isolation. Despite the technology being available, uptake and evidence for online groups is limited. This article shares learnings from a paediatric and adolescent psychology service delivering online groups for young people with chronic health conditions and their healthcare teams. Ideas for how to transfer group process to online platforms are considered, with examples and tips. With sufficient staffing, preparation, thought, creativity and innovation, it is possible for face-to-face groups to successfully be offered online. Caution should be exercised trying to run online groups without these provisions in place, as the safety, comfort and experience of young people could be jeopardised. Further research is needed to better understand group processes online and to consider what is lost and what is gained when comparing online to face-to-face groups.","output":"Keeping young people connected during COVID-19: the role of online groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with immune dysregulation and cytokine storm. Exploring the immune-inflammatory characteristics of COVID-19 patients is essential to reveal pathogenesis and predict progression. In this study, COVID-19 patients showed decreased CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells but increased neutrophils in circulation, exhibiting upregulated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio. IL-6, TNF-, IL-1, IL-18, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-10, Tim-3, IL-8, neutrophil extracellular trap-related proteinase 3, and S100A8/A9 were elevated, whereas IFN- and C-type lectin domain family 9 member A (clec9A) were decreased in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. When compared with influenza patients, the expressions of TNF-, IL-18, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-8, S100A8/A9 and Tim-3 were significantly increased in critical COVID-19 patients, and carcinoembryonic Ag, IL-8, and S100A8/A9 could serve as clinically available hematologic indexes for identifying COVID-19 from influenza. Moreover, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, TNF-, proteinase 3, and S100A8/A9 were increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of severe/critical patients compared with moderate patients, despite decreased CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. Interestingly, bronchoalveolar IL-6, carcinoembryonic Ag, IL-8, S100A8/A9, and proteinase 3 were found to be predictive of COVID-19 severity and may serve as potential biomarkers for predicting COVID-19 progression and potential targets in therapeutic intervention of COVID-19.","output":"The Inflammatory Factors Associated with Disease Severity to Predict COVID-19 Progression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid and low-cost diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to identify the infected subjects, particularly the asymptomatic cases, primarily to arrest the spread of the disease through local transmission.

The negative consequences of lockdowns are presumed to hit even harder on vulnerable groups such as foster children who already struggle with their psychosocial well-being in normal circumstances and who face specific challenges during lockdowns such as: additional help that is no longer available or only offered digitally and physical contact with birth parents that is forbidden. Nevertheless, some scholars point to the positive side of lockdowns (e.g.: relief due to closure of schools). This study aims to asses the psychosocial well-being of Flemish foster children residing in their foster homes during the COVID-19 lockdown and the factors that are associated with the change in their psychosocial well-being. 888 foster parents reported on the psychosocial well-being of just as many foster children through the Brief Assessment Checklist for Children and Adolescents. The COVID-19 lockdown was not associated with a decreased psychosocial well-being of Flemish foster children residing in their foster homes during the lockdown. Foster parents reported a slight improvement in their relationship with their foster child during the lockdown which points to a positive consequence of the lockdown. In addition, this improvement was positively associated with an increased psychosocial well-being during adverse circumstances and should therefore be enhanced. The type and amount of contact with birth parents is significantly associated with foster childrens changed psychosocial well-being during the lockdown. Foster parents who reported an increase in alternative contact (e.g., (video)calls and messages) between their foster child and his/her birth parent(s) during the lockdown, also reported an increase in their foster childs psychosocial well-being during that period.","output":"Psychosocial well-being of Flemish foster children residing in their foster homes during the COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucormycosis is one of the most aggressive invasive mycoses.

OBJECTIVES: A strategy involving the electrostatic interaction between a common antiseptic and a discontinued antibiotic (i.e. octenidine and carbenicillin) was evaluated as a potential treatment for gonorrhoea. Octenidine/carbenicillin is a novel group of uniform materials based on organic salts (GUMBOS) with inherent in vitro antibacterial activity that comes from its parent antiseptic and antibacterial ions, octenidine and carbenicillin, respectively. METHODS: Antibacterial activities for octenidine dihydrochloride, disodium carbenicillin, octenidine/carbenicillin and stoichiometrically equivalent 1:1 octenidine dihydrochloride to disodium carbenicillin were assessed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay for N. gonorrhoeae (ATCC 49226) and three clinical isolates. Predictive permeability using the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay and cytotoxicity against HeLa cells was also evaluated. RESULTS: Additive in vitro antibacterial activities against N. gonorrhoeae were observed in this study, which suggests octenidine/carbenicillin could be a useful agent in reducing N. gonorrhoeae transmission and minimizing gonorrhoea infections. Octenidine/carbenicillin also exhibited bioequivalence to azithromycin and doxycycline, two currently prescribed antibiotics. Likewise, octenidine/carbenicillin had improved predicted permeability compared with octenidine dihydrochloride.

Post-transcriptional regulation is a key step to control gene expression in changing environments and has been reported to play a major role in numerous cellular processes. However, limited reports are available concerning the regulation of PHA accumulation in bacteria, and many essential regulatory factors still need to be identified. Here, we review studies where the synthesis of PHA has been reported to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level, and we analyze the RNA-mediated networks involved.

Nonenteropathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses (PRCVs) have been derived from TGEV. The genetic relationship among six European PRCVs and five coronaviruses of the TGEV antigenic cluster has been determined based on their RNA sequences. The S proteins of six European PRCVs have an identical deletion of 224 amino acids starting at position 21. The deleted area includes the antigenic sites C and B of TGEV S glycoprotein. Interestingly, two viruses (NEB72 and TOY56) with respiratory tropism have the S protein with a similar size to the enteric viruses. NEB72 and TOY56 viruses have 2 and 15 specific amino acid differences with the enteric viruses, respectively. Four of the residues changed are located within the deletion present in the PRCVs and may influence the enteric tropism of TGEV in vivo. A receptor binding site (RBS) used by the virus to infect ST and other cell types might be located between sites A and D of the S glycoprotein, since monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for these sites inhibit the binding of the virus to ST cells. An evolutionary tree relating 13 enteric and respiratory isolates has been proposed. According to this tree, a main virus lineage evolved from a recent progenitor which was circulating around 1941. From this, secondary lineages originated PUR46, NEB72, TOY56, MIL65, BRI70, and the PRCVs, in this order.

Amid economic globalization, prefabricated construction materials are commonly sourced offsite and even offshore. As an issue emerging alongside offshore prefabrication, extended producer responsibility (EPR) is yet to be clearly identified, allocated, and implemented. This research develops a conceptual framework using a design thinking process, through which EPR associated with offshore prefabrication can be analyzed, agreed upon, and allocated. By considering the scope and scale of the responsibility and the procurement methods, the framework comprises four quadrants representing four typical scenarios for implementation of the EPR principle. It is applicable for both short-term and lifelong EPR analysis, in both traditional and integrated project delivery contexts.

In this study, we applied the methodology to multi-omics data from the two largest breast cancer studies. The resultant clusters showed significantly different survival rates in Kaplan-Meier analysis in both datasets. CIBERSORT scores were compared among the identified clusters. Out of the 22 CIBERSORT immune cell types, 9 were commonly significantly different in both datasets, suggesting the difference of tumor immune microenvironment in the clusters. vWCluster can aggregate multi-omics data represented as a vectorial form in a network with multiple layers, taking into account the concordant effect of heterogeneous data, and further identify subgroups of tumors in terms of mortality.","output":"vWCluster: Vector-valued optimal transport for network based clustering using multi-omics data in breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article was inspired by current events. The shopping craze generated by the coronavirus pandemic raised some questions that this article aims to answer by analysing a variety of suppositions. The coronavirus pandemic caused panic shopping amongst consumers, whose motivation for increasing the volumes of shopping revolved around ensuring a safety margin of groceries while also reducing the number of shopping trips. The consumers did most of their shopping in hyper, and supermarkets, as well as in bigger ABCs and grocery stores (Lidl), where theres a wider range of products and larger stock. The average consumer bought much more than the basic groceries during this period. Our research started in March 2020 and ended in May 2020. To validate our assumptions, primary information is derived from the statistical processing of a large number of data from a representative questionnaire survey of 724 respondents. The results show that for many people this period was about stockpiling storages of groceries. Flour saw the biggest increase in purchase volumes, but chicken and pastas were also amongst the more popular items. Stores with the biggest range of selection were able to satisfy this demand. As evidenced by data, consumers also purchased items, which are needed for any household during an emergency and are easy to store in higher volumes. These items include different oils and fats, which are required for cooking, and non-perishables, such as salamis, canned foods, rice and mineral water.","output":"The coronaviruss effect on the decisions and habits of food purchases in Hungary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to analyse the impact that occupational health and safety policies have on employees' work and organisational commitment and, in turn, on their intention to leave the company. METHODS: For this study, we designed a questionnaire with a five-level Likert scale and distributed it among professionals from different companies in the IT consultancy sector in Spain. The data collected from 458 completed questionnaires were analysed using the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique using the SmartPLS software.

As numbers rose, government-led non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, curfews, restrictions on mass gatherings and other physical distancing measures ensued, negatively affecting blood donor mobilisation activities. Objectives: We aimed to assess the blood service activities across 17 National Blood Service Commission (NBSC) centres in Nigeria, including number of blood donations, mobile blood drives, blood units screened, screening outcomes, number of hospitals NBSC provided services to and number of blood units discarded over the study period. Materials and Methods: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood services in 17 NBSC centres in Nigeria, comparing from January-December 2019 (pre-COVID-19) to January-December 2020 (peri-COVID-19). Results: Mobile blood donation drives declined by 100% in the first 2 months following government-imposed lockdowns, the number of all blood donations and voluntary blood donations declined by 9.8%. The number of blood units screened declined by 11.9%, while the number of blood units that screened positive for transfusion-transmissible infections reduced by 28.6%. Discarded blood units reduced by 3.1%, while a 32.6% increase was observed in the number of hospitals that NBSC issued blood for transfusion. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic affected NBSC operations in Nigeria. However, by strengthening hospital linkages and employing innovative strategies, NBSC ensured continuity of operations, thereby significantly managing the challenges of COVID-19 to voluntary blood donor recruitment and the availability of safe blood for transfusion.","output":"COVID-19 impact on Nigeria's national blood service commission - Lessons for Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been a markedly renewed interest in factors associated with pneumonia, a leading cause of death worldwide, due to its frequent concurrence with pandemics of influenza and Covid-19 disease. Reported predisposing factors to both bacterial pneumonia and pandemic viral lower respiratory infections are wintertime occurrence, older age, obesity, pre-existing cardiopulmonary conditions and diabetes. Also implicated are age-related neurodegenerative diseases that cause parkinsonism and dementia. We investigated the prevalence of autopsy-proven pneumonia in the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders (AZSAND), a longitudinal clinicopathological study, between the years 2006 and 2019 and before the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Of 691 subjects dying at advanced ages (mean 83.4), pneumonia was diagnosed postmortem in 343 (49.6%). There were 185 subjects without dementia or parkinsonism while clinicopathological diagnoses for the other subjects included 319 with Alzheimers disease dementia, 127 with idiopathic Parkinsons disease, 72 with dementia with Lewy bodies, 49 with progressive supranuclear palsy and 78 with vascular dementia. Subjects with one or more of these neurodegenerative diseases all had higher pneumonia rates, ranging between 50 and 61%, as compared to those without dementia or parkinsonism (40%). In multivariable logistic regression models, male sex and a non-summer death both had independent contributions (ORs of 1.67 and 1.53) towards the presence of pneumonia at autopsy while the absence of parkinsonism or dementia was a significant negative predictor of pneumonia (OR 0.54). Male sex, dementia and parkinsonism may also be risk factors for Covid-19 pneumonia.

Self-efficacy has been suggested as a protective factor for fatigue. Nonetheless, less is known regarding the underlying mechanisms behind the association. This research aimed to explore the prevalence of fatigue among HCWs during the pandemic, investigate the mediating effect of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and moderating effect of negative coping in the association between self-efficacy and fatigue.Methods. The cross-sectional study employed a sample of 527 HCWs from Anhui Province, China. Self-efficacy, PTSD symptoms, negative coping and fatigue were measured by General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (CSCQ) and 14-item Fatigue Scale (FS-14) respectively.Results. The prevalence of fatigue among HCWs was 56.7%. The effect of self-efficacy on fatigue was partially mediated by PTSD symptoms. Additionally, negative coping moderated both the direct effect of self-efficacy on fatigue and the mediating effect of PTSD symptoms. As revealed by Johnson-Neyman technique, when the standard score of negative coping enhanced to 1.49 and over, the direct association between self-efficacy and fatigue was not significant. Likewise, the effect of self-efficacy on PTSD symptoms had no statistical significance when the standard score of negative coping was ? 1.40 and lower.Conclusions.

Within a year, a few COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized. This unparalleled initiative in developing vaccines created many uncertainties looming around the efficacy and safety of these vaccines. This study aimed to assess the side effects and perceptions following COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing an online survey targeted toward Jordan inhabitants who received any COVID-19 vaccines. Data were statistically analyzed and certain machine learning (ML) tools, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and K-star were used to predict the severity of side effects. Results: A total of 2213 participants were involved in the study after receiving Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and other vaccines (38.2%, 31%, 27.3%, and 3.5%, respectively). Generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). Only 10% of participants suffered from severe side effects; while 39% and 21% of participants had moderate and mild side effects, respectively. Despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against COVID-19 infection. Finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety; while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. Furthermore, based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and side effects, the RF, XGBoost, and MLP gave both high accuracies (0.80, 0.79, and 0.70, respectively) and Cohens kappa values (0.71, 0.70, and 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: The present study confirmed that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. Most of the post-vaccination side effects are mild to moderate, which are signs that bodys immune system is building protection. ML can also be used to predict the severity of side effects based on the input data; predicted severe cases may require more medical attention or even hospitalization.","output":"Side Effects and Perceptions Following COVID-19 Vaccination in Jordan: A Randomized, Cross-Sectional Study Implementing Machine Learning for Predicting Severity of Side Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) is more specific than the tuberculin skin test to discriminate between tuberculosis (TB) and nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases. Here we performed a retrospective study to evaluate the performance of the T-SPOT.TB in patients with NTM diseases. METHODS: Between March, 2013 and Nov, 2015, a total of 58 patients with NTM diseases had a T-SPOT.TB performed were enrolled, 30 patients had definite NTM diseases, 28 had probable diseases. Their clinicopathological characteristics were reviewed and analyzed. Cultures for mycobacteria were performed. The indirect proportion method with L?wensteinCJensen (L-J) medium was used for first-line drug susceptibility test. T-SPOT.TB assay was performed according to the manufacturers instructions. Data were expressed as mean  standard deviation (continuous variables) and as numbers and percentages (categorical variables). The  (2) test was used for comparisons between proportions. RESULTS: The average age was 51.8  16.1 years (range 10 to 77 years), 58.6% (34/58) were male. 16.4% (9/55) were TB-PCR positive. 34 (58.6%) isolates were Mycobacterium intracellulare, ten (17.2%) were Mycobacterium chelonae and seven (12.1%) were Mycobacterium fortuitum. Fifty-two (89.7%) patients were NTM lung disease, five (8.6%) were pleural disease, and one (1.7%) lymphadenitis. The total positivity of T-SPOT.TB was 53.4% (31/58) among the whole group (probable and definite). For probable cases, the T-SPOT.TB assay was positive in 53.5% (15/28); for definite cases, 16 (53.3%) of 30 definite cases were positive. There was no statistical difference in the positivity rate between them (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In the study, we showed that a significant portion of NTM diseases were T-SPOT.TB positive in China. Although T-SPOT.TB is useful diagnostic method for differentiating TB from NTM diseases, in China, the IGRA assay show limited value in the discrimination. In addition, further research is needed to investigate the association between TB infection and treatment for NTM patients.","output":"The performance of interferon-gamma release assay in nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases: a retrospective study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This viewpoint article argues that there is an urgent need to reform the project-based EdTech approach in order to allow EdTech to contribute to the resilience of education systems in the aftermath of Covid-19.

The study aims to measure the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) volume in Scotland. Secondary objectives are to measure the success of restarting elective services and model the time required to bridge the gap left by the first period of suspension. METHODS: A retrospective observational study using the Scottish Arthroplasty Project dataset. All patients undergoing elective THAs and TKAs during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2020 were included. A negative binomial regression model using historical case-volume and mid-year population estimates was built to project the future case-volume of THA and TKA in Scotland. The median monthly case volume was calculated for the period 2008 to 2019 (baseline) and compared to the actual monthly case volume for 2020. The time taken to eliminate the deficit was calculated based upon the projected monthly workload and with a potential workload between 100% to 120% of baseline. RESULTS: Compared to the period 2008 to 2019, primary TKA and THA volume fell by 61.1% and 53.6%, respectively. Since restarting elective services, Scottish hospitals have achieved approximately 40% to 50% of baseline monthly activity. With no changes in current workload, by 2021 there would be a reduction of 9,180 and 10,170 for THA and TKA, respectively. Conversely, working at 120% baseline monthly output, it would take over four years to eliminate the deficit for both TKA and THA. CONCLUSION: This national study demonstrates the significant impact that COVID-19 pandemic has had on overall THA and TKA volume. In the six months after resuming elective services, Scottish hospitals averaged less than 50% normal monthly output.

Previous research on migrant care workers has also highlighted the seeming gap in working conditions relative to native workers. However, lack of disaggregated data on migrant and native care workers, alongside single-case studies, may have concealed potential disadvantages faced by certain groups and insufficiently accounted for differences in migration regimes and organisation of LTC sectors. To address these gaps, we carried out a comparative study on various working conditions of migrant and native LTC workers in Austria and Sweden. Using the international Nordcare survey on care sector working conditions, carried out in Austria in 2017 (n = 792) and in Sweden in 2015 (n = 708), we employed t-tests and multivariate logistic regressions to compare the working conditions of migrant and native carers in home and residential care in each country. We found that worse working conditions in Sweden compared to Austria may be explained by differences in training requirements of the LTC workforce and the relatively large for-profit private sector. Country of origin also plays a paramount role in the differences in working conditions experienced by migrants compared to native care workers, with non-European migrants being more likely to face a number of precarious working conditions. Our findings highlight the need to continue addressing precarious working conditions across the sector, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic where poor working conditions have been linked to increased COVID-related deaths in nursing homes. Our findings also emphasise the importance of policies that consider the various challenges experienced by different migrant groups in the LTC sector, who may particularly be at risk of presenteeism during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Working conditions in the long-term care sector: A comparative study of migrant and native workers in Austria and Sweden."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Love has an enormous effect on mental health.

Personalized peer-to-peer contact tracing through the use of mobile apps has the potential to shift the paradigm. Some countries have deployed centralized tracking systems, but more privacy-protecting decentralized systems offer much of the same benefit without concentrating data in the hands of a state authority or for-profit corporations. Machine learning methods can circumvent some of the limitations of standard digital tracing by incorporating many clues and their uncertainty into a more graded and precise estimation of infection risk. The estimated risk can provide early risk awareness, personalized recommendations and relevant information to the user. Finally, non-identifying risk data can inform epidemiological models trained jointly with the machine learning predictor. These models can provide statistical evidence for the importance of factors involved in disease transmission. They can also be used to monitor, evaluate and optimize health policy and (de)confinement scenarios according to medical and economic productivity indicators.

The economic trend during the pandemic is evaluated, resorting to a mathematical model joining a classical compartmental model including vaccinated individuals with a kinetic model of wealth distribution based on binary wealth exchanges. The interplay between wealth exchanges and the progress of the infectious disease is realized by assuming, on the one hand, that individuals in different compartments act differently in the economic process and, on the other hand, that the epidemic affects risk in economic transactions. Using the mathematical tools of kinetic theory, it is possible to identify the equilibrium states of the system and the formation of inequalities due to the pandemic in the wealth distribution of the population.

Patients who underwent COVID-19 testing and were confirmed to be positive were included and divided into the following three groups based on the presence of CKD or requirement of maintenance dialysis: Non-CKD (participants without CKD), non-dialysis CKD (ND-CKD), and dialysis-dependent CKD (-CKD) patients. We collected data on the development of severe clinical outcomes and death during follow-up. Severe clinical outcomes were defined as the use of inotropics, conventional oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannula, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and the development of AKI, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, or acute heart failure after the diagnosis of COVID-19. AKI was defined as the initiation of renal replacement therapy after the diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients not requiring maintenance dialysis. Death was evaluated according to survival at the end of follow-up. RESULTS: Altogether, 7,341 patients were included. The median duration of data collection was 19 (interquartile range, 11-28) days.

Hazard ratio (HR) for death in the ND-CKD group was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.49-1.26; P = 0.318) compared to the Non-CKD group. The -CKD group had HRs of 2.96 (95% CI, 1.09-8.06; P = 0.033) and 3.77 (95% CI, 1.29-11.06; P = 0.016) compared to the Non-CKD and ND-CKD groups, respectively. -CKD alone was associated with severe clinical outcomes and higher mortality. There was no significant difference in frequency of severe clinical outcomes or mortality rates between the Non-CKD and ND-CKD groups. In patients not requiring maintenance dialysis, AKI was associated with old age, male sex, and high Charlson's comorbidity index score but not with the presence of CKD. HRs for patients with AKI were 11.26 (95% CI, 7.26-17.45; P < 0.001) compared to those for patients without AKI in the multivariate analysis. AKI was associated with severe clinical outcomes and patient survival, rather than underlying CKD. CONCLUSION: CKD requiring dialysis is associated with severe clinical outcomes and mortality in patients with COVID-19; however, the development of AKI is more strongly associated with severe clinical outcomes and mortality.","output":"Association between Chronic Kidney Disease or Acute Kidney Injury and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Untreated progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) type 2, or bile salt exporter protein deficiency, frequently leads to severe pruritus, impaired growth and progressive liver fibrosis with risk of organ failure.

Although more people have been infected and died from the disease among these minority communities, still fewer people in these communities are complying with the suggested public health measures like social distancing. The factors contributing to these ramifications remain a long-lasting debate, in part due to the contested theories between ethnic stratification and ethnic community. To offer empirical evidence to this theoretical debate, we tracked public social-distancing behaviours from mobile phone devices across urban census tracts in the United States and employed a difference-in-difference model to examine the impact of racial/ethnic segregation on these behaviours. Specifically, we focussed on non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic communities at the neighbourhood level from three principal dimensions of ethnic segregation, namely, evenness, exposure, and concentration. Our results suggest that (1) the high ethnic diversity index can decrease social-distancing behaviours and (2) the high dissimilarity between ethnic minorities and non-Hispanic Whites can increase social-distancing behavior;(3) the high interaction index can decrease social-distancing behaviours;and (4) the high concentration of ethnic minorities can increase travel distance and non-home time but decrease work behaviours.

During a gynecological examination, intrauterine fetal death was found, which necessitated premature termination of pregnancy in the 8th gestational week. At the same time the patient was subfebrile and a couple of days later she reported fever up to 39C. Even though the prescribed antibiotics combination, the patient had persistent fever episodes with shivering and tendency to increasing acute phase reactants. The woman was hospitalized in a Clinic of Nephrology in an impaired general condition, where a combination of antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy was performed with unsatisfactory effect.

We sought to characterize and compare the efficacy of a minimally invasive preperitoneal balloon technique (MIB) to standard open packing. METHODS Twenty-six swine were randomized to control (C), open preperitoneal packing technique (OP), and MIB groups. A closed extraperitoneal iliac vascular injury followed by intervention + resuscitation over a 120-minute OP and MIB efficacy was assessed by procedure time, hemodynamics, extraperitoneal tamponade pressures (ETPs), blood loss, and survival. Angiography was performed in select animals, and ETPs were also measured in humans undergoing MIB placement for an elective procedure. RESULTS Baseline parameters (mean arterial pressure [MAP] 29, 38, and 38 mm Hg; cardiac index [CI] 3.5, 3.8, and 4.2; and EPTs 5, 4, and 5 mm Hg) were similar among C, OP, and MIB groups, respectively (all p's > 0.05). The OP and MIB groups had markedly improved MAP and CI versus C. MIB generated significantly higher ETP (28 vs 17 mm Hg), was faster to deploy (164 vs 497 seconds), and had lower total blood loss versus OP (0.7 vs 1.2 L, all p's < 0.05). OP and MIB had equivalent survival times that were significantly improved versus C (91 and 116 vs 43 minutes, p < 0.05). Survival to 2 hours was 80% with OP versus 100% in the MIB group. Angiography showed no active extravasation in both study groups, but controlled partial deflation of the MIB allowed easy visualization of extravasation. Minimally invasive preperitoneal balloon inflation in five human subjects demonstrated a significant increase in mean ETP from 2.4 to 31 mm Hg (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Minimally invasive preperitoneal balloon tamponade was as effective as OP in improving hemodynamics and prolonging survival times, and performed superiorly to OP in time to placement, blood loss, and generation of tamponade pressures. The MIB allows for controlled deflation and reinflation to facilitate angiographic interventions, and may represent a promising new bedside intervention in this patient population.","output":"Preperitoneal balloon tamponade for lethal closed retroperitoneal pelvic hemorrhage in a swine model: A comparable and minimally invasive alternative to open pre-peritoneal pelvic packing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering looming fatality and economic recession, effective policy making based on ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent and standing issue. Numerous issues for controlling infection have arisen from public discussion led by medical professionals. Yet understanding of these factors has been necessarily qualitative and control measures to correct unfavorable trends specific to an infection area have been lacking. The logical implement for control is a large scale stochastic model with countless parameters lacking robustness and requiring enormous data. This paper presents a remedy for this vexing problem by proposing an alternative approach. Machine learning has come to play a widely circulated role in the study of complex data in recent times. We demonstrate that when machine learning is employed together with the mechanistic framework of a mathematical model, there can be a considerably enhanced understanding of complex systems. A mathematical model describing the viral infection dynamics reveals two transmissibility parameters influenced by the management strategies in the area for the control of the current pandemic. Both parameters readily yield the peak infection rate and means for flattening the curve, which is correlated to different management strategies by employing machine learning, enabling comparison of different strategies and suggesting timely alterations. Treatment of population data with the model shows that restricted non-essential business closure, school closing and strictures on mass gathering influence the spread of infection. While a rational strategy for initiation of an economic reboot would call for a wider perspective of the local economics, the model can speculate on its timing based on the status of the infection as reflected by its potential for an unacceptably renewed viral onslaught.","output":"A model to rate strategies for managing disease due to COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The phytotherapeutic properties of Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) extract are mainly attributed to glycyrrhizin (GR) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA).

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among adults hospitalized with severe and critical COVID-19 at five sites in New York City (USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single transfusion of either convalescent plasma or placebo (normal control plasma). The primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days following randomization, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: Of 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in clinical status was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (OR 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-2.68, p=0.180). However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, p=0.034).

Our study aimed at finding the scalp area providing valuable information about brain activity under general anesthesia (GA) to select the more optimal EEG channel to characterized the DoA. We included 30 patients undergoing elective, minor surgery under GA and used a 32-channel EEG to record their electrical brain activity. In addition, we recorded their physiological parameters and the BIS monitor. Each individual EEG channel data were processed to test their ability to differentiate awake from asleep states. Due to strict quality criteria adopted for the EEG data and the difficulties of the real-life setting of the study, only 8 patients recordings were taken into consideration in the final analysis. Using 2 classification algorithms, we identified the optimal channels to discriminate between asleep and awake states: the frontal and temporal F8 and T7 were retrieved as being the two bests channels to monitor DoA. Then, using only data from the F8 channel, we tried to minimize the number of features required to discriminate between the awake and asleep state. The best algorithm turned out to be the Gaussian Na?ve Bayes (GNB) requiring only 5 features (Area Under the ROC Curve - AUC- of 0.93  0.04).

Methods: The model was designed using computer-aided design software and printed using a stereolithography 3D printer. The eyelid and eyeball were synthesized from polyvinyl alcohol and silicone material, respectively. Simulated tear fluid was infused through tubing attached to the eyelid using a syringe pump. With each blink cycle, the eyelid slides and flexes across the eyeball to create an artificial tear film layer. The flow-through fluid was collected using a specialized trough. Two contact lenses, etafilcon A and senofilcon A, were incubated in 2 mL of a water-soluble red dye for 24 h and then placed on the eye model (n = 3). The release of the dye was measured over 24 h using a tear flow rate of 5 L/min. Results: Approximately 25% of the fluid that flowed over the eye model was lost due to evaporation, nonspecific absorption, and residual dead volume. Senofilcon A absorbed more dye (47.6  2.7 L) than etafilcon A (22.3  2.0 L). For etafilcon A, the release of the dye followed a burst-plateau profile in the vial but was sustained in the eye model. For senofilcon A, the release of the dye was sustained in both the vial and the eye model, though more dye was released in the vial (p < 0.05). Overall, the release of the dye from the contact lenses was higher in the vial compared with the eye model (p < 0.05).

However, the accumulation of substitutions in the antigenic regions of HA (i.e., antigenic drift) occasionally results in a mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains. To prevent poor vaccine performance, we investigated whether an antigenically matched neuraminidase (NA) may compensate for reduced vaccine efficacy due to a mismatched HA. Ferrets were vaccinated twice with adjuvanted split inactivated influenza vaccines containing homologous HA and NA (vacH3N2), only homologous HA (vacH3N1), only homologous NA (vacH1N2), heterologous HA and NA (vacH1N1), or phosphate-buffered saline (vacPBS), followed by challenge with H3N2 virus (A/Netherlands/16190/1968). Ferrets vaccinated with homologous HA (vacH3N2 and vacH3N1) displayed minimum fever and weight loss compared to vacH1N1 and vacPBS ferrets, while ferrets vaccinated with NA-matched vacH1N2 displayed intermediate fever and weight loss. Vaccination with vacH1N2 further led to a reduction in virus shedding from the nose and undetectable virus titers in the lower respiratory tract, similarly to when the homologous vacH3N2 was used. Some protection was observed upon vacH1N1 vaccination, but this was not comparable to that observed for vacH1N2, again highlighting the important role of NA in vaccine-induced protection. These results illustrate that NA antibodies can prevent severe disease caused by influenza virus infection and that an antigenically matched NA in seasonal vaccines might prevent lower respiratory tract complications. This underlines the importance of considering NA during the yearly vaccine strain selection process, which may be particularly beneficial in seasons when the HA component of the vaccine is mismatched. IMPORTANCE Despite the availability of vaccines, influenza virus infections continue to cause substantial morbidity and mortality in humans. Currently available influenza vaccines take primarily the hemagglutinin (HA) into account, but the highly variable nature of this protein as a result of antigenic drift has led to a recurrent decline in vaccine effectiveness. While the protective effect of neuraminidase (NA) antibodies has been highlighted by several studies, there are no requirements with regard to quantity or quality of NA in licensed vaccines, and NA immunity remains largely unexploited. Since antigenic changes in HA and NA are thought to occur asynchronously, NA immunity could compensate for reduced vaccine efficacy when drift in HA occurs. By matching and mismatching the HA and NA components of monovalent split inactivated vaccines, we demonstrated the potential of NA immunity to protect against disease, virus replication in the lower respiratory tract, and virus shedding in the ferret model.","output":"Contribution of Neuraminidase to the Efficacy of Seasonal Split Influenza Vaccines in the Ferret Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology and biology of ARDS has identified a number of promising cellular and pharmacological therapies.

Furthermore, a number of promising mesenchymal stromal cell therapy clinical studies for COVID-19-induced ARDS are underway. Recent studies provide support for several emerging ARDS pharmacotherapies, including steroids, statins, vitamins, anticoagulants, interferons, and carbon monoxide. The history of unsuccessful clinical trials of potential therapies highlights the challenges to successful translation for this heterogeneous clinical syndrome. Given this, attention has focused on the potential to identify biologically homogenous subtypes within ARDS, to enable us to target more specific therapies, i.e. 'precision medicines'. SUMMARY Mesenchymal stromal cells, steroids, statins, vitamins, anticoagulants, interferons and carbon monoxide have therapeutic promise for ARDS. Identifying ARDS sub-populations most likely to benefit from targeted therapies may facilitate future advances.","output":"Emerging cellular and pharmacologic therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, few studies have examined the aerosol microbial content in Metro transportation systems. Here we characterised the aerosol microbial abundance, diversity and composition in the Athens underground railway system. PM10 filter samples were collected from the naturally ventilated Athens Metro Line 3 station \\"Nomismatokopio\\". Quantitative PCR of the 16S rRNA gene and high throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was performed on DNA extracted from PM10 samples. Results showed that, despite the bacterial abundance (mean = 2.82  105 16S rRNA genes/m3 of air) being, on average, higher during day-time and weekdays, compared to night-time and weekends, respectively, the differences were not statistically significant. The average PM10 mass concentration on the platform was 107 g/m3. However, there was no significant correlation between 16S rRNA gene abundance and overall PM10 levels. The Athens Metro air microbiome was mostly dominated by bacterial and fungal taxa of environmental origin (e.g. Paracoccus, Sphingomonas, Cladosporium, Mycosphaerella, Antrodia) with a lower contribution of human commensal bacteria (e.g. Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus). This study highlights the importance of both outdoor air and commuters as sources in shaping aerosol microbial communities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterise the mycobiome diversity in the air of a Metro environment based on amplicon sequencing of the ITS region. In conclusion, this study presents the first microbial characterisation of PM10 in the Athens Metro, contributing to the growing body of microbiome exploration within urban transit networks. Moreover, this study shows the vulnerability of public transport to airborne disease transmission.","output":"Bioaerosols in the Athens Metro: Metagenetic insights into the PM10 microbiome in a naturally ventilated subway station"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In only a few months, the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic, leaving physicians, scientists, and public health officials racing to understand, treat, and contain this zoonotic disease SARS-CoV-2 has made the leap from animals to humans, but little is known about variations in species susceptibility that could identify potential reservoir species, animal models, and the risk to pets, wildlife, and livestock While there is evidence that certain species, such as cats, are susceptible, the vast majority of animal species, including those in close contact with humans, have unknown susceptibility Hence, methods to predict their infection risk are urgently needed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critical for viral cell entry and infection Here we identified key ACE2 residues that distinguish susceptible from resistant species using in-depth sequence and structural analyses of ACE2 and its binding to SARS-CoV-2 Our findings have important implications for identification of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 residues for therapeutic targeting and identification of animal species with increased susceptibility for infection on which to focus research and protection measures for environmental and public health","output":"Which animals are at risk?

The mixed method study reported in this article compared Polish undergraduate students' cognitive, affective, and behavioural responses to assessment provided in two practical English phonetics courses taught during an in-class fall semester and online spring semester. The quantitative data were collected by means of an online questionnaire, which consisted of three categories of semantic differential scales referring to the cognitive, affective, and behavioural responses. The qualitative data consisted of drawings, open-ended surveys, and individual interviews with the students. The t-test results showed significant differences in students' perceptions in terms of cognitive and behavioural aspects. The qualitative data revealed that although the students highly valued formative assessment in the course, the online mode weakened their engagement and interest in receiving feedback. It was also observed that students' perceptions of in-class and online assessment were shaped largely by their individual differences and learning preferences. The study underlies the importance of using anxiety-lowering techniques in both in-class and online classes, and the need for fostering undergraduate students' autonomous learning skills. ? 2021 Universidad de Antioquia.

Out of 11 curated screened compounds, we found the significant docking score for tinosponone, xanosporic acid, cardiofolioside B, tembetarine and berberine in Tinospora cordifolia. Based on the findings of the docking study, it was confirmed that tinosponone is the potent inhibitor of main protease of SARS-CoV-2 with the best binding affinity of ?7.7 kcal/mol. Further, ADME along with toxicity analysis was studied to predict the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of five top hits compounds. The molecular dynamics simulation analysis confirmed the stability of tinosponone and 3CL pro complex with a random mean square deviation (RMSD) value of 0.1 nm. The computer-aided drug design approach proved that the compound tinosponone from T. cordifolia is a potent inhibitor of 3CL main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Further, the in vitro and in vivo-based testing will be required to confirm its inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

BMP-2 is localized in the gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) micropatterns on hydrophilic semi-permeable membrane (SNM), and its controlled release is regulated by the concentration of GelMA hydrogel and BMP-2. The controlled release of BMP-2 is verified using computational analysis and quantified using fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) diffusion model. The osteogenic differentiation of osteosarcoma MG-63 cells is manipulated by localized and controlled BMP-2 release. The calcium deposits are significantly higher and the actin skeletal networks are denser in MG-63 cells cultured in the BMP-2-immobilized GelMA micropattern than in the absence of BMP-2. The proposed BMP-2 carrier is expected to not only act as a barrier membrane that can prevent invasion of connective tissue during bone regeneration, but also as a carrier capable of localizing and controlling the release of BMP-2 due to GelMA micropatterning on SNM. This approach can be extensively applied to tissue engineering, including the localization and encapsulation of cells or drugs.","output":"Locally Controlled Diffusive Release of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 Using Micropatterned Gelatin Methacrylate Hydrogel Carriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The outbreak of the new coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) was initiated in December 2019, and within a couple of months it became a global health emergency. Given the importance to assess the evolution and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to forecast the next scenario of the pandemic, mainly in countries with limited healthcare systems, we estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India, and a possible scenario for this pandemic in the region. SUBJECT AND METHODS: We estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in its first outbreak stage in the northwestern region of Himalaya, India, and we also predicted new daily cases for the next 90 days using different R0, testing a plausible end of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. RESULTS: Our results showed a considerable increase in the number of cases, but with a tendency to asymptote. Anantnag, Bandipora, Baramulla, Shopian, and Srinagar districts showed more than 100 cases and Kulgam and Kathua districts showed strong growth of the number of cases from the beginning of May, without a tendency to normalization. The estimated R0 for the J&K region was 1.041; but by decreasing the RO by 10, 25, and 50%, we observed a great decrease in the daily number of new cases, especially by decreasing by 50%. CONCLUSION: In this study, we indicate positive effects of the preventive measures, such as lockdown and social distancing, taken in the J&K region, showing a stabilization of the growth curves of new cases of SARS-CoV-2, which tends to a strong decrease over time as the R0 decreases.","output":"Predicted impacts of government policies and actions on the SARS-CoV-2 disease in the northwestern Himalayan region, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following an outbreak of a novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, rapid community, regional and international spread has occurred across the globe, with exponential growth in the number of cases and deaths On 30 January 2020, the Director-General (DG) of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) The first case in the Americas was confirmed in the USA on 20 January 2020, followed by Brazil on 26 February 2020 COVID-19 has now spread to all 54 countries and territories in the Americas By 26 May 2020, cases and deaths in Latin America surpassed Europe and the United States in the daily number of reported coronavirus infections By June, two of the three countries with the highest number of reported cases are in the Americas, making this region the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Pan American Health Organization Response to COVID-19 in the Americas, 17 January to 31 May 2020"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/62.md","filePath":"doctor/62.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/62.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
