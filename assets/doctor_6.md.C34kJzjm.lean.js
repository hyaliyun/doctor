However, From isolation to identification of H. influenzae, the traditional diagnose strategy was time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, the establishment of a convenient, highly sensitive, and stable detection system is urgent and critical. RESULTS: In this study, we used a combined method to detect H. influenzae. Six specific primers were designed on the basis of outer membrane protein P6 gene sequence of H. influenzae. The reaction condition such as the optimum temperature was 65, and the optimum reaction time was 30 min, respectively. Through the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in combination with nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (LFB), the sensitivity of LAMP-LFB showed 100 fg was the lowest genomic DNA templates concentration in the pure cultures. Meanwhile, the specificity of H. influenzae-LAMP-LFB assay showed the exclusive positive results, which were detected in H. influenzae templates. In 55 clinical sputum samples, 22 samples were positive with LAMP-LFB method, which was in accordance with the traditional culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method. The accuracy in diagnosing H. influenzae with LAMP-LFB could reach 100%, compared to culture and PCR method, indicating the LAMP-LFB had more advantages in target pathogen detection. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, LAMP-LFB could be used as an effective diagnostic approach for H. influenzae in the conditions of basic and clinical labs, which would allow clinicians to make better informed decisions regarding patient treatment without delay.

These systems are commonly based on patient complaints, while the need for timely interventions on regular hospital wards is usually assessed with early warning scores (EWS). We aim to directly compare the ability of currently used triage scales and EWS scores to recognise patients in need of urgent care in the ED. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-centre study on all patients who presented to the ED of a Dutch Level 1 trauma centre, between 1 September 2018 and 24 June 2020 and for whom a Netherlands Triage System (NTS) score as well as a Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) was recorded. The performance of these scores was assessed using surrogate markers for true urgency and presented using bar charts, cross tables and a paired area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We identified 12 317 unique patient visits where NTS and MEWS scores were documented during triage. A paired comparison of the AUC of these scores showed that the MEWS score had a significantly better AUC than the NTS for predicting the need for hospital admission (0.65 vs 0.60; p<0.001) or 30-day all-cause mortality (0.70 vs 0.60; p<0.001). Furthermore, when non-urgent MEWS scores co-occur with urgent NTS scores, the MEWS score seems to more accurately capture the urgency level that is warranted.

Previous studies of infectious diseases showed that infectious diseases not only cause physical damage to infected individuals but also damage to the mental health of the public. Therefore this study aims to analyze the factors that affected depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide evidence for COVID-19-related mental health policies and to emphasize the need to prepare for mental health issues related to potential infectious disease outbreaks in the future. RESULTS: This study performed the following statistical analyses to analyze the factors that influence depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, to confirm the level of depression in the public in each country, the participants' depression was plotted on a Boxplot graph for analysis. Second, to confirm personal and national factors that influence depression in individuals, a multi-level analysis was conducted. As a result, the median Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score for all participants was 6. The median was higher than the overall median for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Paraguay, suggesting a higher level of depression. In personal variables, depression was higher in females than in males, and higher in participants who had experienced discrimination due to COVID-19 than those who had not. In contrast, depression was lower in older participants, those with good subjective health, and those who practiced personal hygiene for prevention. In national variables, depression was higher when the Government Response Stringency Index score was higher, when life expectancy was higher, and when social capital was higher. In contrast, depression was lower when literacy rates were higher. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that depression was higher in participants living in countries with higher stringency index scores than in participants living in other countries. Maintaining a high level of vigilance for safety cannot be criticized. However, in the current situation, where coexisting with COVID-19 has become inevitable, inflexible and stringent policies not only increase depression in the public, but may also decrease resilience to COVID-19 and compromise preparations for coexistence with COVID-19. Accordingly, when establishing policies such as social distancing and quarantine, each country should consider the context of their own country.","output":"Analysis of personal and national factors that influence depression in individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic: a web-based cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To estimate the prevalence of unpaid caregiving during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to identify factors associated with adverse mental health symptoms, substance use, and suicidal ideation in this population, which provides critical support in health care systems by providing care to older adults and those with chronic conditions.

It is unknown whether deprivation mediates this excess ethnic risk. METHODS: We used UK Biobank with linked COVID-19 outcomes occurring between 16th March 2020 and 24th August 2020. A four-way decomposition mediation analysis was used to model the extent to which the excess risk of testing positive, severe disease and mortality for COVID-19 in South Asian and black individuals, relative to white individuals, would be eliminated if levels of high material deprivation were reduced within the population. RESULTS: We included 15 044 (53.0% women) South Asian and black and 392 786 (55.2% women) white individuals. There were 151 (1.0%) positive tests, 91 (0.6%) severe cases and 31 (0.2%) deaths due to COVID-19 in South Asian and black individuals compared with 1471 (0.4%), 895 (0.2%) and 313 (0.1%), respectively, in white individuals.

A responsible Internet accomplishes this through two new distributed and decentralized systems. The first is the Network Inspection Plane (NIP), which enables users to request measurement-based descriptions of the chains of network operators (e.g., ISPs and DNS and cloud providers) that handle their data flows or could potentially handle them, including the relationships between them and the properties of these operators. The second is the Network Control Plane (NCP), which allows users to specify how they expect the Internet infrastructure to handle their data (e.g., in terms of the security attributes that they expect chains of network operators to have) based on the insights they gained from the NIP. We discuss research directions and starting points to realize a responsible Internet by combining three currently largely disjoint research areas: large-scale measurements (for the NIP), open source-based programmable networks (for the NCP), and policy making (POL) based on the NIP and driving the NCP.

Around 70% of the coronavirus positive-sense single-stranded RNA encodes proteins involved in replication, and these viruses essentially take over the biosynthetic and transport mechanisms to ensure the efficient replication of their genome and trafficking of their virions. Some coronaviruses encode genes for ion-channel proteins - the envelope protein E (orf4a), orf3a and orf8 - which they successfully employ to take control of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex intermediate compartment or ERGIC. The E protein, which is one of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, assembles its transmembrane protomers into homopentameric channels with mild cationic selectivity. Orf3a forms homodimers and homotetramers. Both carry a PDZ-binding domain, lending them the versatility to interact with more than 400 target proteins in infected host cells. Orf8 is a very short 29-amino-acid single-passage transmembrane peptide that forms cation-selective channels when assembled in lipid bilayers.

Older adults may be particularly vulnerable. Coping strategies to manage stress can also impact health outcomes by modifying the relationships between perceived stress and health outcomes. This study examined concurrent and longitudinal associations between perceived stress and sleep health, mental health, physical health, and overall perceived health outcomes among older adults. We also examined whether coping strategies moderate these associations. METHODS: Older adults (n = 115; Mage = 68.62, 58.3% female) reported perceived stress (PSS), coping strategies (Brief COPE), global sleep quality (PSQI global sleep quality score and dichotomous good/poor sleep quality), depressive symptoms (CES-D), and perceived mental, physical, and overall health (RAND-12) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The number of individuals with poor sleep quality was greater during the COVID-19 pandemic than before (50% vs. 36.5%). Participants also reported poorer physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. Hierarchical linear regression and hierarchical logistic regression revealed that higher perceived stress was cross-sectionally associated with poorer sleep (e.g., higher total PSQI score and dichotomous sleep quality category). Higher perceived stress was associated with worse depressive symptoms and global mental health concurrently and longitudinally. Coping strategies moderated the relationships between perceived stress and physical health and overall perceived health. For example, higher perceived stress was associated with poorer overall perceived health for those who have lower problem-focused copingbut not for those with higher problem-focused copingboth concurrently and longitudinally. CONCLUSION: Perceived stress influences cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of sleep health and general health among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coping strategies can moderate the effects of perceived stress on health outcomes.

Data was collected in 2019 through purposive sampling, including dyads from a differentiated socio-economic background and gender. RESULTS: The analysis reveals four non-exclusive pathways into caregiving. One pathway is associated with single turning events occurring in family or work trajectories of carers that expanded the possibilities for caregiving later in life. A second pathway referred to cumulative processes that later influenced transitions into caregiving, such as personal biographies marked by weak labour market attachment. Another cumulative pathway, exclusive to caregiving, is characterized by continued and sustained exchanges of support within families that cement reciprocal ties that underpin caregiving at later stages. In the fourth pathway, life trajectories of siblings, but also family relationships and conflicts constrained carers into their role.

Dance and music have been shown to positively affect mood and mental health in individuals, helping to increase compliance of physical activity. Group settings provide evidence for increasing compliance through improving patient's sense of belonging, self-confidence and social engagement. This pilot looks at combining the enjoyment of dance to music in a group setting with physiotherapy strengthening and core exercises to increase engagement, We aim to evaluate the outcome measures to direct the formation of a larger scale study. Methods: The pilot study included children aged 8C16 years old referred by Southampton Paediatric Physiotherapy team with a diagnosis of hypermobility, poor postural fitness and deconditioning with an interest in dance. Children were excluded if they were 7 years old or younger and if they would be unable to follow a group session. The group comprised of a four week (once weekly) group for 45 min consisting of group exercise with warm up, 15 min dance cardio fitness including balance, strengthening, core stability, and cool down sections. A questionnaire assessing patients perceived fitness, pain and overall enjoyment was the outcome measure completed at the beginning and end of the group. Results: Two patients attended the group between November 2020 and December 2020. The post group questionnaire showed both patients found the group very useful or extremely useful. The questionnaire also showed an improvement in sporting activity post group. Both patients also stated an interest in repeating the group and found that it was a positive experience for young people of their age to do fitness in a safe environment. The Coronavirus Pandemic impacted on the sample size of this pilot. Conclusion(s): The results of this small sample pilot have shown very positive outcomes. The pilot highlights the success of using dance as a positive motivator to increase physical activity in those deconditioned and hypermobile patients.

IPC site visits were made. Seven further mass testing rounds were completed at 5-7-day intervals. Data collation and descriptive analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel. There were 56 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases associated with the outbreak (28 residents, 28 staff). Overall attack rate was 52.8% (66.7% for residents, 44.0% for staff). Over half of all cases (51.7%) were detected from the first and second mass testing rounds (positivity rates 34.2% and 27.8% respectively) in the first week of the outbreak. Mean age of resident cases was 81.5 years. The majority (96.4%) were symptomatic (diarrhoea 64.3%, fever 57.1% and anorexia 25%). Hospitalisation and case fatality rates for residents were 21.4% and 41.4% respectively. Mean age of staff cases was 35.5 years. One-quarter were asymptomatic, with no hospitalisations or deaths. The outbreak was declared over on February 16th 2021. Residents of long-term care facilities are extremely vulnerable to COVID-19. Mass testing is a critically important outbreak control strategy which can facilitate rapid case finding and contact tracing in these settings, minimising the potential for further spread of infection and harm to residents and staff. Key messages Residents of long-term care facilities are extremely vulnerable to COVID-19, and may present with atypical clinical symptoms and signs of this disease. A low threshold for testing is required. Mass testing is a crucial COVID-19 outbreak control strategy in long-term care facilities to enable rapid case finding and contact tracing, minimising the potential for further spread of infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in a long-term care facility: lessons learnt and importance of repeated mass testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The understanding of calcium phosphate precipitation has been a major interest in different fields of science, including medicine, biomaterials, and physical chemistry. The presence of additive biomacromolecules has been known to influence various stages of precipitation process from nucleation to crystal growth. In the current work, well-defined sequences of short, negatively charged peptides, oligo(L-glutamic acids), were utilized as a model of the contiguous sequence of acidic amino acids in natural biomineralization proteins. The precipitate morphology and phases, the element time profile in solution and in the precipitates, as well as the kinetics during the precipitation process were analyzed to explain the effect of these short peptides on calcium phosphate precipitation. The results show that peptides can delay the phase transformation of an amorphous precursor phase to hydroxyapatite and that there is an optimal chain length for this effect at a given concentration of peptide. This study is the first part of a two-part series and is followed with a subsequent work to reveal the mechanism by which these short peptides influence the calcium phosphate precipitation.","output":"Oligo(L-Glutamic Acids) in Calcium Phosphate Precipitation: Chain Length Effect."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many of our routines and activities are linked to our ability to move; be it commuting to work, shopping for groceries, or meeting friends. Yet, factors that limit the individuals ability to fully realise their mobility needs will ultimately affect the opportunities they can have access to (e.g. cultural activities, professional interactions). One important aspect frequently overlooked in human mobility studies is how gender-centred issues can amplify other sources of mobility disadvantages (e.g. socioeconomic inequalities), unevenly affecting the pool of opportunities men and women have access to. In this work, we leverage on a combination of computational, statistical, and information-theoretical approaches to investigate the existence of systematic discrepancies in the mobility diversity (i.e. the diversity of travel destinations) of (1) men and women from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and (2) work and non-work travels. Our analysis is based on datasets containing multiple instances of large-scale, official, travel surveys carried out in three major metropolitan areas in South America: Medelln and Bogot in Colombia, and S?o Paulo in Brazil. Our results indicate the presence of general discrepancies in the urban mobility diversities related to the gender and socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals.

These cells constitutively or inducibly express a number of receptors of the TNFR and TLR families, whose signals are transduced by TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) molecules. In vitro studies showed that TRAF3 is required for TLR-induced type I IFN production, but the in vivo function of TRAF3 in myeloid cells remains unknown. In this article, we report the generation and characterization of myeloid cell-specific TRAF3-deficient (M-TRAF3(-/-)) mice, which allowed us to gain insights into the in vivo functions of TRAF3 in myeloid cells. We found that TRAF3 ablation did not affect the maturation or homeostasis of myeloid cells in young adult mice, even though TRAF3-deficient macrophages and neutrophils exhibited constitutive NF-B2 activation. However, in response to injections with LPS (a bacterial mimic) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (a viral mimic), M-TRAF3(-/-) mice exhibited an altered profile of cytokine production. M-TRAF3(-/-) mice immunized with T cell-independent and -dependent Ags displayed elevated T cell-independent IgG3 and T cell-dependent IgG2b responses. Interestingly, 15- to 22-mo-old M-TRAF3(-/-) mice spontaneously developed chronic inflammation or tumors, often affecting multiple organs. Taken together, our findings indicate that TRAF3 expressed in myeloid cells regulates immune responses in myeloid cells and acts to inhibit inflammation and tumor development in mice.","output":"Myeloid cell TRAF3 regulates immune responses and inhibits inflammation and tumor development in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outcomes of mitral valve replacement (MVR) in pediatrics especially in the patients weighing less than 10 kg are not always favorable. This study aimed to measure long-term outcomes of MVR in our institution. METHODS: Nine young children weighing less than 10 kg underwent MVR with mechanical prostheses were enrolled in this retrospectively study. KaplanCMeier survival analysis was used for the prediction of freedom from death and adverse events. Chi-square test was performed to compare outcomes for patients with different ratios of mechanical prosthesis size and body weight. Fourteen related literatures were also reviewed to support our study. RESULTS: All patients received bileaflet mechanical prostheses replacement. The surgical technique varied among the patients with prostheses implanted in the intra-annular (n = 5), supra-annular (n = 1), or with a Dacron conduit segment in the supra-annular position (n = 3). The valve size/weight ratio ranged from 2.11 to 5.00. There were two early death and one late death post-operation. The mean follow-up period was 80.67  63.37 months, the transvalvular gradient was 10.5  1.76 mmHg (range 8 to 12) and the peak gradient of LVOT was 5.00  0.64 mmHg. One (11.1%) patient underwent an immediate revision MVR after initial MVR due to the periprosthetic leak. No patients required surgical reintervention or permanent pacemaker placement during long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The tailored surgical strategy utilized for MVR in infants resulted in reliable valve function and excellent survival. Although revision is inevitable due to somatic growth, the bileaflet mechanical prostheses displayed appropriate durability.

The first-quarter financial statements are reported with weak monitoring of accounting information, resulting in managers' opportunistic attitudes. We used discretionary asset impairment losses not the actual asset impairment amount, and the two-way fixed effect panel regression model was used to control the unique characteristics of individual companies. We investigated whether asset impairment losses were underreported in 2020 compared to the other year during the period 2015 through 2020. In addition, we identified under what conditions these effects would be enhanced or weakened. The analysis showed that managers underreported discretionary asset impairment losses in the first quarter of 2020 (hypothesis 1). This result indicates that manager's discretionary propensity to delay impairment loss recognition as much as possible until annual profit is finalized and to report quarterly profit as high has increased due to Covid19. Such a tendency was more pronounced among the firms with higher proportion of overseas assets (hypothesis 2) and was weakened among the firms with larger difference in earnings response coefficient measured by the operating profit and that measured by non-operating profit (hypothesis 3). Finally, firms with income-increasing earnings management in the previous year were insignificantly less inclined to underreport discretionary asset impairment loss during the first quarter of 2020 (hypothesis 4). ? 2021, Korean Accounting Association.

Exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries) has been consistently considered the main source of primary human infection. Although Saudi Arabia reports the highest rate of human MERS\\\\CoV infection and has one of the largest populations of dromedary camels worldwide, their spatial association has not yet been investigated. Thus, this study aimed to examine the correlation between the spatial distribution of primary MERS\\\\CoV cases with or without a history of camel exposure reported between 2012 and 2019 and dromedary camels at the provincial level in Saudi Arabia. In most provinces, a high proportion of older men develop infections after exposure to camels. Primary human infections during spring and winter were highest in provinces characterized by seasonal breeding and calving, increased camel mobilization and camelChuman interactions. A strong and significant association was found between the total number of dromedary camels and the numbers of primary camel\\\\exposed and non\\\\exposed MERS\\\\CoV cases. Furthermore, spatial correlations between MERS\\\\CoV cases and camel sex, age and dairy status were significant. Via a cluster analysis, we identified Riyadh, Makkah and Eastern provinces as having the most primary MERS\\\\CoV cases and the highest number of camels. Transmission of MERS\\\\CoV from camels to humans occurs in most primary cases, but there is still a high proportion of primary infections with an ambiguous link to camels. The results from this study include significant correlations between primary MERS\\\\CoV cases and camel populations in all provinces, regardless of camel exposure history. This supports the hypothesis of the role of an asymptomatic human carrier or, less likely, an unknown animal host that has direct contact with both infected camels and humans.

These risks are often related, but not limited, to transmissible pathogens. Mobile populations can link zones of disease emergence to lowprevalence or nonendemic areas through rapid or high-volume international movements, or both. Against this background of human movement, other global processes such as economics, trade, transportation, environment and climate change, as well as civil security influence the health impacts of disease emergence. Concurrently, global information systems, together with regulatory frameworks for disease surveillance and reporting, affect organizational and public awareness of events of potential public health significance. International regulations directed at disease mitigation and control have not kept pace with the growing challenges associated with the volume, speed, diversity, and disparity of modern patterns of human movement. The thesis that human population mobility is itself a major determinant of global public health is supported in this article by review of the published literature from the perspective of determinants of health (such as genetics/biology, behavior, environment, and socioeconomics), population-based disease prevalence differences, existing national and international health policies and regulations, as well as inter-regional shifts in population demographics and health outcomes. This paper highlights some of the emerging threats and risks to public health, identifies gaps in existing frameworks to manage health issues associated with migration, and suggests changes in approach to population mobility, globalization, and public health. The proposed integrated approach includes a broad spectrum of stakeholders ranging from individual health-care providers to policy makers and international organizations that are primarily involved in global health management, or are influenced by global health events.","output":"Migrants and emerging public health issues in a globalized world: threats, risks and challenges, an evidence-based framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Determination of the comparative efficacy of one therapy over another for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be challenging. Application of a recognized value framework to published studies could objectively compare the potential benefit across available therapies.

ASCO Value Framework Net Health Benefit Score version 2 (ASCO-NHB v2) scores, the primary analysis, and European Society of Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale version 1.1 scores, the secondary analysis, were computed using selected drug registration trials. Both scores were compared between drugs that were Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved by 2020 and those that were not. RESULTS: Of the 22 studies identified, nine were FDA-approved and 13 were not. Across 22 trials, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.2 months (range, 1.9-16.4 months), with a median gain of 0.35 month (range, 2.3-3.3 months). HCC therapies that were FDA-approved showed longer OS (median 10.7 v 7.9 months, P < .01) and higher ASCO NHB scores (+18.4 v -5.7 scores, P < .01). The median gain in OS was 2.2 months in the approved treatments compared with -0.3 months in the unapproved group, with no difference in progression-free survival between the two groups.

How they do so in COVID-19 may be revealed by analyzing the epigenetic chromatin accessibility of cis- and trans-regulatory elements and creating transcriptomic immune profiles. We performed single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC) and single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing (seq) on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of severely ill/critical patients (SCPs) infected with COVID-19, moderate patients (MPs), and healthy volunteer controls (HCs). About 76,570 and 107,862 single cells were used, respectively, for analyzing the characteristics of chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic immune profiles by the application of scATAC-seq (nine cases) and scRNA-seq (15 cases). The scATAC-seq detected 28,535 different peaks in the three groups; among these peaks, 41.6 and 10.7% were located in the promoter and enhancer regions, respectively. Compared to HCs, among the peak-located genes in the total T cells and its subsets, CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T cells, from SCPs and MPs were enriched with inflammatory pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway. The motifs of TBX21 were less accessible in the CD4(+) T cells of SCPs compared with those in MPs. Furthermore, the scRNA-seq showed that the proportion of T cells, especially the CD4(+) T cells, was decreased in SCPs and MPs compared with those in HCs. Transcriptomic results revealed that histone-related genes, and inflammatory genes, such as NFKBIA, S100A9, and PIK3R1, were highly expressed in the total T cells, CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T cells, both in the cases of SCPs and MPs. In the CD4(+) T cells, decreased T helper-1 (Th1) cells were observed in SCPs and MPs. In the CD8(+)T cells, activation markers, such as CD69 and HLA class II genes (HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DRB5), were significantly upregulated in SCPs. An integrated analysis of the data from scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq showed some consistency between the approaches. Cumulatively, we have generated a landscape of chromatin epigenetic status and transcriptomic immune profiles of T cells in patients with COVID-19. This has provided a deeper dissection of the characteristics of the T cells involved at a higher resolution than from previously obtained data merely by the scRNA-seq analysis. Our data led us to suggest that the T-cell inflammatory states accompanied with defective functions in the CD4(+) T cells of SCPs may be the key factors for determining the pathogenesis of and recovery from COVID-19.","output":"Epigenetic Landscapes of Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility and Transcriptomic Immune Profiles of T Cells in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Siddha system of medicine is a distinct therapeutic science with many single drugs and compound formulations used for treating a broad spectrum of ailments Siddha categorizes the fever manifested by viral infestation into 64 types and it has developed medicines for each type Kapacurak / Kabasurak Kutinir (KK) described in the Citta Vaittiyattirattu is the best promising polyherbal formulation of plant origin for curing viral infections especially with flu-like symptoms As per Siddha system of medicine Kapacuram is defined as a fever with upper and lower respiratory catarrh KK is one of the medicines advised for prevention of Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in India by Ministry of AYUSH, Govt of India KK also emerged to be a popular traditional medicine for swine flu as well The current review recapitulates active phytochemicals of all the 15 herbal drug ingredients in KK with the aim to provide it support for usage in flu-like viral infections spreading over the world in the scenario of having no modern medicines Interestingly, out of 15 herbal ingredients in KK, Zingiber officinale rhizome, Andrographis paniculata whole plant, Syzygium aromaticum flower bud, Cyperus rotundus tuber, Sida acuta roots and Saussurea costus root have been proved to exhibit antiviral activities All the ingredients have been proved to possess antinflammatory activities Three proved to have antipyretic potential and five each proved to possess analgesic and immunomodulatory activities There are ingredients with antiasthmatic and antispasmodic supporting its use in respiratory illnesses such as that caused by COVID-19 The study supports the usage of KK as a traditional Siddha medicine against respiratory illnesses with flu-like symptoms characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 ? 2021, Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India All rights reserved","output":"Pharmacological actions of contents of kabasura kudineer-a siddha formulation for fever with respiratory illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social isolation is extremely important to minimize the effects of a pandemic.

Peru, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina, and Ecuador had the highest death rates, with an increasing trend over time. Suriname, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Guyana had the lowest death rates, and these rates remained steady. The GSI in most countries followed the same pattern during the months analyzed. In other words, high indices at the beginning of the pandemic and lower indices in the latter months, whereas the number of deaths increased during the entire period. Almost no country kept its GSI high for a long time, especially from October to December. Time and GSI, as well as their interaction, were highly significant. As their interaction increases, the death rate decreases.

There is an accompanying challenge of access to WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) facilities. 63 million adolescent girls live in homes without toilets, which compounds discomfort during menstruation (Dasra, 2014). Awareness levels related to menstruation, menstrual hygiene and age-old myths and taboos continue to be low in parts of the country. COVID-19 resulted in an apparent reduction/elimination of access to Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) products and facilities, adoption of unhygienic menstrual management practices even by healthcare workers, decrease in access to menstrual-related knowledge, increase in the risk of occurrence and severity of several stress-related menstrual disorders, and a shift of public focus from menstrual health and wellbeing promotion (Ajari, 2020). This research aims to study add to the literature by studying the impact of COVID-19 on MHM and the impact of an intervention conducted by Project Baala to reduce MHM adversities owing to COVID-19.Methods : We collated data of 368 women from the 20 clusters of Delhi to study their patterns and the impact of the intervention. We undertook a quantitative study to understand the patterns in the community. The sample of women and girls was based on convenience sampling. We surveyed women and girls over a phone call for which oral consent was taken before administering the survey. Results: 31.8% of women reported restricted access to menstrual products and an overwhelming proportion 61.6% cited limited financial resources as the reason. During the lockdown, the access to school supply was disrupted for 80% of the girls. During the lockdown, 27.4% of the respondents had to use alternative methods for their menstrual needs such as old cloth lying at home due to the pandemic-induced scarcity. Results of our intervention suggest that of the 62.8% women who have used the Baala pads at least once, 96.5% of them reported that the reusable pads have increased their comfort level with regard to using menstrual products and about 86% women urged that this usage has facilitated mobility and improved participation in activities. Owing to these benefits, 94.8% respondents find the Baala pads to be reliable and 81% would continue using them after the pandemic, pointing out to the wide acceptance of sustainable menstrual hygiene products by all.","output":"COVID-19 Induced Menstrual Hygiene Management Adversities and Impact Assessment of Project Baala's Intervention in Response to These Adversities in Peri-Urban Fringes of Delhi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article makes the case for including frameworks of media ecology and mobilities research in the shaping of critical robotics research for a human-centered and holistic lens onto robot technologies.

The challenge of combatting the COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the lack of rapid and effective methods to identify viral pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 on-demand. Existing gold standard nucleic acid-based approaches require enzymatic amplification to achieve clinically relevant levels of sensitivity and are not typically used outside of a laboratory setting. Here, we report reagent-free viral sensing that directly reads out the presence of viral particles in 5 minutes using only a sensor-modified electrode chip. The approach relies on a class of electrode-tethered sensors bearing an analyte-binding antibody displayed on a negatively charged DNA linker that also features a tethered redox probe. When a positive potential is applied, the sensor is transported to the electrode surface. Using chronoamperometry, the presence of viral particles and proteins can be detected as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag on the sensor. This report is the first virus-detecting assay that uses the kinetic response of a probe/virus complex to analyze the complexation state of the antibody. We demonstrate the performance of this sensing approach as a means to detect, within 5 min, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated spike protein in test samples and in unprocessed patient saliva.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Particles Using Direct, Reagent-Free Electrochemical Sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies of infectious diseases have attempted to construct more realistic parameters of interpersonal contact patterns from diary-approach surveys. To ensure that such diary-based contact patterns provide accurate baseline data for policy implementation in densely populated Taiwan, we collected contact diaries from a national sample, using 3-stage systematic probability sampling and rigorous in-person interviews. A representative sample of 1,943 contact diaries recorded a total of 24,265 wide-range, face-to-face interpersonal contacts during a 24-hour period. Nearly 70% of the contacts occurred outside of respondents' households. The most active age group was schoolchildren (ages 5C14), who averaged around 16C18 daily contacts, about 2C3 times as many as the least active age groups. We show how such parameters of contact patterns help modify a sophisticated national simulation system that has been used for years to model the spread of pandemic diseases in Taiwan.

Craig, the United States Supreme Court established a two-step necessity and reliability test for allowing video testimony offered by child survivors of sexual abuse against their alleged abuser. As we move towards an increasingly virtual world during the COVID-19 pandemic, courts, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and legal scholars are conflicted as to whether government witnesses in criminal trials should be permitted to testify by videoconference in our new socially-distant reality and beyond.In this Note, I enter this debate by offering a practical proposal for trial courts and a normative one for the Supreme Court. I contend that district court judges should not extend Craig to permit accusatory witnesses to testify over videoconference during the pandemic. A Rule 15 deposition, I contend, is a more constitutionally-sound alternative to in-person testimony than is video testimony because it provides the defendant the opportunity to confront the witness in-person (albeit socially- distant). Normatively, I argue that the Court should remove its reliability and public policy analyses in Craig, which have been rendered impermissible by its later decision in Crawford v. Washington. Instead, the Court should adopt what I call hierarchy of methods approach, permitting video testimony only when securing in-court testimony or Rule 15 deposition of an essential witness is infeasible.","output":"Confrontation After COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To the editor: During the COVID-19 pandemic, deep extubation has been performed by many anesthesia teams to limit coughing efforts and to reduce the risk of aerosolization.","output":"Laryngospasm Following Deep Extubation in the Era of COVID-19 Successfully Managed with Larson's Maneuver."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver injury is common in patients with COVID\\\\19, but little is known about its clinical presentation and severity in the context of liver transplant.

In order to evaluate the relevance of using instant messaging software for the education of future midwives, the tool was evaluated by the students. METHODS: We conducted, in January 2021, a user-centered online study with all midwifery students in training for the classes of 2020C2021, using the French translation of Anstey and Watsons Rubric for the Evaluation of eLearning Tools. This evaluation analyzed the different dimensions of Discord in the context of training: functionality, accessibility, technology, design, privacy and data protection, social presence, pedagogical presence, and cognitive presence. RESULTS: Discord had a good functionality for 75% of the students surveyed. They found Discord to be suitable for maintaining social links and creating serious games. But they did not find it useful for following courses or practical work. More than 80% of the midwifery students interviewed agreed that Discord can be adapted to different learning contexts.

Drugs that targeting a closely related virus with similar genetic material such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and more specifically targeting a similar viral protease would be an excellent choice. Methods: In this study, we carried out a virtual screening for fifteen anti HCV drugs against COVID-19 main protease using computational molecular docking techniques. Moreover, Velpatasvir (4) and Sofosbuvir (13) drugs were further evaluated through molecular dynamics simulations followed by calculating the binding free energy using the molecular mechanics generalised born/solvent accessibility (MM-GBSA) approach. Results: The binding affinity descending order was N3 natural inhibitor (1), Velpatasvir (4), Sofosbuvir (13), Ombitasvir (3), Glecaprevir (2), Asunaprevir (8), Paritaprevir (10), Grazoprevir (11), Elbasvir (6), Ledipasvir (5), Daclatasvir (7), Pibrentasvir (9), Simeprevir (12), Dasabuvir (14), Taribavirin (16) and finally Ribavirin (15).

However, the contribution of adipocytes, the dominantly altered cell type in obesity with broad inflammatory properties, to infectious disease pathogenesis remains largely ignored. Thus, skewing of adipocyte-intrinsic cellular metabolism may lead to the development of pathogenic inflammatory adipocytes, which shape the overall immune responses by contributing to either premature immunosenescence, delayed hyperinflammation, or cytokine storm in infections.

So far, there is no complete survey of older patients in a German district that includes both outpatients and inpatients. In this retrospective observational cohort study, we aimed to investigate risk factors, mortality, and functional outcomes of all patients with COVID-19 aged 70 and older living in the district of Tbingen in the southwest of Germany. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all 256 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in one of the earliest affected German districts during the first wave of the disease from February to April 2020. To ensure inclusion of all infected patients, we analysed reported data from the public health department as well as the results of a comprehensive screening intervention in all nursing homes of the district (n = 1169). Furthermore, we examined clinical data of all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 109). RESULTS: The all-cause mortality was 18%. Screening in nursing homes showed a point-prevalence of 4.6%. 39% of residents showed no COVID-specific symptoms according to the official definition at that time. The most important predictors of mortality were the need for inpatient treatment (odds ratio (OR): 3.95 [95%-confidence interval (CI): 2.00C7.86], p<0.001) and care needs before infection (non-hospitalized patients: OR: 3.79 [95%-CI: 1.01C14.27], p = 0.037, hospitalized patients: OR: 2.89 [95%-CI 1.21C6.92], p = 0.015).

This crisis is particularly dire in Maricopa County, Arizona, where 1 in 5 children experience food insecurity, and >1 in 10 residents experience poverty. Mobile food pantries offer an additional resource to address food insecurity; however, there is minimal knowledge about how communities utilize these food distributors. Background: Research on the elderly (people >60 years) and immigrant populations shows that these populations are especially vulnerable to food insecurity. The risk these groups face is compounded in Maricopa County, the 15th largest county in the country with minimal public transit to extant resources. Mobile food pantries offer one solution to this issue, bringing groceries and other important items directly to communities. Methods: This study utilizes data from a food pantry called Phoenix Rescue Mission (PRM) on food insecure people's use of PRM's mobile and brick-and-mortar pantries, as well as census data. Using GIS mapping and a multinomial logistic regression model, this research identifies how different demographic groups engage with PRM's brick-and-mortar or mobile pantries. Results: Findings indicate that people aged 60C80 years and immigrant people of color are more likely to use both mobile and brick-and-mortar pantries.

The seasonable distribution of the disease suggested that meteorological factors may influence the incidence of mumps. The aim of this study was to explore the possible association between meteorological factors and the incidence of mumps, and to provide scientific evidence to relevant health authorities for the disease control and prevention. METHODS: We obtained the data of mumps cases and daily meteorological factors in Fujian Province in Eastern China over the period of 2005C2013. Using distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) approach, we assessed the relationship between the meteorological factors and mumps incidence. RESULTS: The effects of meteorological factors on the mumps incidence were all non-linear. Compared with the lowest risk values, the upper level of precipitation, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity could increase the risk of mumps, whereas the low level of wind velocity, temperature, diurnal temperature range and sunshine duration may also increase the risk. Moderate atmospheric pressure and low wind velocity had larger cumulative effects within 30 lag days and the relative risks were 10.02 (95%CI: 2.47C40.71) and 12.45 (95%CI: 1.40C110.78). For temperature, the cumulative effect within 30 lag days of minimum temperature was higher than that from maximum temperature in most populations. The cumulative effects of minimum temperature for males, children aged 10C14 and students were higher than those in other populations. CONCLUSIONS: Meteorological factors, especially temperature and wind velocity, should be taken into consideration in the prevention and warning of possible mumps epidemic. Special attention should be paid to the vulnerable populations, such as teenagers and young adults.","output":"Meteorological factors and the incidence of mumps in Fujian Province, China, 2005C2013: Non-linear effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectif : Nous avons tudi limpact psychologique initial de la propagation du Covid 19 sur la famille tunisienne.

Introduction: The infection with SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus started in the city of Wuhan in China in 2019 and has not stopped spreading around the world since then. From March 11, 2020 The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this Covid-19 infection a global pandemic. As a result, the Tunisian government has taken several measures in order to prevent the progression of the pandemic. These different changes can have different psychological consequences for both adults and children. Objectives: We proposed to study the initial impact of the spread of the Covid 19 pandemic on Tunisian parents and children. Material and methods: We conducted a prospective descriptive study two weeks after the proclamation of the curfew and one week after the proclamation of sanitary lockdown in Tunisia. Parents of Tunisian children were invited to voluntarily answer an anonymous questionnaire posted on social media. The questionnaire included questions on socio-demographic characteristics and the degree of impact of the spread of the Covid 19 pandemic on family habits and activities. The stress level of the parent responding to the questionnaire was measured by the Impact Event Scale Revised (IES-R). Results: One hundred and thirty-eight parents, answered this questionnaire of which 88% were mothers. Fathers had to operate changes in their working arrangements in 87.2% of the cases and mothers had to do so in 79.8%. One of the parents chose to live far from the family in 13% of the cases. Only 1% of parents did not teach or talk to their children about hygiene rules. The parents of our study reported that they had a child aged 12 or less in 91% of cases with an average age of six years and a sex ratio of 1.13. Parents sought to keep them occupied in 58.6% of the cases. Children did different activities during this period: watching television in 41 %, playing games in 27% and studying in 38% of the cases. In 41.4% of the cases, parents had a child aged over 12 years with an average age around 15 years and a sex ratio of 0.9. Teenagers often spent their time on tablets/computers in 80%, 52% watched movies or series, 31.25% participated in house cleaning activities, 27% spent time cooking for their family, 14.5% read books and 4.16% did social work. Parents reported that their childrens behaviour changed in 60% of the cases when the children were 12 or younger and in 20 % of the cases when the children were older than 12. The IES-R scores for the parents interviewed ranged from 2 to 79 with an average of 28.9  18. In 48 cases, the score was greater than 32.The severity of the impact was associated with the female sex of the parent responding to the questionnaire (p = 0.04). We found a positive correlation between the IES score and the symptomatology of children with p <0.001 and r = 0.52 when the age was 12 years or less and p = 0.001 and r = 0.518 when the age was strictly superior to 12. Conclusions: Both parents and children were affected when the Covid 19 pandemic began to spread in Tunisia. Psychological intervention is essential in order to help them get through this crisis with as few consequences as possible.","output":"Impact initial de la pandmie Covid 19 sur les parents et les enfants tunisiens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A ateno ao paciente vtima de parada cardiorrespiratria no contexto da pandemia da Doen?a por Coronavrus 2019 (COVID-19) possui particularidades que devem ser ressaltadas.

The current study, conducted at a hospital in the United Kingdom, evaluated the effectiveness of these primes, both in isolation and in combination, at the entry way to four separate wards, over a longer duration than the previous work. METHODS: A crossover randomized controlled trial was conducted. Four wards were allocated for 6 weeks of observation to each of four conditions, including control, olfactory, visual, or both (i.e., olfactory and visual combined). It was hypothesized that hand hygiene compliance would be greater in all priming conditions relative to the control condition. The primary outcome was whether people used the gel dispenser when they entered the wards. After the trial, a follow up survey of staff at the same hospital assessed the barriers to, and facilitators of, hand hygiene compliance. The trial data were analyzed using regression techniques and the survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The total number of individuals observed in the trial was 9,811 (female = 61%), with similar numbers across conditions, including control N = 2,582, olfactory N = 2,700, visual N = 2,488, and both N = 2,141. None of the priming conditions consistently increased hand hygiene. The lowest percentage compliance was observed in the both condition (7.8%), and the highest was observed in the visual condition (12.7%). The survey was completed by 97 staff (female = 81%). Environmental resources and social influences were the greatest barriers to staff cleaning their hands. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the current findings suggest that the olfactory and visual priming interventions investigated do not influence hand hygiene consistently. To increase the likelihood of such interventions succeeding, future research should focus on prospectively determined mechanisms of action.","output":"A Crossover Randomized Controlled Trial of Priming Interventions to Increase Hand Hygiene at Ward Entrances"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Why have some countries suppressed waves of the COVID-19 pandemic much more effectively than others? We find that the decay rate of daily cases or deaths from peak levels varies by a factor of ~40 between countries.

All countries where >40% agree most people can be trusted achieve a near complete reduction of new cases and deaths. In contrast, countries where governments maintain greater background stringency tend to be less trusting and less resilient.

The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk. The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the models predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.","output":"Evidence for the Convergence Model: The Emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) in Viet Nam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper deals with the issue of application possibilities of MOOC platforms in IT specialist training.

Early diagnosis of this condition is crucial for patient treatment and survival. As current diagnostic techniques for IA lack sufficient accuracy, we have raised two monoclonal antibodies (1D2 and 4E4) against A. fumigatus cell wall fragments that may provide a platform for a new diagnostic approach. The immunoreactivity of these antibodies was tested by immunofluorescence and ELISA against various Aspergillus and Candida species in vitro and by immunohistochemistry in A. fumigatus infected mouse tissues. Both monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) showed intensive fluorescence with the hyphae wall of A. fumigatus and A. flavus, but there was no staining with other Aspergillus species or Candida species. Both mAbs also showed strong immunoreactivity to the cell wall of A. fumigatus hyphae in the infected liver, spleen and kidney of mice with IA. The antigens identified by 1D2 and 4E4 might be glycoproteins and the epitopes are most likely a protein or peptide rather than a carbohydrate. An antibody-based antigen capture ELISA detected the extracellular antigens released by A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger and A. terreus, but not in Candida species. The antigen could be detected in the plasma of mice after 48 h of infection by double-sandwich ELISA.

Furthermore, the moderating effect of gender was not significant in the mediation model. Overall, adolescents who experience more developmental assets are less likely to suffer IGD. Moreover, developmental assets are conducive to developing a higher level of self-control, which in turn contributes to preventing or intervening in IGD as well.

However, the long-term risk of infection, especially in late preterm infants or those at near-normal birthweight, is unknown. We estimated whether rates of infection-related admissions to hospital for children in Western Australia were associated with age, gestational age, birthweight, and birth length. METHODS We did a population-based, data-linkage study using total-linked, registry data from the Western Australia Birth Register of all liveborn, non-Indigenous Australian singleton births recorded from Jan 1, 1980, to Dec 31, 2010. We followed up individuals from birth-related hospital discharge to age 18 years, death, or end of 2010, and linked to data about subsequent admissions to hospital or death registrations. Gestational age was assessed from both the last menstrual period and from estimates based on ultrasonography. We categorised birthweight by 500 g bands and birth length by 5 cm bands, and approximated the reference ranges for both to the 50th percentile. Because size at birth and gestational age are strongly associated, we calculated Z scores for gestational-specific and sex-specific birthweight, birth length, and ponderal index. Our primary outcomes were the number and type of infection-related admissions to hospital. We used multilevel negative binomial regression to generate rate ratios (RR) for such admissions, identified by codes from the International Classification of Diseases, versions 9 and 10-AM. We adjusted the RRs for maternal age at delivery, birth year, birth season, parity, sex, 5-min Apgar score, delivery method, socioeconomic status, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. FINDINGS Of 719 311 liveborn singletons included in the analysis and followed up for 8 824 093 person-years, 365 867 infection-related admissions to hospital occurred for 213 683 (30%) children. Of the 719 311 children included in the analysis, 137 124 (19%) had one infection-related admission to hospital, 43 796 (6%) had two, 16 679 (2%) had three, and 16 084 (2%) had four or more. The 365 867 admissions to hospital included a diagnosis of infection of the upper respiratory tract for 174 653 (48%), the lower respiratory tract for 74 297 (20%), the gastrointestinal tract for 44 755 (12%), and a viral infection for 37 213 (10%). Infection-related rates of admissions to hospital increased by 12% for each week reduction in gestational age less than 39-40 weeks (RR 112, 95% CI 112-113), by 19% for each 500 g reduction in birthweight less than 3000-3500 g (119, 118-121), and by 41% for each 5 cm reduction in birth length less than 45-50 cm (141, 138-145). Gestational age-specific and sex-specific birthweight Z scores lower than the 25th to 50th percentile and birth length Z scores lower than the 10th to 25th percentile were associated with increased rates of infection-related admissions to hospital (eg, 1st-5th percentile RR 115, 95% CI 112-119, and 111, 107-114, respectively). Ponderal index Z scores lower than the 25th to 50th percentile were also associated with increased rates of infection-related admissions (eg, 1st-5th percentile RR 108, 95% CI 104-112). A gestational age of 41 weeks or later, a birthweight or birth length Z score above the 50th percentile, or a ponderal index Z score between the 75th and 95th percentile, were associated with modestly reduced rates of infection-related admissions to hospital. INTERPRETATION Children who were born with reduced gestational age, birthweight, and birth length have persistently increased rates of infection-related admissions to hospital until age 18 years. Pregnancy outcomes should be optimised to prevent infection occurring in this population, especially in resource-limited settings where suboptimum intrauterine growth and moderate prematurity are common.

This study sought to assess the knowledge and preventive practices towards COVID-19 among pregnant women seeking antenatal services in Northern Ghana. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a structured questionnaire in the Nabdam district in Ghana. A total of 527 pregnant women were randomly sampled from health facilities offering antenatal care services in the district. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between the predictors and outcome variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of adequate knowledge and good COVID-19 preventive practices were 85.6%, (95% CI: 82.57, 88.59) and 46.6%, (95% CI: 42.41, 50.95) respectively. Having at least a primary education, residing in an urban area, and receiving COVID-19 education at a health facility were positively associated with adequate knowledge on COVID-19. Factors positively associated with good COVID-19 preventive practices were older age, having at least a primary education, pregnant women with a chronic disease, and living in an urban area. Multiparity was negatively associated with good COVID-19 preventive practices. CONCLUSION: Although majority of women had adequate knowledge of COVID-19, less than half of them were engaged in good COVID-19 preventive practices. Education of pregnant women on COVID-19 preventive practices should be intensified at health facilities while improving upon the water, sanitation and hygiene need particularly in rural communities.","output":"Knowledge and preventive practices towards COVID-19 among pregnant women seeking antenatal services in Northern Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The usage of pesticides is deemed essential to ensure crop production for global food security. Conventional chemical pesticides have significant effects on ecosystems. Nanopesticides are increasingly considered an emerging alternative due to their higher efficiency and lower environmental impacts. However, large knowledge gaps exist in the public perceptions and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for nanopesticides. Thus, we conducted a regional survey of pesticide users and food consumers on perceptions and WTP for nanopesticides across China. We found that 97.4% pesticide users were willing to pay for nanopesticides, with a main price from 25% to 40% higher than for conventional pesticides. Experience with applying pesticides, income, familiarity with and attitude toward nanopesticides, and trust in industries were significant determinants of WTP. Although the public were not familiar with nanopesticides, they had positive attitudes toward their future development and supported labeling nanoscale ingredients on products. Pesticide users presented high trust levels in governments and industries, while 34% of food consumers neutrally or distrusted industries in selling and production. This study highlights the socioeconomic and technological aspects of nanopesticides, which could provide guidance for industries to develop market strategies and for governments to design relevant regulation policies effectively, contributing to crop yield improvement and sustainable agriculture.","output":"Public Perceptions and Willingness-to-Pay for Nanopesticides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gene loss is the obverse of novel gene acquisition by a genome through a variety of evolutionary processes.

METHODS: Participants from two Swiss organisations, aged 18-65 years and working from home during the lockdown (n = 69) were included. Baseline data collected in January 2020 before the lockdown (office work) were compared with follow-up data in April 2020 during lockdown (working from home). The primary outcome of NP was assessed with a measure of intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes were quality of workstation ergonomics, number of work breaks, and time spent working at the computer. Two linear mixed effects models were fitted to the data to estimate the change in NP. RESULTS: No clinically relevant change in the average NP intensity and neck disability was found between measurement time points. Each working hour at the computer increased NP intensity by 0.36 points (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.62) indicating strong evidence. No such effect was found for neck disability. Each work break taken reduced neck disability by 2.30 points (95% CI: - 4.18 to - 0.42, evidence). No such effect was found for NP intensity. There is very strong evidence that workstation ergonomics was poorer at home. CONCLUSION: The number of work breaks and hours spent at the computer seem to have a greater effect on NP than the place of work (office, at home), measurement time point (before COVID-19, during lockdown) or the workstation ergonomics.

In particular, viral RNA molecules are a key example of conformationally adapting molecules that have evolved to switch between many functional conformations. The transactivation response element (TAR) RNA from the type-1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is a viral RNA molecule that is being increasingly explored as a potential therapeutic target due to its role in the viral replication process. In this work, we have studied the dynamics in TAR RNA in apo and liganded states by performing explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations initiated with 27 distinct structures. We determined that the TAR RNA structure is significantly stabilized on ligand binding with especially decreased fluctuations in its two helices. This rigidity is further coupled with the decreased flipping of bulge nucleotides, which were observed to flip more frequently in the absence of ligands. We found that initially-distinct structures of TAR RNA converged to similar conformations on removing ligands. We also report that conformational dynamics in unliganded TAR structures leads to the formation of binding pockets capable of accommodating ligands of various sizes.","output":"Role of conformational heterogeneity in ligand recognition by viral RNA molecules."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In support of the Decade of Healthy Aging, the World Health Organization has launched a publicly available, multi-lingual knowledge exchange platform that will enable people to find, share and produce knowledge on healthy aging.

Objective To compare adolescents' substance use and physical activity behaviors before and after stay-at-home restrictions. Design, Setting, and Participants Ongoing prospective cohort study of tobacco use behaviors among ninth- and tenth-grade students enrolled at 8 public high schools in Northern California from March 2019 to February 2020 and followed up from September 2019 to September 2020. Race/ethnicity was self-classified from investigator-provided categories and collected owing to racial/ethnic differences in tobacco and substance use. Exposures In California, a COVID-19 statewide stay-at-home order was imposed March 19, 2020. In this study, 521 six-month follow-up responses were completed before the order and 485 were completed after the order. Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence of substance use (ie, past 30-day use of e-cigarettes, other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol) and physical activity (active 5 days/week) was compared at baseline and follow-up. A difference-in-difference approach was used to assess whether changes from baseline to 6-month follow-up varied if follow-up occurred after the stay-at-home order, adjusting for baseline behaviors and characteristics. All models were weighted for losses to follow-up using the inverse probability method. Weights were derived from a logistic regression model for having a follow-up response (dependent variable), as predicted by baseline characteristics and behaviors. Results Of 1423 adolescents enrolled at baseline, 1006 completed 6-month follow-up (623 [62%] were female, and 492 [49%] were non-Hispanic White). e-Cigarette use declined from baseline to 6-month follow-up completed before the stay-at-home order (17.3% [89 of 515] to 11.3% [58 of 515]; McNemar 2 = 13.54; exact P < .001) and 6-month follow-up completed after the stay-at-home order (19.9% [96 of 482] to 10.8% [52 of 482]; McNemar 2 = 26.16; exact P < .001), but the extent of decline did not differ statistically between groups responding before vs after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.47-1.52; P = .58). In contrast, being physically active was unchanged from baseline if follow-up was before the order (53.7% [279 of 520] to 52.9% [275 of 520]; McNemar 2 = 0.09; exact P = .82) but declined sharply from baseline if follow-up was after the order (54.0% [261 of 483] to 38.1% [184 of 483]; McNemar 2 = 30.72; exact P < .001), indicating a pronounced difference in change from baseline after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69; P < .001). Overall in the cohort, reported use of other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol did not differ meaningfully before and after the order. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort, a reduction in e-cigarette use occurred independently of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions, but persistent cannabis and alcohol use suggest continued need for youth substance use prevention and cessation support.

Minimal research has been performed on the independent and combined impact of each of these interventions based on empirical case data. METHODS: We obtained data from all confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 7th to February 22nd 2020 in Zhejiang Province, China, to fit an age-stratified compartmental model using human contact information before and during the outbreak. The effectiveness of social distancing, contact tracing, and case isolation was studied and compared in simulation. We also simulated a two-phase reopening scenario to assess whether various strategies combining nonpharmaceutical interventions are likely to achieve population-level control of a second-wave epidemic. RESULTS: Our study sample included 1,218 symptomatic cases with COVID-19, of which 664 had no inter-province travel history. Results suggest that 36.5 % (95 % CI, 12.8C57.1) of contacts were quarantined, and approximately five days (95 % CI, 2.2C11.0) were needed to detect and isolate a case. As contact networks would increase after societal and economic reopening, avoiding a second wave without strengthening nonpharmaceutical interventions compared to the first wave it would be exceedingly difficult.

DESIGN & SETTING Observational study. Patient experience data were taken from the national GP Patient Survey in England (2018 and 2019). Data on the provision of extended access services were sourced from NHS England. The analyses considered potential confounding factors. These were sourced from publicly available data about practice characteristics from NHS Digital, NHS England and Government websites. METHOD The percentage of patients reporting positive responses to questions related to satisfaction with access, continuity of care, and overall satisfaction were modelled. The association between these outcomes and the provision of extended access were estimated via multivariable fixed-effects linear regression. RESULTS There were no associations between practices offering extended access services and key indicators of patient experience or satisfaction, at a practice population level. CONCLUSION Extended access has a cost of an estimated 250 million per year. Whilst there is a body of work that finds associations with emergency department use reduction, we find that at a practice population level, extended access had no measurable impact. This may be because extended access services are only used by small numbers of patients and its introduction has not significantly impacted general practices and most general practice patients.","output":"Has the national extended access scheme impacted on patient experience of and satisfaction with general practice? an observational study using the english GP patient survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have demonstrated the feasibility and ease of producing quercetin radicals by photoionization with a pulsed 355 nm laser.

According to the duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine, the patients were divided into the 20 and &gt;20-day groups, and the similarities and differences between them were compared. Results: Among the 37 patients, five had mild disease, 30 had moderate disease, one had severe disease, and one was critically ill. All of the patients were released from quarantine, and no mortality was observed. The average duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine was 20.2  6.6 days. The average duration from symptom onset to hospitalization was 4.1  3.7 days, and the patients were hospitalized for an average of 16.1  6.2 days. The average age was 44.3  1.67 years, and 78.4% of cases were caused by exposure to a patient with confirmed disease or the workplace of a patient with confirmed disease. The main symptoms were cough (67.6%), fever (62.2%), shortness of breath (32.4%), fatigue (24.3%), sore throat (21.6%), vomiting, and diarrhea (21.6%).

After matching on maternal characteristics, maternal SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was significantly associated with admission for neonatal care (11.7% vs 8.4%; odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.70) and with neonatal morbidities such as respiratory distress syndrome (1.2% vs 0.5%; OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.50-3.84), any neonatal respiratory disorder (2.8% vs 2.0%; OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07-1.90), and hyperbilirubinemia (3.6% vs 2.5%; OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13-1.90). Mortality (0.30% vs 0.12%; OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 0.99-6.57), breastfeeding rates at discharge (94.4% vs 95.1%; OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.05), and length of stay in neonatal care (median, 6 days in both groups; difference, 0 days; 95% CI, -2 to 7 days) did not differ significantly between the groups. Twenty-one infants (0.90%) of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the neonatal period; 12 did not have neonatal morbidity, 9 had diagnoses with unclear relation to SARS-CoV-2, and none had congenital pneumonia. Conclusions and Relevance: In a nationwide cohort of infants in Sweden, maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was significantly associated with small increases in some neonatal morbidities. Given the small numbers of events for many of the outcomes and the large number of statistical comparisons, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory.","output":"Association of Maternal SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Pregnancy With Neonatal Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of recent discoveries harnessing the adaptive immune system of prokaryotes to perform targeted genome editing is having a transformative influence across the biological sciences. The discovery of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins has expanded the applications of genetic research in thousands of laboratories across the globe and is redefining our approach to gene therapy. Traditional gene therapy has raised some concerns, as its reliance on viral vector delivery of therapeutic transgenes can cause both insertional oncogenesis and immunogenic toxicity. While viral vectors remain a key delivery vehicle, CRISPR technology provides a relatively simple and efficient alternative for site-specific gene editing, obliviating some concerns raised by traditional gene therapy. Although it has apparent advantages, CRISPR/Cas9 brings its own set of limitations which must be addressed for safe and efficient clinical translation. This review focuses on the evolution of gene therapy and the role of CRISPR in shifting the gene therapy paradigm.

Given the global spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19), social isolation regulations and laws have been implemented in many countries to contain the spread of the virus and this has caused a drastic shift from the usual physically demanding life to a sedentary lifestyle characterized by significantly reduced physical activities and prolong sitting. METHODS/DATA SOURCE: Human and nonhuman primate literature was examined to compare experimental and clinical modulation of inflammatory cytokines by exercised-induced myokines. DATA SYNTHESIS: Experimental and clinical evidence was used to examine whether exercised-induced myokines can prime the immune system of the elderly population during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The immune system changes with advancement in age which increases the likelihood of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in older adults. Several epidemiological studies have also shown that physical inactivity among geriatric population impacts negatively on the immune system. Evidences on the importance of exercise in priming the immune system of elderly individuals could be an effective therapeutic strategy in combating the virus as it may well be a case of let those with the best immune system win.","output":"COVID-19: sitting is the new smoking; the role of exercise in augmenting the immune system among the elderly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Guselkumab is indicated for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Data from real-life clinical practice regarding its use are scarce, especially concerning patients who relapse after previous biologic therapies. Aim This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and adherence to guselkumab in psoriasis refractory to biologic therapies. Method This real-life, retrospective study included patients who initiated guselkumab between February 2019 and October 2020. The main objective was to assess effectiveness, expressed as the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 5, 2 and 0, at the first follow-up medical visit. As secondary effectiveness outcomes, we assessed the body surface area (BSA) and dermatology life quality index (DLQI). We also evaluated adverse events and adherence (using the medication possession ratio [MPR]). Results The study included 35 patients who had previously received a median of two biologic drugs. The median basal PASI score (IQR) was 11 (7.3-15.9), decreasing to 0 (0-1.4) at first follow-up medical visit. At this point, 32 patients (94.1%) reached PASI 5, 28 (82.4%) PASI 2 and 19 (55.9%) PASI 0. We also found statistically significant improvements in PASI, BSA and DLQI at first follow-up (p<0.001). Three patients developed adverse events. Most patients (N=29, 85.3%) had an MPR 90%. The MPR was not associated with PASI score at first follow-up.

METHODS: From January 2018 to April 2021, 246 consecutive patients with OSAHS diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG) in our hospital were selected. All patients were grouped according to the minimum nocturnal oxygen saturation and apnea hypopnea index (AHI). There were 33 cases in the no sleep hypoxia group, 34 cases in the mild hypoxia group, 119 cases in the moderate hypoxia group, and 60 cases in the severe hypoxia group. There were 30 cases in the simple snoring group, 55 cases in the mild OSAHS group, 48 cases in the moderate OSAHS group, and 113 cases in the severe OSAHS group. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores of each group were compared. All patients were grouped according to ESS score. Those with score 9 were included in the lethargy group (n = 118), and those with score 10 were included in the no lethargy group (n = 128). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the influencing factors of daytime sleepiness in OSAHS patients. Pearson correlation analysis showed the correlation between ESS score and pulse oxygen decline rate in patients with severe OSAHS. RESULTS: The ESS score of the severe hypoxia group > the moderate hypoxia group > the mild hypoxia group > the no sleep hypoxia group. There was significant difference among the groups (F = 19.700, P < 0.0001). There were significant differences between the severe hypoxia group and other groups and between the moderate hypoxia group and the no sleep hypoxia group and the mild hypoxia group (P < 0.05). The ESS score of the severe OSAHS group > the moderate OSAHS group > the mild OSAHS group > the simple snoring group. There was significant difference among the groups (F = 19.000, P < 0.0001). There were significant differences between the severe OSAHS group and other groups and between the moderate OSAHS group and the simple snoring group (P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that BMI, neck circumference, snoring degree, total apnea hypopnea time, AHI, micro arousal index (MAI), oxygen saturation (CT90%), lowest oxygen saturation (LSaO2), and mean oxygen saturation (MSaO2) were the influencing factors of daytime sleepiness in OSAHS patients (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that AHI and CT90% were independent risk factors for daytime sleepiness in OSAHS patients (P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between ESS score and pulse oxygen decline rate in patients with severe OSAHS (r = 0.765, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: OSAHS patients may be accompanied by daytime sleepiness in varying degrees, which may be independently related to AHI and CT90%. The degree of daytime sleepiness in patients with severe OSAHS may be closely related to the decline rate of pulse oxygen, which should be paid great attention in clinic.","output":"Influencing Factors of Daytime Sleepiness in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome and Its Correlation with Pulse Oxygen Decline Rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is characterized predominantly by respiratory symptoms and has affected a small subset of children.

A large majority of the news is negative. A previous study from our laboratory showed that reading negative news is associated with both increased stress reactivity (measured via the stress hormone cortisol) and recall of the negative news segments in women. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the effects of positive news on cortisol stress reactivity, memory and affect using a methodology highly similar to the study on negative news that was previously used by our team. METHODS: Sixty-two healthy participants aged between 18 and 35 years (81% women) were randomly exposed to either positive or neutral news segments, followed by a laboratory stressor. We assessed participants affect three times during the procedure and measured cortisol in saliva eight times (at 10-minute intervals). Twenty-four hours later, participants were contacted by phone to assess their recall of the news segments. RESULTS: Results showed that exposure to positive news, relative to neutral news, did not modulate participants cortisol levels in response to the laboratory stressor. Positive news had no impact on memory recall of the news and did not change participants positive or negative affect. Bayes factors suggested that these nonsignificant results are not attributable to low statistical power. CONCLUSION: Contrary to negative news, positive and neutral news do not modulate stress reactivity, memory and affect. These results suggest that people can stay informed without physiological and psychological costs when the news to which they are exposed adopt a positive or neutral approach.","output":"Staying informed without a cost: No effect of positive news media on stress reactivity, memory and affect in young adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When infectious disease outbreaks strike, health facilities acquire labels such as \\"war zones\\" and \\"battlefields\\" and healthcare professionals become \\"heroes\\" on the \\"front line.\\" But unlike soldiers, healthcare professionals often take on these dangerous roles without any prior intention or explicit expectation that their work will place them in grave personal danger.

From January to May 2020, a total of 69 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Third Central Hospital and the Jinnan Hospital (both situated in Tianjin) were enrolled in the disease group. According to the severity, these patients were divided into mild group (15 cases), moderate group (46 cases), and severe group (8 cases). In the same period, 70 non-infected patients were enrolled in control group. The level of white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (NEU#), absolute lymphocyte count (LY#), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and platelet-large contrast ratio (P-LCR) before and after treatment were analyzed. Binary logistic regression analysis is used to establish a mathematical model of the relationship between these indexes and the outcome of severe COVID-19 patients. The receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve is used to further explore the prognosis value of MPV, P-LCR, NLR separately and jointly in COVID-19 patients. Compare to the control group, WBC and NE# increase (Z=-5.63, P<0.01;Z=-9.19,P<0.01) and LY# decrease (Z=-9.34, P<0.01) in the severe group; NLR increase with the aggravation of the disease, there is significant difference between groups (Z=17.61, P<0.01); PLT, PDW, MPV and P-LCR decrease with the aggravation of the disease, there is significant difference between groups (Z=9.47, P<0.01; Z=11.41, P<0.01; Z =16.76, P<0.01; Z=13.97, P<0.01).

Children and youth living with disabilities (CYWD) tend to have fewer opportunities for participation in PA and outdoor play compared with their typically developing peers. In turn, CYWD are typically less active and more sedentary, on average, compared with their peers. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced opportunities for many children and youth to participate in PA and outdoor play. The purpose of this study was to assess parent-perceived changes in PA (including outdoor play), SB (including screen time), and sleep quality and quantity, due to COVID-19 and related restrictions, in a national cohort of Canadian CYWD. We recruited parents of school-aged CYWD (N = 151) in May 2020. In an online survey, parents reported their childs previous 7-day PA, SB, and sleep, as well as perceived changes in their childs movement and play behaviours due to COVID-19 and related restrictions. Parent-perceived parental support for their childs movement and play behaviours during the pandemic was also assessed. We used descriptive statistics to describe the childs movement behaviours and assessed the association between movement behaviours and parental factors using Pearson and point-biserial correlations. Few (5.3%) CYWD met PA recommendations and 13.2% met screen time recommendations during the acute period of the COVID-19 pandemic. More CYWD (66.2%) were meeting sleep recommendations. Overall, only 1.3% of CYWD were meeting the combined movement guidelines. Parent encouragement was positively associated with the childs outdoor PA (0.23), wheeling, walking, and biking (0.19), indoor PA (0.16), and family-based PA (0.26). Parental co-play was similarly positively associated with the childs outdoor PA (0.26), wheeling, walking, and biking (0.39), indoor PA (0.16), and family-based PA (0.26). Parents perceived their CYWD to be less active and more sedentary as a result of COVID-19 and the related restrictions. Parents of CYWD have an important role in encouraging healthy movement behaviours. Return to movement and play post-COVID guidelines should include tailored strategies for CYWD and their families to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic.","output":"Adverse Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Movement and Play Behaviours of Children and Youth Living with Disabilities: Findings from the National Physical Activity Measurement (NPAM) Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Prescriptions of Han-Shi-Yu-Fei (HSYF), Han-Shi-Zu-Fei (HSZF), and Yi-Du-Bi-Fei (YDBF) were effective in treating COVID-19.

In India, the COVID-19 trajectory appears assured to change modes. While the number of incidents grew slowly in February, they doubled in just five days in mid-March from 100 to more than 236, and now at the end of April, the cases reported are 29,435.

METHOD: One hundred and sixty-three pSS patients who regularly attended their follow-ups between January 2010 and May 2021 were included in the study. These patients reasons for hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, and numbers of presenting to the hospital were recorded. The demographic, clinical and serological characteristics of the hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients were compared. RESULTS: Hospitalization occurred in 22.7% of the patients, and the total number of hospitalizations was 79. The hospitalization incidence density rate was 6.21 per 100 patient-years. The most frequently encountered reason for hospitalizations was pSS-related organ involvement (44.3%). Infections (17.7%), malignancy (16.5%), endocrine, and various other reasons were the other indications for hospitalization. While male sex (p = 0.005), the presence of extra-glandular involvement (p < 0.001), and interstitial lung disease (p = 0.001) were more common in the hospitalized patients, anti-nuclear antibody positivity was less frequent (p = 0.032). The usage rate of hydroxychloroquine (p = 0.022) was lower in the hospitalized patients, whereas the use of glucocorticoids (p < 0.001) and azathioprine (p = 0.005) was more frequent. The multivariable analyses revealed a relationship between extra-glandular involvement (OR: 4.57 [1.05C19.84], p = 0.043), glucocorticoid use (OR: 3.23 [1.13C9.21], p = 0.028) and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: pSS-related system involvement and infection accounted for the majority of hospitalizations of the pSS patients.

There is considerable controversy as to whether temporary relief of biliary obstruction prior to major definitive surgery (pre-operative biliary drainage) is of any benefit to the patient. OBJECTIVES To assess the benefits and harms of pre-operative biliary drainage versus no pre-operative biliary drainage (direct surgery) in patients with obstructive jaundice (irrespective of a benign or malignant cause). SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until February 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised clinical trials comparing biliary drainage followed by surgery versus direct surgery, performed for obstructive jaundice, irrespective of the sample size, language, and publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), rate ratio (RaR), or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the available patient analyses. We assessed the risk of bias (systematic overestimation of benefit or systematic underestimation of harm) with components of the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We assessed the risk of play of chance (random errors) with trial sequential analysis. MAIN RESULTS We included six trials with 520 patients comparing pre-operative biliary drainage (265 patients) versus no pre-operative biliary drainage (255 patients). Four trials used percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and two trials used endoscopic sphincterotomy and stenting as the method of pre-operative biliary drainage. The risk of bias was high in all trials. The proportion of patients with malignant obstruction varied between 60% and 100%. There was no significant difference in mortality (40/265, weighted proportion 14.9%) in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus the direct surgery group (34/255, 13.3%) (RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.71; P = 0.60). The overall serious morbidity was higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group (60 per 100 patients in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus 26 per 100 patients in the direct surgery group) (RaR 1.66; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.16; P = 0.0002). The proportion of patients who developed serious morbidity was significantly higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group (75/102, 73.5%) in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus the direct surgery group (37/94, 37.4%) (P < 0.001). Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay (2 trials, 271 patients; MD 4.87 days; 95% CI -1.28 to 11.02; P = 0.12) between the two groups. Trial sequential analysis showed that for mortality only a small proportion of the required information size had been obtained. There seemed to be no significant differences in the subgroup of trials assessing percutaneous compared to endoscopic drainage. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is currently not sufficient evidence to support or refute routine pre-operative biliary drainage for patients with obstructive jaundice. Pre-operative biliary drainage may increase the rate of serious adverse events. So, the safety of routine pre-operative biliary drainage has not been established. Pre-operative biliary drainage should not be used in patients undergoing surgery for obstructive jaundice outside randomised clinical trials.","output":"Pre-operative biliary drainage for obstructive jaundice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A logistic model was employed to correlate the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) with related environmental factors and the migration of birds.

The results show that proximity to water bodies and national highways was statistically relevant to the occurrence of HPAI. Migratory birds, mainly waterfowl, were important infection sources in HPAI transmission. In addition, the HPAI outbreaks had high spatiotemporal autocorrelation. This epidemic spatial range fluctuated 45 km owing to different distribution patterns of cities and water bodies. Furthermore, two outbreaks were likely to occur with a period of 22 d.

A microbial sensor utilizing fluorescence emitted by microorganisms was used to measure bioaerosol concentrations in the living room and children's bedroom as well as on the balcony. Indoor PM2.5 was also monitored simultaneously at certain time points using a PM2.5 sensor. The behavior of the residents was also recorded during some monitoring periods. The average number concentration of microbes as fungi in the living room was 15,100, 58,800, and 10,600 counts m(-3) in spring, summer, and winter, respectively, increasing in summer when the outside temperature was high. Microbial number concentrations were closely related to human behavior, increasing rapidly during periods of physical activity, but decreasing again within 20-30 min of the activity ending. There was no clear correlation between indoor microbial number concentrations and PM2.5 concentrations, suggesting that indoor microorganisms are concentrated in coarse particles, such as dust, which are quickly removed via gravitational settling. The concentration of indoor airborne microorganisms decreased significantly after ventilation, and although an occasional increase was observed immediately after ventilation, concentrations decreased again rapidly within 10-20 min. These results suggest that even a short period of ventilation can significantly reduce the indoor bioaerosol.","output":"Real-time Monitoring of Bioaerosol in a Residential Property in Central Tokyo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Combined biomarker screening is increasingly used to diagnose invasive aspergillosis (IA) in high-risk patients.

In addition, clinical data were recorded and classification of IA was performed according to the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria. Among the 39 high-risk children, we identified 4 patients (10.3%) with probable and 2 (5.1%) with possible IA. All patients with probable IA were repeatedly positive for both tests (means of 9.5 and 6.8 positive GM and PCR samples, respectively), whereas both possible IA cases were detected by PCR. The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 67% and 89% for GM and 100% and 63% for PCR. Positive and negative predictive values were, respectively, 50% and 100% for GM and 27% and 100% for PCR. For the combined testing approach, both values were 100%. The number of positive samples seemed to be lower in patients undergoing antifungal therapy. Sporadically positive tests occurred in 12% (GM) and 42% (PCR) of unclassified patients. In summary, our data show that combined monitoring for GM and fungal DNA also results in a high diagnostic accuracy in pediatric patients.

OBJECTIVE: To describe differences in the number of COVID-19 deaths by nursing home racial composition and examine the factors associated with these differences. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study of 13 312 nursing homes in the US used the Nursing Home COVID-19 Public File from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which contains COVID-19 cases and deaths among nursing home residents as self-reported by nursing homes beginning between January 1, 2020, and May 24, 2020, and ending on September 13, 2020. Data were analyzed from July 28 to December 18, 2020. EXPOSURES: Confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Confirmed cases were defined as COVID-19 infection confirmed by a diagnostic laboratory test. Suspected cases were defined as signs and/or symptoms of COVID-19 infection or patient-specific transmission-based precautions for COVID-19 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Deaths associated with COVID-19 among nursing home residents. Death counts were compared by nursing home racial composition, which was measured as the proportion of White residents. RESULTS: Among 13 312 nursing homes included in the study, the overall mean (SD) age of residents was 79.5 (6.7) years. A total of 51 606 COVID-19Cassociated deaths among residents were reported, with a mean (SD) of 3.9 (8.0) deaths per facility. The mean (SD) number of deaths in nursing homes with the lowest proportion of White residents (quintile 1) vs nursing homes with the highest proportions of White residents (quintile 5) were 5.6 (9.2) and 1.7 (4.8), respectively. Facilities in quintile 1 experienced a mean (SE) of 3.9 (0.2) more deaths than those in quintile 5, representing a 3.3-fold higher number of deaths in quintile 1 compared with quintile 5. Adjustment for the number of certified beds reduced the mean (SE) difference between these 2 nursing home groups to 2.2 (0.2) deaths. Controlling for case mix measures and other nursing home characteristics did not modify this association. Adjustment for county-level COVID-19 prevalence further reduced the mean (SE) difference to 1.0 (0.2) death. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, nursing homes with the highest proportions of non-White residents experienced COVID-19 death counts that were 3.3-fold higher than those of facilities with the highest proportions of White residents. These differences were associated with factors such as larger nursing home size and higher infection burden in counties in which nursing homes with high proportions of non-White residents were located. Focusing limited available resources on facilities with high proportions of non-White residents is needed to support nursing homes during potential future outbreaks.","output":"Factors Associated With Racial Differences in Deaths Among Nursing Home Residents With COVID-19 Infection in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen En diciembre de 2019, se informaron casos de neumona potencialmente mortal en Wuhan, provincia de Hubei, China (COVID-19).

METHODS: Survey questions were developed to assess dentists awareness about their vaccine administration scope of practice and attitudes and barriers if choosing to incorporate vaccine delivery into their practice scope. The survey was deployed electronically to members of the American Dental Association Clinical Evaluators (ACE) Panel (N = 989) on September 2, 2021, and remained open for 2 weeks. Data were summarized descriptively in Qualtrics and SAS Version 9.4. RESULTS: Of the 330 ACE Panel members who responded to the survey, 42% were not aware of which vaccines their state permits them to deliver. More than one-half (55%) would be willing to administer influenza or COVID-19 vaccines in their practice setting, but at present only 2% of respondents administer vaccines. To overcome vaccine administration barriers, the top 3 resources respondents want access to are the following: training or education, financial support, and access to protocols. Of all the respondents, 91% indicated the dental hygienist should be involved in certain capacities. CONCLUSIONS: Few dentists are administering vaccines, possibly owing to a number of challenges. Dental hygienists may play an integral role in the administration of vaccines in the dental clinic, but few dentists are educating their patients about vaccines.

Inclusion criteria was children 0-18 years admitted to hospital between February 1 and June 6, 2020 with diagnosis of an inflammatory syndrome and acute cardiovascular complications. Results: A total of 286 children from 55 centers in 17 European countries were included. The median age was 8.4 years (IQR 3.8-12.4 years) and 67% were males. The most common cardiovascular complications were shock, cardiac arrhythmias, pericardial effusion and coronary artery dilatation. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction was present in over half of the patients and a vast majority of children had raised cardiac troponin (cTnT) when checked. The biochemical markers of inflammation were raised in majority of patients on admission: elevated CRP, serum ferritin, procalcitonin, NT-proBNP, IL-6 level and D-dimers. There was a statistically significant correlation between degree of elevation in cardiac and biochemical parameters and need for intensive care support (p <0.05).

This is especially the case for those individuals who might have a high need to belong and difficulties in emotional competences. The difficult social situation during contact restrictions, more time for online communication and maladaptive emotion regulation might lead to aggressive communication patterns in the form of cyberbullying perpetration. In an online study with N = 205 adolescents aged 14C19 (M = 15.83, SD = 1.44;57% girls), we assessed the frequency of online and offline contacts, need to belong, emotion regulation problems, feelings of loneliness, and cyberbullying perpetration as predictors of adolescents well-being. In particular, we explored whether cyberbullying perpetration might function as a maladaptive strategy to deal with feelings of loneliness and therefore predicts well-being. This effect was expected to be stronger for those with a higher need to belong and with higher emotion regulation problems. Results of a hierarchical regression analysis revealed that well-being was significantly predicted by less emotion regulation difficulties, less feeling isolated and more cyberbullying perpetration. We also tested whether the need to belong or emotion regulation problems moderated the association between cyberbullying and well-being. While the results for emotion regulation problems were not significant, the moderation effect for the need to belong was significant: For students with a high need to belong, well-being was more strongly related to cyberbullying perpetration than for students with a medium need to belong. For students with a low need to belong, cyberbullying was not significantly associated with well-being. That cyberbullying perpetration predicted well-being positively is rather surprising in the light of previous research showing negative psychosocial outcomes also for cyberbullying perpetrators. The moderation analysis provides a hint at underlying processes: In times of distance learning and contact restrictions, cyberbullying may be a way of coming into contact with others and to regulate loneliness maladaptively.","output":"Can Acting Out Online Improve Adolescents Well-Being During Contact Restrictions?

METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis after replacing the background CEI with PIEB for our labor PCEA. Pre-change pump settings were CEI 12mL/h with PCEA (12mL bolus, lockout 15min); PIEB settings were a 9mL bolus every 45min with PCEA (10mL bolus, lockout 10min). We compared medical records of all women receiving epidural or combined spinal-epidural labor analgesia for vaginal delivery for two months before PIEB implementation to a two-month period of PIEB utilization following a five-month introductory familiarization period. The primary outcome was the proportion of women requiring rescue clinician boluses. RESULTS Fewer patients in the PIEB group required rescue clinician boluses compared to the CEI group (12% vs. 19%, P=0.012). Time to first rescue bolus request and total bolus dose were not different. Peak (median [IQR]) pain scores were 2[0-5] with CEI and 0[0-4] with PIEB. There was no difference in instrumental delivery rates. CONCLUSIONS Using PIEB compared to CEI as the background maintenance epidural analgesia method in conjunction with PCEA reduced the number of women requiring clinician rescue boluses while providing comparable labor analgesia. The findings of this clinical care impact study confirm the results of randomized controlled studies and suggest PIEB may be a preferable technique to CEI for the maintenance of labor analgesia.","output":"Programmed intermittent epidural boluses for maintenance of labor analgesia: an impact study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The primary objective was to demonstrate the relationship between lung ultrasound (LUS) manifestations and the outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The secondary objective was to determine the characteristics of LUS manifestations in different subgroups of ICU patients. METHODS This prospective multi-center cohort study was conducted in 17 ICUs. A total of 1702 patients admitted between August 31, 2017 and February 16, 2019 were included. LUS was performed according to the bedside lung ultrasound in emergency (BLUE)-plus protocol, and LUS scores were calculated. Data on the outcomes and oxygenation indices were analyzed and compared between different primary indication groups. RESULTS The LUS scores were significantly higher for non-survivors than for survivors and were significantly different between the oxygenation index groups, with higher scores in the lower oxygenation index groups. The LUS score was an independent risk factor for the 28-day mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.663 for prediction of the 28-day mortality and 0.748 for prediction of an oxygenation index 100. CONCLUSIONS The LUS score based on the BLUE-plus protocol was an independent risk factor for the 28-day mortality and was important for the prediction of an oxygenation index 100.

We hypothesized that this pandemic reduced referral of other non-COVID-19 patients to the hospitals or clinics, including gynecological and perinatological referrals. Women can be at risk in limited use of health services. METHODS: In this retrospective study, referrals from gynecologic oncology, perinatology, and gynecology clinics in a large teaching hospital of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) were compared from February 20 to May 20, 2020, with the same period in 2019. Finally, referral trends in 2020 were compared with the COVID-19 admission pattern. RESULTS: Total admissions to all three clinics declined 63% in 2020 compared to 2019. There was a significant relationship between the number of visits to three clinics during these2 years (p < 0.001). The reduction in referrals to the gynecology clinic was more than gynecologic oncology and perinatology. The COVID-19 referral pattern was conversely linked to gynecology-related admissions. CONCLUSION: As the pandemic situation makes patients hesitant to go to the hospitals or not, health policymakers should consider other non-COVID issues, including maternal and fetal concerns. Providing safe places for other patients to visit is a goal that can be achieved through developing guidelines for nosocomial hygiene and training informed healthcare staff. Moreover, non-urgent visits should be avoided or postponed. This issue calls for new strategies, including telemedicine in situations similar to the current pandemic to both identify and manage such conditions.","output":"Indirect effects of COVID-19 in referring women to gynecologic oncology, perinatology and gynecology clinics in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The purpose of this article is to analyse the main measures in medical institutions in Bulgaria to combat the COVID-19 coronavirus infection pandemic The main measures taken in connection with the reorganization of non-medical activities and services in hospitals in Bulgaria in conditions of COVID-19 pandemic are studied Results: Based on an analysis of the practice in medical institutions in Bulgaria, the main non-medical activities and measures to combat COVID-19 have been identified and studied in 6 main areas: (1) Improving logistics and supply management, incl of pharmaceuticals, in hospitals;(2) Restricting external visitors to hospitals;(3) Providing the employees involved in the access regime and the security in hospitals with the necessary personal protective equipment and non-contact systems for measuring the body temperature and their placement at appropriate access points;(4) Ensuring the availability of sufficient and appropriately located hygienic materials in the hospital building;(5) Cleaning of the building and the premises in the hospitals in accordance with the maximum requirements for hygiene, security and protection;(6) Provision of basic hospital maintenance services and implementation of administrative controls and policies to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 Conclusion: The presence of the first, second, etc waves of pandemics, without yet finding a cure for COVID-19 prevention, in many unknown circumstances for health authorities and the public, puts hospitals in a critical situation for a very long time Maintaining the normal functioning of hospitals is becoming increasingly difficult as the available medical staffs to fight the disease is gradually depleted This requires the need for hospitals to constantly use new strategies, mechanisms and methods to address or mitigate serious challenges, to reorganize their activities and management systems The existence of a well-functioning hospital management system, with strict implementation of the identified and studied in six groups of key measures in the field of non-medical activities and services in hospitals in Bulgaria to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, remains a key factor for effective response to such a disaster","output":"Analysis of the Key Measures in the Medical Institutions in Bulgaria for Combating Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2) disease (COVID-19) is a novel threat that hampers life expectancy especially in obese individuals.

We previously reported that patients with a Lewis score (LS) on capsule endoscopy <270 had a lower risk of exacerbation without additional treatment. This study investigated prognostic predictors in patients undergoing capsule endoscopy and determined the optimal LS cut-off value. METHODS In a retrospective single-center study, 102 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent capsule endoscopy were reviewed. We reviewed the clinical course and the patients' characteristics, Crohn's Disease Activity Index, laboratory findings, LS, and Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) for factors potentially associated with Crohn's disease-related emergency hospitalization. Subsequently, we prospectively enrolled 66 patients with Crohn's disease and analyzed clinical outcomes according to these factors. RESULTS In the retrospective study, LS 270 and PNI <45 were identified as independent predictors of Crohn's disease-related emergency hospitalization with hazard ratios of 9.48 and 3.01, respectively. Even in patients with LS 270, cumulative hospitalization rates decreased after intervention based on capsule endoscopy findings. The prospective study confirmed that patients with LS 270 or PNI <45 had a significantly higher risk of Crohn's disease-related emergency hospitalization and that additional treatment reduced the risk of relapse. CONCLUSIONS LS and PNI are the best available prognostic predictors in patients with Crohn's disease without gastrointestinal stenosis and can guide decisions on treatment escalation.

In this Letter, we experimentally investigate the generation of drops of a viscoelastic suspension, made of non-Brownian spherical particles dispersed in a dilute polymer solution. Using high-speed imaging, we characterize the different stages of the detachment. Our experiments show that the particles primarily affect the initial Newtonian necking by increasing the fluid viscosity. In the viscoelastic regime, particles do not affect the thinning until the onset of the blistering instability, which they accelerate. We find that the transition from one regime to another, which corresponds to the coil-stretch transition of the polymer chains, strongly depends on the particle content. Considering that the presence of rigid particles increase the deformation of the liquid phase, we propose an expression for the local strain rate in the suspension, which rationalizes our experimental results.

Additionally, we provide haptic feedback, employing transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation immediately, as soon as an error occurs, to correct the movements. The results based on a dataset collected from 15 subjects show that our approach can detect severe movement execution errors directly during the workout and provide haptic feedback at respective body locations.

The clinical spectrum of COVID?19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID?19 severity. Method This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID?19 infection or ICU admission. Results Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID?19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 ? 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 ? 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 ? 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 ? 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 ? 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 ? 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. Conclusions Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness.

We built a mutation-annotated reference SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny with two main macro-haplogroups, A and B, both of Asian origin, and more than 160 sub-branches representing virus strains of variable geographical origins worldwide, revealing a rather uniform mutation occurrence along branches that could have implications for diagnostics and the design of future vaccines. Identification of the root of SARS-CoV-2 genomes is not without problems, owing to conflicting interpretations derived from either using the bat coronavirus genomes as an outgroup or relying on the sampling chronology of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and TMRCA estimates; however, the overall scenario favors haplogroup A as the ancestral node. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a TMRCA for SARS-CoV-2 genomes dating to November 12, 2019, thus matching epidemiological records. Sub-haplogroup A2 most likely originated in Europe from an Asian ancestor and gave rise to subclade A2a, which represents the major non-Asian outbreak, especially in Africa and Europe.

The D-dimer, prothrombin time and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis. No difference on 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3% vs 29.7%, P=0.910). But the 28-day mortality of heparin users were lower than nonusers In patients with SIC score 4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P=0.029), or D-dimer > 6 fold of upper limit of normal (32.8% vs 52.4%, P=0.017).

Methods: Video visits were launched in an academic, multi-subspecialty, ambulatory neurology clinic in March 2020. Adoption of video visits for new and return patient visits was assessed using clinician-level scheduling data from March 22 to May 16, 2020. Perceived utility of video visits was explored via a clinician survey and semistructured interviews with clinicians and patients/caregivers. Findings were compared across 5 subspecialties and 2 visit types (new vs return). Results: Video visits were adopted rapidly; all clinicians (n = 65) integrated video visits into their workflow within the first 6 weeks, and 92% of visits were conducted via video, although this varied by subspecialty. Utility of video visits was higher for return than new patient visits, as indicated by surveyed (n = 48) and interviewed clinicians (n = 30), aligning with adoption patterns. Compared with in-person visits, clinicians believed that it was easier to achieve a similar physical examination, patient-clinician rapport, and perceived quality of care over video for return rather than new patient visits. Of the 25 patients/caregivers interviewed, most were satisfied with the care provided via video, regardless of visit type, with the main limitation being the physical examination. Discussion: Teleneurology was robustly adopted for both new and return ambulatory neurology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Return patient visits were preferred over new patient visits, but both were feasible. These results provide a foundation for developing targeted guidelines for sustaining teleneurology in ambulatory care.","output":"Patient and Clinician Perspectives of New and Return Ambulatory Teleneurology Visits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report herein a fatal case of acute human orthopneumovirus (formerly respiratory syncytial virus) infection in a captive white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar).

Purposes: To classify the number of ridges on the lateral intercondylar wall, identify factors influencing the number of ridges, and define the relationship between the area of denser bone on the lateral intercondylar wall and the lateral intercondylar ridge. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Included were 89 patients with computed tomography (CT) images of the knee joint. On full lateral view of the lateral femoral condyle, the authors evaluated for the presence of a lateral intercondylar ridge. The height and area of the lateral intercondylar wall (notch height and lateral notch area) and the length of Blumensaat line were calculated. Notch outlet length, axial notch area, notch width index, and transepicondylar length were also calculated using 3-dimensional CT. Maximum intensity projection was used to identify the area of denser bone on the femoral lateral intercondylar wall, and the relationship between this area and the lateral intercondylar ridge was investigated. Results: The lateral intercondylar ridge exhibited 3 types of morphological variations. The invisible type (no ridge) was observed in 20 knees (22.5%); the ridge type (1 ridge), in 23 knees (25.8%); and the plateau type (2 ridges), in 46 knees (51.7%). There were significant differences in notch height, lateral notch area, Blumensaat line length, and denser bone area among the ridge types (P  .031 for all). The locations of the anterior ridge of the plateau type and of all 23 ridges of the ridge type corresponded to the anterior margin line of the area of denser bone. Conclusion: Significant differences were seen in the 3 types of lateral intercondylar ridges. The anterior margin line of the denser bone area on the lateral intercondylar wall was found to correspond to the anterior border of the plateau type and the ridge type. Clinical Relevance: The variations in the lateral intercondylar ridge may affect measurement accuracy during evaluation of ACL tunnel position while using the ridge as a landmark. The plateau-type ridge and the area of denser bone on the lateral intercondylar wall may provide a new way for surgeons to determine the femoral tunnel.","output":"Relationship Between Number of Lateral Intercondylar Ridges and Area of Denser Bone on the Lateral Intercondylar Wall"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Majority of schools and other higher educational institutions have rushed to procure the best application in the recent days to deliver content to their students in the best possible manner without wasting time during the course of the new academic year as the threat for Covid-19 arose at around the end of the year 2019 Critical Technology Element, a new or noveltechnology that a platform or system depends on to achieve successful development or production or to successfully meet a system operational threshold requirement, has come to its aid This has slowly become the part of life of all households mostly irrespective of each ones financial status, and thus a part of life for the majority of school going population This in turn, especially the use of technology and social media in the pretext of education has shown both positive and negative impacts on the society and the young generation Now when everything gets back to normal, how are the students going to handle the transition Would they find their old traditional classroom and evaluation techniques worthy enough?

Serious games have advantages in the dissemination of reliable information during the pandemic, as they can offer qualified content while providing interactivity with the user and have great reach over the internet. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a serious game with the purpose of bringing scientific-based information on prevention and personal care against COVID-19. Besides, it proposed to assess the players' knowledge about COVID-19 topics. METHODS: The study was carried out with the interdisciplinary collaboration of specialists in health sciences, computing, and design at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The health recommendations were grouped into six thematic blocks, presented in a quiz format. The software languages were based on the Progressive Web App with the Framework Ionic, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and Typescripts (Angular). Open data reports of how users interact with the serious game were obtained using the Google Analytics API. The visual identity, logo, infographics, and icons were carefully developed considering a selection of colors, typography, sounds, and images suitable for young audiences. Cards with characters were introduced at the end of each thematic topic to interact with the player reinforcing the correct answers or alert the need to know more about the disease. The players' performance was assessed by the rate of errors and successes and analyzed by the linear correlation coefficient, over seven weeks. The agile SCRUM development methodology provided quick and daily interactions by developers through a webchat and sequential team meetings. RESULTS: The game \\"COVID-19 - Did you know?\\" was available for free in the university public domain, on April 1st, 2020. The access number was 17,571, until September 2020. Disclosure actions such as reports on social media and television had a temporal correspondence with a greater access number. The players' error rate in the topic \\"Mask\\" showed a negative trend (r = -.83; P = .01) over the weeks of follow-up. The other topics showed no significant trend over the weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The gamification strategy for health education content on the theme of COVID-19 reached a young audience, considered a priority in the strategy of orientation towards the social distance. Specific educational reinforcement measures were proposed and implemented based on the players' performance.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the clinical care of individuals with prediabetes, determine patient factors associated with this care, and evaluate risk for diabetes development. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using linked claims and electronic health record data. PARTICIPANTS: We created a cohort of adults with prediabetes based on laboratory measures. We excluded patients with a prior history of diabetes, pregnancy in prior 6 months, or recent steroid use. MAIN MEASURES: We measured ordering and completion of clinical services targeting prediabetes management and diabetes incidence within 12 months following cohort entry. We tested the strength of the association between individuals characteristics and outcomes of interest using bivariate and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Our cohort included 3888 patients with a laboratory diagnosis of prediabetes (incident or prevalent prediabetes). Within 12 months, 63.4% had repeat glycemic testing, yet only 10.4% had coded diagnoses of prediabetes, 1.0% were referred for nutrition services, and 5.4% were prescribed metformin. Most patients completed labs and nutrition visits when referred and filled metformin when prescribed. Individuals with a higher glycemic level or BMI were more likely to receive prediabetes clinical care. Six percent of individuals developed diabetes within 12 months of cohort entry and had higher glycemic levels and BMI  30 kg/m(2). In the adjusted model, Black individuals had 1.4 times higher odds of developing diabetes than White individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of prediabetes clinical care activities are low and have not improved.

Though various intubation devices have been demonstrated to perform well in oral endotracheal intubation, limited information is available concerning nasotracheal intubation (NTI) in patients with cervical spine immobilization. The present study compared the performance of the C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope with the McCoy laryngoscope for NTI in patients with simulated cervical spine injuries. METHODS This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, study done in a tertiary hospital. Ninety-five patients requiring NTI were included in data analysis: McCoy group (group M, n = 47) or C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope group (group C, n = 48). A Philadelphia neck collar was applied before anesthetic induction to immobilize the cervical spine. Single experienced anesthesiologist performed NTI. The primary outcome was duration of intubation divided by three steps: nose to oropharynx; oropharynx into glottic inlet; and glottic inlet to trachea. Secondary outcomes included glottic view as percentage of glottis opening (POGO) score and Cormack-Lehance (CL) grade, modified nasal intubation-difficulty scale (NIDS) rating, hemodynamic changes before and after intubation, and complications. RESULTS Total intubation duration was significantly shorter in group C (39.5  11.4 s) compared to group M (48.1  13.9 s). Group C required significantly less time for glottic visualization and endotracheal tube placement in the trachea. More patients in group C had CL grade I and higher POGO scores (P < 0.001, for both measures). No difficulty in NTI (modified NIDS = 0) was more in group C than group M. Hemodynamic changes and incidence of complications were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION The C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope is an effective tool for NTI in a simulated difficult airway, which improves glottic visualization and shortens intubation time relative to those with McCoy laryngoscope.

The aim is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of prolonged medical evacuation of critical patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We included 12 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection: six ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and six non-ventilated patients with hypoxaemia. Transfer on an amphibious assault ship lasted 20 hours. We collected patients' medical records: age, comorbidities, COVID-19 history and diagnosis, ventilation supply and ventilator settings, and blood gas results. We calculated oxygen consumption (OC). RESULTS: All patients had a medical history. The median delay from onset of symptoms to hospitalisation was 8 (7-10) days. The median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on admission was 3 (2-5). There was no significant increase in oxygen during ship transport and no major respiratory complication. There was no significant increase in arterial oxygen pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratio among ventilated patients during ship transport. Among ventilated patients, the median calculated OC was 255 L (222-281) by hours and 5270 L (4908-5616) during all ship transport.

Methods: The mRNA and lncRNA expression matrix of lung adenocarcinoma patients were retrieved from the TCGA database. Next, we constructed a co-expression network of lncRNAs and autophagy-related genes. Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression were then applied to establish a prognostic risk model. Subsequently, a risk score was generated to differentiate the high and low risk groups and a ROC curve and nomogram to visualize the predictive ability of the current signature.

Results: A total of 1,703 autophagy-related lncRNAs were screened and five autophagy-related lncRNAs (LINC01137, AL691432.2, LINC01116, AL606489.1, and HLA-DQB1-AS1) were finally included in our signature. Judging from univariate (HR=1.075, 95% CI=1.046-1.104) and multivariate (HR=1.088, 95% CI=1.057-1.120) Cox regression analysis, the risk score is an independent factor for LUAD patients. Further, the AUC value based on the risk score for 1-year, 3-years, and 5-years, was 0.735, 0.672, and 0.662, respectively, indicating a reliable model. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed low risk patients were more sensitive to Gemcitabine and Gefitinib, while high risk patients had a better response to Paclitaxel and Erlotinib. Moreover, the lncRNAs included in our signature were primarily enriched in the autophagy process, metabolism, p53 pathway, and JAK/STAT pathway. Finally, a multi-omics analysis of correlated genes showed CFLAR overexpressed in the tumor sample, while GAPDH and MLST8 had a slightly higher expression in the normal sample. Conclusion: Overall, our study indicated that the prognostic model we generated had certain predictability for LUAD patients' prognosis and the related genes might be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","output":"A Five Autophagy-Related Long Non-Coding RNA Prognostic Model for Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with HIV (PWH) are unknown Beyond SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, the pandemic may have devastating consequences for HIV care delivery Understanding these is crucial as reduced antiretroviral therapy (ART) availability alone could lead to 500,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2020-2021 With Latin America now a focal point in the pandemic, we sought to describe the impact of COVID-19 on HIV care at Latin American clinical sites Methods: Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) and additional Brazilian HIV care sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru were included An electronic survey of COVID-19 effects on HIV clinic operations was administered in Spanish or English via phone and email, April 28-June 2, 2020 We also compared national COVID-19 case, mortality, and policy data from public sources Results: Brazil's and Mexico's epidemics appear most pronounced, with &gt;10,000 confirmed COVID-19-related deaths (Figure 1);countries implemented social distancing policies at different times after initial cases, with Haiti earliest and Mexico latest (Figure 2) Nearly all 13 sites reported decreased hours and providers for HIV care Twelve of 13 reported increased use of telehealth, suspension/postponements of routine HIV appointments, and/or suspension of HIV research Eleven of 13 reported initiation of new COVID-19 research but suspension of community HIV testing, and nearly half provided additional ART supplies Nearly 70% reported impacts on HIV viral load testing and nearly 40% reported personal protective equipment stock-outs (Table) All 13 sites experienced changes in resources/services in tandem with national policies;there was wide variation, however, in the number of economic and health supports implemented thus far (e g , quarantines, tax deferrals, interest rate reductions, etc ), from 172 COVID-19-related policies in Brazil to only 30 in Mexico Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has already had a substantial effect on daily operations of HIV clinics in Latin America The downstream effects of these impacts on HIV outcomes in Latin America will need to be further studied (Table Presented)","output":"Describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV care in latin america"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a pilot double blind study carried out in Scotland, the effect of supplementing a conventional treatment plan with homoeopathic Arsenicum album was studied.

OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to describe patients' and pharmacists' experience using an asynchronous teleconsultation platform entitled Ask Your Pharmacist (AYP) and gather their perspectives and those of various healthcare and social services professionals providing primary care. METHODS: We performed semi-structured individual interviews over the telephone with patients having used the platform, pharmacists providing teleconsultation services on the platform, and various professionals delivering healthcare and psychosocial services to ambulatory patients. The questions explored specific themes, such as the perceived utility and impacts of the platform. We transcribed the interviews and performed a content analysis. RESULTS: We interviewed eight patients, six AYP pharmacists, and 15 healthcare and social services professionals. Participants perceived that the platform was simple to use and accessible. They also perceived that AYP promoted the visibility and the value of pharmacists' services. Some constraints were also shared, notably regarding questions requiring immediate attention or about complex situations. CONCLUSIONS: The experience and perspectives of users and non-users of the AYP platform are mostly positive, but concerns were also raised regarding patients' safety.

The questionnaire included items on the demographic characteristics of hospital staff and a scale to assess stress among healthcare workers caring for patients with a highly infectious disease. A total of 752 valid questionnaires were collected. The hospital staff reported a moderate level of stress and nurses had a highest level of stress compared to staff in the other three occupational categories. The five highest stress scores were observed for the items rough and cracked hands due to frequent hand washing and disinfectant use, inconvenience in using the toilet at work, restrictions on eating and drinking at work, fear of transmitting the disease to relatives and friends, and fear of being infected with COVID\\\\19. Discomfort caused by protective equipment was the major stressor for the participants, followed by burden of caring for patients. Among participants who experienced severe stress (n = 129), work stress was higher among those with rather than without minor children.

To assess the impact of the Patient Voices series by measuring change in student confidence to interact with patients from underserved communities, comparing student self-ratings of performance in this area with preceptor evaluations, and examining student perceptions of this content.Methods. A series of patient speakers and integrated simulation activities focused on underserved populations (i.e., the Patient Voices series) was embedded into a pharmacy skills laboratory curriculum. First professional year (P1) student self-ratings of confidence were compared on pre- and post-course surveys. Using evaluations from P1 introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE) rotations, student self-evaluation data were compared to preceptor evaluations of student performance. Open-ended responses to course evaluations (from first- and second-year PharmD students) and student reflections (from third-year PharmD students) were assessed using conventional content analysis to identify and characterize student perceptions.Results. Statistically significant increases were observed in P1 students' confidence to show empathy (mean, 4.22 to 4.70) and to interact with patients from underserved communities (mean, 2.24 to 4.22). Preceptor data on empathy was consistent with students' self-rated abilities, while student self-ratings on cultural sensitivity were higher. Qualitative analysis of course evaluation surveys and reflections revealed common themes identified by students such as understanding different perspectives, increased empathy for patients, and the value of including this content in the curriculum.Conclusion.

In the early phase of infection, the single-strand positive RNA genome is translated into non-structural proteins (NSP). One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. This triggers translation inhibition of cellular translation. In spite of the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome, viral translation proceeds however. The molecular mechanism of the so-called viral evasion to NSP1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we confirm that viral translation is maintained in the presence of NSP1. The evasion to NSP1-inhibition is mediated by the cis-acting RNA hairpin SL1 in the 5UTR of SARS-CoV-2. NSP1-evasion can be transferred on a reporter transcript by SL1 transplantation. The apical part of SL1 is only required for viral translation. We show that NSP1 remains bound on the ribosome during viral translation. We suggest that the interaction between NSP1 and SL1 frees the mRNA accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the ribosome. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host translation or fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation depending on the presence of the SL1 5UTR hairpin. SL1 is also present and necessary for translation of sub-genomic RNAs in the late phase of the infectious program. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting SL1 should affect viral translation at early and late stages of infection. Therefore, SL1 might be seen as a genuine Achille heel of the virus.","output":"The viral protein NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper for shutting down host translation and fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este artculo resume la informacin cientfica sobre las caractersticas de los virus SARS-CoV-2, incluyendo el fundamento y las dificultades a las que se enfrenta la bsqueda de su correcto y rpido diagnstico, su tratamiento, y una prevencin eficaz This article summarizes the scientific information about the characteristics of SARSCoV-2, including the basis and difficulties that is facing the search for its correct and fast diagnosis and efficient procedures for its treatment and prevention","output":"Aportaciones de las ciencias biomdicas en el estado de alarma motivado por la pandemia del virus SARS-COV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many jurisdictions and gastroenterological societies around the world have suspended nonurgent endoscopy.

We created an indicator-the COVID-19 bereavement multiplier-that estimates the average number of individuals who will experience the death of a close relative (defined as a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child) for each COVID-19 death. Using demographic microsimulation-based estimates of kinship networks in the United States, the clear age gradient in COVID-19 mortality seen across contexts, and several hypothetical infection prevalence scenarios, we estimate COVID-19 bereavement multipliers for White and Black individuals in the United States. Our analysis shows that for every COVID-19 death, approximately nine surviving Americans will lose a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child. These estimates imply, for example, that if 190,000 Americans die from COVID-19, as some models project, then a1.7 million will experience the death of a close relative. We demonstrate that our estimates of the bereavement multiplier are stable across epidemiological realities, including infection scenarios, total number of deaths, and the distribution of deaths, which means researchers can estimate the bereavement burden over the course of the epidemic in lockstep with rising death tolls. In addition, we provide estimates of bereavement multipliers by age group, types of kin loss, and race to illuminate prospective disparities.

RESULTS: 105 patients (57 male and 48 female) were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. Among the 105 patients, 55 (52%) had made short trips to Wuhan during the two weeks before the onset of illness, and these were the first-generation confirmed cases.

Because of the role of social and environmental factors in COVID-19 transmission and burden of disease, it is essential to ensure that there is adequate coordination of population-based health services and public health interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the primary and community healthcare (P&CHC) systems weaknesses worldwide. In many instances, P&CHC played only a minor role, the emphasis being on hospital and intensive care beds. This was compounded by political failures, in supporting local community resilience. Placing community building, social cohesion and resilience at the forefront of dealing with the COVID-19 crisis can help align solutions that provide a vision of planetary health. This can be achieved by involving local well-being and participation in the face of any pervasive health and environmental crisis, including other epidemics and large-scale ecological crises. This paper proposes that P&CHC should take on two critical roles: first, to support local problem-solving efforts and to serve as a partner in innovative approaches to safeguarding community well-being; and second, to understand the local environment and health risks in the context of the global health perspective.

Summary Emergency, especially in times of crises, requires learning to make choices, but priorities are questionable in the concept of emergency care. It is, therefore, necessary to anticipate questioning and evaluate the consequences of decisions with an ethical approach. The concern comes in part from political and economic constraints whose influence grows within the perimeter of a clinic punctuated by short temporality, unsuitable for reflection. A responsibility is, therefore, shared in the accomplishment of the means of care between the caregiver, a local decision-maker, and the non-caregiver, a remote decision-maker. Emergency teaches us that criticality, both clinical and material or organizational, puts the work of care in tension with a non-specific problem of having to choose to whom to distribute limited resources. Practice then requires an ethical light because the situations experienced project the actors towards a relationship to death. The issue is individual and collective: from a conflict between duty to a person and having to choose between people emerges a psychological and moral suffering that leads to the question of WHO decides or WHO to choose? There is, therefore, every need to look at the emergency decision-making process, namely that choices must be decided that would not be the sole decision of health professionals.

The number of trainers and trainees present in theatre were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: Fewer DIEP flaps were performed in the post-COVID period (45 vs 29). There was no significant difference in mastectomy resection weight, but flap weight was significantly increased. There was no significant difference in ischaemic time. The postoperative length of stay was significantly reduced. There was no significant difference in rates of return to theatre, unplanned admission, infection, haematoma, seroma or wound dehiscence. No cases of venous thromboembolism or flap failures were recorded. The mean number of trainers and trainees, and the trainee-to-trainer ratio was not found to be significantly different between.

Specifically we investigated pre-existing medical conditions, social isolation, financial stress and deprivation as a predictor for wellbeing and whether there were community level characteristics which protect against poorer wellbeing. METHODS: Using online survey responses from the COVID-19 modules of Understanding society, we linked 8379 English cases across five waves of data collection to location based deprivation statistics. We used ordinary least squares regression to estimate the association between deprivation, pre-existing conditions and socio-demographic factors and the change in well-being scores over time, as measured by the GHQ-12 questionnaire. RESULTS: A decline in wellbeing was observed at the beginning of the first lock down period at the beginning of March 2020. This was matched with a corresponding recovery between April and July as restrictions were gradually lifted. There was no association between the decline and deprivation, nor between deprivation and recovery. The strongest predictor of wellbeing during the lock down, was the baseline score, with the counterintuitive finding that for those will pre-existing poor wellbeing, the impact of pandemic restrictions on mental health were minimal, but for those who had previously felt well, the restrictions and the impact of the pandemic on well-being were much greater. CONCLUSIONS: These data show no evidence of a social gradient in well-being related to the pandemic. In fact, well-being was shown to be highly elastic in this period indicating a national level of resilience which cut across the usually observed health inequalities.","output":"An analysis of changes in wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Introduccin: en el contexto de la pandemia por la COVID-19 y debido a su alta contagiosidad y al nmero cada vez mayor de casos confirmados y muertes en el mundo, las emociones y los pensamientos negativos se extienden como amenaza hacia la salud mental.

Introduction: The Mediterranean diet (MDiet), reduces morbidity and mortality. The lockdown that took place in Spain between the months of March and May 2020 may have led to behavioural changes. The aim of the present study was to assess adherence to the MDiet at the end of the lockdown period and to compare it with the situation prior to it. Methods: Data were obtained by means of two online questionnaires, one at the beginning of lockdown and the other at the end, completed by adults from the Spanish population, who responded anonymously and voluntarily. The assessment of adherence to the MDiet was carried out using two questionnaires: Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and modified PREDIMED, which contained 14 questions each. Other variables included were: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), Autonomous Community of origin, home living conditions, and level of studies achieved. At the end of the lockdown period, the comparison was made using the Student t statistic and the McNemar test. Results: A total of 207 people (137 women) participated, with a mean age 51.3  12.4 years, age range: 20-83 years. After lockdown, BMI remained unchanged (initial 24.55  3.7 kg / m2 and final 24.57  3.7 kg / m2, p=.752), as well as fish consumption (initial 51.2%) and 60.9% at the end, p=.003) mainly due to the women and adherence to the Mdiet. The mean total score of MEDAS increased with 10.6  2.0 at the beginning, and 10.57  2.0 at the end; p=.001). This also occurred with the modified PREDIMED (9.47  2.1 at the beginning and 9.93  2.1 at the end, p<.001). Similarly, the proportion of participants that had a score classified as high at the beginning increased at the end of lockdown: from 80.7% initially in MEDAS to 87.9% at the end, p=.021, and from 68.6% initially in modified PREDIMED to 75.8% at the end, p=.037. Conclusions: In the study sample, during lockdown there were no changes in BMI, but there were increases in fish consumption and adherence to the MDiet.","output":"Influencia del confinamiento ocurrido en Espa?a debido a la pandemia por el virus SARS-CoV-2 en la adherencia a la dieta mediterrnea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We aimed to investigate the demographic shifts in emergency service admissions, possible measures and room for improvement in emergency services during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methodology: Our study retrospectively analysed the demographic features and clinical admission types of patients admitted to Batman District State Hospital Emergency Service at two different time periods, one between 28 March 2019 and 28 April 2019 (prior to the Covid-19 pandemic) and the other between 28 March 2020 and 28 April 2020 (during the Covid-19 pandemic). The results were compared between the two periods designated as the pandemic period and the pre-pandemic period. Results: The number of patients admitted to emergency service was 47,681 in the pre-pandemic period and 9455 in the pandemic period (P &lt;.01). The number of patients examined in green zone (non-urgent cases) was 27,701 (58%) in the pre-pandemic period and 3668 (38.7%) in the pandemic period (P &lt;.01). The number of patients admitted for trauma was 1247 (2.61%) in the pre-pandemic period and 59 (0.62%) in the pandemic period (P &lt;.01). The number of patients hospitalised to cardiology department or coronary care unit for acute coronary syndrome was 602 (1.26%) in the pre-pandemic period and 29 (0.3%) in the pandemic period (P &lt;.01). The number of patients hospitalised to neurological intensive care unit for acute cerebrovascular disease was 542 (1.13%) in the pre-pandemic period and 22 (0.2%) in the pandemic period (P &lt;.01).

Conclusion: Measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection have caused a significant drop in emergency service admissions. We are of the opinion that this will lead to an increase in deaths occurring at home, and we will soon encounter patients with worse prognosis and overcrowded emergency services. We are in opinion that the public awareness about emergency conditions requiring emergency service admission should be heightened alongside of the stay home calls.

Healthcare workers are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments and specialists in Spain. METHODS Nationwide survey addressing the impact of COVID-19 on resources, procedures and physicians of Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments in 81 hospitals representative of the Spanish National Health Service. RESULTS Overall, 41.8% of hospital beds and 40.7% of Gastroenterology and Hepatology beds were allocated to COVID-19 patient care, as well as 24.8% of gastroenterologists and 58.3% of residents. Outpatient visits, abdominal ultrasounds and endoscopies were reduced by 81.8-91.9%. Nine large university hospitals had 75% and 89% reductions in therapeutic endoscopies and hepatocellular carcinoma surgery, respectively, with cancellation of elective liver transplant and TIPS. Prevalence of infected physicians was 10.6% and was dependent on regional population incidence (r = 0.74, P = 0.001), with 11% hospitalized and one physician dying. Up to 63.4% of physicians may have been infected before or shortly after Spain entered lockdown, 57% of them having recently performed endoscopies. Adequate protection was acknowledged in >80% hospitals but only 2.9% performed regular SARS-CoV-2 testing. CONCLUSIONS The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery has been massive. A wave of Gastroenterology-related complications is expected due to resource diversion. Gastroenterologists have a high prevalence of infection although they may have been infected during a first phase of lower awareness and protection. Regular SARS-CoV-2 screening, adequate protection and quick reorganization of healthcare resources are still needed.","output":"MASSIVE IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY DEPARTMENTS AND DOCTORS IN SPAIN."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of candidemia in our hospital has been stable over an 18\\\\year period (1.3 episodes per 1000 admissions).

This study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. METHODS A cohort of 158 employees, who were identified as high risk to respiratory biohazard exposure, were invited to participate in the RPP. We provided a bundle of interventions, which included an online training package, and mandatory quantitative fit testing. The main outcomes included the participants' knowledge and attitude toward respiratory protection equipment (RPE), which were assessed via an online survey. Their donning and doffing skills, and user seal check techniques on four different types of N95 respirators were also assessed by an observer using a pre-determined marking sheet. We compared these outcomes before and after participation in the program. RESULTS There was a total of 125 participants, all of whom completed the knowledge and attitude assessment, and 69 completed the skill assessment before and after the program. There was a statistically significant improvement in their knowledge scores, donning and doffing skills, and user seal check techniques after participation in the RPP. Participants also reported significant increased level of confidence in their RPE knowledge, training and skills; and workplace safety.

This work further expands their activity profile by identifying seven benzylamine-containing dithiocarbamate derivatives with piperazine and piperidine substitutions at the main moiety, and five piperazine-containing dithiocarbamates with various substitutions at the piperazine moiety as new inhibitors of -glucosidase. Compounds bearing the benzylamine moiety exhibited more potent inhibition of the enzyme than the piperazine derivatives. Majority of the compounds noncompetitively inhibited -glucosidase that led to the identification of a new allosteric site on the enzyme with the help of molecular dynamics and docking studies. These studies suggest that the compounds regulate inhibition of the enzyme by binding to an allosteric site that is located in the vicinity of the active site. This is the first report on the allosteric inhibition of -glucosidase by dithiocarbamate derivatives that provides insights into the mechanism of inhibition of the enzyme at molecular level.

However, engagement with and adherence to guidance on testing, self-isolation, and providing details of contacts can be low and interventions are needed. This qualitative study aimed to identify the key factors affecting adherence to test, trace, and isolate behaviours using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). METHODS: We conducted six online focus groups between October 2020 and February 2021 with people living in Sheffield who came into close contact with others in work or social settings (N = 30). The focus groups explored capability, opportunity, and motivational barriers to adherence to test, trace, and isolate behaviours. Framework analysis was used to code the data into TDF domains. RESULTS: There is a complex relationship between the factors affecting COVID-19 symptom identification, testing, and self-isolation. People who perceived significant barriers to testing and self-isolation were less likely to interpret potential symptoms as COVID-19, and perceiving barriers to self-isolation reduced the likelihood of requesting a test. Concerns about the negative consequences of self-isolation for themselves and others were common and also influenced willingness to pass on details of contacts. There was a lack of trust in the Test and Trace system, with people wanting further evidence of being at risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Communications and interventions to increase adherence to test, trace, and isolate strategies need to consider the interplay of these behaviours and their influences and target them collectively. Efforts to promote testing should focus on the range of barriers to self-isolation, especially increasing financial and practical support, and include new messaging to promote symptom identification.

Although we have upgraded our global GDP growth forecast for 2021 again, to 6.0% from 5.6%, we do not expect this to trigger a sustained rise in inflationary pressures. We still view the pandemic as being disinflationary and expect the low inflation/low yield environment of the past decade to persist. ? The US looks set for an even bigger fiscal boost than we had expected a month ago, and its GDP growth is now seen at 7.0% this year. We expect the full $1.9trn of fiscal measures to be passed, rather than the $1.3trn package previously assumed. Strong US demand and a fall in global Covid cases bode well for the world economy. ? However, a growing concern is that the ongoing substantial global fiscal support, combined with the release of pent\\\\up demand as restrictions are eased, may cause a sustained pick\\\\up in inflation. Although we expect some factors, many of which are a direct consequence of the pandemic, and rising oil prices to lead to higher headline inflation in the short term, we do not see a sustained overshoot of inflation targets. ? First, fiscal policy is expected to be a bit tighter at a global level this year than in 2020 and, while households have built up large stocks of savings over the past year, the unwind is likely to be gradual and a large share of these unplanned savings may be permanently saved rather than spent. ? Second, we do not see a strong argument why higher costs and inflation in the short term will lead to an inflationary spiral. Workers are in no position to push up wages in response to the near\\\\term rise in inflation. And while some sectors that have seen surges in demand during the pandemic may be able to pass on higher costs and even expand their margins, this will be offset by weaker price pressures among the sectoral losers from the pandemic. ?

The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (a4%) compared to health care professionals (a14%). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from severe forms of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition, to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20-200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (30-100 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. METHODS: Our hypothesis is that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter time to response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ+standard-of-care (CPZ+SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ+SOC group, compared to the SOC group: (A) superior clinical improvement; (B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); (C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); (D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; (E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; (F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps and can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its \\"LARGe ACTion\\" properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Repositionnement de la chlorpromazine dans le traitement du COVID-19 : tude reCoVery./ [Repurposing of chlorpromazine in COVID-19 treatment: the reCoVery study]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to examine the challenges students experienced during the lockdowns imposed by the government to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak in Afghanistan.

In the context of a national drive to advance practice of Allied Health Professionals to address some key challenges facing the National Health Service, we explored whether UK speech and language therapists (SLTs) felt it is possible to utilize and extend their existing skills to patients on the urgent 2-week wait (2ww) ENT pathway. AIMS To explore SLTs' views of extending their role to work with patients referred on the ENT 2ww pathway. METHODS & PROCEDURES Two separate focus groups were conducted using nominal group technique to generate and rank benefits and challenges of the proposed extension of role. Participants were invited to take part through Clinical Excellence Networks relevant to head and neck cancer and voice sub-specialties. Participants were competent in performing nasendscopy in at least a highly specialist role in voice or head and neck subspecialties. OUTCOMES & RESULTS Nine SLTs from England, Wales and Northern Ireland attended two focus groups. All were employed in band 8 roles in head and neck and/or voice. Eight were competent to Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists' scoping level 3. Important benefits of the proposed novel service delivery model were generated and ranked by participants, with both groups identifying improved quality and efficiency of service for patients among the most important. Disadvantages were then generated and ranked across the two groups with potential for misdiagnosis ranked as the most important by both. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS Participants responded that extending the SLT role into assessment of 2ww patients would provide benefits for quality of care, healthcare efficiency and the SLT workforce. The identified disadvantages require addressing if the proposed SLT-led model of service delivery is piloted in the UK. These include practical matters such as referral and prescribing rights, alongside wider implications such as support, governance, indemnity, acknowledgement and remuneration for the extended role. Nationally agreed competencies and training for the role are required if this model is to be successful. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS What is already known on this subject? International studies have shown that SLTs provide safe and effective assessment for routine ENT referrals with dysphonia and dysphagia, reducing ENT waiting lists in the process (Payten et al., 2020; Seabrook et al., 2019). The current study is the first, to the authors' knowledge, to explore views of the profession regarding SLTs' involvement in assessing patients on the more urgent ENT 2ww pathway in the UK, particularly in the primary care setting. What this study adds The greatest benefits of SLTs assessing patients with dysphonia and dysphagia in the 2ww wait clinic were felt to be for patients through prompt, holistic consultation from a clinician with expert knowledge in their disorder. The greatest disadvantages were posed for the workforce such as potential to miss diagnoses, risk of litigation and the increased burden of responsibility. While advantages are clear for service users, the disadvantages must be addressed if such a model is to be implemented. Clinical implications of this study Expert SLTs communicated strongly that SLTs would be a beneficial addition to the 2ww assessment clinic for patients with dysphonia and dysphagia. For this role to be piloted and implemented successfully, their concerns around increased responsibility, potential for litigation and missed diagnoses need to be addressed. If the SLT role is to be extended to the 2ww clinic, robust training, competencies, supervision, guidance and recognition are necessary to support clinicians in this role and protect patients. Some practical matters such as referral and prescription rights also require exploration.","output":"Scoping opinion: Speech and language therapists' views on extending their role to the urgent ear, nose and throat pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in containing HIV replication and delaying disease progression. However, HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells become progressively more exhausted as chronic HIV infection proceeds. Symptoms of T cell exhaustion range from expression of inhibitory receptors and selective loss of cytokine production capacity through reduced proliferative potential, impaired differentiation into effector cells and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. While effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) durably reduces HIV viremia to undetectable levels, this alone does not restore the full pluripotency of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells. In a number of studies, a subset of peptide epitope variants categorized as heteroclitic, restimulated more potent cellular immune responses in vitro than did the native, immunizing peptides themselves. This property of heteroclitic peptides has been exploited in experimental cancer and chronic viral infection models to promote clearance of transformed cells and persistent viruses. In this review, we consider the possibility that heteroclitic peptides could improve the efficacy of therapeutic vaccines as part of HIV immunotherapy or eradication strategies. We review literature on heteroclitic peptides and illustrate their potential to beneficially modulate the nature of HIV-specific T cell responses toward those found in the small minority of HIV-infected, aviremic cART-na?ve persons termed elite controllers or long-term non-progressors. Our review suggests that the efficacy of HIV vaccines could be improved by identification, testing, and incorporation of heteroclitic variants of native HIV peptide epitopes.","output":"Enhancing Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Specific CD8(+) T Cell Responses with Heteroclitic Peptides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS This study investigates whether a straight-to-test colorectal cancer pathway improves attainment of the NHS England 28-day Faster Diagnosis Standard and the effect of the pathway on reducing face-to-face outpatient clinic appointments. Patient satisfaction and the safety of a novel GP-led patient triage system regarding suitability for colonoscopy are also evaluated. METHODS This is an observational study of all patients managed via a straight-to-test colorectal cancer pathway between 1st September 2019 and 19th March 2020. Comparison is made with all patients referred on the suspected colorectal cancer pathway prior to implementation of the straight-to-test pathway from 1st January 2019 to 30th July 2019. Patient satisfaction with the straight-to-test pathway was assessed with a telephone-based questionnaire. RESULTS Attainment of the 28-day diagnosis target for all suspected colorectal cancer referrals improved following the establishment of the straight-to-test pathway (88% vs 82%, p<0.0001). From a potential total of 548 outpatient colorectal clinic appointments for patients on the straight-to-test pathway, 504 (92%) were avoided. In those eligible for the straight-to-test pathway, GP assessment of patients suitable for colonoscopy agreed with that of the colorectal department in 93% of cases. Of the 50 patients who undertook the satisfaction survey, 86% were satisfied or very satisfied with the pathway. No patient suffered adverse events as a result of their straight-to-test investigations. CONCLUSION A straight-to-test pathway for suspected colorectal cancer referrals with novel GP-led patient triage safely streamlines patients through the suspected colorectal cancer diagnostic pathway and significantly reduces requirement for face-to-face outpatient clinic attendance.

We aimed to characterise the linear and non-linear relationships of 27 physiological indicators with all-cause mortality to evaluate whether the current clinical thresholds are suitable in distinguishing patients at high risk for mortality from those at low risk. Methods: For this observational cohort study of the US non-institutionalised population, we used data from adults (18 years) included in the 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) linked with National Death Index mortality data collected from Jan 1, 1999, up until Dec 31, 2015. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age, sex, and race or ethnicity to assess associations of physiological indicators with all-cause mortality. We assessed non-linear associations by discretising the physiological indicator into nine quantiles (termed novemtiles) and by using a weighted sum of cubic polynomials (spline). We used ten-fold cross validation to select the most appropriate model using the concordance index, Nagelkerke R2, and Akaike Information Criterion. We identified the level of each physiological indicator that led to a 10% increase in mortality risk to define our cutoffs used to compare with the current clinical thresholds. Findings: We included 47 266 adults of 82 091 assessed for eligibility. 25 (93%) of 27 indicators showed non-linear associations with substantial increases compared with linear models in mortality risk (15-25-times increase). Height and 60 s pulse were the only physiological indicators to show linear associations. For example, participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 65 mL/min per 173 m2 or between 90-116 mL/min per 173 m2 are at moderate (hazard ratio 1-2) mortality risk. Those with a GFR greater than 117 mL/min per 173 m2 show substantial (hazard ratio 2) mortality risk. Both lower and higher values of cholesterol are associated with increased mortality risk. The current clinical thresholds do not align with our mortality-based cutoffs for fat deposition indices, 60 s pulse, triglycerides, cholesterol-related indicators, alkaline phosphatase, glycohaemoglobin, homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and GFR. For these indicators, the misalignment suggests the need to consider an additional bound when only one is provided. Interpretation: Most clinical indicators were shown to have non-linear associations with all-cause mortality. Furthermore, considering these non-linear associations can help derive reliable cutoffs to complement risk stratification and help inform clinical care delivery. Given the poor alignment with our proposed cutoffs, the current clinical thresholds might not adequately capture mortality risk.","output":"Characterising the relationships between physiological indicators and all-cause mortality (NHANES): a population-based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A universal community testing programme (UCTP) was initiated by the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, as part of a territory\\\\wide initiative to enhance the control of the coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) pandemic, to facilitate the early identification of asymptomatic patients in the community\\\\transmission chain.

The fact that mostly physicians teach tomorrows physicians without acquiring pedagogical skills before becoming a teacher is a cause of concern. In Hungary, where traditional teaching methods are common, and teachers have not had pedagogical courses in medical education there has not been any research dealing with the issue. On the one hand, we aimed with this cross-sectional study to examine the attitudes of teachers towards learning outcomes of medical students to get a view about the opinions about their importance and rate of delivery. On the other hand, we analyzed the pedagogical skills of teachers from the students and teachers perspective in Hungary. METHODS: Data collection through self-reported questionnaires in online form in all the four Hungarian higher education institutions offering medical education was carried out among teachers and students with active student legal status in 2017. We validated the questionnaires of the two respondents groups. We used gap matrices to represent the correspondences of the delivery and perceived importance of the learning outcomes. We calculated averages of the pedagogical skills and compared them with t-tests. RESULTS: The response rates are 11.18% in case of the students (1505) and 24.53% in case of the teachers (439). The results indicate the lack of concordance between the rates of the learning outcomes in terms of their importance and delivery - no positive gap can be observed -, and the need for pedagogical skills among teachers and students.

The fourteenth-century Black Death, which is usually believed to have led to a significant reduction in economic inequality, has attracted the greatest attention. However, the picture becomes much more complex if other epidemics are considered. This article covers the worst epidemics of preindustrial times, from the Plague of Justinian of 540-41 to the last great European plagues of the seventeenth century, as well as the cholera waves of the nineteenth. It shows how the distributive outcomes of lethal epidemics do not only depend upon mortality rates, but are mediated by a range of factors, chief among them the institutional framework in place at the onset of each crisis. It then explores how past epidemics affected poverty, arguing that highly lethal epidemics could reduce its prevalence through two deeply different mechanisms: redistribution toward the poor or extermination of the poor. It concludes by recalling the historical connection between the progressive weakening and spacing in time of lethal epidemics and improvements in life expectancy, and by discussing how epidemics affected inequality in health and living standards.","output":"Epidemics, Inequality, and Poverty in Preindustrial and Early Industrial Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Central to measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV is understanding the role of loss of access to essential HIV prevention and care services created by clinic and community-based organization closures. In this paper, we use a comprehensive list of HIV prevention services in four corridors of the US heavily impacted by HIV, developed as part of a large RCT, to illustrate the potential impact of service closure on LGBTQ+ youth. METHODS: We identified and mapped LGBTQ+ friendly services offering at least one of the following HIV-related services: HIV testing; STI testing; PrEP/PEP; HIV treatment and care; and other HIV-related services in 109 counties across four major interstate corridors heavily affected by HIV US Census regions: Pacific (San Francisco, CA to San Diego, CA); South-Atlantic (Washington, DC to Atlanta, GA); East-North-Central (Chicago, IL to Detroit, MI); and East-South-Central (Memphis, TN to New Orleans, LA). RESULTS: There were a total of 831 LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service providers across the 109 counties. There was a range of LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV-service provider availability across counties (range: 0C14.33 per 10,000 youth aged 13C24 (IQR: 2.13), median: 1.09); 9 (8.26%) analyzed counties did not have any LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service providers. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the correlation between county HIV prevalence and LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service provider density was 0.16 (p = 0.09), suggesting only a small, non-statistically significant linear relationship between a countys available LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service providers and their HIV burden.

CABG is associated with myocardial damage due to ischemia/reperfusion injury. In addition, postoperative complications, including perioperative myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation and graft failure, remain important clinical challenges. So far, no reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools to predict outcomes after CABG surgery have been established. MiRNAs are noncoding, 21C24 nucleotide-long RNA particles, expressions of which alter during CABG surgery. Here, we summarize the potential clinical applicability of miRNAs as promising biomarkers to predict post-CABG procedure outcomes. ABSTRACT: MiRNAs are noncoding, 21C24 nucleotide-long RNA particles that control over 60% of genes. MiRNAs affect gene expression through binding to the 3-untranslated region of messenger RNA (mRNA), thus inhibiting mRNA translation or inducing mRNA degradation. MiRNAs have been associated with various cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, or ischemic heart disease. In addition, miRNA expression alters during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, which could be used to predict perioperative outcomes. CABG is an operation in which complex coronary arteries stenosis is treated by bypassing atherosclerotic lesions with venous or arterial grafts. Despite a very low perioperative mortality rate and excellent long-term survival, CABG is associated with postoperative complications, including reperfusion injury, graft failure, atrial fibrillation and perioperative myocardial infarction. So far, no reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools to predict prognosis after CABG have been developed. Changes in the perioperative miRNA expression levels could improve the diagnosis of post-CABG myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation and could be used to stratify risk after CABG. Herein, we describe the expression changes of different subtypes of miRNAs during CABG and review the diagnostic and prognostic utility of miRNAs in patients undergoing CABG.","output":"Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of miRNAs after Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Worldwide, seasonal influenza imposes a considerable health and economic burden. Clinical diagnosis of influenza-like illness (ILI) is complicated by non-specific symptomatology. Rapid flu tests (RFTs) impact treatment decisions and may improve patient care; yet, recommendations for RFT use are broad, and the performance of unaided clinical diagnosis relative to RFTs is unclear. OBJECTIVES To determine age-stratified, overall sensitivities and specificities of the widely studied RFT, QuickVue? (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA), and clinical diagnosis of ILI by meta-analysis and to seek factors associated with poorer clinical diagnostic discrimination. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted using article selection criteria identifying studies indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and other pertinent sources of studies reporting sensitivity, specificity, and effects of RFTs and clinical diagnosis on decision-making for patients with ILI. RESULTS QuickVue's? diagnostic specificity exceeds that of unaided clinical diagnosis by 29-31%. False-positive results occur approximately 8.2 times more frequently by unaided clinical diagnosis than by the RFT alone. These findings were unaffected by seasonal variations in disease prevalence. RFTs reduce diagnostic testing, antibiotic use, and emergency department utilization while increasing antiviral prescription rates. No systematic relationship between the broadness of clinical diagnostic criteria for influenza and diagnostic performance was observed across studies included in this review. CONCLUSIONS Use of RFTs improves seasonal influenza diagnostic specificity above that based on unaided clinical diagnosis irrespective of the broadness of clinical diagnostic criteria, and affects clinical decision-making. These results provide an improved framework upon which to diagnose influenza, design future RFT studies, and modify existing recommendations for improved ILI patient management.","output":"Rapid diagnostic testing for seasonal influenza: an evidence-based review and comparison with unaided clinical diagnosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Frailty, increased vulnerability to physiological stressors, is associated with adverse outcomes. COVID-19 exhibits a more severe disease course in older, co-morbid adults. Awareness of atypical presentations is critical to facilitate early identification. OBJECTIVE: To assess how frailty affects presenting COVID-19 symptoms in older adults. DESIGN: Observational cohort study of hospitalised older patients and self-report data for community-based older adults. SETTING: Admissions to St Thomas Hospital, London with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Community-based data for older adults using the COVID Symptom Study mobile application. SUBJECTS: Hospital cohort: patients aged 65 and over (n = 322); unscheduled hospital admission between March 1(st), 2020-May 5(th), 2020; COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab. Community-based cohort: participants aged 65 and over enrolled in the COVID Symptom Study (n = 535); reported test-positive for COVID-19 from March 24th (application launch)-May 8(th), 2020. METHODS: Multivariable logistic regression analysis performed on age-matched samples from hospital and community-based cohorts to ascertain association of frailty with symptoms of confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Hospital cohort: significantly higher prevalence of probable delirium in the frail sample, with no difference in fever or cough. Community-based cohort: significantly higher prevalence of possible delirium in frailer, older adults, and fatigue and shortness of breath. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating higher prevalence of probable delirium as a COVID-19 symptom in older adults with frailty compared to other older adults. This emphasises need for systematic frailty assessment and screening for delirium in acutely ill older patients in hospital and community settings.

Estrogen deficiency increases the NAFLD risk among postmenopausal women. Thus, effective agents to prevent and treat NAFLD in postmenopausal women are required. Quercitrin (Quer) is a natural glycosylated flavonoid with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic effects. This study investigated whether Quer improves dysregulated lipid metabolism and suppresses hepatic steatosis in ovariectomized (OVX) mice as an experimental model mimicking postmenopausal women. Mice were assigned to the following four groups: SHAM, OVX, OVX + -estradiol (0.4 mg/kg diet), and OVX + Quer (500 mg/kg diet). Mice were administered a diet with or without Quer for three months. OVX mice displayed significantly higher body mass, epidermal fat, and liver weights than those of SHAM mice. However, these levels were reduced in Quer-treated mice. Quer treatment reduced the levels of serum lipid metabolites, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, Quer reduced liver lipid steatosis and inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-, IL-6, and IL-1. The results of the present study indicate that Quer improves dysregulated lipid metabolism and reduces hepatic steatosis and inflammation by compensating for estrogen deficiency, suggesting that Quer may potentially exert protective effects during hepatic steatosis in postmenopausal women.","output":"Quercitrin Ameliorates Hyperlipidemia and Hepatic Steatosis in Ovariectomized Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dimitris and Platt (Am J Epidemiol.

METHODS: A single-institution retrospective chart review was conducted of men treated with pelvic external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and SBRT boost (21Gy/19Gy in 2 fractions) to the prostate for prostate cancer. A cohort treated at the same institution with high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost (19Gy in 2 fractions) was compared. Propensity-score (PS) matching and multivariable Cox regression were used for analysis. Outcomes were biochemical-recurrence-freedom (BCRF) and metastasis-freedom (MF). RESULTS: 131 men were treated with SBRT boost and 101 with HDR boost with median follow-up of 73.4 and 186.0 months, respectively. 68.8% of men had high-risk and 26.0% had unfavorable-intermediate disease, and 94.3% received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Five- and 10-year unadjusted BCRF was 88.8%/85.3% for SBRT and 91.8%/74.6% for HDR boost (Log-Rank P=0.3), and 5- and 10-year unadjusted MF was 91.7%/84.3% for SBRT and 95.8%/82.0% for HDR (Log-Rank P=0.8). After adjusting for covariates, there was no statistically significant difference in BCRF (HR 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-1.79, P=0.6) or MF (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.44-2.57, P=0.9) between SBRT and HDR boost.

In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, SCC is a clinically significant cause of disease-related morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether screening for SCC with spinal MRI, and pre-emptive treatment if radiological SCC (rSCC) was detected, reduced the incidence of clinical SCC (cSCC) in asymptomatic patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and spinal metastasis. METHODS We did a parallel-group, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3, superiority trial. Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were recruited from 45 National Health Service hospitals in the UK. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years, with an Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, asymptomatic spinal metastasis, no previous SCC, and no spinal MRI in the past 12 months. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a minimisation algorithm with a random element (balancing factors were treatment centre, alkaline phosphatase [normal vs raised, with the upper limit of normal being defined at each participating laboratory], number of previous systemic treatments [first-line vs second-line or later], previous spinal treatment, and imaging of thorax and abdomen), to no MRI (control group) or screening spinal MRI (intervention group). Serious adverse events were monitored in the 24 h after screening MRI in the intervention group. Participants with screen-detected rSCC were offered pre-emptive treatment (radiotherapy or surgical decompression was recommended per treating physician's recommendation) and 6-monthly spinal MRI. All patients were followed up every 3 months, and then at month 30 and 36. The primary endpoint was time to and incidence of confirmed cSCC in the intention-to-treat population (defined as all patients randomly assigned), with the primary timepoint of interest being 1 year after randomisation. The study is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN74112318, and is now complete. FINDINGS Between Feb 26, 2013, and April 25, 2017, 420 patients were randomly assigned to the control (n=210) or screening MRI (n=210) groups. Median age was 74 years (IQR 68 to 79), 222 (53%) of 420 patients had normal alkaline phosphatase, and median prostate-specific antigen concentration was 48 ng/mL (IQR 17 to 162). Screening MRI detected rSCC in 61 (31%) of 200 patients with assessable scans in the intervention group. As of data cutoff (April 23, 2020), at a median follow-up of 22 months (IQR 13 to 31), time to cSCC was not significantly improved with screening (hazard ratio 064 [95% CI 037 to 111]; Gray's test p=012). 1-year cSCC rates were 67% (95% CI 38-106; 14 of 210 patients) for the control group and 43% (21-77; nine of 210 patients) for the intervention group (difference -24% [95% CI -42 to 01]). Median time to cSCC was not reached in either group. No serious adverse events were reported within 24 h of screening. INTERPRETATION Despite the substantial incidence of rSCC detected in the intervention group, the rate of cSCC in both groups was low at a median of 22 months of follow-up. Routine use of screening MRI and pre-emptive treatment to prevent cSCC is not warranted in patients with asymptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with spinal metastasis.

Those who displayed more anxiety about acquiring COVID-19 disease were more likely to accept COVID-19 antibody testing. If the antibody test results showed protective antibodies, 1,190 (58.1%) were more likely to arrange travel plans in China, while 526 (25.7%) thought they would feel safer traveling abroad. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination strategies help reduce public anxiety. However, public anxiety may be elevated as the local transmission of COVID-19 occurs in mainland China, which is usually caused now by imported cases. Those who display more anxiety choose to have antibody testing. Improving the accessibility of COVID-19 antibody tests can help ease public anxiety and enhance the confidence of some people to participate in social activities.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccines and Public Anxiety: Antibody Tests May Be Widely Accepted"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Four Bovidae cell lines (BEK\\\\1, MDBK, Bu and EBTr) were characterized by means of enzymatic biochemical markers.

Despite focused efforts to achieve this balance, the frequency of both thrombotic and bleeding events remains high. Anticoagulation is complicated to manage in this population due to the complexities of the hemostatic system that are compounded by age-related developmental hemostatic changes, variable effects of the etiology of critical illness on hemostasis, and blood-circuit interaction. Lack of high-quality data to guide anticoagulation management in ECMO patients results in marked practice variability among centers. One aspect of anticoagulation therapy that is particularly challenging is the use of antithrombin (AT) supplementation for heparin resistance. This is especially controversial in the neonatal and pediatric population due to the baseline higher risk of bleeding in this cohort. The indication for AT supplementation is further compounded by the potential inaccuracy of the diagnosis of heparin resistance based on the standard laboratory parameters used to assess heparin effect. With concerns regarding the adverse impact of bleeding and thrombosis, clinicians and institutions are faced with making difficult, real-time decisions aimed at optimizing anticoagulation in this setting. In this clinically focused review, the authors discuss the complexities of anticoagulation monitoring and therapeutic intervention for patients on ECMO and examine the challenges surrounding AT supplementation given both the historical and current perspectives summarized in the literature on these topics.","output":"Clinical controversies in anticoagulation monitoring and antithrombin supplementation for ECMO"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard in diagnosis for infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the false-negative result is the problem in the prevention and control the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Molecular mimicry, manifested by structural similarity between viral and endogenous host proteins, allow viruses to harness or disrupt cellular functions including nucleic acid metabolism and modulation of immune responses. Here, we use protein structure similarity to scan for virally encoded structure mimics across thousands of catalogued viruses and hosts spanning broad ecological niches and taxonomic range, including bacteria, plants and fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates. Our survey identified over 6,000,000 instances of structural mimicry, the vast majority of which (>70%) cannot be discerned through protein sequence. The results point to molecular mimicry as a pervasive strategy employed by viruses and indicate that the protein structure space used by a given virus is dictated by the host proteome. Interrogation of proteins mimicked by human-infecting viruses points to broad diversification of cellular pathways targeted via structural mimicry, identifies biological processes that may underly autoimmune disorders, and reveals virally encoded mimics that may be leveraged to engineer synthetic metabolic circuits or may serve as targets for therapeutics. Moreover, the manner and degree to which viruses exploit molecular mimicry varies by genome size and nucleic acid type, with ssRNA viruses circumventing limitations of their small genomes by mimicking human proteins to a greater extent than their large dsDNA counterparts.

Characterizing the host cytokine response to RSV infection, the regulation of host cytokines and the impact of neutralizing an RSV-inducible cytokine during infection were undertaken in this study. METHODS: A549, primary human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and wild-type, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (Mavs) knockout (KO) mice were infected with RSV and cytokine responses were investigated by ELISA, multiplex analysis and qPCR. Neutralizing anti-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) IgG or control IgG was administered to a group of wild-type animals prior to RSV infection. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: RSV-infected A549 and SAE cells release a network of cytokines, including newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines LIF, migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-). These RSV-inducible cytokines were also observed in the airways of mice during an infection. To identify the regulation of RSV inducible cytokines, Mavs and Trif deficient animals were infected with RSV. In vivo induction of airway IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IFN-, CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CXCL1, IP-10/CXCL10, IL-22, MIG/CXCL9 and MIF were dependent on Mavs expression in mice. Loss of Trif expression in mice altered the RSV induction of IL-1, IL-5, CXCL12, MIF, LIF, CXCL12 and IFN-. Silencing of retinoic acidCinducible gene-1 (RIG-I) expression in A549 cells had a greater impact on RSV-inducible cytokines than melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), and Trif expression. To evaluate the role of LIF in the airways during RSV infection, animals were treated with neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, which enhanced RSV pathology observed with increased airspace protein content, apoptosis and airway hyperresponsiveness compared to control IgG treatment. CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection in the epithelium induces a network of immune factors to counter infection, primarily in a RIG-I dependent manner. Expression of LIF protects the lung from lung injury and enhanced pathology during RSV infection.

The aim of this explorative review was to assess and compare the prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) in male healthcare workers and males during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic review of major databases from inception to February 2021 was conducted. Prevalence data were extracted, and a random-effects meta-analysis was undertaken. OUTCOMES: The pooled prevalence of ED amongst healthcare workers working in COVID-19 specific environments, and non-healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Of 52 initial studies, six were included for the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of ED in healthcare workers working in a COVID-19 environment was 63.6% (95% CI 20.3C92.3%), and in non-healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 31.9% (95% CI 19.5C47.6%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ED in healthcare workers working in COVID-19 environments was higher than representative samples and is of concern. Sexual health (and by extension, overall health), should be a priority when considering ways to care for this population.

METHODS: At one metropolitan trauma center ED, we conducted a review of all visits from February to May in 2020 and compared findings with the same months from 2019. RESULTS: A total of 34,213 ED visits occurred during the study periods (18,471 in 2019 and 15,742 in 2020), with a decline in patient visits occurring after state emergency declarations. In 2020, patients were less likely to be female and more likely to arrive by ambulance.

OBJECTIVES: We leverage a 10-billion-word-database of online news, taken from over 7,000 English newspapers and magazines across 20 countries, culminating in 28 million articles. First, we track the volume of Covid-19 conversations across 20 countries from before to during the pandemic (Oct19 to May20). Second, we distill the phases of global pandemic narratives, and elucidate regional differences. METHODS: To track the volume of Covid-19 narratives, we identified 10 target termsCoronavirus, Covid-19, Covid, nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan Virus, Virus, Disease, Epidemic, Pandemicand tracked their combined monthly prevalence across eight months from October 2019 through May 2020. Globally, across 20 countries, we identified 18,042,855 descriptors of the target terms. Further, these descriptors were analysed with natural language processing models to generate the top five topics of Covid-19 that were labelled by two independent researchers. This process was repeated across six continents to distil regional topics. RESULTS: Our model found four phases of online news media narratives: Pre-pandemic, Early, Peak and Recovery. Pre-pandemic narratives (Oct19CDec19) were divergent across regions with Africa focused on monkeypox, Asia on dengue fever, and North America on Lyme disease and AIDS. Early (JanCFeb20) and Peak Pandemic (MarCMay20) evidenced a global convergence, reflecting the omnipresence of Covid-19. The brief transition from early to peak pandemic narratives underscored the pandemics rapid spread. Emerging from the embers of the pandemics peak were nascent recovery words that are regionally divergentOceania focused on hope and an uncertain future while North America centered on re-opening the economy and tackling discrimination.

No studies have yet summarized the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We synthesized a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 7.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively.

Blood transcriptomic biomarkers that prospectively predict those who progress to leprosy (progressors) would allow early diagnosis, better treatment outcomes and facilitate interventions aimed at stopping bacterial transmission. To identify potential risk signatures of leprosy, we collected whole blood of household contacts (HC, n=5,352) of leprosy patients, including individuals who were diagnosed with leprosy 4-61 months after sample collection. METHODS: We investigated differential gene expression (DGE) by RNA-Seq between progressors before presence of symptoms (n=40) and HC (n=40), as well as longitudinal DGE within each progressor. A prospective leprosy signature was identified using a machine learning approach (Random Forest) and validated using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). FINDINGS: Although no significant intra-individual longitudinal variation within leprosy progressors was identified, 1,613 genes were differentially expressed in progressors before diagnosis compared to HC. We identified a 13-gene prospective risk signature with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 95.2%. Validation of this RNA-Seq signature in an additional set of progressors (n=43) and HC (n=43) by RT-qPCR, resulted in a final 4-gene signature, designated RISK4LEP (MT-ND2, REX1BD, TPGS1, UBC) (AUC=86.4%). INTERPRETATION: This study identifies for the first time a prospective transcriptional risk signature in blood predicting development of leprosy 4 to 61 months before clinical diagnosis.

Its primary presentation is respiratory and cardiac. However, some neurological manifestations are also reported. We tried to explore the reported neurological manifestations in a group of non-hospitalized mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. We contacted 107 patients via phone calls and e-mail messages, within 10 days of clinical presentation. The collected data regarded the neurological and non-neurological symptoms of the disease using a questionnaire that collected medical information of each patient. RESULTS: It is found that 100% of patients have been reported with at least one neurological symptom during the first 10 days of COVID-19 presentation. The most common were headache which recorded 72% of the total. Then anosmiaCdysgeusia which reached 52%, then myalgia with 44%, fatigue with 33% and dizziness with 32%. While the less common was numbness, migraine, loss of concentration, and seizures. CONCLUSION: There are many neurological manifestations found to be very common in COVID-19 patients even in mild cases, which when added to the increasing reports of serious cases of GuillainCBarre syndrome, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, myelitis, stroke, and encephalitis in COVID-19 patients support CNS invasion of the virus and assures the importance of neurological assessment of COVID-19 patients both in the acute phase of infection and after recovery for potential neurological sequelae.","output":"Neurological manifestations in mild and moderate cases of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this article is to evaluate how the State of Pernambuco, Brazil, through its public policies, has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic concerning the tourism sector.

For several directly transmitted diseases, reinfection is a relevant process, which can be expressed by endogenous reactivation of the pathogen or by exogenous reinfection due to direct contact with an infected individual (with smaller reinfection rate [Formula: see text] than infection rate [Formula: see text]). In this paper, we examine the stochastic susceptible, infected, recovered, infected (SIRI) model simulating the endogenous reactivation by a spontaneous reaction, while exogenous reinfection by a catalytic reaction. Analyzing the mean-field approximations of a site and pairs of sites, and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the particular case of exogenous reinfection, we obtained continuous phase transitions involving endemic, epidemic, and no transmission phases for the simple approach; the approach of pairs is better to describe the phase transition from endemic phase (susceptible, infected, susceptible (SIS)-like model) to epidemic phase (susceptible, infected, and removed or recovered (SIR)-like model) considering the comparison with MC results; the reinfection increases the peaks of outbreaks until the system reaches endemic phase. For the particular case of endogenous reactivation, the approach of pairs leads to a continuous phase transition from endemic phase (SIS-like model) to no transmission phase. Finally, there is no phase transition when both effects are taken into account. We hope the results of this study can be generalized for the susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed or recovered ([Formula: see text]) model, for which the state exposed (infected but not infectious), describing more realistically transmitted diseases such as tuberculosis.

We additionally surveyed participating providers to assess acceptance of the intervention. SETTING: Community general pediatrics practices. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 81 general pediatricians, family medicine physicians, and nurse practitioners in 5 general pediatrics practices participated in this study. INTERVENTIONS: Each practice identified a practice and operations champion for the project. Practices chose 2-4 implementation strategies previously shown to be effective at reducing outpatient antibiotic use to implement in their practice throughout the study intervention period. Study personnel also held quarterly meetings with all providers to review deidentified peer comparison feedback both across practices enrolled in the study and at the provider level within each practice. RESULTS: We detected improvements in guideline-concordant antibiotic use in the pre-COVID-19 intervention period, and they were sustained in the study period during the pandemic (P3): otitis media (P1 72.14% vs P2 81.42% vs P3 86.11%), group A streptococcal pharyngitis (P1 66.13% vs P2 81.56% vs P3 80.44%), pneumonia (P1 70.6% vs P2 76.2% vs P3 100%), sinusitis (P1 76.2% vs P2 83.78% vs P3 82.86%), skin and soft-tissue infections (P1 97.18% vs P2 100% vs P3 100%).

Outcomes were in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay, 30-day readmission, 30-day reintervention and in-hospital costs. Candidate PFs were age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Score, prior hospitalizations, prior days spent in hospital, and socio-economic status. Included patients dealt with either colorectal carcinoma (CRC, n = 10,254), urinary bladder carcinoma (UBC, n = 17,385), acute percutaneous coronary intervention (aPCI, n = 25,818), or total knee arthroplasty (TKA, n = 39,214). Prior hospitalization significantly increased readmission risk in all treatments (OR between 2.15 and 25.50), whereas prior days spent in hospital decreased this risk (OR between 0.55 and 0.95). In CRC patients, women had lower risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 0.64), ICU admittance (OR 0.68) and 30-day reintervention (OR 0.70). Prior hospitalization was the strongest PF for higher costs across all treatments (31-64% costs increase/hospitalization).

Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are at elevated risk of mental health difficulties. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the pandemic on anxiety, depression and mental wellbeing in adults with NDDs using longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children study (n=3,058). Mental health data were collected pre-pandemic (age 21-25) and at three timepoints during the pandemic (ages 27-28) using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7, and Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. ADHD and ASD were defined using validated cut-points of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Autism Spectrum Quotient, self-reported at age 25. We used multi-level mixed-effects models to investigate changes in mental health in those with ADHD and ASD compared to those without. Prevalences of depression, anxiety and poor mental wellbeing were higher at all timepoints (pre-pandemic and during pandemic) in those with ADHD and ASD compared to those without. Anxiety increased to a greater extent in those with ADHD ({beta}=0.8 [0.2,1.4], p=0.01) and ASD ({beta}=1.2 [-0.1,2.5], p=0.07), while depression symptoms decreased, particularly in females with ASD ({beta}=-3.1 [-4.6,-1.5], p=0.0001).

Although the role of robotics in hernia surgery is rapidly expanding, the benefits of a robotic approach for abdominal wall reconstruction have not been established well. We aimed to compare the impact of the application of robotics to the TAR procedure on the perioperative outcomes when compared to the open TAR repairs. METHODS Case-matched comparison of patients undergoing robotic TAR (R-TAR) at two specialized hernia centers to a matched historic cohort of open TAR (O-TAR) patients was performed. Outcome measures included patient demographics, operative details, postoperative complications, and length of hospitalization. RESULTS 38 consecutive patients undergoing R-TAR were compared to 76 matched O-TAR. Patient demographics were similar between the groups, but ASA III status was more prevalent in the O-TAR group. The average operative time was significantly longer in the R-TAR group (299  95 vs.. 211  63 min, p < 0.001) and blood loss was significantly lower for the R-TAR group (49  60 vs. 139  149 mL, p < 0.001). Wound morbidity was minimal in the R-TAR, but the rate of surgical site events and surgical site infection was not different between groups. Systemic complications were significantly less frequent in the R-TAR group (0 vs. 17.1%, p = 0.026). The length of hospitalization was significantly reduced in the R-TAR group (1.3  1.3 vs. 6.0  3.4 days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In our early experience, robotic TAR was associated with longer operative times. However, we found that the use of robotics was associated with decreased intraoperative blood loss, fewer systemic complications, shorter hospitalizations, and eliminated readmissions.

ASC-EVs and BMSC-EVs shared more similar molecular signatures than cartilage-derived EVs, although overall miR-103a-3p consistently ranked as the first and miR-22-5p as the second most stable EV-miRNA RG, whereas miR-221-3p behaved poorly. Further, to emphasize the impact of incorrect RG choice, the abundance of four OA-therapeutic miRNAs (miR-93-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-455-3p, and miR-27b-3p) was compared. The use of miR-221-3p led to less accurate EV fingerprinting and, when applied to sift therapeutic potency prediction, to misleading indication of the most appropriate clinical product. In conclusion, miR-103a-3p and miR-22-5p will represent reliable RGs for the quantification of miRNAs embedded in MSC- and CC-EVs, a mandatory step for the molecular definition and comparison of the clinical potency of these innovative cell-free-based therapeutic products for OA in particular, as well as for a wider array of regenerative-medicine-based approaches.","output":"miR-103a-3p and miR-22-5p Are Reliable Reference Genes in Extracellular Vesicles From Cartilage, Adipose Tissue, and Bone Marrow Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increased infectivity and transmissibility of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 new variants were contributed largely by increase binding of receptor binding domain (RBD) domain of the Spike (S) protein to its cellular receptor ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2).

METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of colonoscopy data during the 3 months (AprilCJune 2020) when clinical services were most affected by COVID\\\\19 in South Australia compared to the same period in 2019. Data on colonoscopies and responses to surveillance recall letters were reviewed to determine the numbers and proportions of colonoscopies that were delayed. RESULTS: During 2020, the total number of colonoscopies decreased by 51.1% (n = 569) compared to 2019 (n = 1164). In 2019, 45.5% (n = 530) of colonoscopies were completed for surveillance, but this proportion decreased to 32.0% (n = 182) during 2020, an overall decrease in the number of surveillance colonoscopies of 65.6%. Of surveillance colonoscopies that were due in 2020, 46.1% (134/291) were delayed >6 months, a significant increase compared to 2019 (19.3%; 59/306, P < 0.001).

This article, we studied the impact of wage recession on employee loyalty, the same was studied by Linz et al, 2013. We decided to study employee loyalty during this pandemic period. Based on this the study objectives are framed to determine the various dimensions of employee loyalty, the impact of wage recession on loyalty and problems faced by employees those who work from home. The study population is college teachers and ITians. In these two sectors adopted a change in their working mode (i.e work from home) and faced wage recession. ITians don't face many issues since it is not new for them but for the teaching community, work from home is an entirely new concept. Teachers try to learn to work in a new platform like google meet, zoom app, cisco Webex meet and give assignments online and conduct exams in virtual mode, leading them to prepare themselves for a changing environment. The work from home created more stress for teachers but for ITians the family intervention and network issues created more stress. Apart from these issues, the employer also reduces the payment from 10% to 50%. Both are the major contributors of employee loyalty. A questionnaire was designed based on the suggestions of HR managers. The data was collected through the virtual mode from 96 professors and 74 ITians in and around Chennai. We measured the key factors which affect employee loyalty like salary, treatment by organization, career focus, job involvement, job satisfaction, wellbeing and work recognition. The study findings revealed that pay reduction does not affect loyalty much. Lack of communication creates more work stress among the employees. This virtual mode of working increased more working hours and responsibility but poor recognition by employers. Our study results reveal that most of the respondents have moderate loyalty and if the work of employees continues to be unrecognized which may decrease the loyalty in future.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihood of employees in different sectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present essay review, we have placed the notion of the War on Terror on the critical lens of scrutiny.

Effective and accurate forecasting models are essential for proper management and preparedness of the healthcare system and resources, eventually aiding in preventing the rapid spread of the disease. With the intention to provide better forecasting tools for the management of the pandemic, the current research work analyzes the effect of the inclusion of environmental parameters in the forecasting of daily COVID-19 cases. Three univariate variants of the long short-term memory (LSTM) model (basic/vanilla, stacked, and bi-directional) were employed for the prediction of daily cases in 9 cities across 3 countries with varying climatic zones (tropical, sub-tropical, and frigid), namely India (New Delhi and Nagpur), USA (Yuma and Los Angeles) and Sweden (Stockholm, Skane, Uppsala and Vastra Gotaland). The results were compared to a basic multivariate LSTM model with environmental parameters (temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH)) as additional inputs. Periods with no or minimal lockdown were chosen specifically in these cities to observe the uninhibited spread of COVID-19 and explore its dependence on daily environmental parameters. The multivariate LSTM model showed the best overall performance; the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) showed an average of 64% improvement from other univariate models upon the inclusion of the above environmental parameters. Correlation with temperature was generally positive for the cold regions and negative for the warm regions. RH showed mixed correlations, most likely driven by its temperature dependence and effect of allied local factors. The results suggest that the inclusion of environmental parameters could significantly improve the performance of LSTMs for predicting daily cases of COVID-19, although other positive and negative confounding factors can affect the forecasting power.","output":"Improving performance of deep learning predictive models for COVID-19 by incorporating environmental parameters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents the results of a study of electrochemical transformations in aqueous and aprotic media of 5-methyl-6-nitro-7-oxo-4,7-dihydro-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidinide l-arginine monohydrate (1a, Triazid) obtained by electrochemical methods and ESR spectroscopy. The effect of pH on the current and the reduction potential of 1a in an aqueous BrittonCRobinson buffer solution was studied. It was found that 1a is irreversibly reduced in aqueous acidic media on a glassy carbon electrode in one stage with the participation of six electrons and the formation of 5-methyl-6-amino-7-oxo-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin. The electroreduction of 1a in DMF on a background of tetrabutylammonium salts proceeds in two stages, controlled by the kinetics of second-order reactions. In the first stage, the reduction of 1a is accompanied by protonation by the initial compound of the basic intermediate products formed in the electrode reaction (self-protonation mechanism). The second quasi-reversible stage of the electroreduction 1a corresponds to the formation of a dianion radical upon the reduction of the heterocyclic anion 5-methyl-6-nitro-7-oxo-4,7-dihydro-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin, which is formed upon the potentials of the first peak. The ESR spectrum of the radical dianion was recorded upon electroreduction of Triazid in the presence of Bu(4)NOH. The effect of the formation of ion pairs on the reversibility of the second peak of the 1a transformation is shown. A change in the rate and regioselectivity of the protonation of the dianion radical in the presence of Na(+) and Li(+) ions is assumed. The results of studying the electroreduction of 1a by ESR spectroscopy with a TEMPO trap make it possible to assume the simultaneous formation of both a nitroxyl radical and a radical with the spin density localized on the nitrogen at the 4 position of the six-membered ring.","output":"Redox Conversions of 5-Methyl-6-nitro-7-oxo-4,7-dihydro-1,2,4triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidinide L-Arginine Monohydrate as a Promising Antiviral Drug"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we focus on an Natural Language Inference task.

This study used 2013-2016 VA data, Medicare claims, Nursing Home Compare, and Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments. We identified 10,531 long-stay CNH episodes for Veterans not prescribed antipsychotics 6 months before CNH admission. We categorized Veterans by whether, 12 months before admission, they were diagnosed with FDA-approved indications (including schizophrenia, Tourettes syndrome, Huntingtons disease) for antipsychotic use. The exposure was the proportion of all CNH residents prescribed antipsychotics in the quarter preceding a Veterans admission. Using adjusted logistic regression, we analyzed two outcomes measured using MDS assessments collected ~100 days after CNH admission: 1) new antipsychotic use, and 2) new diagnosis for an FDA-approved indication among Veterans without these conditions at admission. Among antipsychotic-na?ve Veterans admitted to CNHs, 7,924 (75.2%) lacked an antipsychotic indication. Prevalent antipsychotic use in CNHs ranged 0%-10.9% (quintile 1) and 25.7%-91.4% (quintile 5).

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey of 702 young consumers - students - was carried out in October and November 2020. The questionnaire was available to respondents as a Google form. The obtained data was processed using a standard qualitative analysis and selected quantitative methods, including descriptive statistics, Spearman's correlation coefficient and Pearson's chi-square test. Findings: Nearly 63% of respondents agreed or rather agreed that the food needs of their household are fully met. Almost 44% of respondents stated that they are afraid of the lack of money to meet their food needs during the pandemic, and quite a similar share of respondents (47.3%) stated that they have no concerns in this regard. Although as many as 72% of the surveyed young consumers are concerned about rising food prices, only 22% are concerned that they will have to change their eating habits during the pandemic. The vast majority of respondents (92%) pay attention to the price when buying food and 83% agree that food is wasted in households. Research limitations/implications: Due to the limited possibilities during COVID-19, the research was conducted among 702 respondents, who were mainly students of the Warsaw University of Life Sciences (SGGW). Such a number of respondents and the sample selection do not fully authorize the generalization of the results. Consequently, the conclusions should not be treated as representative for the whole population of Polish young consumers. Moreover, the questionnaire survey is related to the subjective interpretation of questions and the declarativeness of respondents, which may influence the obtained results. However, despite these limitations, the findings allow for approximating the concerns of this consumer group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: As COVID-19 is a new social and economic challenge, young consumers' concerns in such conditions have not been investigated so far and this study is to fill this gap. Moreover, this research may be a basis for further research as the pandemic situation evolves and may change both young consumers' economic situation and their concerns about meeting their food needs.","output":"Young Consumers' Concerns About Meeting Their Food Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To define headache characteristics and evolution in relation to COVID-19 and its inflammatory response. METHODS: This is a prospective study, comparing clinical data and inflammatory biomarkers of COVID-19 patients with and without headache, recruited at the Emergency Room. We compared baseline with 6-week follow-up to evaluate disease evolution. RESULTS: Of 130 patients, 74.6% (97/130) had headache. In all, 24.7% (24/97) of patients had severe pain with migraine-like features. Patients with headache had more anosmia/ageusia (54.6% vs. 18.2%; p < 0.0001). Clinical duration of COVID-19 was shorter in the headache group (23.9  11.6 vs. 31.2  12.0 days; p = 0.028). In the headache group, IL-6 levels were lower at the ER (22.9 (57.5) vs. 57.0 (78.6) pg/mL; p = 0.036) and more stable during hospitalisation. After 6 weeks, of 74 followed-up patients with headache, 37.8% (28/74) had ongoing headache. Of these, 50% (14/28) had no previous headache history. Headache was the prodromal symptom of COVID-19 in 21.4% (6/28) of patients with persistent headache (p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Headache associated with COVID-19 is a frequent symptom, predictive of a shorter COVID-19 clinical course. Disabling headache can persist after COVID-19 resolution. Pathophysiologically, its migraine-like features may reflect an activation of the trigeminovascular system by inflammation or direct involvement of SARS-CoV-2, a hypothesis supported by concomitant anosmia.","output":"Headache: A striking prodromal and persistent symptom, predictive of COVID-19 clinical evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can lead to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Drawing on this concept, it has also been proposed that treatments typically employed in the management of HAPE and other forms of acute altitude illnesspulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamideshould be considered for COVID-19. Despite some similarities in clinical features between the two entities, such as hypoxemia, radiographic opacities, and altered lung compliance, the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE and lung injury due to COVID-19 are fundamentally different, and the entities cannot be viewed as equivalent. Although of high utility in the management of HAPE and acute mountain sickness, systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19, as they carry the risk of multiple adverse consequences, including worsened ventilationCperfusion matching, impaired carbon dioxide transport, systemic hypotension, and increased work of breathing.","output":"COVID-19 Lung Injury and High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema.

Recently, the feasibility of using the ureter as a natural orifice for natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery nephrectomy has been demonstrated in a nonsurvival porcine model. The purpose of this study was to assess the outcomes of transureteral laparoscopic natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery nephrectomy in a survival porcine model. METHODS Three pigs underwent hybrid transureteral natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery nephrectomy. An experimental balloon/dilating sheath was inserted over a wire to dilate the urethra, ureteral orifice, and ureter. Through a bariatric 12-mm laparoscopic port, the ureter was opened medially and the hilar dissection was performed. Next, 2 needlescopic ports were placed transabdominally to facilitate hilar transection. The kidney was morcellated using a bipolar sealing device and extracted via the ureter using the housing of a bariatric stapling device. The ureteral orifice was closed with a laparoscopic suturing device. The bladder was drained by a catheter for 10 to 14 days postoperatively. Pigs were euthanized on postoperative day 21. RESULTS All surgical procedures were successfully completed, with no intraoperative complications. One pig had an episode of postoperative clot retention that resolved with catheter irrigation. Each pig was healthy and eating a normal diet prior to euthanasia. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the feasibility of a hybrid transureteral approach to nephrectomy in a survival porcine model.

Methods: This is a prospective cohort study that included patients hospitalised because of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, three months after their discharge. A clinical evaluation, analytical parameters, chest X-ray, six-minute walk test, spirometry and DL(CO)CDL(NO) analysis were performed. Demographic variables, comorbidities, and variables related to the severity of the admission were recorded. Results: Two hundred patients completed the study; 59.5% men, age 62 years, 15.5% admitted to the intensive care unit. The most frequent functional alteration, in 27% of patients, was in the DL(CO)CDL(NO) combination. This alteration was associated with age, male sex, degree of dyspnoea, poorer perception of health, and limited ability for physical effort. These patients also presented higher levels of D-Dimer and more residual radiological alterations. In 42% of the patients with diffusion alterations, only reduced DL(NO) was presented, along with lower D-Dimer levels and less capillary volume involvement. The severity of the process was associated with the reduction in DL(CO)CDL(NO). Conclusions: The most sensitive RFT for the detection of the sequelae of COVID-19 pneumonia was the combined measurement of DL(CO)CDL(NO) and this factor was related to patient health status and their capacity for physical exertion.

Self-discipline was a significant moderator of several of these relationships. We discuss the implications of our research for the pandemic and beyond.","output":"Achieving Effective Remote Working During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Work Design Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the infection of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) are becoming increasingly clear as the pandemic spreads.

This information was linked to their 3-year historical healthcare data. The severity of the disease was classified into five levels. We also clustered the levels into two grades. Results: The risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity were old age, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and renal replacement therapy. The use of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) both before and after a diagnosis of COVID-19 were not associated with COVID-19 severity.

Data are urgently needed to determine whether vaccine-induced immunity is impacted by commonly used immunosuppressive drug regimens in IBD. Methods: We prospectively recruited 447 adults (90 healthy controls and 357 IBD) at nine UK centres. The IBD study population was established (>12 weeks therapy) on either thiopurine monotherapy (n=78), infliximab (IFX) monotherapy (n=61), thiopurine & IFX combination therapy (n=70), ustekinumab (uste) monotherapy (n=56), vedolizumab (vedo) monotherapy (n=62) or tofacitinib (tofa) monotherapy (n=30). Participants had two doses of either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, BNT162b2 or mRNA1273 vaccines. The primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1 RBD) Ab concentrations, measured using the Elecsys anti- SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) Ab assay, 53-92 days after second vaccine dose, in participants without prior infection, adjusted by age & vaccine type. Secondary outcomes included proportions failing to generate protective Ab responses (defined cut-off anti-S concentration 15 U/mL, which correlated with 20% viral neutralization). Results: Geometric mean S Ab concentrations (figure 1) were lower in patients treated with IFX (153U/mL;p<0.0001), IFX and thiopurine combination (109U/mL;p<0.0001), tofa (430U/mL;p<0.0001) and uste (561U/mL;p=0.013) compared to controls (1596U/ml). No differences in S Ab concentrations were found between controls and thiopurine monotherapy- treated patients (1020U/mL;p=0.62), nor between controls and vedo-treated patients (944 U/mL;p=0.69). In multivariable modelling (figure 2), lower S Ab concentrations were independently associated with IFX (FC 0.10 [95% CI 0.07-0.14], p<0.0001), tofa (0.36 [95% CI 0.19-0.69], p=0.002) and uste (0.56 [95% CI 0.31-1.00], p=0.049), but not with thiopurine (0.77 [95% CI 0.54-1.11], p=0.17) or vedo (1.01 [95% CI 0.61-1.68], p=0.96). mRNA vaccines (3.67 [95% CI 2.72- 4.96], p<0.0001) and older age (0.82 [95% CI 0.73-0.91], p=0.0003) were independently associated with higher & lower S Ab concentrations respectively.

Climate change has tended to dominate the headlines, reflecting, in part, the greater complexity of the biodiversity crisis. Biodiversity itself is a difficult concept. Land plants dominate the global biomass and terrestrial arthropods probably dominate in terms of numbers of species, but most of the Tree of Life consists of single-celled eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea. Wild plants provide a huge variety of products and services to people, ranging from those that are species-specific, such as food, medicine, and genetic resources, to many which are partly interchangeable, such as timber and forage for domestic animals, and others which depend on the whole community, but not on individual species, such as regulation of water supply and carbon sequestration. The use of information from remote sensing has encouraged a simplified view of the values of natures contributions to people, but this does not match the way most people value nature. We can currently estimate the proportion of species threatened by human impacts only for a few well-assessed groups, for which it ranges from 14% (birds) to 63% (cycads). Less than 8% of land plants have been assessed, but it has been estimated that 30-44% are threatened, although there are still few (0.2%) well-documented extinctions. Priorities for improving protection of biodiversity include: improving the inventory, with surveys focused on geographical areas and taxonomic groups which are under-collected; expanding the protected area system and its representativeness; controlling overexploitation; managing invasive species; conserving threatened species ex situ; restoring degraded ecosystems; and controlling climate change.

However, demonstration of confirmed fecal-oral transmission has been difficult. Clinical studies have shown an incidence rate of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms ranging from 2% to 79.1% in patients with COVID-19. They may precede or accompany respiratory symptoms. The most common GI symptoms included nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In addition, some patients also had liver injury, pancreatic damage, and even acute mesenteric ischemia/thrombosis.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in the host cells as a receptor of Spike-I Glycoprotein of COVID-19 which causes final infection. ACE2 is highly expressed in the bladder, ileum, kidney and liver, comparing with ACE2 expression in the lung-specific pulmonary alveolar type II cells. In this study, the single-cell RNAseq data of the five tissues from different humans are curated and cell types with high expressions of ACE2 are identified. Subsequently, the proteinCprotein interaction networks have been established. From the network, potential biomarkers which can form functional hubs, are selected based on k-means network clustering. It is observed that angiotensin PPAR family proteins show important roles in the functional hubs. To understand the functions of the potential markers, corresponding pathways have been researched thoroughly through the pathway semantic networks. Subsequently, the pathways have been ranked according to their influence and dependency in the network using PageRank algorithm. The outcomes show some important facts in terms of infection. Firstly, renin-angiotensin system and PPAR signaling pathway can play a vital role for enhancing the infection after its intrusion through ACE2. Next, pathway networks consist of few basic metabolic and influential pathways, e.g. insulin resistance. This information corroborate the fact that diabetic patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the key regulators of the aforementioned pathways are angiontensin and PPAR family proteins.

For many countries, after successfully curbing the initial wave, lockdown measures were gradually lifted. In Belgium, such relief started on May 4th with phase 1, followed by several subsequent phases over the next few weeks. METHODS: We analysed the expected impact of relaxing stringent lockdown measures taken according to the phased Belgian exit strategy. We developed a stochastic, data-informed, meta-population model that accounts for mixing and mobility of the age-structured population of Belgium. The model is calibrated to daily hospitalization data and is able to reproduce the outbreak at the national level. We consider different scenarios for relieving the lockdown, quantified in terms of relative reductions in pre-pandemic social mixing and mobility. We validate our assumptions by making comparisons with social contact data collected during and after the lockdown. RESULTS: Our model is able to successfully describe the initial wave of COVID-19 in Belgium and identifies interactions during leisure/other activities as pivotal in the exit strategy. Indeed, we find a smaller impact of school re-openings as compared to restarting leisure activities and re-openings of work places. We also assess the impact of case isolation of new (suspected) infections, and find that it allows re-establishing relatively more social interactions while still ensuring epidemic control. Scenarios predicting a second wave of hospitalizations were not observed, suggesting that the per-contact probability of infection has changed with respect to the pre-lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS: Contacts during leisure activities are found to be most influential, followed by professional contacts and school contacts, respectively, for an impending second wave of COVID-19.

Recommended action at the first sign of a suspected stroke is to quickly request emergency services (i.e., calling 9-1-1) (2). Public education campaigns have emphasized recognizing stroke signs and symptoms and the importance of calling 9-1-1, and stroke knowledge increased 14.7 percentage points from 2009 to 2014 (4). However, disparities in stroke awareness have been reported (4,5). Knowledge of the five signs and symptoms of stroke and the immediate need to call emergency medical services (9-1-1), collectively referred to as \\"recommended stroke knowledge,\\" was assessed among 26,076 adults aged 20 years as part of the 2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The prevalence of recommended stroke knowledge among U.S. adults was 67.5%. Stroke knowledge differed significantly by race and Hispanic origin (p<0.001). The prevalence of recommended stroke knowledge was highest among non-Hispanic White adults (71.3%), followed by non-Hispanic Black adults (64.0%) and Hispanic adults (57.8%). Stroke knowledge also differed significantly by sex, age, education, and urbanicity. After multivariable adjustment, these differences remained significant. Increasing awareness of the signs and symptoms of stroke continues to be a national priority. Estimates from this report can inform public health strategies for increasing awareness of stroke signs and symptoms.","output":"Sociodemographic and Geographic Variation in Awareness of Stroke Signs and Symptoms Among Adults - United States, 2017."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Time to stabilisation (TTS) provides limited information to evaluate the dynamic postural control for individuals with functional ankle instability in single-leg landing task. More information is needed to understand TTS and evaluate the dynamic postural control better. The purpose is to develop a method estimating TTS, initial impact force (IIF) and landing leg stiffness (LLS) through fitting ground reaction force (GRF) decay in single leg landing with exponential vibration decay function (EVDF), and investigate effects of landing directions and GRF components on these parameters. Thirty-nine healthy participants were recruited. EVDF was used to fit GRF decays in different single-leg landings. TTS, IIF, and LLS were compared across landing directions and GRF components. The mean regression determinants of fitting GRF decays with EVDF were greater than 0.50. TTS was sensitive to GRF components (P = 0.041 females, P = 0.028 males). IIF was sensitive to GRF components (P = 0.001) for both genders. LLS was sensitive to GRF components (P = 0.023) for males. This method showed a moderate to strong feasibility for reporting GRF decay during landing, and provided movement characteristic information for better understanding of dynamic postural control together with TTS during landing.","output":"Evaluation of dynamic postural control during single-leg landing tasks using initial impact force, landing leg stiffness and time to stabilisation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in abrupt, drastic changes to daily life in many nations. Experiences within the United States have varied widely. In the State of Oregon in the early months of the pandemic protective protocols (e.g., social distancing) were comparatively high, resulting in concern for increases in loneliness and COVID-related stress. The present study of college students examined the indirect relationship of loneliness and other stressors to alcohol use, via drinking-to-cope motives. METHOD A sample of traditional- and nontraditional-aged college students (N = 215; 68.1% female; mean age = 24.8 years) completed an online survey assessing COVID-19 experiences during shelter-in-place orders in Oregon over a 5-week period in April and May of 2020. RESULTS Cross-sectional structural equational modeling revealed that loneliness and COVID-19 news consumption were associated with stronger coping motives, whereas rated seriousness of COVID-19 was related to weaker coping motives. Coping motives, in turn, were related to more frequent past-30-day consumption; significant indirect effects were revealed for all three predictors on drinking frequency and heavy drinking frequency, via drinking-to-cope motives. Drinking-to-cope motives were also related to greater past-30-day marijuana use. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide insight into how COVID-related stressors and associated social relationship repercussions relate to alcohol and marijuana use and drinking-to-cope motivations while sheltering in place.

Data on dermatology consultations provided to inpatients admitted to general surgery wards are limited. The aim of this study was to analyze the reasons for and diagnoses of consultations provided by dermatologists to hospitalized patients in a general surgery ward and compare the provisional diagnoses by surgical residents and the final diagnoses by dermatologists. METHODS: Electronic health records were retrieved for patients admitted to a general surgery ward who received dermatology consultations while inpatients in Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 1 September 2015 and 31 August 2020. Sex, age, surgical diagnosis, reason for dermatology consultation, provisional diagnosis by surgical residents, and final diagnosis by dermatologists were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 262 dermatology consultations for 251 patients (n = 251, 123 women and 128 men) were identified, of whom 240 (95.6%) required only one consultation and 11 (4.4%) required two. Dermatology consultations were classified into three categories: preoperative consultation (n = 45, 17.9%), postoperative consultation (n = 65, 25.9%), and consultation unrelated to general surgery diseases or treatments (including surgery) (n = 141, 56.2%). For consultations falling in the category preoperative consultation, common reasons for the consultation were: to evaluate whether the current treatment plan for previously diagnosed skin diseases needed to be changed; to evaluate and manage skin problems that emerged after admission; to evaluate syphilis; and to evaluate whether previously diagnosed skin diseases would affect surgical incision or wound healing. Drug eruption, dermatitis/eczema, infectious skin disorders, and urticaria were the most common skin diseases in the hospitalized general surgery patients. Only 32 (12.7%) provisional diagnoses were made, of which 25 (78.1%) were correct and seven (21.9%) were incorrect. Surgical residents mainly had difficulty distinguishing herpes zoster, drug eruption, and infectious skin disorders from dermatitis/eczema.

RNA recovery was examined in several bench-scale experiments using heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (HI-SCV-2) spiked into raw wastewater to assess the effects of different solids pellet : buffer ratios, inhibition mitigation strategies, and varying levels of total suspended solids. When the method was assessed using an influent wastewater sample known to contain SARS-CoV-2, the viral signal was detected in all five biological replicates, whereas direct extraction of 1-mL aliquots of the raw wastewater resulted in a 40% viral detection rate. The experimental method limit of detection (MLOD) using HI-SCV-2 spiked into raw wastewater was 50 GU mL?1 with a 95% limit of detection. Using the described protocol, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was verified in wastewater collected from wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs) in Atlantic Canada over a period of 15 weeks during the rise and fall of a COVID-19 outbreak. This method is effective and rapid and could provide potential application for laboratories with limited resources.

Precise determination of nutritional values of pig diets can help reducing feed costs by reducing security margins for nutrients and therefore provide a more sustainable swine production. In commercial farms, pigs have free access to feed and eat with no limitation according to their natural behaviour. In contrast, during digestibility trials, pigs are restricted in their daily intake of feed, which is distributed in a limited number of meals. The number of meals per day and the amount of feed consumed daily can affect the digestibility of the nutrients, the transit time and the metabolism. To reduce feed costs, by-products are frequently added to diets. Most by-products are rich in dietary fibre, which are known to have negative effects on digestibility. Enzymes can be supplemented in the diet to counteract the negative aspects of dietary fibre, but their efficiency can vary depending on the number of meals per day and the amount of feed consumed daily. ABSTRACT: Nutritional values of ingredients have been and still are the subject of many studies to reduce security margins of nutrients when formulating diets to reduce feed cost. In most studies, pigs are fed a limited amount of feed in a limited number of meals that do not represent how pigs are fed in commercial farm conditions. With free access to feed, pigs follow their intrinsic feeding behaviour. Feed intake is regulated by satiety and satiation signals. Reducing the feed intake level or feeding frequency can affect digestibility and transit time and induce metabolic changes. To reduce feed costs, alternative ingredients that are frequently rich in dietary fibre are added to diets. Fibre acts on the digestion process and transit time by decreasing energy density and causing viscosity. Various analyses of fibre can be realised, and the measured fibre fraction can vary. Exogenous enzymes can be added to counteract the effect of fibre, but digestive tract conditions, influenced by meal size and frequency, can affect the efficiency of supplemented enzymes. In conclusion, the frequency and size of the meals can affect the digestibility of nutrients by modulating gastrointestinal tract conditions (pH and transit time), metabolites (glucose and short-chain fatty acids) and hormones (glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide tyrosine tyrosine).","output":"Toward Precise Nutrient Value of Feed in Growing Pigs: Effect of Meal Size, Frequency and Dietary Fibre on Nutrient Utilisation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heat-related illnesses (HRIs), mainly heat exhaustion (HE) and heat stroke (HS), are characterized by an elevation of core body temperature.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2018 at 80 data collection points distributed in the field. Data related to demographics, features and risk factors were collected and analyzed from all encountered cases with suspected HRIs. Moreover, we developed a diagnostic tree for HRIs by using the XGBoost model. Out of the 1200 persons encountered during the study period, 231 fulfilled the criteria of HRIs spectrum and were included in this study. Around 6% had HS and 20% had HE. All HS cases (100%) were from outside of Saudi Arabia as compared with 72.5% diagnosed with HE (27.5% were from Saudi Arabia). In addition, 16% were considered as heat-induced muscle spasms, and 7% had limb heat edema. Additionally, most of HRIs cases were reported between 11 am and 1 pm. The HRIs diagnostic tree model gave a diagnostic accuracy of 93.6%. This study highlights the magnitude of HRIs among pilgrims in Hajj and provides a diagnostic tree that can aid in the risk stratification and diagnosis of these patients.

Participants' level of self-reported aggression and psychopathy was assessed, after which they engaged in either the reactive or proactive VR task. Changes in affect and blood pressure were also measured. Aggression in the reactive VR task was evidenced to mostly display convergent validity because it positively correlated with self-reported aggression and total and fearless dominance factor scores of psychopathy, and there was a trend relationship with increased systolic blood pressure. The validity of the proactive aggression variant of our VR bar paradigm received less support, and needs more refinement.

In this cross-sectional study, we exploratively investigated the associations among burnout, depression, and anxiety in 574 swiss medical students using a network analytic approach for the first time. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder respectively. Burnout was assessed with two single-item questions, one referring to emotional exhaustion and the other to depersonalization. We found a dense network in which at least one dimension of burnout was related to eleven of the sixteen included symptoms. This suggests that burnout is closely related to depression and anxiety but also has its own characteristics. Notably, suicidal ideation was not associated with either emotional exhaustion or depersonalization after adjusting for the influence of the remaining symptoms of anxiety and depression. Hence, the well-documented relationship between burnout and suicidal ideation in medical students may be entirely mediated by the experience of anxiety and depression.

In contrast, recent experiments suggest that on many real-world networks the run time to solve VertexCover is way smaller than even the best known FPT-approaches can explain. Similarly, greedy algorithms deliver very good approximations to the optimal solution in practice. We link these observations to two properties that are observed in many real-world networks, namely a heterogeneous degree distribution and high clustering. To formalize these properties and explain the observed behavior, we analyze how a branch-and-reduce algorithm performs on hyperbolic random graphs, which have become increasingly popular for modeling real-world networks. In fact, we are able to show that the VertexCover problem on hyperbolic random graphs can be solved in polynomial time, with high probability. The proof relies on interesting structural properties of hyperbolic random graphs. Since these predictions of the model are interesting in their own right, we conducted experiments on real-world networks showing that these properties are also observed in practice.

Currently, the accepted method for controlling the disease is Tuberculosis Directly Observed Treatment Shortcourse (TB-DOTS). This program is not preventative and individuals may transmit disease before diagnosis, thus better understanding of disease transmission is essential. Using whole-genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, we analyzed genomes of 145 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates from active TB cases from the Rubaga Division of Kampala, Uganda. We established that these isolates grouped into M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) lineages 1, 2, 3, and 4, with the most isolates grouping into lineage 4. Possible transmission pairs containing &#8804;12 SNPs were identified in lineages 1, 3, and 4 with the prevailing transmission in lineages 3 and 4. Furthermore, investigating DNA codon changes as a result of specific SNPs in prominent virulence genes including plcA and plcB could indicate potentially important modifications in protein function. Incorporating this analysis with corresponding epidemiological data may provide a blueprint for the integration of public health interventions to decrease TB transmission in a region.","output":"Assessing a transmission network of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in an African city using single nucleotide polymorphism threshold analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Countries around the world are working hard to fight against the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with a special emphasis on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) due to their vulnerability and importance in the business ecosystem This paper analyzes the Spanish guarantee model and the measures taken by regional governments in conjunction with the main mutual guarantee societies (MGSs) to mitigate the economic problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic We show that public administrations may use guarantee schemes as instruments to improve SME access to financing while limiting the burden on the public budget ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","output":"Post-COVID-19 SME financing constraints and the credit guarantee scheme solution in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic is a global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulting from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2).

The main objective of this study was to investigate the negative impact of social media during the COVID-19 outbreak. A web-based poll was used to collect data from social media users. Snowball sampling was used to acquire information from participants for 1 month, from September 1 to September 30, 2020. To examine the effect of social media on fear among participants, the study employed Cohens d statistic, analysis of variance, Chi-squared test, and linear regression analysis. The study results showed that more than three-fourth (73.26%) used Facebook followed by Telegram by 14.49%. Health news was the most frequently seen, read, or heard with 88.20% of the total. Moreover, 86.73% of respondents experienced panic, while only 13.27% was not. Compared to males, females were more likely to follow health news (p < 0.001). The majority of participants reported being psychologically affected, while only a few were physically affected. Females were substantially more affected mentally and reported significantly more fear than males (p < 0.001). The effect of social media panic is associated with participants age, and gender at a 5% level of significance. A significant positive link between social media and the diffusion of COVID-19 fear has been shown in this study. According to the result of regression analysis, social media usage has a significant effect on the spread of panic among participants at a 5% level of significance. Study revealed that social media use has a significant impact on the development of panic among people regarding the COVID-19 epidemic, with possibly detrimental psychological and mental health repercussions.This study also discovered a strong correlation between COVID-19 fear and social media.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the effectiveness of child protection practice models in improving outcomes for children and families. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Children < 18 years and their families involved in child protection services. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to synthesize evidence regarding the effectiveness of child protection practice models. Systematic searches across 10 electronic databases and grey literature were conducted to identify quasi-experimental studies minimally. Included studies were critically appraised and the findings summarized narratively. RESULTS: Five papers, representing six studies, focusing on three practice models (Solution-Based Casework; Signs of Safety; and Reclaiming Social Work) met the inclusion criteria. All studies applied a quasi-experimental design. Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as being poor, with studies suffering from a risk of selection bias, small sample sizes and short-term follow up.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 73-year-old non-diabetic white man with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock that was suspected to be due to peritonitis. The patient was enrolled in LOVIT (Lessening Organ Dysfunction with VITamin C; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03680274), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of high-dose intravenous vitamin C. He developed factitious hyperglycemia, as measured with a point-of-care glucometer, that persisted for 6 days after discontinuation of the study drug, confirmed to be vitamin C after unblinding. He also had short-lived iatrogenic coma because of hypoglycemia secondary to insulin administration. These events triggered a protocol amendment. CONCLUSIONS: Although factitious hyperglycemia has been reported before using certain glucometers in patients treated with high-dose vitamin C, the persistence of this phenomenon for 6 days after the discontinuation of the therapy is a distinguishing feature. This case highlights the importance of monitoring glucose with a core laboratory assay for up to a week in specific populations, such as patients on peritoneal dialysis.","output":"High-dose vitamin-C induced prolonged factitious hyperglycemia in a peritoneal dialysis patient: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with cancer, in particular patients with hematologic malignancies, are at increased risk for critical illness upon COVID-19. We here assessed antibody as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in unexposed and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer to characterize SARS-CoV-2 immunity and to identify immunologic parameters contributing to COVID-19 outcome. Unexposed patients with hematologic malignancies presented with reduced prevalence of preexisting SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4+ T-cell responses and signs of T-cell exhaustion compared with patients with solid tumors and healthy volunteers. Whereas SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses did not differ between patients with COVID-19 and cancer and healthy volunteers, intensity, expandability, and diversity of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses were profoundly reduced in patients with cancer, and the latter associated with a severe course of COVID-19.

However, with recent improvements in flexible endoscopic instrumentation and techniques, totally peroral endoscopic approaches could reduce the invasiveness of myotomic procedures. The aim of the study was to establish the feasibility and efficacy of endoscopic submucosal pyloromyotomy in a porcine model. METHODS Four pigs were included in a preliminary study and a 2-week survival study was performed in another four pigs. An esophagogastroduodenoscope was inserted perorally into the stomach. Saline solution was injected into the submucosal space proximal to the pylorus. The gastric mucosa was incised and a 5-cm submucosal tunnel was created. After exposure of the muscular layer in a submucosal tunnel, myotomy of the circular muscle layer was performed until the longitudinal muscular layer was reached. Once myotomy was completed, endoscopic clips were used to re-approximate the mucosal incision. RESULTS Submucosal dissection, identification of the circular muscular layer, and pyloromyotomy were achieved in all animals. Acute complications such as bleeding and perforation were not observed in any cases. Median pyloric resting pressure was reduced from 16.5 mmHg to 6.1 mmHg immediately after myotomy and 8.4 mmHg at 14 days after myotomy.

Thus, a remote protocol for assessment of patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) was developed, and the agreement of this protocol was compared to the guidelines of the diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders (DC/TMD). A total of 16 individuals were first assessed by a reference standard examination (RSE) and three other examinations applied in a random order by three examiners: standard physical examination (standard examination), physical examination keeping 2 m distance (physical distanced examination) and examination done with the aid of video communication technology (video communication examination). The primary outcomes were the diagnoses of myalgia of the masseter and temporalis muscles, and arthralgia. The diagnoses of intra-articular joint disorders were considered secondary outcomes because of less impact on psychosocial functioning and quality of life when compared with the pain-related diagnoses. The Fleiss kappa coefficient and its 95% confidence interval were computed to determine the level of agreement in diagnoses between each examination protocol and the RSE. There was substantial to almost perfect agreement between the RSE and all the examination protocols for the diagnoses of myalgia (0.86 to 1.00) and arthralgia (0.86 to 0.87) (p<0.001). On the other hand, there was an overall poor agreement (0.30 to 0.58) between the RSE and all the protocols for the diagnosis of disc displacement with reduction.

Within two months, it had begun to spread around the world in what became an unprecedented pandemic. Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in a state of immunosuppression may be considered at risk for complications in the COVID-19 pandemic, although there is increasing evidence postulating a possible protective role of selective immunosuppression. One group of such immunosuppressants used in MS comprises the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) ocrelizumab and rituximab. Anti-CD20 mAbs bind to the surface of B cells, causing their depletion. We describe our experience in seven cases of patients with multiple sclerosis who have been affected by SARS-COV-2 (with a clinical/serological diagnosis or PCR diagnosis) and who were being treated with anti-CD20+ monoclonal antibodies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We review the development of patients during infection as well as the resolution of their clinical picture. We also analyze the serology status against SARS-CoV-2 after resolution of the infection. RESULTS: Although the severity of the clinical pictures was variable, patients' development was good. Not all patients, however, developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with anti-CD20+ have adequate resolution of COVID-19 despite the fact that the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in all cases.

Implementation of DISE with propofol requires a dosing strategy that reliably and efficiently produces obstruction while minimizing oxygen desaturation. METHODS The surgeon in a prospective study of transoral robotic resection of the tongue base enrolled 97 patients with obstructive sleep apnea confirmed by polysomnography who failed continuous positive airway pressure. All patients were screened by DISE. Propofol dose was determined using custom software written in MATLAB, which has been previously described. Studies were performed in an operating room with standard monitors and resuscitation equipment. No topical anesthesia was used, and no IV drugs other than propofol were used. All patients received 2 L/min supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula placed in the mouth. After initiation of propofol sedation, a pediatric bronchoscope was positioned via the naris to observe the velopharynx. The sedation sequence was continued until the clinical end point of obstruction onset was noted. Observation of the pharynx was performed for a sufficient period to obtain images of the anatomic site(s) of obstruction. The infusion was then terminated. Statistical analysis was performed with MATLAB (MathWorks, version 2012b). Comparison of saturation nadirs between DISE and subject sleep studies was performed with both the paired and unpaired Student t test. RESULTS The subject population was characterized by a median body mass index of 32.1 (interquartile range [IQR] 6.8) kg/m and apnea-hypopnea index of 48 (IQR 32). All patients demonstrated obstruction within the design variables. Obstruction was observed after 236 (57.9) seconds at an estimated effect-site concentration of 4.2  1.3 mcg/mL. The median saturation nadir during DISE was significantly higher (91.4% (IQR 5.1)) than that during standard sleep studies (81.0% [IQR 11.2], P < 0.0001). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for correlations between DISE saturation nadir and body mass index, age, apnea-hypopnea index, or administered propofol dose included zero in all cases. CONCLUSIONS A propofol infusion strategy that requires limited experience with propofol dose selection and only 1 pump dosing change reliably produced airway obstruction in patients with severe sleep apnea. Clinical obstruction was achieved faster than target-controlled infusion-based systems for similar procedures reported in the literature.

METHODS: We conducted a within- and between-subjects, randomized controlled cross-sectional, web-based study in July 2020. Participants viewed two PSAs: one advocating wearing a mask in public settings and one advocating staying at home. The control PSA only provided information, and the treatment PSAs were designed to appeal to the identities held by individuals; that is, either a Christian identity or an economically motivated identity. Participants were asked about their identity and then provided a control PSA and treatment PSA matching their identity, in random order. The PSAs were of approximately 100 words. RESULTS: We recruited 300 social media users from Amazon Mechanical Turk in accordance with usual protocols to ensure data quality. In total, 8 failed the data quality checks, and the remaining 292 were included in the analysis. In the identity-based PSA, the source of the PSA was changed, and a phrase of approximately 12 words relevant to the individuals identity was inserted. A PSA tailored for Christians, when matched with a Christian identity, increased the likelihood of compliance by 12 percentage points. A PSA that focused on economic values, when shown to individuals who identified as economically motivated, increased the likelihood of compliance by 6 points.

However, the specific signals driving the observed time-of-day specific effects of exercise have not been fully identified. Exercise influences the skeletal muscle circadian clock, although the relative contribution of muscle contraction and extracellular signals is unknown. Here, we show that contraction acutely increases the expression of the core circadian clock gene Period Circadian Regulator 2 (Per2) and phase-shifts Per2 rhythmicity in muscle cells. This contraction effect on core clock genes is mediated through a calcium-dependant mechanism; The results obtained in the present study suggest that a proportion of the ability of exercise to entrain the skeletal muscle clock is driven directly by muscle contraction. Contraction interventions may be used to mimic some time-of-day specific effects of exercise on metabolism and muscle performance. ABSTRACT: Exercise entrains the central and peripheral circadian clocks, although the mechanism by which exercise modulates expression of skeletal muscle clock genes is unclear. The present study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle contraction alone could directly influence circadian rhythmicity and uncover the underlying mechanism by which contraction modulates clock gene expression. We investigated the expression of core clock genes in human skeletal muscle after acute exercise, as well as following in vitro contraction in mouse soleus muscle and cultured C2C12 skeletal muscle myotubes. Additionally, we interrogated the molecular pathways by which skeletal muscle contraction could influence clock gene expression. Contraction acutely increased the expression of the core circadian clock gene Period Circadian Regulator 2 (Per2) and phase-shifted Per2 rhythmicity in C2C12 myotubes in vitro. Further investigation revealed that pharmacologically increasing cytosolic calcium concentrations by ionomycin treatment mimicked the effect of contraction on Per2 expression. Similarly, treatment with a calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, blocked the effect of electric pulse stimulation-induced contraction on Per2 expression. Increased calcium influx from contraction lead to binding of the phosphorylated form of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) to the Per2 promoter, suggesting a role of CREB in contraction-induced Per2 transcription. Thus, by dissociating the effect of muscle contraction alone from the whole effect of exercise, our investigations indicate that a proportion of the ability of exercise to entrain the skeletal muscle clock is driven directly by contraction.","output":"Contraction influences Per2 gene expression in skeletal muscle through a calcium-dependent pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The innate immune system initiates immune responses by pattern\\\\recognition receptors (PRR).

The paper investigates the impact of alternative policies based on scientific vaccination priorities inspired by the extended statistics on Covid-19 fatalities. Methods In the case of Covid-19 vaccination, a principal role is played by promptly adopting a reverse-order of age approach (to target first the elderly) coupled to covering the high priority categories but postponing the low priority ones. We implemented an in silico vaccination simulator capable of comparing what happened in reality with what might have happened if alternative vaccination policies had been adopted. The immunization profile and the death distribution curve allowed measuring the distance between reality and alternative policies and finally quantifying the expected number of saved lives. Results The alternative approach to vaccination was applied to Italy and Lombardy that host 60 and 10 million residents respectively. In about 100 days of vaccination based on (a) a reverse-order of age policy (from 90 + to 80C89 to 70C79 year-olds, etc.), (b) vaccination of priority categories, (c) postponement of non-priority categories and reallocation of such doses to (a) and (b), the saved lives would have been 3969 in Italy (of which 799 in Lombardy). In the same period, Italy suffered 30,911 fatalities (of which 5,613 in Lombardy). Of those fatalities, about 12.8% in Italy and 14.2% in Lombardy might have been avoided if a different approach to vaccination had been applied. Even better results would have been achieved if the elderly vaccination had been anticipated a few days (which started only 53 days after the very beginning of the Italian vaccination campaign) or if the vaccination engine had performed better in terms of daily administered doses while respecting the available delivered doses.

We evaluated both number and nature of referrals. Results: Throughout the years, psychiatric referrals comprised about 5% of the total number of ED visits. In March-April 2020, 30% decreases were observed in overall ED visits and in psychiatric referrals in the ED. Compared to 2018C2019, in 2020, the proportions of these diagnoses were higher: anxiety disorders (14.5 vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001), personality disorders (6.7 vs. 3.2%, p = 0.001), psychosis (9.5 vs. 6.7%, p = 0.049), post-traumatic stress disorder (3.2 vs. 1.5%, p = 0.023).

POCTs for respiratory viruses have previously been limited by the poor sensitivity of antigen detection based tests and by a limited range of detectable viruses. Highly accurate molecular platforms are now able to test for a comprehensive range of viruses, can be operated by non-laboratory staff and can generate a result in approximately 1 h, making them potentially deployable as POCTs.

The surface of the AAV capsid is an essential component that is involved in cell binding, internalization, and trafficking within the targeted cell. Prior to developing a gene therapy strategy that utilizes AAV, the serotype should be carefully considered since each capsid exhibits a unique tissue tropism and transduction efficiency. Several approaches have been undertaken in an effort to target AAV vectors to specific cell types, including utilizing natural serotypes that target a desired cellular receptor, producing pseudotyped vectors, and engineering chimeric and mosaic AAV capsids. These capsid modifications are being incorporated into vector production and purification methods that provide for the ability to scale-up the manufacturing process to support human clinical trials. Protocols for small-scale and large-scale production of AAV, as well as assays to characterize the final vector product, are presented here. The structures of AAV2, AAV4, and AAV5 have been solved by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and provide a basis for rational vector design in developing customized capsids for specific targeting of AAV vectors. The capsid of AAV has been shown to be remarkably stable, which is a desirable characteristic for a gene therapy vector; however, recently it has been shown that the AAV serotypes exhibit differential susceptibility to proteases. The capsid fragmentation pattern when exposed to various proteases, as well as the susceptibility of the serotypes to a series of proteases, provides a unique fingerprint for each serotype that can be used for capsid identity validation. In addition to serotype identification, protease susceptibility can also be utilized to study dynamic structural changes that must occur for the AAV capsid to perform its various functions during the virus life cycle. The use of proteases for structural studies in solution complements the crystal structural studies of the virus.

The aim of this study was to describe these elements in patients infected with SARS-CoV2, hospitalized at a single center in rural Pennsylvania. METHODS: Patients with SARS-CoV2 infections hospitalized between March-December 2020 were studied. Data were obtained from electronic health records generated reports and was retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified into three groups according to severity. Distribution of variables was studied among these three groups. Using certain variables, we ran logistic regression analysis to study the odds of death and requirement of mechanical ventilation (MV). RESULTS: Among 335 hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV2, age more than 65 years increased the severity of clinical status and in-hospital mortality. Gender did not affect odds of death nor need for MV. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, but diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increased the risk of death. In terms of laboratory parameters, our data suggests that maximum LDH marginally increased the risk of death and maximum WBC marginally increased the risk of need for MV and death. CONCLUSION: Through our basic analysis of various characteristics of SARS-CoV2 positive patients admitted in a rural hospital, we have identified certain risk factors associated with severe disease and increased in-hospital mortality.

Since those functions are associated with the hippocampus, I analyzed the global gene expression data from post-mortem hippocampal tissue of 25 old (age  60 yrs) and 15 young (age  45 yrs) cognitively intact human subjects. By employing a rigorous, multi-method bioinformatic approach, I identified 36 genes that were the most significant in terms of differential expression; and by employing mathematical modeling, I demonstrated that 7 of the 36 genes were able to discriminate between the old and young subjects with high accuracy. Remarkably, 90% of the known genes from those 36 most significant genes are associated with either inflammation or immune system activation. This suggests that chronic inflammation and immune system over-activity may underlie the aging process of the human brain, and that potential anti-inflammatory treatments targeting those genes may slow down this process and alleviate its symptoms.","output":"Inflammation and Immune System Activation in Aging: A Mathematical Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The long-term consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on brain physiology and function are not yet well understood.

Voxel-wise analyses of CBF were performed to assess for between-group differences, after controlling for age and sex. Relative to controls, the COVID-19 group exhibited decreased CBF in the thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, and regions of the basal ganglia. Within the COVID-19 group, CBF differences in occipital and parietal regions were observed between those with (n = 11) and without (n = 28) self-reported on-going fatigue. These results suggest long-term changes in brain physiology in adults across the post-COVID-19 timeframe.

Many healthcare workers, including neurosurgeons, have expressed concern about how to safely and adequately perform their medical responsibilities in these challenging circumstances. One of these concerns revolves around the pressing question: should providers continue to work in the absence of adequate PPE? Although the first peak of the COVID-19 crisis seems to have subsided and supply of PPE has increased, concerns about insufficient PPE availability remain. Inconsistent supply, limited efficacy, and continued high demand for PPE, combined with the continued threat of a second COVID-19 wave, mean that the issues surrounding PPE availability remain unresolved, including a duty to work. This paper offers an ethical investigation of whether neurosurgeons should perform their professional responsibilities with limited availability of PPE. We evaluate ethical considerations and conflicting duties and thereby hope to facilitate providers in making a well-considered personal and moral decision about this challenging issue.","output":"Should neurosurgeons continue to work in the absence of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 era?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, we have been in the battlefield with a new threat to the humanity known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

All of them compare the highlighting advantages and disadvantages from an analytical point of view. The gold standard method in terms of sensitivity and specificity is the RT-PCR. The different modifications propose to make it more rapid and applicable at point of care (POC) are also presented and discussed. CT images are limited to central hospitals. However, being combined with RT-PCR is the most robust and accurate way to confirm COVID-19 infection. Antibody tests, although unable to provide reliable results on the status of the infection, are suitable for carrying out maximum screening of the population in order to know the immune capacity. More recently, antigen tests, less sensitive than RT-PCR, have been authorized to determine in a quicker way whether the patient is infected at the time of analysis and without the need of specific instruments.","output":"Current state of Diagnostic, Screening and Surveillance Testing Methods for COVID-19 from an Analytical Chemistry Point of View"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pathological processes by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that make the virus a major threat to global health are insufficiently understood. Inefficient viral clearance at any stage is a hallmark of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Disease severity is associated with increases in peripheral blood cytokines among which interleukin 10 (IL-10) increases particularly early and independent of patient age, which is not seen in active SARS-CoV infection. Here, we consider the known multi-faceted immune regulatory role of IL-10, both in protecting the lung from injury and in defense against infections, as well as its potential cellular source. While the absence of an IL-10 response in SARS is thought to contribute to early deterioration, we suspect IL-10 to protect the lung from early immune-mediated damage and to interfere with viral clearance in COVID-19. This may further both viral spread and poor outcome in many high-risk patients. Identifying the features of the viral genotype, which specifically underlie the different IL-10 dynamics as an etiological endotype and the different viral load kinetics and outcomes as clinical phenotype, may unveil a new immune evasive strategy of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Lung Protection vs. Infection Resolution: Interleukin 10 Suspected of Double-Dealing in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use a stochastic branching process model, structured by age and level of healthcare access, to look at the heterogeneous spread of COVID-19 within a population. We examine the effect of control scenarios targeted at particular groups, such as school closures or social distancing by older people. Although we currently lack detailed empirical data about contact and infection rates between age groups and groups with different levels of healthcare access within New Zealand, these scenarios illustrate how such evidence could be used to inform specific interventions. We find that an increase in the transmission rates among children from reopening schools is unlikely to significantly increase the number of cases, unless this is accompanied by a change in adult behaviour. We also find that there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities that have low access to healthcare and that are socially isolated from more privileged communities. The greater the degree of inequity and extent of social segregation, the longer it will take before any outbreaks are detected. A well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicates that Maori and Pacific peoples are at a higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand. This highlights the importance of ensuring that community needs for access to healthcare, including early proactive testing, rapid contact tracing and the ability to isolate, are being met equitably.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this cross-sectional content analysis study is to describe the content of videos with the hashtag #covidnurse on TikTok, which included 100 videos in the English language. METHODS: At the time of the study, this hashtag had 116.9 million views. Each video was coded for content-related to what nurses encountered and were feeling during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Combined, the 100 videos sampled received 47,056,700 views; 76,856 comments; and 5,996,676 likes. There were 4 content categories that appeared in a majority (>50) of the videos: 83 showed the individual as a nurse, 72 showed the individual in professional attire, 58 mentioned/suggested stress, 55 used music, and 53 mentioned/suggested frustration. Those that mentioned stress and those that mentioned frustration received less than 50% of the total views (n=21,726,800, 46.17% and n=16,326,300, 34.69%, respectively). Although not a majority, 49 of the 100 videos mentioned the importance of nursing. These videos garnered 37.41% (n=17,606,000) of the total views, 34.82% (n=26,759) of the total comments, and 23.85% (n=1,430,213) of the total likes. So, despite nearly half of the total videos mentioning how important nurses are, these videos received less than half of the total views, comments, and likes.

This presents an opportunity for future research to assess the utility of the TikTok platform for meaningful engagement and health communication on important public health issues.","output":"Investigating #covidnurse Messages on TikTok: Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess psychological resilience, coping, and related psychological distress in admitted COVID-19 patients. Predictors of subsequent development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and disability were also studied.Methods: Stable inpatients with COVID-19 (aged > 18 years with mild symptoms) admitted to a tertiary care hospital from April 2020 to December 2020 were recruited for the study. During admission, the patients were assessed for resilience, coping, and psychological distress using the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), Brief COPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced), and 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Similarly, they were assessed at 4 weeks after discharge using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule.Results: A total of 176 patients were recruited for the study and assessed during their admission, and 102 were reassessed during follow-up. Of the patients, 17.6% during admission and 58.8% at follow-up had significant psychological distress (PHQ-4 score > 2). The mean  SD CD-RISC-10 score was 27.94  5.82. The most used coping strategies were emotional support, religion, and acceptance. Increased resilience was associated with better education (rs[100] = 0.265, P = .007), less psychological distress (r[100] = -0.596, P = .001), and healthy coping strategies. PHQ-4, PCL-5, and disability scores at follow-up were positively correlated (Pearson correlation). The multiple regression model statistically significantly predicted PTSS (F7, 94 = 2.660, P < .015, adjusted R2 = 0.103).Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with better resilience are associated with reduced psychological distress.

COVID-19 posed a threat to human health and profoundly impacted the global economy and peoples lifestyles. The United States is one of the countries severely affected by the disease. Evidence shows that the spread of COVID-19 was significantly underestimated in the early stages, which prevented governments from adopting effective interventions promptly to curb the spread of the disease. This paper adopts a Bayesian hierarchical model to study the under-reporting of COVID-19 at the state level in the United States as of the end of April 2020. The model examines the effects of different covariates on the under-reporting and accurate incidence rates and considers spatial dependency. In addition to under-reporting (false negatives), we also explore the impact of over-reporting (false positives). Adjusting for misclassification requires adding additional parameters that are not directly identified by the observed data. Informative priors are required. We discuss prior elicitation and include R functions that convert expert information into the appropriate prior distribution.","output":"A Bayesian Hierarchical Spatial Model to Correct for Misreporting in Count Data: Application to State-Level COVID-19 Data in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As countries in COVID-19 pandemic lockdown begin relaxation of shelter-in-place mitigation strategies, the role of serology testing escalates in importance. However, there are no clear guidelines as to when to use qualitative rapid diagnostic serology tests (RDTs) vs. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (PCR) tests as an aid in acute diagnosis of patients presenting with flu-like symptoms, nor how to interpret serology test results in asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical COVID-19 symptomatology. Here we describe, in the context of the likely first case of COVID-19 in California, with an atypical presentation and not tested acutely, who nearly 3 months later was found to be IgM- and IgG+ positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, highlighting the role of RDT-based serology testing and interpretation in retrospective diagnosis. Case Presentation: A 62-year-old male practicing neurosurgeon had onset of flu-like symptoms on January 20 with fatigue, slight cough only on deep inspiration, intermittent pleuritic chest pain unrelated to exertion, dyspnea, and night sweats but without fever, sore throat or rhinorrhea. He had recently traveled abroad but not to China. CT scan revealed right lower lobe infiltrate and effusion. Because of atypical symptoms, and low prevalence of COVID-19 in January, community acquired pneumonia was diagnosed and one week of doxycycline was prescribed without relief, followed by a second week of azithromycin with symptom remission. Three months later the physician-patient (author THL), tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by a serology point-of-care rapid diagnostic test (RDT).

Grounded in self-determination theory, the objectives of this exploratory study were to analyse the influence of the flipped classroom and gamification on SLE concerning learner achievement and engagement. Participants were recruited from postgraduate business education programmes in China, and three instructional interventions were applied for a semester of 10 weeks. The three instructional interventions applied were: gamified flipped classroom (n = 25), non-gamified flipped classroom (n = 24) and gamified traditional classroom (n = 19). A mixed-methods approach was used, and both quantitative and qualitative data were analysed. The results indicated gamified traditional classrooms promote learner achievement, and the gamified flipped classrooms promote learner engagement. Furthermore, learning culture, such as teacher-dependency, also influence learner achievement and engagement.

The increase in daily confirmed cases accelerated significantly from ~ 5 additional new cases (ANC)/day during early March up to ~ 249 ANC/day during early June. An abrupt change in this temporal pattern was noticed during mid-April, from which can be inferred a much reduced impact of the nationwide lockdown in India. Daily maximum (T Max), minimum (T Min), mean (T Mean) and dew point temperature (T Dew), wind speed (WS), relative humidity, and diurnal range in temperature and relative humidity during March 01 to June 04, 2020 over 9 major affected cities are analyzed to look into the impact of daily weather on COVID-19 infections on that day and 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 days before those cases were detected (i.e., on the likely transmission days). Spearmans correlation exhibits significantly lower association with WS, T Max, T Min, T Mean, T Dew, but is comparatively better with a lag of 14 days.

A multi-disciplinary review was conducted to try to identify reasons for this increase, and to determine whether systems changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have played a role.ObjectivesInvestigation of a local increase in invasive GBS cases in infants.MethodsA retrospective case note review of all cases of iGBS occurring between 2015 and 2020 was conducted. Cases occurring in 2020 were compared to cases in 2015C2019 and to a matched-control population for presence of known risk factors and demographics, Whole genome sequencing was conducted on bacterial isolates from cases in 2020 in order to identify whether the increased incidence represented an outbreak.ResultsIn 2020 14 cases of iGBS occurred in infants <90 days of age (Incidence rate (IR) 2.55/1000);5 Early Onset GBS (EOGBS, 0C6d, IR 0.91/1000)) and 9 Late Onset GBS (LOGBS, 7C89d, (IR 1.64/1000)) at our hospital. These rates were 1.2-fold and 4.5-fold higher, respectively, than the local rates for 2019, and 1.7-fold and 5.5-fold higher than the 2019 national rates.All babies with EOGBS in 2020 had identifiable risk factors;4/5 had maternal pyrexia >38C, 1/5 had suspected chorioamnionitis and 3/5 had prolonged rupture of membranes >18 hours. All received appropriate intra-partum antibiotics. GBS colonisation was unknown prior to delivery in any mother, with 60% of mothers in 2020 subsequently testing positive compared to 27% in 2015C2019. There were no significant differences in the demographics of infants with EOGBS in 2020 compared to 2015C2019. All cases of EOGBS in 2020 were identified rapidly following delivery, and treated according to NICE guidelines.Cases of LOGBS in 2020 tended to occur more in low risk, term deliveries compared to previous years. In 2020 43% of infants with LOGBS had no identifiable risk factors for LOGBS at delivery, compared to 23% in the early time-period. Infants with LOGBS in 2020 were demographically comparable to those in 2015C2019.No clear evidence of an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was found. Mothers of infants with LOGBS disease had slightly fewer antenatal microbiological samples, where GBS may have been identified incidentally, compared to previous years (56% vs. 75%), possibly indicating reduced ad-hoc presentations as a result of the pandemic, although this difference was not significant. No evidence for nosocomial or community clustering of cases was found.Whole genome sequencing identified serotype III ST-17 as the dominant GBS strain. However, isolates were genomically diverse with no evidence of an outbreak of a hyper-virulent strain. All sequenced isolates carried the mreA gene conferring macrolide resistance.ConclusionsAn increase in LOGBS cases in our low-risk term-infant population was noted during 2020, with high rates of iGBS strains showing macrolide resistance.

It includes the role of the pathologist in patient care and other professional values such as patient-centred care, clinical competencies and skills, e.g. explaining results, and knowledge under the various sub-disciplines, i.e. histopathology (including neuropathology), clinical microbiology, haematology, chemical pathology and immunology. In each of these, we suggest key aspects and activities that the medical graduate should be comfortable in carrying out. The methods of delivery of teaching and assessment across pathology disciplines have evolved and adapted to recent circumstances. Lessons have been learned and insights gained during the COVID-19 pandemic as educators have risen to the challenge of continuing to educate medical students. Integrated and multi-disciplinary teaching is recommended to reflect best the professional environment of the medical graduate who works as an integral part of a multi-disciplinary team, with the minimum dependence on the traditional lecture, where at all possible. Finally, options on assessment are discussed, e.g. multiple-choice questions, including their respective advantages and disadvantages.

In addition, to assess the impact of smell loss on psychological well-being and distress, and to assess coping strategies used by COVID-19 patients with smell loss. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study. A total of 487 COVID-19 positive patients with anosmia were recruited. All participants filled in the validated Multi-Clinic Smell and Taste Questionnaire, and the validated General Well-being Schedule. RESULTS: Negative impacts of smell loss, associated risks, interference with daily activities, and deterioration in well-being were common. The importance of the sense of smell was evaluated (In relation to other senses) as higher in the period after the loss than before the loss (p < 0.001). All aspects of health-related QOL are statistically significant (p < 0.001), with the exception of financial security and friendship, which are not statistically significant (p = 0.129, p = 0.334), respectively. Psychological well-being was negatively affected, and the use of both problem- and emotion-focused strategies was common. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 Patients with loss of smell have significant reductions in health-related QOL. Their loss of smell directly affects daily activities related to the olfactory function. Therefore, priority should be given to diagnose and treat the loss of smell. Patients who have recently developed smell loss may be offered a combination of the problem- and emotion-focused strategies to cope with their condition.","output":"Impact of the smell loss on the quality of life and adopted coping strategies in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction COVID-19 can lead to a severe inflammatory response and cytokine storm, which is associated with activation of blood coagulation, platelets, and endothelium leading to a severe prothrombotic state. Recent studies have interpreted TEG parameters of increased maximum amplitude (MA) and alpha angle (AA) as indicating a hypercoagulable pattern in patients with COVID-19. The definition of hypercoagulability in literature has been variable while some have used increased MA, others used increased coagulation index (CI) as a surrogate for a hypercoagulable state. Here we report our center experience using TEG to evaluate coagulation in COVID-19 patients. Methods Retrospective analysis of 37 critically ill patients that were evaluated using TEG on a single occasion along with standard coagulation tests. We defined hypercoagulable pattern as CI &gt; 3;hypocoagulable pattern was defined as CI &lt;-3;and normal pattern if CI was between-3-3. Results TEG patterns were interpreted as hypercoagulable in 5 (13.5%), normal in 22 (59.5%) and hypocoagulable in 10 (27%) patients using the TEG coagulation index (CI). MA and AA were elevated in 13 (35.1%) and 10 (27%) patients, respectively, and both were elevated in 8 (21.6%). Discussion Our results show a normal TEG pattern in most of our critically ill COVID-19 patients based on CI (Figure 1);only 5 (13.5%) showed a hypercoagulable pattern. These findings differ from previous reports of TEG in COVID-19 patients, where a hypercoagulable TEG pattern was shown in 83-90% of patients, in these reports interpretation of hypercoagulability was based on AA or MA. We used the CI to define a hypercoagulable state, which has been used to define hypercoagulability in orthopedic surgery and during pregnancy. An elevated MA or AA was seen in only 15 (40%) of our patients. Plasma fibrinogen, an acute-phase reactant, is also elevated in COVID-19 patients. The mean fibrinogen level in our patients was 364 mg/dl, which is lower than those reported by Panigada and Mortus, where mean fibrinogen levels were 680 and 740 mg/dl, respectively. The high MA may reflect the high fibrinogen observed in COVID-19 patients and this may explain the differences in the number of patients considered as hypercoagulable in our cohort compared to others. Conclusion;Our study in COVID-19 patients advances a caution in the interpretation of TEG parameters and its use as an indicator of a hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Thromboelastography (TEG) in COVID-19 patients-not all hypercoagulable"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are of significant interest owing to their high potential health effects, including mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. We report 16 PAHs measured in ambient PM(2.5) from June 2018 to May 2019 over three different sites located in central east India. The annual average PM(2.5) mass concentrations of 97.3  18.1 g m(?3), 101.9  19.4 g m(?3), and 93.9  20.3 g m(?3) were measured at RCI (Ranchi), GHY (Gamharia), and BKR (Bokaro), respectively. The mass concentrations at all sampling sites are relatively higher than the annual average concentration of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Total annual PAH concentrations (ng m(?3)) are found to be comparable at BKR (797.9  39.1 ng m(?3)) and RCI (887.7  38.8 ng m(?3)); however, a relatively higher average is observed over GHY (1015.1  42.7 ng m(?3)). Using PAH diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis (PCA), their major sources were attributed to coal and wood combustion as well as vehicular emission of diesel and gasoline at all sampling sites. Significant seasonal variability is observed for PAH composition and mainly attributed to change in emission sources. Summer and winter compositions were found to be impacted by the transport from Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). However, ambient level PAHs during the post-monsoon season were impacted by mixed sources from Indo-Gangetic Plain and eastern India. These observations are supported by the analysis of back-trajectory and fire count data. The excess life time cancer risk (ELCR) values estimated for the study sites are within acceptable limits suggesting acceptable risk levels at BKR, GHY, and RCI.

METHODS: We built a model for GammaMed Plus high dose rate brachytherapy source in TOPAS. The TG-43 dosimetry parameters including air-kerma strength SK , dose-rate constant &#923;, radial dose function gL (r), and 2D anisotropy function F(r,) were calculated using Monte Carlo simulation with Geant4 physics models and NNDC 192 Ir spectrum. Calculations using an old 192 Ir spectrum were also carried out to evaluate the impact of incident spectrum and cross sections. The results were compared with published data. RESULTS: For calculations using the NNDC spectrum, the air-kerma strength per unit source activity SK /A and &#923; were 1.0139  10-7 U/Bq and 1.1101 cGy.h-1 .U-1 , which were 3.56% higher and 0.62% lower than the reference values, respectively. The gL (r) agreed with reference values within 1% for radial distances from 2 mm to 20 cm. For radial distances of 1, 3, 5, and 10 cm, the agreements between F(r,) from this work and the reference data were within 1.5% for 15 <  < 165, and within 4% for all  values. The discrepancies were attributed to the updated source spectrum and cross sections. They caused deviations of the SK /A of 2.90% and 0.64%, respectively. As for gL (r), they caused average deviations of -0.22% and 0.48%, respectively. Their impact on F(r,) was not quantified for the relatively high statistical uncertainties, but basically they did not result in significant discrepancies. CONCLUSION: A model for GammaMed Plus high dose rate 192 Ir brachytherapy source was developed in TOPAS and validated following TG-43 protocols, which can be used for future studies.

The mechanisms that result in depressive behaviors are not fully understood; however, the hippocampus has been noted as a key structure in the pathophysiology of depression. In addition to neural implications of depression, the cardiovascular system is impacted. Although not as commonly considered, the cerebrovasculature is critical to brain function, impacted by environmental stimuli, and is capable of altering neural function and thereby behavior. In the current study, we assessed the relationship between depressive behavior and a marker of vascularization of the hippocampus in adult female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Similar to previously noted impacts on neuropil and glia, the depressed phenotype predicts a reduction in a marker of vascular length in the anterior hippocampus. These data reinforce the growing recognition of the effects of depression on vasculature and support further consideration of vascular endpoints in studies aimed at the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying depression.","output":"Reduced marker of vascularization in the anterior hippocampus in a female monkey model of depression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity and mortality of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza were recently compared in the general population but not in patients with hematological malignancies.

However, the last such prioritization study was conducted more than a decade ago and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. OBJECTIVES: To identify conditions that should be prioritized for comparative effectiveness research based on prevalence, cost, and variation in cost of hospitalizations using contemporary data at US childrens hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study of children with hospital encounters used data from the Pediatric Health Information System database. Children younger than 18 years with inpatient hospital encounters at 45 tertiary care US childrens hospitals between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2019, were included. Data were analyzed from March 2020 to April 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The condition-specific prevalence and total standardized cost, the corresponding prevalence and cost ranks, and the variation in standardized cost per encounter across hospitals were analyzed. The variation in cost was assessed using the number of outlier hospitals and intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: There were 2 882 490 inpatient hospital encounters (median [interquartile range] age, 4 [1-12] years; 1 554 024 [53.9%] boys) included. Among the 50 most prevalent and 50 most costly conditions (total, 74 conditions), 49 (66.2%) were medical, 15 (20.3%) were surgical, and 10 (13.5%) were medical/surgical. The top 10 conditions by cost accounted for $12.4 billion of $33.4 billion total costs (37.4%) and 592 815 encounters (33.8% of all encounters). Of 74 conditions, 4 conditions had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.30 or higher (ie, major depressive disorder: ICC, 0.49; type 1 diabetes with complications: ICC, 0.36; diabetic ketoacidosis: ICC, 0.33; acute appendicitis without peritonitis: ICC, 0.30), and 9 conditions had an ICC higher than 0.20 (scoliosis: ICC, 0.27; hypertrophy of tonsils and adenoids: ICC, 0.26; supracondylar fracture of humerus: ICC, 0.25; cleft lip and palate: ICC, 0.24; acute appendicitis with peritonitis: ICC, 0.21). Examples of conditions high in prevalence, cost, and variation in cost included major depressive disorder (cost rank, 19; prevalence rank, 10; ICC, 0.49), scoliosis (cost rank, 6; prevalence rank, 38; ICC, 0.27), acute appendicitis with peritonitis (cost rank, 13; prevalence rank, 11; ICC, 0.21), asthma (cost rank, 10; prevalence rank, 2; ICC, 0.17), and dehydration (cost rank, 24; prevalence rank, 8; ICC, 0.18). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that major depressive disorder, scoliosis, acute appendicitis with peritonitis, asthma, and dehydration were high in prevalence, costs, and variation in cost.

This study identifies how frequently equestrians use roads and what impacts their ability to do so. Over 6000 UK equestrians completed an online questionnaire about their exercise behaviours, road use and experiences of road-related incidents. Most equestrians use roads regularly. In the previous year, 68% of equestrians experienced a near-miss and 6% an injury-causing incident. Our results found that regional differences in road use and near-miss experiences coincided with off-road route availability. Road use was associated with the proximity of off-road routes, and road-using equestrians covered longer distances. Near-misses were associated with increasing frequency of weekly road use. Younger equestrians were more likely to use roads, but also to experience near-misses. Injury-causing incidents were associated with increasing road-use anxiety or ceasing to use roads (due to strong feelings of danger, compromised safety and conflict with other road users), the proximity of off-road routes, having a near-miss and riding while leading a ridden horse; often a child. Targeted campaigns encouraging responsible road use, better off-road access and inclusion of equestrians in planning and development initiatives would create safer equestrian spaces, particularly for young people. ABSTRACT: Real or perceived traffic risk is a significant barrier to walking and cycling. To understand whether similar barriers influence equestrians, this study obtained exercise behaviours, road use and experiences of road-related incidents from UK equestrians (n = 6390) via an online questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with road use and experiencing a near-miss or injury-causing incident in the previous year. Content analysis identified themes around equestrians decisions not to use roads. Our results show that most equestrians (84%) use roads at least once weekly, and in the previous year, 67.7% had a near-miss and 6.1% an injury-causing incident. Road use differs regionally, with exercise type and off-road route availability. Road-using equestrians covered greater daily distances and were younger. However, younger equestrians were at higher risk of near-misses. Respondents decisions not to use roads were based on individualised risk assessments arising from: the road itself, perceptions of other road users, the individual horse and the handlers own emotional management. Roads were perceived as extremely dangerous places with potentially high conflict risk. Injury-causing incidents were associated with increasing road-use anxiety or ceasing to use roads, the proximity of off-road routes, having a near-miss and type of road use. Targeted road-safety campaigns and improved off-road access would create safer equestrian spaces.","output":"Public Roads as Places of Interspecies Conflict: A Study of Horse-Human Interactions on UK Roads and Impacts on Equine Exercise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: the Covid-19 pandemic has been marked by sudden outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations in both the N-terminal (NTD) and receptor binding (RBD) domains of the spike protein. The goal of this study was to predict the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants from genomic sequence data. METHODS: we used a target-based molecular modeling strategy combined with surface potential analysis of the NTD and RBD. RESULTS: we observed that both domains act synergistically to ensure optimal virus adhesion, which explains why most variants exhibit concomitant mutations in the RBD and in the NTD. Some mutation patterns affect the affinity of the spike protein for ACE-2. However, other patterns increase the electropositive surface of the spike, with determinant effects on the kinetics of virus adhesion to lipid raft gangliosides. Based on this new view of the structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants, we defined an index of transmissibility (T-index) calculated from kinetic and affinity parameters of coronavirus binding to host cells. The T-index is characteristic of each variant and predictive of its dissemination in animal and human populations.

The study of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCW), through prevalence studies, will let us know viral expansion, individuals at most risk and the most exposed areas in healthcare organizations. The aim of this study is to gauge the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in our hospital workforce and identify groups and areas at increased risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is a cross-sectional and incidence study carried out on healthcare workers based on molecular and serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 3013 HCW invited to participate, 2439 (80.9%) were recruited, including 674 (22.4%) who had previously consulted at the Occupational Health Service (OHS) for confirmed exposure and/or presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. A total of 411 (16.9%) and 264 (10.8%) healthcare workers were SARS-CoV-2 IgG and rRT-PCR positive, respectively. The cumulative prevalence considering all studies (IgG positive HCW and/or rRT-PCR positive detection) was 485 (19.9%). SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive patients in whom the virus was not detected were 221 (9.1%); up to 151 of them (68.3%) did not report any compatible symptoms nor consult at the OHS for this reason. Men became more infected than women (25% vs 18.5%, p = 0.0009), including when data were also classified by age. COVID-19 cumulative prevalence among the HCW assigned to medical departments was higher (25.2%) than others, as well as among medical staff (25.4%) compared with other professional categories (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCW of our centre has been 19.9%. Doctors and medical services personnel have had the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of them have not presented compatible symptoms. This emphasizes the performance of continuous surveillance methods of the most exposed health personnel and not only based on the appearance of symptoms.","output":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among health care workers in a secondary teaching hospital in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the world has witnessed outbreak of a novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which initially emerged in Wuhan, China has now made its way to a large part of the world, resulting in a public emergency of international concern. The functional importance of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) in viral replication and maturation turns it into an attractive target for the development of effective antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronaviruses. At present, there is no standard drug regime nor any vaccine available against the infection. The rapid development and identification of efficient interventions against SARS-CoV-2 remains a major challenge. Based on the available knowledge of closely related coronavirus and their safety profiles, repurposing of existing antiviral drugs and screening of available databases is considered a near term strategic and economic way to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

As a result three FDA approved drugs ( Remdesivir, Saquinavir and Darunavir) and two natural compounds (. flavone and coumarine derivatives) were identified as promising hits. Further, MD simulation and binding free energy calculations were performed to evaluate the dynamic behavior, stability of protein-ligand contact, and binding affinity of the hit compounds. Our results indicate that the identified compounds can inhibit the function of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of Coronavirus. Considering the severity of the spread of coronavirus, the current study is in-line with the concept of finding the new inhibitors against the vital pathway of the corona virus to expedite the process of drug discovery.","output":"Identification of Chymotrypsin-like Protease Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Via Integrated Computational Approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, restorative environment theory and virtual reality (VR) technology were combined to build different 3D dynamic VR interactive scenes. We discuss the effects of a VR restorative environment on the emotional and cognitive recovery of individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression. First, we built a VR restorative garden scene, divided into four areas: forest, lawn, horticultural planting, and water features. The scene was verified to have a good recovery effect in 26 participants. Then, 195 participants with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression were selected as experimental subjects. Through psychological testing and EMG (Electromyography) and EEG (Electroencephalography) data feedback, we further explored the differences in the sense of presence in VR restorative scenes and their effect on individual emotional and cognitive recovery. The results showed that (1) both the restorative environment images and the VR scenes had a healing effect (the reduction in negative emotions and the recovery of positive emotions and cognition), with no difference in the subjective feeling of recovery among the different scenes, but the recovery score of the VR urban environment was higher than that of the natural environment (differing from the results in real environments); (2) a high sense of presence can be experienced in different VR scenes, and interactive activities in VR scenes can provide a great presence experience; (3) the recovery effects of VR restorative environment on emotion and self-efficacy are realized through the presence of VR scenes; (4) a VR restorative environment is helpful for the emotional improvement and cognitive recovery of individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression. VR urban scenes also have good recovery effects. In terms of cognitive recovery, self-efficacy improved significantly. In addition, from the perspective of EEG indicators, the VR restorative scene experience activated the prefrontal lobe, which is conducive to cognitive recovery in individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression. In terms of emotional improvement, negative emotions were significantly reduced in the different VR scene groups. In conclusion, we further explored ways to help individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression, in order to promote the development and application of mental health.","output":"Effect of a Virtual Reality-Based Restorative Environment on the Emotional and Cognitive Recovery of Individuals with Mild-to-Moderate Anxiety and Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animal farming has intensified significantly in recent decades, with the emergence of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in industrialized nations. The congregation of susceptible animals in CAFOs can lead to heavy environmental contamination with pathogens, promoting the emergence of hyper-transmissible, and virulent pathogens. As a result, CAFOs have been associated with emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, hepatitis E virus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Streptococcus suis, livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Cryptosporidium parvum in farm animals. This has led to increased transmission of zoonotic pathogens in humans and changes in disease patterns in general communities. They are exemplified by the common occurrence of outbreaks of illnesses through direct and indirect contact with farm animals, and wide occurrence of similar serotypes or subtypes in both humans and farm animals in industrialized nations. Therefore, control measures should be developed to slow down the dispersal of zoonotic pathogens associated with CAFOs and prevent the emergence of new pathogens of epidemic and pandemic potential.","output":"Association of Common Zoonotic Pathogens With Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to compare the effects of high-flow nasal oxygen cannula (HFNC) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in extubated patients with respiratory insufficiency.

The primary outcome was reintubation within 24-72 hours after a planned extubation. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Six articles with1746 patients were included. The effect of HFNC on the reintubation rate was noninferior to that of NIV (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.85-1.44). The rate of treatment failure was 20.40% with HFNC versus 20.92% with NIV; this difference was nonsignificant (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.72-1.32, P = 0.85).

This paper aims to evaluate the impact of lockdown on five major airborne pollutants, i.e., NO(2), SO(2), O(3), PM(2.5) and PM(10), in the three different functional regions of Chongming, Xuhui and Jinshan of Shanghai. Changes in the same pollutants from the three regions over the same/different periods were all studied and compared. Overall, the COVID-19 lockdown has changed pollutant concentrations in the long and short terms. Concentrations of four pollutants decreased, except for that of earth surface O(3), which increased. SO(2) had significant correlations with all other pollutants. PM(2.5) and PM(10) are more externally input than locally produced. NO(2), SO(2) and PM levels sharply reduced in Jinshan and Xuhui due to the limited usage of fossil fuel. Lockdown improved the air quality.

RESULTS: At month 1, the prevalence of infection measured by rRT-PCR and serology was 14.9% (84/565) and the seroprevalence 14.5% (82/565). We found 25 (5%) new infections in participants without previous evidence of infection (501).

AIM: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies among HCWs, identify associated epidemiological factors and study antibody kinetics. METHODS: A longitudinal evaluation of the seroprevalence and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was undertaken in approximately 30,000 HCWs in the largest healthcare system in Connecticut, USA. FINDINGS: At baseline, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among 6863 HCWs was 6.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.7-6.9%], and was highest among patient care support (16.7%), medical assistants (9.1%) and nurses (8.2%), and lower for physicians (3.8%) and advanced practice providers (4.5%).

The main objective of this study was to assess the presence of CVH and ICC alterations in patients with COVID-19 and evaluate their association with short-term clinical outcomes. Methods: Fifty consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients were studied with transcranial Doppler (TCD) and non-invasive monitoring of ICC. Subjects were included upon ICU admission; CVH was evaluated using mean flow velocities in the middle cerebral arteries (mCBFV), pulsatility index (PI), and estimated cerebral perfusion pressure (eCPP), while ICC was assessed by using the P2/P1 ratio of the non-invasive ICP curve. A CVH/ICC score was computed using all these variables. The primary composite outcome was unsuccessful in weaning from respiratory support or death on day 7 (defined as UO). Results: At the first assessment (n = 50), only the P2/P1 ratio (median 1.20 [IQRs 1.00C1.28] vs. 1.00 [0.88C1.16]; p = 0.03) and eICP (14 [11C25] vs. 11 [7C15] mmHg; p = 0.01) were significantly higher among patients with an unfavorable outcome (UO) than others. Patients with UO had a significantly higher CVH/ICC score (9 [8C12] vs. 6 [5C7]; p < 0.001) than those with a favorable outcome; the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for CVH/ICC score to predict UO was 0.86 (95% CIs 0.75C0.97); a score > 8.5 had 63 (46C77)% sensitivity and 87 (62C97)% specificity to predict UO. For those patients undergoing a second assessment (n = 29), after a median of 11 (5C31) days, all measured variables were similar between the two time-points. No differences in the measured variables between ICU non-survivors (n = 30) and survivors were observed. Conclusions: ICC impairment and CVH disturbances are often present in COVID-19 severe illness and could accurately predict an early poor outcome.","output":"Cerebral Hemodynamics and Intracranial Compliance Impairment in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The initial outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly extended globally, which brought huge detrimental to the whole society.

Cardiovascular disease including hypertension was shown to play a critical role in the severity of COVID-19 infection by affecting the survival of patients with COVID-19. Hypertension and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are involved in increasing vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction (ED), and both processes are instrumental in COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is an essential component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the target receptor that mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry to the cell. This led to speculations that major renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, such as angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors might affect the course of the disease, since their administration enhances angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 expression. An increase in ACE2 activity could reduce angiotensin II concentration in the lungs and mitigate virus-driven lung injury. This could also be associated with a reduction in blood coagulation, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2; of note, COVID-19 is now regarded as a disorder of blood clotting. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the effect of targeting ACE2 as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 driven injury, and in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms by reversing SARS-CoV-2-induced excessive coagulation and fatalities.

For the diagnosis markers, we found that the levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin (PCT) were significantly higher in severe group compared with the non-severe group on admission (D-Dimer: 87.3% vs. 35.3%, P<0.001; CRP, 65.1% vs. 13.5%, P<0.001; LDH: 83.9% vs. 22.2%, P<0.001; PCT: 35.1% vs. 2.2%, P<0.001), while the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ASP) and creatinine kinase (CK) were only mildly increased. We also made a large scale meta-analysis of 1646 cases combined with 4 related literatures, and further confirmed the relationship between the COVID-19 severity and these risk factors. Moreover, we tracked dynamic changes during the process of COVID-19, and found CRP, D-dimer, LDH, PCT kept in high levels in severe patient. Among all these markers, D-dimer increased remarkably in severe patients and mostly related with the case-fatality rate (CFR). We found adjuvant antithrombotic treatment in some severe patients achieved good therapeutic effect in the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis markers CRP, D-dimer, LDH and PCT are associated with severity of COVID-19. Among these markers, D-dimer is sensitive for both severity and CFR of COVID-19. Treatment with heparin or other anticoagulants may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients.","output":"A cohort study of 223 patients explores the clinical risk factors for the severity diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a growing need for the automated generation of instance models to evaluate model-driven engineering techniques. Depending on a chosen application scenario, a model generator has to fulfill different requirements: As a modeling language is usually defined by a meta-model, all generated models are expected to conform to their meta-models. For performance tests of model-driven engineering techniques, the efficient generation of large models should be supported. When generating several models, the resulting set of models should show some diversity. Interactive model generation may help in producing relevant models. In this paper, we present a rule-based, configurable approach to automate model generation which addresses the stated requirements. Our model generator produces valid instance models of meta-models with multiplicities conforming to the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). An evaluation of the model generator shows that large EMF models (with up to half a million elements) can be produced. Since the model generation is rule-based, it can be configured beforehand or during the generation process to produce sets of models that are diverse to a certain extent.","output":"Generating Large EMF Models Efficiently: A Rule-Based, Configurable Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Noninvasive in vivo blood and tissue analysis remains a challenge to medical technology epitomized by the ongoing quest to replace fingerstick self-monitoring of blood glucose.

In fact, social anxiety more than quadruples the risk of developing cannabis use disorder, yet it is inconsistently related to more cannabis use. Inconsistent findings may be due to lack of attention to protective behavioral strategies (PBS) among socially anxious cannabis users. PBS are cognitive-behavioral strategies to reduce cannabis use and related problems. Yet socially anxious persons may be less likely to use PBS for a variety of reasons (e.g., fear of negative evaluation for engaging in behaviors to reduce use), leading to heavier or more frequent use and related problems. The current study examined the mediating role of PBS in the relationships of social anxiety with past-month cannabis use and related problems among current (past-month) cannabis users (N = 102). Social anxiety was significantly positively related to past-month cannabis problems, but not directly related to cannabis use. Social anxiety was significantly negatively related to PBS. Social anxiety was indirectly (via PBS) related to more frequent use, greater peak use, and more cannabis problems. Serial mediation analyses indicated that social anxiety was indirectly related to more cannabis problems via the serial effects of PBS and cannabis use variables. Findings suggest that socially anxious persons may be vulnerable to heavier cannabis use and more cannabis problems due to PBS underutilization.

The conventional methods of disease-spread modeling, compartmental models, are based on the assumption of spatiotemporal homogeneity of the spread of the virus, which may cause forecasting to underperform, especially at high spatial resolutions. In this paper we approach the forecasting task with an alternative technique - spatiotemporal machine learning. We present COVID-LSTM, a data-driven model based on a Long Short-term Memory deep learning architecture for forecasting COVID-19 incidence at the county-level in the US. We use the weekly number of new positive cases as temporal input, and hand-engineered spatial features from Facebook movement and connectedness datasets to capture the spread of the disease in time and space. COVID-LSTM outperforms the COVID-19 Forecast Hub's Ensemble model (COVIDhub-ensemble) on our 17-week evaluation period, making it the first model to be more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble over one or more forecast periods. Over the 4-week forecast horizon, our model is on average 50 cases per county more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble. We highlight that the underutilization of data-driven forecasting of disease spread prior to COVID-19 is likely due to the lack of sufficient data available for previous diseases, in addition to the recent advances in machine learning methods for spatiotemporal forecasting. We discuss the impediments to the wider uptake of data-driven forecasting, and whether it is likely that more deep learning-based models will be used in the future.","output":"A spatiotemporal machine learning approach to forecasting COVID-19 incidence at the county level in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Diante da emergncia em sade pblica de importancia internacional provocada pela COVID-19, trabalhadores da pesca artesanal, em dilogo com lideran?as e acadmicos brasileiros criaram, em mar?o de 2020, um Observatrio sobre os impactos dessa pandemia em comunidades pesqueiras.

Despite adequate thromboprophylaxis, one-third of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia developed pulmonary embolism. This high rate of thrombotic complications has led to higher doses of anticoagulants according to clinical complexity (e.g. intensive care unit (ICU) patients) and D-dimer levels. On the other side of the coin, haemorrhagic complications are being increasingly reported. CASES PRESENTATION: We herein report four cases of spontaneous psoas haematomas (SPH) among 548 patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia between March 2020 and January 2021 (incidence of 7.3 cases per 1000 patients). All patients had pneumonia, with age ranging between 62 and 83 years. All patients received anticoagulant therapy with low weight molecular heparin (100 U.I. anti-Xa/kg 2 times/d) from admission: in two cases, a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made. In another case, a thrombosis of left axillary and basilic veins was found, and only in one case anticoagulant therapy was started because of elevated levels of D-dimer. In all cases, signs of anaemia were detected and patients experienced low back or abdominal pain. The diagnosis of spontaneous psoas haematoma was made by computed tomography (CT) after a median of 12.5 d (9;16) from admission and 19.5 d (14.75; 24.25) from the beginning of COVID-19 symptoms. Half of these patients died from haemorrhagic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Given the potential life-threatening of SPH and the possible subtle clinical presentation, we believe it is crucial to raise clinicians awareness of this complication among COVID-19 patients undergoing anticoagulants.","output":"Spontaneous psoas haematoma: a life-threatening complication of anticoagulation in COVID-19.

As farm, performance, and companion animals, horses are a unique species from a zoonotic disease risk perspective, and the risks of subclinical infections spreading among horses can pose challenges.

In addition, sugar flotation test was performed for fecal parasites. E. coli f17 was commonly detected, prevalent in 59% of horses, followed closely by Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (55%). Additional pathogens recognized included betacoronavirus, Campylobacter jejuni, Cryptosporidium sp., E. coli O157, equine adenovirus 1, equine rhinitis B virus, and others. The use of PCR data may overestimate the true prevalence of these pathogens but provides a sensitive overview of common pathogens present in healthy horses.

Depending upon the intensity of transmission and severity of disease, pandemic influenza may cause as many as 350 million deaths and result in economic losses topping $1 trillion C an impact great enough to create a worldwide recession. We then reviewed 100 papers primarily from more than a dozen countries which studied the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccine in children, adults, and the elderly. These studies demonstrate that influenza vaccination is quite cost-effective among children 6 months to 18 years old, in health care workers and pregnant women, and in high-risk individuals. Remarkably, compared with the other recently introduced vaccines for children, such as rotavirus and pneumococcal polysaccharide, vaccinating children and school attendees results in societal cost savings because it obviates lost productivity and wages among infected individuals and their caretakers.

The ability of radars to penetrate through objects and operate during low visibility conditions enables detection of occluded human subjects on and under debris when other sensing modalities fail. Recently, radars have been deployed on UAVs to measure minute human physiological parameters such as respiratory and heart rates while sensing through clothing and building materials. Aggregating radar measurements with the information from other sensors is broadening the applications of drones in life-critical situations. Signal processing techniques are critical in enabling UAV-borne radars for human vital sign detection (VSD) in multiple operation modes.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a population-based study to assess asthma disease status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in relation to COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 61,338) in a large, diverse integrated health care system were identified. Asthma/COPD history, medication use, and covariates were extracted from electronic medical records. Asthma patients were categorized into those with and without clinical visits for asthma 12 or fewer months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and labeled as active and inactive asthma, respectively. Primary outcomes included COVID-19Crelated hospitalizations, intensive respiratory support (IRS), and intensive care unit admissions within 30 days, and mortality within 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Logistic and Cox regression were used to relate COVID-19 outcomes to asthma/COPD history. RESULTS: The cohort was 53.9% female and 66% Hispanic and had a mean age of 43.9 years. Patients with active asthma had increased odds of hospitalization, IRS, and intensive care unit admission (odds ratio 1.47-1.66; P < .05) compared with patients without asthma or COPD. No increased risks were observed for patients with inactive asthma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with increased risks of hospitalization, IRS, and mortality (odds ratio and hazard ratio 1.27-1.67; P < .05). Among active asthma patients, those using asthma medications had greater than 25% lower odds for COVID-19 outcomes than those without medication. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with asthma who required clinical care 12 or fewer months prior to COVID-19 or individuals with COPD history are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.

This study analyzed our experience with 3 different buttressing materials for creating the gastric division during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. METHODS From July 5, 2001 to May 30, 2007, 1451 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass with buttressing material used for the stapled creation of the gastric pouch. Peristrips Dry (PSDs), permanent bovine pericardial strips, were used in 926 cases from July 5, 2001 to October 11, 2005. Seamguards, a synthetic bioabsorbable product, were used in 145 cases from November 2, 2004 to July 18, 2006, and PSD Veritas, remodelable, nonpermanent bovine pericardial strips, were placed in 380 patients from October 11, 2005 to May 30, 2007. All products were applied to the 60-mm-long, 3.5-mm cartridges of the EndoGIA II stapler. The ease of use, operative complications, visual bleeding, and postoperative leaks were recorded. RESULTS The patient characteristics were comparable for all groups. All products were easy to load on the stapler, and no operative complications related to the use of the buttress materials occurred. The incidence and severity of staple line bleeding was not specifically calculated but was visually noted to be minimal in all cases. Of the 3 groups, 4 contained leaks occurred in the Seamguards group, and all were successfully managed nonoperatively. No acute leaks were discovered in the PSD or PSD Veritas groups.

Regarding relative importance, hope turned out to be the most useful predictor of creativity, followed by its components of agency and pathway.Research limitations/implicationsThe study was conducted in a public university setting located in urban areas. The findings may not be generalizable to private settings due to variations in the teacher's creative behaviour with variation in the creative environment.

There is a paucity of data on the impact of congestive heart failure (CHF) on outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a literature search of PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases from 11/1/2019 till 06/07/2020, and identified all relevant studies reporting cardiovascular comorbidities, cardiac biomarkers, disease severity, and survival. Pooled data from the selected studies were used for metanalysis to identify the impact of risk factors and cardiac biomarker elevation on disease severity and/or mortality. Results: We collected pooled data on 5,967 COVID-19 patients from 20 individual studies. We found that both non-survivors and those with severe disease had an increased risk of acute cardiac injury and cardiac arrhythmias, our pooled relative risk (RR) was - 8.52 (95% CI 3.63-19.98) (p<0.001); and 3.61 (95% CI 2.03-6.43) (p=0.001), respectively.

Metabolic features were integrated with the data of another cohort from China (35 TB patients and 35 controls) for a global functional meta-analysis. Specifically, all features were matched to a known biological network to identify potential endogenous metabolites. Next, a pathway-level gene set enrichment analysis-based analysis was conducted for each study and the resulting p-values from the pathways of two studies were combined. The meta-analysis revealed both known metabolic alterations and novel processes. For instance, retinol metabolism and cholecalciferol metabolism, which are associated with TB risk and outcome, were altered in plasma from TB patients; proinflammatory lipid mediators were significantly enriched. Furthermore, metabolic processes linked to the innate immune responses and possible interactions between the host and the bacillus showed altered signals.

Genomic surveillance provides an opportunity to detect and characterize new mutations early enough for effective deployment of control strategies. Here, genomic data from Germany and United Kingdom were examined for genetic diversity by assessing gene mutations and inferring phylogeny, and simplifying genomic data workflow for faster visualization and interpretation. Delta variant sublineages were grouped into seven distinct clusters of spike mutations located in N-terminal domain of S1 region (T95I, D138H, *D142G, Y145H and A222V) and S2 region (T719I and *N950D). The most predominant cluster was T95I mutation, with the highest frequencies (71.1% - 83.9%) in Wales, England and Scotland, and the least frequencies (8.9% - 12.1%) in Germany. Two mutations, *D142G and *N950D here described as *reverse mutations and T719I mutation, were largely unique to Germany. In a month, frequencies of D142G had increased from 55.6% to 67.8 % in Germany. Additionally, a cluster of D142G+T719I/T mutation went up from 27.7% to 34.1%, while a T95I+ D142G+N950D/N cluster rose from 19.2% to 26.2%.

The aim of this study is to identify preoperative characteristics that allow predicting the success after bariatric surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred and sixty-one patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were included. Success of the surgery was defined as the sum of five outcome variables, assessed at baseline and 12 months after the surgery: excess weight loss, use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), daily number of antidiabetics, daily number of antihypertensive drugs, and all-cause mortality. Partial least squares (PLS) regression and multiple linear regression were performed to identify preoperative predictors. We performed a 90/10 split of the dataset in train and test sets and ran a leave-one-out cross-validation on the train set and the best PLS model was chosen based on goodness-of-fit criteria. RESULTS: The preoperative predictors of success after bariatric surgery included lower age, presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and OSA, more years of CPAP/BiPAP use, negative history of cardiovascular disease, and lower number of antihypertensive drugs. The PLS model displayed a mean absolute percent error of 0.1121 in the test portion of the dataset, leading to accurate predictions of postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSION: This success index allows prioritizing patients with the best indication for the procedure and could be incorporated in the public health system as a support tool in the decision-making process.

Here, using a 5-year dataset of eukaryotic plankton DNA metabarcoding, we assess changes in biodiversity and net community production in this region. Our results show that sea-ice extent is a dominant factor influencing eukaryotic plankton community composition, biodiversity, and net community production. Species richness and evenness decline with an increase in sea surface temperature (SST). In regions with low SST and shallow mixed layers, the community was dominated by a diverse assemblage of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Conversely, less diverse plankton assemblages were observed in waters with higher SST and/or deep mixed layers when sea ice extent was lower. A genetic programming machine-learning model explained up to 80% of the net community production variability at the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Among the biological explanatory variables, the sea-ice environment associated plankton assemblage is the best predictor of net community production.

Although minimally invasive techniques have been described and offer some promise, each has considerable limitations. This study assesses the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic transgastric necrosectomy (LTN), a novel technique for the management of necrotizing pancreatitis. STUDY DESIGN Between 2009 and 2013, patients with retrogastric pancreatic necrosis requiring debridement were evaluated for LTN. Debridement was performed via a laparoscopic transgastric approach using 2 to 3 ports and the wide cystgastrostomy left open. Patient demographics, disease severity, operative characteristics, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-one patients (13 men, median age 54 years; interquartile range [IQR] 46 to 62 years) underwent LTN during the study period. The duration between pancreatitis onset and debridement was 65 days (IQR 53 to 124 years). Indications for operation included infection (7 patients) and persistent unwellness (14 patients). Median duration of LTN was 170 minutes (IQR 136 to 199 minutes); there were no conversions. Control of the necrosis was achieved via the single procedure in 19 of 21 patients. Median postoperative hospital stay was 5 days (IQR 3 to 14 days) and the majority (71%) of patients experienced no (n = 9) or only minor postoperative complications (n = 6) by Clavien-Dindo grade. Complications of Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher developed in 6 patients, including 1 death (5%). With a median follow-up of 11 months (IQR 7 to 22 months), none of the patients required additional operative debridement or had pancreatic/enteric fistulae or wound complications develop. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic transgastric necrosectomy is a novel, minimally invasive technique for the management of pancreatic necrosis that allows for debridement in a single operation. When feasible, LTN can reduce the morbidity associated with traditional open necrosectomy and avoid the limitations of other minimally invasive approaches.","output":"Laparoscopic transgastric necrosectomy for the management of pancreatic necrosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Obesity is associated with multiple health risks. Bariatric surgery is a treatment for clinically severe obesity and is known to increase urolithiasis risk. However, trends in risk over time are not well characterized. Moreover little attention has been devoted to laparoscopic gastric band placement. A comparison of urinary risk of urolithiasis after the Roux-en-Y and gastric banding procedures was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated 24-hour urine collections from 39 subjects (11 male and 28 female, mean age 51 years) after bariatric surgery. Of these subjects 27 underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 12 had gastric banding procedures. Mean time since surgery was 3.4 and 2.1 years for the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and gastric banding groups, respectively. RESULTS Urine volume was low in both groups (less than 1.5 l daily). Urinary calcium excretion was lower (p = 0.001) in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (100 mg daily) vs the gastric banding group (191 mg daily). After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery 48% had a urinary oxalate of 45 mg daily or more compared to 25% after gastric banding. Urinary citrate was less than 370 mg daily for 14 subjects in the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 1 in the gastric banding group. All patients were taking calcium supplements. Dietary intake of high oxalate foods did not correlate with urinary oxalate excretion or with hyperoxaluria. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirms the risk of urinary stones following the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure as a result of hyperoxaluria, low urine volume and hypocitraturia. Those with gastric banding placement had low urine volumes. Future studies should elucidate the effect of nutrition and/or pharmacological therapy on stone risk of both surgeries as their incidence increases.","output":"Gastric band placement for obesity is not associated with increased urinary risk of urolithiasis compared to bypass."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Background: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases can provide insights into viral transmission and genetic diversity at a population level. However, less is known about the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including lockdowns, on circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages and variants of concern, the relative contribution of travel to re-emergence of pandemic waves within communities or how different lineages and variants contribute to disease severity. Methods: We have conducted an analysis within a prospective, multicentre observational study of individuals attending four hospitals in the South-East of Ireland with COVID-19. Samples underwent WGS from which lineages and variants were assigned, lineage frequency was plotted over time and phylogenetic analysis was employed to determine the origin of variants detected post-lockdown. Univariate and multivariate analyses assessed relationships between viral lineage/variant and COVID-19 disease severity. Results: We analysed 225 genome sequences across two SARS-CoV-2 waves, 134 (59.6%) from wave 1 (March to June) and 91 (40.4%) from wave 2 (July to December), representing 15.2% of COVID-19 admissions to these hospitals during the sampling periods. Four variants (B.1.1.162, B1.1.70, B.1.1.267 and B.1.1) comprised 68% of variants detected during wave 1. Of these variants, only a single B.1.1.70 sequence was detected in wave 2, while the B.1.177 lineage emerged and contributed to 82.3% of lineages detected. Phylogenetic analysis suggested multiple introductions of wave 2 variants from outside Ireland. We found no consistent association between SARS-CoV-2 lineages and disease severity. Conclusions: These data suggest elimination of common SARS-CoV-2 lineages from hospitalised cases associated with effective NPIs and that importation of new viral variants through travel was a significant contributor to the re-emergence of the pandemic in the second wave in Ireland.

Furthermore, we address the possibility of intergenerational impacts of COVID-19 on the brain, potentially via both maternal and paternal routes. Evidence from preclinical models of earlier coronaviruses has shown direct viral infiltration across the bloodCbrain barrier and indirect secondary effects due to other organ pathology and inflammation. In the most severely ill patients with pneumonia requiring intensive care, there appears to be additional severe inflammatory response and associated thrombophilia with widespread organ damage, including the brain. Maternal viral (and other) infections during pregnancy can affect the offspring, with greater incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Available reports suggest possible vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although longitudinal cohort studies of such offspring are needed. The impact of paternal infection on the offspring and intergenerational effects should also be considered.

JZ-1 also has preventive and therapeutic effects on Trichomonas vaginitis, Candida albicans vaginitis and GH in vitro and in vivo experiments. AIM OF STUDY: The effect and mechanism of JZ-1 on anti-herpes simplex virus type 2(HSV-2) in vitro focusing on adhesion and penetration stages were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model of HSV-2 infection of VK2/E6E7 was developed. In order to explore JZ-1's anti-HSV-2 effect in vitro, cell morphology, ultrastructural pathology, cell viability and expression of viral glycoprotein D (gD) were assessed at 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h of JZ-1 treatment. Then we measured the exact time required for adhesion and penetration of HSV-2 into VK2/E6E7 among a series of times at room temperature and under temperature control techniques. We treated VK2/E6E7 with JZ-1, penciclovir, or berberine and explored the mechanism of JZ-1 in blocking HSV-2 adhesion and penetration of host cells by assessing the cell ultrastructural pathology, viability, viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4 and host cell proteins HVEM, Nectin-1, and Nectin-2. RESULTS: HSV-2 can fully adhere and penetrate into VK/E6E7 within 5 mins at room temperature while it takes 60mins under temperature control techniques. JZ-1 and penciclovir showed significant anti-HSV-2 effects, with improved host cell morphologies and increased host cell viabilities observed after treatment for 24 h. The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 can be detected after treatment for 6 h while that of penciclovir was not obvious until treatment for 12 h. JZ-1 showed distinct effect on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration stages by significantly reducing the expression of viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4, improving cell morphology and increasing cell viability.

The physiological functions of SULT1C enzymes still remain to be fully understood. In this study, common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a promising primate animal model, was used to investigate the functional relevance of the SULT1C subfamily. Gene database search revealed three intact SULT1C genes and a pseudogene in its genome. These four genes were named SULT1C1, SULT1C2, SULT1C3P, and SULT1C5, according to the sequence homology and gene location. Since SULT1C5 is the orthologous gene for human SULT1C2P, we propose, here, to revisit the designation of human SULT1C2P to SULT1C5P. Purified recombinant SULT1C enzymes showed sulfating activities toward a variety of xenobiotic compounds and thyroid hormones. Kinetic analysis revealed high catalytic activities of SULT1C1 and SULT1C5 for 3,3'-T2. It appears therefore that SULT1C isoforms may play a role in the thyroid hormone metabolism in common marmoset.","output":"Molecular cloning and characterization of common marmoset SULT1C subfamily members that catalyze the sulfation of thyroid hormones."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS Nuclear grade has been recently validated as a powerful prognostic tool in epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma (E-MPM). In other studies histological parameters including pleomorphic features and growth patterns were also shown to exert prognostic impact. The primary aims of our study are (1) externally validate the prognostic role of pleomorphic features in E-MPM and (2) investigate if evaluating growth pattern in addition to 2-tier nuclear grade improves prognostication. METHODS AND RESULTS 614 consecutive cases of E-MPM from our institution over a period of 15 years were retrospectively reviewed, of which 51 showed pleomorphic features. E-MPM with pleomorphic features showed significantly worse overall survival compared those without (5.4 months vs 14.7 months). Tumours with predominantly micropapillary pattern showed the worst survival (6.2 months) followed by solid (10.5 months), microcystic (15.3 months), discohesive (16.1 months), trabecular (17.6 months) and tubulo-papillary (18.6 months). Sub-classification of growth patterns into high grade (solid, micropapillary) and low grade (all others) led to good separation of overall survival (10.5 months vs. 18.0 months) but did not predict survival independent of 2-tier nuclear grade. A composite score comprised of growth pattern and 2-tier nuclear grade did not improve prognostication compared with nuclear grade alone. Intra-tumoural heterogeneity in growth patterns is ubiquitous. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the incorporation of E-MPM with pleomorphic features in the epithelioid subtype as a highly aggressive variant distinct from 2-tier nuclear grade. E-MPM demonstrates extensive heterogeneity in growth pattern but its evaluation does not offer additional prognostic utility to 2-tier nuclear grade.","output":"Presence of pleomorphic features but not growth patterns improves prognostic stratification of epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma by 2-tier nuclear grade."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtual outcrop models are increasingly used in geoscience education to supplement field-based learning but their efficacy for teaching key 3D spatial thinking skills has been little tested. With the rapid increase in online digital learning resources and blended learning, most recently because of the global COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the role of virtual field environments in supporting and developing skills conventionally taught through field-based teaching has never been more critical. Here we show the efficacy of virtual outcrop models in improving 3D spatial thinking and provide evidence for positive perceptions amongst participants using virtual outcrops in teaching and learning. Our results show that, in a simple, multiple-choice scenario, participants were more likely to choose the 3D block diagram that best represents the structure when using a virtual outcrop (59 %) compared to more traditional representations, such as a geological map (50 %) or field photograph (40 %). We add depth to these results by capturing the perceptions of a cohort of students, within our full participant set, on the use of virtual outcrops for teaching and learning, after accessing a virtual field site and outcrops which they had previously visited during a day's field teaching. We also asked all participants if and how virtual outcrops could be used effectively for teaching and training, recording 87 % of positive responses. However, only 2 % of participants felt that virtual outcrops could potentially replace in-field teaching. We note that these positive findings signal significant potential for the effective use of virtual outcrops in a blended learning environment and for breaking barriers to increase the equality, diversity and inclusivity of geoscience field skills and teaching.","output":"A role for virtual outcrop models in blended learning C improved 3D thinking and positive perceptions of learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion has been indicated as a promising therapy in the treatment for other emerging viral infections However, the quality control of CP and individual variation in patients in different studies make it rather difficult to evaluate the efficacy and risk of CP therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) We aimed to explore the potential efficacy of CP therapy, and to assess the possible factors associated with its efficacy We enrolled eight critical or severe COVID-19 patients from four centers Each patient was transfused with 200-400 mL of CP from seven recovered donors The primary indicators for clinical efficacy assessment were the changes of clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters, and radiological image after CP transfusion CP donors had a wide range of antibody levels measured by serology tests which were to some degree correlated with the neutralizing antibody (NAb) level No adverse events were observed during and after CP transfusion Following CP transfusion, six out of eight patients showed improved oxygen support status;chest CT indicated varying degrees of absorption of pulmonary lesions in six patients within 8 days;the viral load was decreased to a negative level in five patients who had the previous viremia;other laboratory parameters also tended to improve, including increased lymphocyte counts, decreased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and indicators for liver function The clinical efficacy might be associated with CP transfusion time, transfused dose, and the NAb levels of CP This study indicated that CP might be a potential therapy for severe patients with COVID-19","output":"The efficacy assessment of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 patients: a multi-center case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is an exploratory cross-case analysis of political communication strategies of selected youth political organizations on the social network Facebook.

At first glance, this is a challenge, but seen from the standpoint of the process of consistency and upgrading of knowledge, skills and competencies in recent years, it can be defined as a systematic logical and consistent development. The modernization of higher (and not only higher) education requires a serious rethinking of the models, methods and content of the educational process.

In the current educational landscape, programs that meet these competencies are offered and attended in an ad hoc manner. During the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying switch to virtual learning, our team observed a surge in interest for our weekly non-sequential programs. In this study, we surveyed our learners to better understand motivators for attending these programs during the pandemic and to identify barriers for participating in such events before and during Work-From-Home. Our data indicate that conflict with research responsibilities, time spent to get to the event location, and planning time to attend are all significant barriers to engagement. Notably, feelings of being overwhelmed, which increased slightly during the pandemic, stood out as an identified barrier. Per our results, the virtual format was an attraction. While 58% of respondents would prefer to access professional development programs virtually in the future, almost 42% indicated a preference for in-person events when normalcy resumes as the physical presence of an instructor and of peers result in a deeper engagement. Our collective analysis here suggests that learners will benefit from a hybrid or combination of synchronous and asynchronous career and professional development programming in the future, even post-pandemic, to reduce identified barriers.

METHOD We conducted a prospective study in 2 gerontologic Covid Units in Paris, France, from March 14 th 2020 to May 7 th 2020. Patients with dementia hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 infection were systematically enrolled. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mortality at 21 days. RESULTS We included 125 patients. Median age was 86 (IQI 82-90);59.4% were female. Most common causes of dementia were Alzheimers disease, mixed dementia and vascular dementia. 67.2% had 2 comorbidities;40.2% lived in a long-term care facility. The most common symptoms at COVID-19 onset were confusion and delirium (82.4%), asthenia (76.8%) and fever (72.8%) before polypnea (51.2%) and desaturation (50.4%). Falls were frequent at the initial phase of the disease (35.2%). The fatality rate at 21 days was 22.4%. Chronic kidney disease and CRP at admission were independent factors of death. Persisting confusion, mood and behavioral disorders were observed in survivors (19.2%).

While much is known about the ineffective HBV-specific T-cell responses that characterise persistent HBV replication, B cells have been left largely understudied. However, an important role for humoral immunity during the natural history of HBV infections, as well as after functional cure, has been inadvertently revealed by the occurrence of HBV flares following B cell-depleting treatments. Herein, we review our current understanding of the role of the humoral immune response in chronic HBV, both at the level of HBV-specific antibody production and at the phenotypic and broader functional level of B cells. The recent development of fluorescently labelled HBV proteins has given us unprecedented insights into the phenotype and function of HBsAg- and HBcAg-specific B cells. This should fuel novel research into the mechanisms behind dysfunctional HBsAg-specific and fluctuating, possibly pathogenic, HBcAg-specific B-cell responses in chronic HBV. Finally, novel immunomodulatory treatments that partly target B cells are currently in clinical development, but a detailed assessment of their impact on HBV-specific B-cell responses is lacking. We plead for a rehabilitation of B-cell studies related to both the natural history of HBV and treatment development programmes.","output":"Humoral immunity in hepatitis B virus infection: Rehabilitating the B in HBV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, isoliquiritigenin (ISL) incorporated nanoliposomes were prepared and their effects on colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines were investigated. Herein, we sought to explore the anti-cancer mechanisms of ISL loaded nanoliposomes (ISL-NLs) on AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (AMPK/mTOR) pathways mediated glycolysis. Also, the key targets such as caveolin 1 (CAV1), glucose transporters and Akt/mTOR that promote glycolysis, and are activated via the induction of &#945;-enolase (ENO1), fructose bisphosphate aldolase A (ALDOA) and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) expressions were also investigated. It was shown that ISL-NLs significantly suppressed the proliferation and glucose uptake of CRC cell by potentially regulating the glycolysis and lactate targets as well as pathways that formed the basis of the anti-CRC effects of ISL-NLs. The mechanism underlying this effect was further validated via the regulation of some key targets such as ENO1, ALDOA, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and MCT4 in glycolysis coupled with cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-myc), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1&#945;) in protein kinase B/mTOR (Akt/mTOR) pathways. Moreover, the AMPK proteins were identified to be up-regulated while the lactic acid production was suppressed by ISL-NLs in the CRC cells, indicating that ISL-NLs had an inhibitory effect on AMPK mediated glycolysis and lactate production. Altogether, these results have provided insights into the mechanism underlying the key role that liposomal ISL played in the multiple inhibition of AMPK and Akt/mTOR mediated glycolysis and lactate generation, which may be regulated as the alternative metabolic pathways of CRC as well as serve as adjuvant therapy for the disease.","output":"The effects and mechanisms of isoliquiritigenin loaded nanoliposomes regulated AMPK/mTOR mediated glycolysis in colorectal cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive, behavioral and motor symptoms and has a more challenging clinical management and poorer prognosis compared to other forms of dementia. The experience of lockdown leads to negative psychological outcomes for fragile people such as elderly with dementia, particularly for DLB, causing a worsening of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Since an individuals feeling of time passage is strongly related to their cognitive and emotional state, it is conceivable to expect alterations of this construct in people with DLB during such a difficult period. We therefore assessed the subjective experience of the passage of time for present and past time intervals (Subjective Time Questionnaire, STQ) during the lockdown due to coronavirus disease (COVID?19) in 22 patients with DLB (17 of which were re-tested in a post-lockdown period) and compared their experience with that of 14 caregivers with similar age. Patients showed a significantly slower perception of present and past time spent under lockdown restrictions. We argue that these alterations might be related to the distinctive features of DLB and their exacerbation recorded by the patients caregivers during the period of lockdown, though our results show that the patients experience of time passage in a post-lockdown period remained similarly slow. Overall, we show an impairment of the subjective perception of time passage in DLB tested during the COVID-19 lockdown.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was (i) to test whether patients and HCWs thought that a novel patient isolation hood was safe and comfortable and (ii) to obtain COVID-19 infection data of hospital HCWs. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 20 patients, entailing HCW/patient questionnaires and safety aspects of prototype isolation hoods. COVID-19 data of HCWs were prospectively collected. Assessment of the hood's safety and practicality and adverse event reporting was carried out. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures are as follows: questionnaire responses, adverse event reporting, rates of infections in HCWs during the study period (20/6/2020 to 21/7/2020), and COVID-19 infections in HCWs reported until the last recorded diagnosis of COVID-19 in HCWs (20/6/2020 to 27/9/2020). RESULTS: Of the 64 eligible individual HCW surveys, 60 surveys were overall favourable (>75% questions answered in favour of the isolation hood). HCWs were unanimous in perceiving the hood as safe (60/60), preferring its use (56/56), and understanding its potential COVID-19 cross-contamination minimisation (60/60). All eight patients who completed the questionnaire thought the isolation hood helped prevent COVID-19 cross infection and was safe and comfortable. There were no reported patient safety adverse events. The COVID-19 attack rate from 20/6/2020 to 27/9/2020 among registered nurses was as follows: intensive care units (ICUs), 2.2% (3/138); geriatric wards, 13.2% (26/197); and COVID-19 wards, 18.3% (32/175). The COVID-19 attack rate among medical staff was as follows: junior staff, 2.1% (24/932); senior staff, 0.7% (4/607); aged care/rehabilitation, 6.7% (2/30); and all ICU medical staff, 8.6% (3/35). CONCLUSIONS: The isolation hood was preferred to standard care by HCWs and well tolerated by patients, and after the study, isolation hoods became part of standard ICU therapy.

Although all children lived in poverty-stricken households, 20% (157/796) of children did not live in a household in receipt of a cash grant and did not report food security; 32.4% (258/796) reported either component of social protection and, 47.9% (381/796) received both measures of social protection in combination. Compared to no social protection, being in receipt of either component of social protection was found to be significantly associated with being in the correct class for age, higher scores of non-verbal cognition, and higher working memory scores. Receiving both social protection measures in combination was found to be significantly associated with reduced educational risk scores, improved odds of being in the correct class for age, regular school attendance, missing less than a week of school in the previous two weeks, higher scores on measures of nonverbal cognition, higher working memory scores, and learning new things more easily. Educational and cognitive outcomes for children can be bolstered by social protection measures (cash grant receipt or food security). Benefits are enhanced when social protection is received in combination. Such findings support the notion of synergistic social protection responses for children living in environments impacted by high levels of HIV burden and deprivation.","output":"Food Should not be Forgotten: Impacts of Combined Cash Transfer Receipt and Food Security on Child Education and Cognition in South Africa and Malawi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination information is needed at individual and at population levels, as it is an important part of public health measures.

Children and adolescents were increasingly affected in the last waves of the pandemic. Notably, Brazil experienced one of the longest periods of school closures and reopening could have exposed students to high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is still unknown what the infection status of students and school workers was at the time of reopening schools in Brazilian cities. Methods: Here we evaluated viral carriage by RT-PCR and seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM and IgG) by immunochromatography in 2,259 individuals (1,139 students and 1120 school workers) from schools in 28 Brazilian cities. The study was performed from November 17 th to December 21 st , 2020, during public schools reopening, when classes were conducted in hybrid mode before the start of vaccination campaigns. Findings: Most students (n=421) and school workers (n=446) had active (qRT-PCR+ IgM- IgG- or qRT-PCR+ IgM+ IgG-/+) SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regression analysis indicated a strong association between the infection status of students and school workers. Furthermore, while 45% (n = 515) of the students and 37% (n = 415) of the school workers were neitherantigen nor antibody positive in laboratory tests, 16% of the participants (169 students and 193 school workers) were oligosymptomatic, including those reinfected, presenting mild symptoms such as headache, sore throat, and cough. Notably, most of the individuals were asymptomatic (83.9%) during schools reopening. Interpretation: These results indicate a high number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections during school reopening in multiple Brazilian cities. Considering the potential transmission risk of asymptomatic infections in educational settings, preventive (e.g., vaccination) measures will be essential to reduce viral transmission during school reopening in future pandemics.

The battle to make abortion illegal has been predicated on three nebulous assumptions about how abortion bans work. First, supporters believe banning abortion will deter it. Second, they hope bans will send a message about abortionspecifically, that abortion is immoral. And third, they expect bans to be competently implemented and enforced. Drawing on empirical work from within and outside of the U.S., this Article offers an evidence-based assessment of each of these assumptions. Part One examines the question of deterrence by exploring findings from countries with relatively high and relatively low abortion rates. After explaining why restrictive abortion laws alone do not reduce aggregate abortion rates, I consider the matter of individual deterrence. By identifying those most likely to be deterred by U.S. abortion bans, I illustrate how abortion bans intersect with structural inequalities to disproportionately impact poor women of color and their children. Part Two tests the idea that abortion bans send a message. I consider the bans meaning in context with U.S. laws and policies affecting families, exposing the difference between laws discouraging abortion, and those encouraging childbirth. Then, drawing from literature on the expressive function of the law, I assess the limits on the message-sending capacity of abortion bans in a society divided over abortion and over its commitment to children living in poverty. Part Three turns to the expectation that abortion bans will be competently enforced, noting the legitimacy struggles arising from law enforcement patterns, along with the administrative challenges inherent in overseeing the various exceptions to abortion bans. This article concludes by considering why the consequences and limitations of abortion bans should matter to supporters and opponents, alike.","output":"What will and wont happen when abortion is banned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Agricultural exports are an important source of economic profit for many countries. Accurate predictions of a countrys agricultural exports month on month are key to understanding a countrys domestic use and export figures and facilitate advance planning of export, import, and domestic use figures and the resulting necessary adjustments of production and marketing. This study proposes a novel method for predicting the rise and fall of agricultural exports, called agricultural exports time series-long short-term memory (AETS-LSTM). The method applies Jieba word segmentation and Word2Vec to train word vectors and uses TF-IDF and word cloud to learn news-related keywords and finally obtain keyword vectors. This research explores whether the purchasing managers index (PMI) of each industry can effectively use the AETS-LSTM model to predict the rise and fall of agricultural exports. Research results show that the inclusion of keyword vectors in the PMI values of the finance and insurance industries has a relative impact on the prediction of the rise and fall of agricultural exports, which can improve the prediction accuracy for the rise and fall of agricultural exports by 82.61%. The proposed method achieves improved prediction ability for the chemical/biological/medical, transportation equipment, wholesale, finance and insurance, food and textiles, basic materials, education/professional, science/technical, information/communications/broadcasting, transportation and storage, retail, and electrical and machinery equipment categories, while its performance for the electrical and optical categories shows improved prediction by combining keyword vectors, and its accuracy for the accommodation and food service, and construction and real estate industries remained unchanged.

There is a concerted effort within the global scientifi c community to identify (and thereby potentially mitigate) the possible modes of transmission through which the virus spreads throughout populations. OBJECTIVE Summarize the ways in which SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted and provide scientifi c support for the prevention and control of COVID-19. EVIDENCE AQUISITION We conducted an extensive literature search using electronic databases for scientifi c articles addressing SARSCoV-2 transmission published from December 28, 2019 through July 31, 2020. We retrieved 805 articles, but only 302 were included and discussed in this review. The report captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) viral survival, 2) transmission period and transmissibility, and 3) routes of viral spread. DEVELOPMENT Currently available evidence indicates that SARSCoV-2 seems to have variable stability in different environments and is very sensitive to oxidants, such as chlorine. Temperature and humidity are important factors infl uencing viral survival and transmission. SARSCoV-2 may be transmitted from person to person through several different routes. The basic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets, or via indirect contact. Aerosolized transmission is likely the dominant route for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in healthcare facilities. Although SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in non-respiratory specimens, including stool, blood and breast milk, their role in transmission remains uncertain. A complicating factor in disease control is viral transmission by asymptomatic individuals and through what would otherwise be understood as innocuous human activities.

It includes six dimensions: frequency of complaints, limitations in activities of daily living, work-related problems, social limitations, intensity of complaints and emotional complaints. The present study aimed to determine the psychometric properties including responsiveness and structural validity of the German version. METHODS: The analysis used data from participants of the LEA cohort study at University Hospital Augsburg. The PEmb-QoL was administered via postal surveys 3, 6 and 12 months post-PE. Internal consistency and testCretest reliability were evaluated by calculating Cronbachs alpha and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Standardized response means (SRM) were calculated for investigating responsiveness. For evaluating the fit of the factor structure, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted. RESULTS: Overall, we used data from 299 patients 3 months after PE. Cronbachs alpha (0.87C0.97) and ICC (0.53C0.90) were in an acceptable to good range. SRM scores showed good responsiveness of all dimensions. CFA revealed the four-factor model including one general factor to have a good model fit. CONCLUSION: Despite existing floor effect, most standard criteria of reliability and validity were met and indications for appropriateness of the PEmb-QoL summary score could be found. Apart from some restrictions concerning the factor structure and the dimension of social limitations, our results support the use of the PEmb-QoL questionnaire for evaluating PE-specific quality of life.

Patients who died and those who did not were compared statistically. We developed a predictive score using preprocedural variables that were statistically predictive of death in univariate regression analysis (P<0.1). RESULTS Of the 182 patients in the DEFUSE 3 study, 92 (mean age 69 years; 50% male) met our inclusion criteria, and 15.2% of these patients met the primary outcome. Patient age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, wake-up stroke, statin use, and history of diabetes were statistically associated with death. Statin use did not improve the prediction score so was excluded. Thus, our model included four predictors, with one point each given for age >75 years, NIHSS 20, wake-up stroke, and diabetes, yielding low (0-1), moderate (2), and high (3-4) risk of death.

This lead to the concept of substrate-induced subsite cooperativity as an initial attempt to explain the dual binding specificity of this enzyme in recognizing the cleavage sequences at its N- and C-termini, which are important processing steps in obtaining the mature protease. The presented hypothesis proposes that structural heterogeneity is a property of the enzyme, independent of the presence of a substrate or ligand. Indeed, the analysis of Mpro structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 reveals a conformational diversity for the catalytically competent state in ligand-free structures. Variation in the binding site appears to result from flexibility at residues lining the S1 subpocket and segments incorporating methionine 49 and glutamine 189. The structural evidence introduces \\"structure-based recognition\\" as a new paradigm in substrate proteolysis by Mpro. In this concept, the binding space in subpockets of the enzyme varies in a non-cooperative manner, causing distinct conformations, which recognize and process different cleavage sites, as the N- and C-termini. Insights into the recognition basis of the protease provide explanation to the ordered processing of cleavage sites. The hypothesis expands the conformational space of the enzyme and consequently opportunities for drug development and repurposing efforts.","output":"Protein structural heterogeneity: A hypothesis for the basis of proteolytic recognition by the main protease of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a searchable version of these abstracts, please visit www.acrabstracts.org.","output":"ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) [1C3]. Due to amino acid differences between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus to high titers in the nasal turbinates, lung and brain, with high lethality, and cytokine/chemokine production. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results in viral replication to lower titers limited to the nasal turbinates and lung, and no clinical signs of infection. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing vaccines and antivirals, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains.","output":"Comparison of transgenic and adenovirus hACE2 mouse models for SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This literature-based article utilizes ?siege? theory to describe the emotional pressures that families are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic Applying an understanding of siege theory, counselors can better assist families in responding to the uncertainties and duration of this concern To support families? struggles to make sense of this threat, narrative counseling can assist families to sort the confusing dominant narratives being presented and author a narrative that honors family coping, resilience, and determination Finally, the article offers ramifications for future research with families to begin to generate a model of coping in these uncertain times","output":"Siege Mentality in the 2020 Pandemic: Building Family Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biocidal functionalization in polyester fibers is a really tough challenge because of the lack of tethering groups This study indicated supercritical carbon dioxide application using N-halamine would be an alternative solution for obtaining antibacterial function on the polyester surface Firstly, N-(2-methyl-1-(4-methyl-2,5-dioxo-imidazolidin-4 yl)propan-2 yl)acrylamide was synthesized and applied to the polyester in supercritical carbon dioxide medium, at 120 C, 30 MPa for different processing times The addition of N-halamine on the surface significantly brought antibacterial activity against E coli The chlorine loadings showed that 6 -h exposure time was critical to obtain sufficient antibacterial activity This treatment caused a reasonable and tolerable loss in color and mechanical properties But, the durability to abrasion, stability, and rechargeability of oxidative chlorine, and the durability of N-halamine on the surface were remarkably good Conclusively, it can be available to work on polyester surfaces with resource-efficient and eco-friendly supercritical carbon dioxide technique for getting more functionalization and modification","output":"Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Application Using Hydantoin Acrylamide for Biocidal Functionalization of Polyester"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics have historically had a significant impact on economic inequality. However, official inequality statistics are only available at low frequency and with considerable delay, which challenges policymakers in their objective to mitigate inequality and fine-tune public policies. We show that using data from bank records it is possible to measure economic inequality at high frequency. The approach proposed in this paper allows measuring, timely and accurately, the impact on inequality of fast-unfolding crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying this approach to data from a representative sample of over three million residents of Spain we find that, absent government intervention, inequality would have increased by almost 30% in just one month. The granularity of the data allows analyzing with great detail the sources of the increases in inequality. In the Spanish case we find that it is primarily driven by job losses and wage cuts experienced by low-wage earners. Government support, in particular extended unemployment insurance and benefits for furloughed workers, were generally effective at mitigating the increase in inequality, though less so among young people and foreign-born workers. Therefore, our approach provides knowledge on the evolution of inequality at high frequency, the effectiveness of public policies in mitigating the increase of inequality and the subgroups of the population most affected by the changes in inequality.

The beneficial effects of C-Phycocyanin seem likely to be primarily attributable to its covalently attached chromophore Phycocyanobilin (PCB). Within cells, biliverdin is generated from free heme and it is subsequently reduced to bilirubin. Although bilirubin can function as an oxidant scavenger, its potent antioxidant activity reflects its ability to inactivate some isoforms of NADPH oxidase. Free bilirubin can also function as an agonist for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR); this may explain its ability to promote protective Treg activity in cellular and rodent models of inflammatory disease. AhR agonists also promote transcription of the gene coding for Nrf-2, and hence can up-regulate phase 2 induction of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1. Hence, it is proposed that C-Phycocyanin/PCB chiefly exert their protective effects via inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity, as well as by AhR agonism that both induces Treg activity and up-regulates phase 2 induction. This simple model may explain their potent antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, PCB might mimic biliverdin in activating anti-inflammatory signaling mediated by biliverdin reductase. This essay reviews recent research in which C-Phycocyanin and/or PCB, administered orally, parenterally, or intranasally, have achieved marked protective effects in rodent and cell culture models of Ischemic Stroke and Multiple Sclerosis, and suggests that these agents may likewise be protective for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and in COVID-19 and its neurological complications.","output":"C-Phycocyanin-derived Phycocyanobilin as a Potential Nutraceutical Approach for Major Neurodegenerative Disorders and COVID-19-induced Damage to the Nervous System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Introduction: The work presents a research project carried out in John Paul II Hospital in Cracow in Clinical Department of Cardiac and Vascular Diseases with the Intensive Cardiac Supervision Subdivision, with participation of 100 (50 F, 50 M) patients with congenital heart defects.

Augmented reality has also evolved as a ubiquitous, robust, and effective technology for providing innovative educational tools. In engineering education, many abstract concepts require technological intervention for conceptual understanding and better instructional content. While learning through the immersive tools, system usability has great importance in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Effectiveness refers to users' accuracy and completeness in achieving defined goals; efficiency relates to expended resources about the precision and completeness with which users achieve their objectives; satisfaction deals with a positive attitude towards using the product. If the system fails to provide good usability, it may cause adverse effects such as increasing stress, lacking necessary features, increasing the users' cognitive load, and negatively impacting the student's motivation. In this study, two mobile augmented reality (MAR) applications were developed as an instructional tool to teach the students about Karnaugh maps in the digital electronics course. The first application is a Keypad-based MAR application that uses a keypad matrix for user interaction and the second application is a Marker-based MAR application that uses multiple markers to solve K-Map for producing an optimum solution of the given problem. An experimental study was conducted to determine the student's opinion of the developed MAR applications. The study was designed to determine the system usability of the two MAR applications using the System Usability Score (SUS) and Handheld Augmented Reality Usability Score (HARUS) models. 90 engineering students participated in the study, and they were randomly divided into two different groups: keypad-based group and Marker-based group. The keypad-based group included 47 students who had hands-on experience with a keypad-based MAR application, whereas the marker-based group included 43 students who had hands-on experience with multiple marker-based MAR applications. The experimental outcomes indicated that the keypad-based MAR application has better SUS and HARUS scores than the marker-based MAR application which suggests that the keypad-based MAR application has provided better user interaction.","output":"Evaluating system usability of mobile augmented reality application for teaching Karnaugh-Maps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the winter months of 2020/2021 a wave of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged in Poland.

Using these two sub-panels, we tested how our program PredYmale reacts to mutability when considering basal branches and, moving down, terminal branches. We tested first the discrimination capacity of CombYplex on 996 human samples using various forensic and statistical parameters and showed that its resolution is sufficient to separate haplogroup classes. In parallel, PredYMaLe was designed and used to test whether a ML approach can predict haplogroup classes from Y-STR profiles. Applied to our kit, SVM and Random Forest classifiers perform very well (average 97 %), better than Neural Network (average 91 %) and Bayesian methods (< 90 %). We observe heterogeneity in haplogroup assignation accuracy among classes, with most haplogroups having high prediction scores (99-100 %) and two (E1b1b and G) having lower scores (67 %). The small sample sizes of these classes explain the high tendency to misclassify the Y-profiles of these haplogroups; results were measurably improved as soon as more training data were added. We provide evidence that our ML approach is a robust method to accurately predict haplogroups when it is combined with a sufficient number of markers, well-balanced mutation rate Y-STR panels, and large ML training sets. Further research on confounding factors (such as CNV-STR or gene conversion) and ideal STR panels in regard to the branches analysed can be developed to help classifiers further optimize prediction scores.","output":"Predicting haplogroups using a versatile machine learning program (PredYMaLe) on a new mutationally balanced 32 Y-STR multiplex (CombYplex): Unlocking the full potential of the human STR mutation rate spectrum to estimate forensic parameters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral discovery studies in bats have increased dramatically over the past decade, yet a rigorous synthesis of the published data is lacking.

This algorithm is based on the approaches proposed by the authors in several previous studies and allows unbiased estimates for the trend and seasonal components for data with a strong trend containing different periodic (including seasonal) variations, as well as observational gaps and omissions. The main idea of the algorithm is that both the trend and the seasonal components should be estimated using a signal that is maximally cleaned of any other variations, which are considered a noise. In estimating the trend component, seasonal variation is a noise, and vice versa. The iterative approach allows a priori information to be more completely used in the optimization of models of both trend and seasonal components. The approximation procedure provides maximum flexibility and is fully controllable at all stages of the process. In addition, it allows one to naturally solve the problems in the case of missing observations and defective measurements without filling these dates with artificially simulated values. The algorithm was tested using data on changes in the concentration of CO(2) in the atmosphere at four stations belonging to different latitudinal zones. The choice of these data is explained by the features that complicate the use of other methods, namely, high interannual variability, high-amplitude seasonal variations, and gaps in the series of observed data. This algorithm made it possible to obtain trend estimates (which are of particular importance for studying the characteristics and searching for the causes of global warming) for any time interval, including those that are not multiples of an integer number of years. The rate of increase in the CO(2) content in the atmosphere has also been analyzed. It has been reliably established that in around 2016, the rate of CO(2) accumulation in the atmosphere became stabilized and even tended to decrease.

OBJECTIVE: To follow TIME participant clinical outcomes for 24 months PARTICIPANTS: Low-income Latino(a)s with type 2 diabetes DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: We collected post-intervention clinical data for five cohorts (n = 101, mean n = 20/cohort) who participated in TIME programs from 2018 to 2020 in Houston, Texas. MAIN MEASURES: We gathered HbA1c (primary outcome), weight, body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure data at baseline, 6 months (intervention end), and semiannually thereafter until 24 months after baseline to assess sustainability. We also evaluated participant loss to follow-up until 24 months. KEY RESULTS: Participants decreased HbA1c levels during the intervention (p < 0.0001) and maintained these improvements at each timepoint from baseline to 24 months (p range: < 0.0001 to 0.015). Participants reduced blood pressure levels during TIME and maintained these changes at each timepoint from baseline until 18 months (systolic p range < 0.0001 to 0.0005, diastolic p range: < 0.0001 to 0.008) but not at 24 months (systolic: p = 0.065; diastolic: p = 0.85). There were no significant weight changes during TIME or post-intervention: weight (p range = 0.07 to 0.77), BMI (p range = 0.11 to 0.71). Attrition rates (loss to follow-up during the post-intervention period) were 5.9% (6 months), 24.8% (12 months), 35.6% (18 months), and 41.8% (24 months). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible for vulnerable populations to maintain long-term glycemic and blood pressure improvements using a multiple dimensional intervention.

Firstly, other non-SARS-CoV-2 viral respiratory infections have also been reported to be associated with thrombotic events, be it arterial or venous. Thus, we aimed to compare the thrombotic rates between these two groups of patients directly to hopefully ascertain the actual thrombotic tendency in COVID-19 infections. Secondly, global hemostatic assays such as thromboelastogram and clot waveform analysis (CWA) have been used to demonstrate hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients, albeit in a small group of patients and only in the critically ill. Incorporating these laboratory results into the management of thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 is an attractive notion but more data and studies are definitely needed. Here, we evaluate the dynamic changes of hemostatic assays in patients with COVID-19 to better understand the overall coagulation profiles of COVID-19 infection. Methods We performed a single center, retrospective cohort study. All consecutive patients admitted to our hospital between 15 January and 10 April 2020 that were tested positive for COVID-19 or other non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses were included in our study. The main coagulation assays studied were prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and its associated CWA, min1, min2 and max2. Findings We included a total of 181 COVID-19 patients and 165 patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral infections. The respiratory viruses were rhinovirus (n=65), influenza A and B (n=46), adenovirus (n=13), human coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43 (n=15), human enterovirus (n=3), metapneumovirus (n=6), parainfluenza virus 1 to 4 (n=11), respiratory syncytial virus (n=6) and human bocavirus 1 to 4 (n=0). The median age of COVID-19 patients was 37 (interquartile range [IQR], 30.5-51 years) versus 35 (IQR, 29-51.5) in the non-SAR-CoV-2 respiratory viruses group (P=0.12). Comorbidities, assessed by Charlson score, was also not statistically different between both groups (median score 0 (IQR, 0-1) in both groups, P=0.39). Majority of our patients had relatively mild infection as reflected by the low proportions of them requiring oxygen supplementation (11.0% in COVID-19 vs 4.8% in non-SARS-COV-2, P=0.035). COVID-19 patients had longer hospital stay (7 days (IQR, 5.5-13) vs 3 days (IQR, 2-3), P<0.001) and more required ICU support (5.0% vs 1.2%, P=0.04). Mortality rate was low in both groups. We reported two (1.0 event/1000-hospital-days) and one (1.8 event/1000-hospital-day) thrombotic events amongst COVID-19 group and non-SARS-COV-2 group respectively (P=0.63). All were myocardial infarction and occurred in intensive care unit. No venous thrombotic event was noted. There was no significant difference in all the coagulation parameters throughout the course of mild COVID-19 infection (Table 1). However, CWA parameters were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 infection compared with mild disease (min1: 6.48%/s vs 5.05%/s, P<0.001; min2: 0.92%/s2 vs 0.74%/s2, P=0.033), suggesting hypercoagulability in severe COVID-19 infection (Table 2 and Figure 1). We also observed that critically ill COVID-19 patients had higher absolute CWA parameters as compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 patients, albeit in small number of patients (Table 3). Conclusion The thrombotic rates were low in both groups and did not differ significantly between COVID-19 and Non-SARS-CoV-2 patients. Nonetheless, our analysis of hemostatic parameters demonstrated hypercoagulability in COVID-19 as a dynamic process with the risk highest when the patients are critically ill. These changes in hemostasis could be detected by CWA. With our findings, we suggest that a more individualized thromboprophylaxis approach, considering clinical and laboratory factors, is probably preferred over universal pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients and warrants further research.

This study presents the use of machine learning techniques for projecting COVID-19 infections and deaths in Mexico. The research has three main objectives: first, to identify which function adjusts the best to the infected population growth in Mexico; second, to determine the feature importance of climate and mobility; third, to compare the results of a traditional time series statistical model with a modern approach in machine learning. The motivation for this work is to support health care providers in their preparation and planning. The methods compared are linear, polynomial, and generalized logistic regression models to describe the growth of COVID-19 incidents in Mexico. Additionally, machine learning and time series techniques are used to identify feature importance and perform forecasting for daily cases and fatalities. The study uses the publicly available data sets from the John Hopkins University of Medicine in conjunction with the mobility rates obtained from Googles Mobility Reports and climate variables acquired from the Weather Online API. The results suggest that the logistic growth model fits best the pandemics behavior, that there is enough correlation of climate and mobility variables with the disease numbers, and that the Long short-term memory network can be exploited for predicting daily cases. Given this, we propose a model to predict daily cases and fatalities for SARS-CoV-2 using time series data, mobility, and weather variables.","output":"Data Analysis and Forecasting of the COVID-19 Spread: A Comparison of Recurrent Neural Networks and Time Series Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants potentially influence the effectiveness of existing laboratory diagnostics.

Data is available on psychological stress in caregivers during pandemics. To date, there are no known studies regarding the impact of leadership on nursing and midwifery practice. Aim: Evaluation of leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic at a Swiss University Hospital. Methods: The approach to this study was based on action research. The authors defined quality indicators and values of excellence on the impact of leadership. In May 2020 140 nurses and midwives of different departments were interviewed using one-time questionnaires. The quantitative data was analyzed descriptively and the open questions evaluated by thematic analysis. Results: The results showed that through the combination of different nterventions, a mostly positive working situation could be created for the interviewees. Uncertainty existed about the safety measures. The interviewees were highly stressed by their own private situations, the frequent changes in guidelines and the flood of information. However, the staff felt well supported by the leadership teams. Improvements were described in teamwork and decision-making. Conclusions: The results indicate an impact on leadership and demonstrate as well the need for adequate support.

A centre-based format is a known barrier, suggesting that home-based programmes might improve accessibility. The aim of SCOT: Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF) is to assess the implementation of the REACH-HF home-based CR intervention in the context of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland.This paper presents the design and protocol for this observational implementation study. Specific objectives of SCOT:REACH-HF are to: (1) assess service-level facilitators and barriers to the implementation of REACH-HF; (2) compare real-world patient and caregiver outcomes to those seen in a prior clinical trial; and (3) estimate the economic (health and social) impact of implementing REACH-HF in Scotland. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The REACH-HF intervention will be delivered in partnership with four 'Beacon sites' across six NHS Scotland Health Boards, covering rural and urban areas. Health professionals from each site will be trained to facilitate delivery of the 12-week programme to 140 people with heart failure and their caregivers. Patient and caregiver outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 4-month follow-up. Assessments include the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), five-dimension EuroQol 5L, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Caregiver Burden Questionnaire. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with up to 20 health professionals involved in programme delivery (eg, cardiac nurses, physiotherapists). 65 facilitator-patient consultations will be audio recorded and assessed for fidelity. Integrative analysis will address key research questions on fidelity, context and CR participant-related outcomes. The SCOT:REACH-HF findings will inform the future potential roll-out of REACH-HF in Scotland. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been given ethical approval by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (reference 20/WS/0038, approved 25 March 2020). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The study is listed on the ISRCTN registry with study ID ISRCTN53784122. The research team will ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with both General Data Protection Regulations and the University of Glasgow's Research Governance Framework. Findings will be reported to the funder and shared with Beacon Sites, to facilitate service evaluation, planning and good practice. To broaden interest in, and understanding of REACH-HF, we will seek to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals and present at stakeholder events, national and international conferences.","output":"Protocol for an implementation study of an evidence-based home cardiac rehabilitation programme for people with heart failure and their caregivers in Scotland (SCOT:REACH-HF)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate effectiveness of prevention and control strategies for COVID-19 in Ningbo by using an epidemic dynamic model","output":"[Epidemic dynamic model based evaluation of effectiveness of prevention and control strategies for COVID-19 in Ningbo]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent decades, high-performance computing (HPC) technologies and supercomputers in China have significantly advanced, resulting in remarkable achievements.

The population's susceptibility to these highly pathogenic coronaviruses has contributed to large outbreaks, evolved into public health events, and rapidly transmitted globally. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies and vaccines against this disease. In the primary stage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) infection, the signs and symptoms are nonspecific, and many more cases have been observed than initially expected.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS), released by activated neutrophils during a process called NETosis, can be formed in the lungs upon infection with respiratory viruses. They have the ability to promote lung damage, thrombosis and fibrosis, three cardinal features encountered in severe Covid-19. In a recent study, we sought to understand how NETosis could relate to lung immunopathological changes associated with fatal cases of the disease. We assessed whether NET structures could be identified in post-mortem lung biopsies from Covid-19 patients, and whether they were located in particular lesions and micro-anatomical lung compartments. We performed immunofluorescence staining of myeloperoxi-dase, citrullinated histone H3 and nuclear acid (DAPI) on sections of paraffin-embedded lung biopsies from four Covid-19 patients who succumbed Covid-19 and from four patients who died from a Covid-19-unrelated cause. The four patients represented prototypical severe and fatal cases of Covid-19, characterized by pneumonia and fatal respiratory distress associated with signs of systemic inflammation, neutrophilia and coagulopathy. NETs were uniquely detected in the lungs of each Covid-19 patient. Detailed histopathological analysis revealed widely distributed NET-infiltrating areas encompassing several lung compartments, including arteriolar microthrombi, neutrophil-rich inflammatory areas of lung interstitium as well as alveoli or bronchioles where they often co-localized with occluding fibrin-rich deposits. Another study published simultaneously to ours provides first experimental evidence for causality between NETosis and lung injury in severe Covid-19. However, the possible involvement of NETs in thrombogenesis remains to be addressed. Notwithstanding, these data support the hypothesis that NETs may represent drivers of Covid-19-associated severe pulmonary complications, and suggest that NET-targeting approaches could represent potential avenues for the treatment of uncontrolled tissue-damaging, thrombotic or fibrotic responses to Sars-Cov-2.","output":"Neutrophil extracellulor trops: key drivers of severe Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fifty-four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) were characterized according to protein specificity, immunoglobulin subclass, virus neutralization, reactivity with different coronaviruses, and ability to induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection in vitro. The MAbs were found to be specific for one of three structural proteins of FIPV. A total of 47 MAbs were specific for the 205-kDa spike protein (S), 3 MAbs were specific for the 45-kDa nucleocapsid protein (N), and 4 MAbs were specific for the 26- to 28-kDa membrane protein (M). The S-specific MAbs showed various degrees of cross-reactivity with strains of FIPV, feline enteric coronavirus, canine coronavirus, and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Nineteen S-specific MAbs neutralized FIPV. A total of 15 of the neutralizing MAbs induced ADE, and all but 1 were of the immunoglobulin G2a subclass. The remaining four neutralizing MAbs that did not induce ADE were of the immunoglobulin G1 subclass. Two S-specific MAbs induced ADE but were nonneutralizing. None of the N- or M-specific MAbs was neutralizing or induced ADE. On the basis of the reactivity patterns of the MAbs with FIPV and related coronaviruses, it was concluded that there is a minimum of five neutralizing sites on S. In most instances, neutralizing MAbs were able to induce ADE, demonstrating a direct relationship between neutralization and enhancement. The difference in immunoglobulin subclass between neutralizing MAbs that induced ADE and those that did not induce ADE suggests that there may be a restriction in the immunoglobulin subclasses capable of mediating ADE.","output":"Monoclonal antibody analysis of neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement of feline infectious peritonitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To perform a systematic analysis of articles on the ophthalmological implications of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Moreover, official recommendations of ophthalmological societies were systematically reviewed, with a focus on the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth). RESULTS: As of April 16, 2020, in total, 21 peer-reviewed articles on the ophthalmological aspects of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 12 (57.1%) were from Asia, 6 (28.6%) from the United States of America, and 3 (14.3%) from Europe.

METHODS: PPE samples were collected from the coveralls of physicians exiting a room after the management of a patient with severe-to-critical COVID-19 within 14 days after the patients symptom onset. The surface of coveralls was categorized into coverall-only parts (frontal surface of the head, anterior neck, dorsal surface of the foot cover, and back and hip) and gown-covered parts (the anterior side of the forearm and the abdomen). Sampling of the high-contact surfaces in the patients environment was performed. We attempted to identify significant differences in contamination with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between the coverall-only and gown-covered parts. RESULTS: A total of 105 swabs from PPEs and 28 swabs from patient rooms were collected. Of the PPE swabs, only three (2.8%) swabs from the gown-covered parts were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS A systematic review with network meta-analysis, surface under the cumulative ranking analysis and stochastic multicriteria acceptability analyses were performed. Searches were conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science without limits for time-frame or language. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy or safety of any PDE5i compared to a placebo or to other PDE5i in males with erectile disfunction were included. RESULTS Overall, 184 articles representing 179 randomized controlled trials (50,620 patients) were included. All PDE5i were significantly more efficient than placebo. Sildenafil 25 mg was statistically superior to all interventions in enhancing IIEF (with a 98% probability of being the most effective treatment), followed by sildenafil 50 mg (80% of probability). Taladafil 10 mg and 20 mg also presented good profiles (73% and 76%, respectively). Avanafil and lodenafil were less effective interventions. Mirodenafil 150 mg was the treatment that caused more adverse events, especially flushing and headaches. Sildenafil 100 mg was more related to visual disorders, while vardenafil and udenafil were more prone to cause nasal congestion.

Unlike SARS-CoV, the cause of SARS, several SARS-CoV-2 spike glycans contain sialic acid residues. In contrast to the SARS secreted glycoprotein (SGP), SARS-CoV-2 SGP are thus potential ligands for Sialic acid-binding Siglecs on host immune cells, known to regulate immune function. Such SARS-CoV-2 glycoproteins would contribute to immune deviation. CD33-related Siglecs are important immune regulators. Siglec-5 and -14 are paired receptors with opposed actions on the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is critical in early viral clearance. SGP binding in persons of Siglec-14 null genotype (30-70% in Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) persons, 10% in North Europeans) would induce unopposed inhibitory signalling, causing viral persistence through inflammasome inhibition. Siglec-3 (CD33) and Siglec-5 are expressed on CD33 myeloid derived suppressor cells (CD33 MDSC). Immunosuppressive CD33 MDSC populations are increased in all groups at risk of severe Covid-19 infection. CD33 expression is increased in persons with the CD33 rs3865444 CC allele, associated with Alzheimers disease, who would thus show enhanced susceptibility. Viral SGP ligation of CD33, potentially in conjunction with Siglec-5, would promote expansion of CD33 MDSC cells, as occurs in cancers but at much greater scale. CD33 is expressed on CNS microglia, potentially activated by SGP penetration through the porous cribriform plate to cause anosmia. Genotyping of severe or fatal Covid-19 cases can confirm or refute this pathophysiological mechanism. Early data have confirmed extremely high-level increase of CD33 MDSC numbers in severe Covid-19 infection, consistent with the proposed mechanism.","output":"Common determinants of severe Covid-19 infection are explicable by SARS-CoV-2 secreted glycoprotein interaction with the CD33-related Siglecs, Siglec-3 and Siglec-5/14"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Knowing the age-specific rates at which individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe and critical disease is essential for designing public policy, for infectious disease modeling, and for individual risk evaluation.

METHODS: This prospective, multicenter survey consisted in the administration of a self-questionnaire to patients during a pulmonology consultation. The 1025 questionnaires distributed collected demographics, socio-professional and basic health literacy characteristics. Patients were asked to rank their level of trust for pharmaceutical companies and indicate their willingness to participate in different categories of research (pre or post marketing, sponsored by an academic institution or pharmaceutical company). Logistic regression was used to determine factors contributing to \\"trust\\" versus \\"distrust\\" group membership and willingness to participate in each category of research. RESULTS: One thousand patients completed the survey, corresponding to a response rate of 97.5%.

Methods: We included 46 death cases from intensive care unit and 68 discharged cases from ordinary units with confirmed COVID-19 of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital from January 1 to March 22, 2020. Laboratory and radiologic data were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were followed up until April 10, 2020. Results: COVID-19 patients in the death group had significantly higher CEA levels (ng/ml) than discharged group (14.80  14.20 vs. 3.80  2.43, P < 0.001). The risk of COVID-19 death increased 1.317 times for each additional 1 ng/ml CEA level (OR = 1.317, 95% CI: 1.099C1.579). The standardized and weighted receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis adjusted to age, sex, and ferritin levels suggested that the area under the curve (AUC) of the serum CEA levels was 0.808 in discrimination between death cases and discharged cases with COVID-19 (P < 0.001). We found mortality of COVID-19 is associated with elevated CEA levels increased (HR = 1.023, 95% CI: 1.005C1.042), as well as age (HR = 1.050, 95% CI: 1.016C1.086) and ferritin levels (HR = 1.001, 95% CI: 1.001C1.002) by survival analysis of Cox regression model. Among discharged patients, CEA levels were significant lower in moderate cases compared to the severe and critical cases (P = 0.005; OR = 0.488, 95% CI: 0.294C0.808) from binary logistic regression analysis.

In the following manuscript we simulated different scenarios using defined mathematical models to estimate the burden of intensive care treatment by COVID-19 patients within certain limits during the coming autumn. METHODS: The simulation of the scenarios uses a stationary model supplemented by the effect of vaccinations. The age group-specific risk profile for intensive care unit (ICU)-associated disease progression is calculated using third wave ICU admission data from sentinel hospitals, local DIVI registry occupancy data and the corresponding local incidence rates by linear regression with time lag. We simulated vaccination rates of 15% for the over 18-year-old cohort, 70% for the 15C34 year cohort, 75%/80%/85% for the 35C59 year cohort and 85%/90%/95% for the over 60-year-old cohort. The simulations take into account that vaccination provides 100% protection against disease progression requiring intensive care. Regarding protection against infection in vaccinated persons the simulations are depicted for the scenario of 70% protection against infection in vaccinated persons and for the scenario of 85% protection against infection in vaccinated persons. RESULTS: The incidence is proportional to ICU bed occupancy. The proportionality factor is higher than in the second and third waves, so that comparable ICU bed occupancy is only achieved at a higher incidence. A 10% increase in vaccination rates of the over 35-year-olds to 85% and of the over 60-year-olds to 95% leads to a significant reduction in ICU bed occupancy. DISCUSSION: There will continue to be a close and linear relationship between SARS-CoV?2 incidence and ICU bed occupancy in the coming months. Even above incidences of 200/100,000 a considerable burden of ICUs with more than 3000 COVID-19 patients can be expected again, unless the vaccination rate is significantly increased. A few percentage points in the vaccination rate have a significant impact on potential ICU occupancy in the autumn, so efforts to increase vaccination acceptance should be a priority in the coming weeks. For intensive care medicine, the vaccination rate of those over 35 years of age is crucial.","output":"Intensivbettenbedarf fr COVID?19 im Herbst/Winter 2021: Simulation unterschiedlicher Szenarien unter Bercksichtigung von Inzidenzen und Impfquoten"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A key step to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the attachment of its Spike receptor-binding domain (S RBD) to the host receptor ACE2.

Specifically we highlight the Nuremberg Code's requirements of 'fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods', and proportionality of risk and humanitarian benefit, as broad ethical principles that recur in later documents on research ethics and should also apply to certain types of research not involving human subjects. We address several potential objections to this view, and conclude with recommendations for bringing these ethical considerations into policy development.","output":"The ethics of biosafety considerations in gain-of-function research resulting in the creation of potential pandemic pathogens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibody-based therapeutics have become a major class of therapeutics with over 120 recombinant antibodies approved or under review in the EU or US. This therapeutic class has experienced a remarkable expansion with an expected acceleration in 2021C2022 due to the extraordinary global response to SARS-CoV2 pandemic and the public disclosure of over a hundred anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies. Mainly delivered intravenously, alternative delivery routes have emerged to improve antibody therapeutic index and patient comfort. A major hurdle for antibody delivery and efficacy as well as the development of alternative administration routes, is to understand the different natural and pathological barriers that antibodies face as soon as they enter the body up to the moment they bind to their target antigen. In this review, we discuss the well-known and more under-investigated extracellular and cellular barriers faced by antibodies. We also discuss some of the strategies developed in the recent years to overcome these barriers and increase antibody delivery to its site of action. A better understanding of the biological barriers that antibodies have to face will allow the optimization of antibody delivery near its target. This opens the way to the development of improved therapy with less systemic side effects and increased patients adherence to the treatment.","output":"Therapeutic antibodies C natural and pathological barriers and strategies to overcome them"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oral health reflects the general health, and it is fundamental to well-being and quality of life. An infection in the oral cavity can be associated with serious complications in human health. Local therapy of these infections offers many advantages over systemic drug administration, targeting directly to the diseased area while minimizing systemic side effects. Specialized drug delivery systems into the oral cavity have to be designed in such a fashion that they resist to the aqueous environment that is constantly bathed in saliva and subject to mechanical forces. Additionally, a prolonged release of drug should also be provided, which would enhance the efficacy and also decrease the repeated dosing. This review is aimed to summarize the current most relevant findings related to local drug delivery of various drug groups for prevention and treatment of infections (viral, bacterial, fungal) and infection-related manifestations in the oral cavity. Current therapeutic challenges in regard to effective local drug delivery systems will be discussed, and the recent approaches to overcome these obstacles will be reviewed. Finally, future prospects will be overviewed to promote novel strategies that can be implemented in clinical management for prevention and treatment of oral infections.

STARS training aims to address knowledge, attitudes and capabilities that influence intervention behavior/skills. This study aimed to examine associations between clinician characteristics and pre-training competencies in suicide risk assessment (SRA), as well as the impact of STARS training workshop on clinician competencies; and to determine the predictors of SRA training outcomes. METHOD: Australian mental health professionals working with suicidal persons who undertook the STARS 2-day face-to-face workshop between 2018 and 2020 completed an online survey at pre- and post-training. Of the 222 participants who completed the pre-training questionnaire, 144 (64.9%) also completed the post-training questionnaire. Participants were mostly female (75.7%), had completed a university degree (86.4%), had <10 years of experience in suicide prevention (71.7%), and were allied and mental health professionals (78.1%). We used linear mixed-effects regression for statistical analyses. RESULTS: STARS participants who reported higher perceived capability at baseline had significantly greater formal and informal training, more years of experience in suicide prevention, and were more likely to have experienced client suicide and/or suicide attempt and to report fewer SRA related fears. We found overall significant positive impacts of STARS training on clinician competencies (attitudes, perceived capability, declarative knowledge) from pre- to post-training. The most distinct changes following STARS training were for perceived capability and declarative knowledge. Participants who had more positive attitudes after training were significantly more likely to have had less prior supervision/mentoring. Reluctance to intervene was not found to significantly change after training. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that attitudes, perceived capability and declarative knowledge changed positively from pre- to post-STARS training among mental health professionals. Underpinned by the minimum standardized SRA competencies, STARS training may be critical for informing evidence-based knowledge and skills in SRA and safety planning.","output":"Impact of Systematic Tailored Assessment for Responding to Suicidality (STARS) Protocol Training on Mental Health Professionals' Attitudes, Perceived Capabilities, Knowledge, and Reluctance to Intervene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blight is a concept not commonly discussed. However, blight is a problem that exists in the lives of many people, especially if they reside in urban areas. Blight originates whenever properties are neglected, contributing to both a functional and social depreciation process and ultimately leading to uninhabitable dwellings. Despite being blighted, these properties and surrounding neighborhoods often are occupied by families who fail to have sufficient income to afford residences that meet minimum standards or to live in neighborhoods free from drug trafficking and prostitution or other forms of crime. Blight may spread rapidly, thus, experts must, in a timely manner, analyze its causes, which are essential to preventing and mitigating blight problems. The purpose of this study is to seek an understanding of blight and identify its causal factors. The generic methods commonly applied in previous blight research present limitations that this study aims to overcome by using cognitive mapping and the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique. This dual methodology provides a more transparent and less restrictive approach for analyzing and complying with the dynamics of cause-and-effect relationships among variables. Group debate involving a panel of specialists in this field identified six causation clusters based on the experts experience and knowledge.

One fundamental question is whether the induction of TI generates a homogeneous or heterogeneous population of trained cells. In this issue of the JCI, Zhang, Moorlag, and colleagues tackle this question by combining an in vitro model system of TI with single-cell RNA sequencing. The induction of TI in human monocytes resulted in three populations with distinct transcriptomic profiles. Interestingly, the presence of lymphocytes in the microenvironment of monocytes substantially impacted TI. The authors also identified a similar population of monocytes in various human diseases or in individuals vaccinated with bacillus Calmette-Gurin. These insights warrant in-depth analysis of TI in responsive versus nonresponsive immune cells and suggest that modulating TI may provide a strategy for treating infections and inflammatory diseases.","output":"Training cant always lead to Olympic macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Young people are considered at lower risk from coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). However, measures to limit the population health impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic have caused significant disruptions to their lives. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of young people predominantly living in the south-west of England during the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Rapid qualitative study. METHODS: Following advertisement on social media, a purposive sample of young people by age and gender who had expressed an interest were invited to participate. In June 2020, 21 young people (12C17 years) took part in 18 semi-structured interviews, either through a digital platform or by telephone. Interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was undertaken, assisted by NVvivo Software. RESULTS: Young people felt the greatest impacts of the pandemic have been disruption to how they learned because of school closures and limited face-to-face interaction with their social networks. There was variation in terms of how satisfied young people were with self-directed learning at home, and some anxieties in relation to its effectiveness outside the school environment. Most young people reported maintaining social relationships remotely, but some young people appeared to have little social interaction outside their household. High levels of adherence to social distancing and handwashing were reported, which could lead to a sense of injustice resulting from visibility of other people breaching social distancing guidance. Young people were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine became available, with the greatest motivator being to protect others above themselves. CONCLUSIONS: Young people have experienced significant disruption to their education and social networks during the COVID-19 pandemic. During lockdown, high levels of compliance to government public health guidelines to reduce transmission of COVID-19 were reported by young people. If an effective vaccine is developed, a schools-based vaccination programme could be an efficient method to interrupt transmission to more at-risk populations and prevent further disruptions to young people's education.","output":"Experiences of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic from the perspectives of young people: Rapid qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the unimaginable influence of Covid-19 and the essential of capital asset pricing in the market, this article analyzes the TV industry of the US stock market before and during the epidemic based on the Fama-French five-factor model.

Introduction: The primary objective is to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the triggers of psychopathology and on the delusional content of patients with psychotic symptoms treated during the first three months of the pandemic in a tertiary hospital in Madrid. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational and retrospective study of all patients attending the psychiatric emergency room (ER) between 11th March and 11th June 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were included. The chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test were performed to compare categorical variables. The level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results: In the first month of the pandemic, COVID-19 conditioned the delirious content of 38.5% of the admitted patients and acted as a direct trigger for 46.2% of consultations. In the second week it affected 100.0% of the patients in both cases.

However, owing to the soft inorganic lattice of these materials, the intense emission is barely retained under ambient conditions, thus largely limiting their practical applications in optoelectronics at atmospheric pressure. Here, remarkably enhanced emission in microtubules of the 0D hybrid halide (C5 H7 N2 )2 ZnBr4 ((4AMP)2 ZnBr4 ) is successfully achieved by means of pressure treatment at room temperature. Notably, the emission, which is over ten times more intense than the emission in the initial state, is retained under ambient conditions upon the complete release of pressure. Furthermore, the pressure processing enables the tuning of \\"sky blue light\\" before compression to \\"cool daylight\\" with a remarkable quantum yield of 88.52% after decompression, which is of considerable interest for applications in next-generation lighting and displays. The irreversible electronic structural transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules [4AMP], is highly responsible for the eventual retention of PIE and tuning of the color temperature. The findings represent a significant step toward the capture of PIE under ambient conditions, thus facilitating its potential solid-state lighting applications.","output":"Harvesting Cool Daylight in Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Halides Microtubules through the Reservation of Pressure-Induced Emission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recognising that the causes of over half the worlds deaths pass unrecorded, the World Health Organization (WHO) leads development of Verbal Autopsy (VA): a method to understand causes of death in otherwise unregistered populations. Recently, VA has been developed for use outside research environments, supporting countries and communities to recognise and act on their own health priorities. We developed the Circumstances of Mortality Categories (COMCATs) system within VA to provide complementary circumstantial categorisations of deaths. OBJECTIVES: Refine the COMCAT system to (a) support large-scale population assessment and (b) inform public health decision-making. METHODS: We analysed VA data for 7,980 deaths from two South African Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) from 2012 to 2019: the Agincourt HDSS in Mpumalanga and the Africa Health Research Institute HDSS in KwaZulu-Natal. We assessed the COMCAT systems reliability (consistency over time and similar conditions), validity (the extent to which COMCATs capture a sufficient range of key circumstances and events at and around time of death) and relevance (for public health decision-making). RESULTS: Plausible results were reliably produced, with emergencies, recognition, accessing care and perceived quality characterising the majority of avoidable deaths. We identified gaps and developed an additional COMCAT referral, which accounted for a significant proportion of deaths in sub-group analysis. To support decision-making, data that establish an impetus for action, that can be operationalised into interventions and that capture deaths outside facilities are important. CONCLUSIONS: COMCAT is a pragmatic, scalable approach enhancing functionality of VA providing basic information, not available from other sources, on care seeking and utilisation at and around time of death. Continued development with stakeholders in health systems, civil registration, community and research environments will further strengthen the tool to capture social and health systems drivers of avoidable deaths and promote use in practice settings.","output":"Refining circumstances of mortality categories (COMCAT): a verbal autopsy model connecting circumstances of deaths with outcomes for public health decision-making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vascular injury has been implicated as a major cause of clinical complications in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Autopsy studies have revealed destruction of the endothelial cell lining, which might explain cardiovascular alterations arising from the infection. However, data demonstrating endothelial dysfunction during ongoing infection are sparse, and the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Red blood cells (RBCs) are affected by COVID-19 with alterations in their structure and function, possibly contributing to vascular injury via increased oxidative stress. PURPOSE: To determine the presence of endothelial dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 and to explore the RBC as a possible mediator of such dysfunction. METHODS: The study was performed on 17 patients hospitalized for moderate COVID-19 infection and age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Inclusion criteria of the COVID-19 patients were PCR-verified SARS-CoV2 infection, pulmonary infiltrates on x-ray, oxygen demand during hospital stay and  one cardiovascular co-morbidity. Microvascular endothelial function in vivo was assessed with a pulse amplitude tonometry device on each index finger at baseline and during reactive hyperemia and expressed as reactive hyperemia index (RHI). RBCs from COVID-19 patients (C19-RBCs) and healthy subjects (H-RBCs) were incubated with isolated rat aortic segments for evaluation of endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients displayed profound impairment in endothelial function in vivo with RHI 1.56 (1.30C1.81, median and interquartile range) compared to healthy subjects 2.36 (1.97C2.79, p<0.001). C19-RBCs induced severe impairment in both endothelium-dependent (27% maximal relaxation) and -independent relaxations (54%) compared to H-RBCs (67% and 95% relaxation, respectively). Further, C19-RBCs induced upregulation of vascular arginase 1 (2 fold increase compared to H-RBCs) and markers of oxidative stress (6 fold). Consequently, inhibition of vascular arginase or superoxide attenuated the impairment in endothelial function induced by C19-RBCs. C19-RBCs were characterized by increased production of reactive oxygen species (1.4 fold) and reduced export of the nitric oxide metabolite nitrate. Following pre-incubation with interferon-, but not interleukin-6 or tumor necrosis factor-, H-RBCs induced impairment in endothelial function. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the presence of marked endothelial dysfunction in an otherwise mainly healthy patient group hospitalized for COVID-19, and clearly implicates a central role of the RBC as a mediator of endothelial injury through enhancement of reactive oxygen species and arginase. These data shed light on a new pathological mechanism underlying vascular dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and may lay the foundation for future therapeutic developments.

Although the terms refer to a political and public health strategy - contain the virus, flatten the peak of the epidemic, mitigate its effects - we offer a psychosocial reading that draws attention to the relation between time and care embedded in each term. We do so to call for the development of a form of care-ful attention under conditions that tend to prompt action rather than reflection, closing down time for thinking. Using Adriana Cavarero's notion of 'horrorism', in which violence is enacted at precisely the point that care is most needed, we discuss the ever-present possibility of failures within acts of care. We argue that dwelling in the temporality of delay can be understood as an act of care if delaying allows us to pay care-ful attention to violence. We then circle back to a point in twentieth-century history - World War II - that was also concerned with an existential threat requiring a response from a whole population. Our purpose is not to invoke a fantasised narrative of 'Blitz spirit', but to suggest that the British psychoanalytic tradition born of that moment offers resources for understanding how to keep thinking while 'under fire' through containing unbearable anxiety and the capacity for violence in the intersubjective space and time between people.

Significant variations were observed in the distribution of children between triage categories: the proportion of patients who was given a green-code showed a 0.59-fold decrease in comparison to 2019 (95% CI 0.5-0.69), while a relative increase in the proportion of yellow codes was observed (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.2-1.78).Conclusion: Quarantine measures significantly impacted on the total number of patients and on the reasons for visiting them in our pediatric ED. This substantial decrease in pediatric care may either be due to lower rates of acute infections because of social distancing, or to parents' or caregivers' reticence to risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in a health-care setting. What is known: a? A recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus responsible for a severe acute respiratory syndrome is spreading globally. a? Restrictive measures may impact patterns of healthcare utilization, as observed in other previous outbreaks. What is new: a? This study shows significant variations in the distribution of children among triage categories during the COVID-19 pandemic. a? Discharge diagnosis was significantly different as well, in particular a relative increase in the proportion of children presenting with traumatic injuries and a decrease of viral infections were observed.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on a tertiary care pediatric emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China, and spread to Guizhou province on January of 2020.

In this discussion, we measure the severity of the disease by the ratio of Intensive Care Units (ICU) spaces occupied by COVID-19 patients and the number of Active Cases (AC) each month from April to October 2020. We also use the ratio of the number of Deaths (D) to the number of Active Cases. What clearly emerges, from rigorous statistical analysis, is a progressive decrease in both ratios until August, indicating progressive mitigation of the disease. This is particularly evident when comparing March-April with July-August; during the summer period the two ratios became roughly 18 times lower. We test such sharp decreases against possible bias in counting active cases and we confirm their statistical significance. We then interpret such evidence in terms of the well-known seasonality of the human immune system and the virus-inactivating effect of stronger UV rays in the summer. Both ratios, however, increased again in October as ICU/AC began to increase in September 2020. These ratios and the exponential growth of infections in October indicate that the virus - if not contained by strict measures - will lead to unsustainable challenges for the Italian health system in the winter of 2020-2021.","output":"The evolution of Covid-19 in Italy during the Summer 2020: analysis and interpretation of an unpredicted rest period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid development of technology has drastically changed the way consumers do their shopping The volume of global online commerce has significantly been increasing partly due to the recent COVID-19 crisis that has accelerated the expansion of e-commerce A growing number of webshops integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI), state-of-the-art technology into their stores to improve customer experience, satisfaction and loyalty However, little research has been done to verify the process of how consumers adopt and use AI-powered webshops Using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as a theoretical background, this study addresses the question of trust and consumer acceptance of Artificial Intelligence in online retail An online survey in Hungary was conducted to build a database of 439 respondents for this study To analyse data, structural equation modelling (SEM) was used After the respecification of the initial theoretical model, a nested model, which was also based on TAM, was developed and tested The widely used TAM was found to be a suitable theoretical model for investigating consumer acceptance of the use of Artificial Intelligence in online shopping Trust was found to be one of the key factors influencing consumer attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Perceived usefulness as the other key factor in attitudes and behavioural intention was found to be more important than the perceived ease of use These findings offer valuable implications for webshop owners to increase customer acceptance","output":"Consumer Acceptance of the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Online Shopping: Evidence from Hungary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T cell immunity is central for the control of viral infections To characterize T cell immunity, but also for the development of vaccines, identification of exact viral T cell epitopes is fundamental Here we identify and characterize multiple dominant and subdominant SARS-CoV-2 HLA class I and HLA-DR peptides as potential T cell epitopes in COVID-19 convalescent and unexposed individuals SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides enabled detection of post-infectious T cell immunity, even in seronegative convalescent individuals Cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 peptides revealed pre-existing T cell responses in 81% of unexposed individuals and validated similarity with common cold coronaviruses, providing a functional basis for heterologous immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses was associated with mild symptoms of COVID-19, providing evidence that immunity requires recognition of multiple epitopes Together, the proposed SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes enable identification of heterologous and post-infectious T cell immunity and facilitate development of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures for COVID-19","output":"SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides define heterologous and COVID-19-induced T cell recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein NMR chemical shifts are highly sensitive to local structure.

Governments and professional organisations in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (RoI) have acknowledged the need to support and maximise community pharmacy to maintain delivery of patient care. However, the pandemic's impact on day-to-day changes to community pharmacy practice has not been comprehensively examined across the island of Ireland. Aim: To identify changes as communicated by policy and professional bodies to community pharmacy practice across the island of Ireland in preparation for and/or response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compare identified changes in Northern Ireland (NI) and RoI. Methods: Government, health service, regulatory and professional organisation websites in both NI and RoI were searched using relevant search terms (e.g. pharmacist, COVID- 19). Any document (e.g. official publications/reports, website pages, circulars) containing information relating to changes to community pharmacy-related infrastructure, funding/resourcing, legislation, guidelines or policies in preparation for, and/ or response to, COVID-19, published between 1st January and 31st October 2020 was included. Guidelines on clinical use of medicines were excluded as this was considered a separate topic. Initial screening of each website was undertaken by one reviewer. Brief details of potentially relevant documents were collated in a spreadsheet. Following removal of duplicates, full-texts of identified documents were assessed for inclusion by two reviewers independently, with discrepancies resolved through discussion. A content analysis was undertaken. Results: In total, 253 documents were identified. Following removal of duplicates and screening, 98 documents were included in the analysis. Most documents were published in the first three months of the pandemic (March-May 2020). A key theme related to medication prescribing and supply, with changes implemented to ensure continued access to medicines. In both NI and RoI, significant changes were made to emergency supply arrangements (e.g. increase in allowable duration of supply at the request of patients). In RoI, legislative changes were made to recognise Healthmail as the national electronic prescription transfer system and to temporarily extend prescription validity. In NI, many community pharmacy services (e.g. Minor Ailments Service, Medicines Use Review) were 'stood down' during initial months of the pandemic. Much of the communication in NI and RoI related to operational changes to ensure business continuity. In both jurisdictions a temporary register of pharmacists was introduced to allow previously registered pharmacists to contribute to the health service response. Additionally, in NI, General Dental Practitioners were redeployed to assist with community pharmacy response. Other areas of focus across both jurisdictions included infection control within a workplace setting, dealing with situations where staff were affected by COVID-19, and the use of personal protective equipment during pharmacy service provision. Conclusion: This study examined changes in community pharmacy practice across two jurisdictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst our searches were limited to publicly accessible documents only, the overlap in identified changes reflects the similarities in challenges faced by community pharmacists in adapting and responding to COVID-19. The cross-country comparison may help pharmacists and policy-makers to identify optimal approaches for responding to any future public health crises.","output":"Changes to Community Pharmacy Practice during the Covid-19 Pandemic: a Cross-country Documentary Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to present the numerical investigations of an infection-based fractional-order nonlinear prey-predator system (FONPPS) using the stochastic procedures of the scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) along with the artificial neuron networks (ANNs), i.e., SCGNNs.

METHODS: The trial (ClinicalTrial.gov NCT04388514) was conducted in four different Italian centers (April-October 2020). Patients were treated according to best available standard of care (SoC) therapy, with or without O3-autohemotherapy (O3-AHT). RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled: SoC + O3-AHT (48 patients) were compared to the SoC treatment (44 patients). The two groups differed in steroids therapy administration (72.7% in SoC arm vs. 50.0% in O3-AHT arm; p = 0.044). Steroid therapy was routinely started when it was subsequently deemed as effective for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. No significant differences in mortality rates, length of hospital stay, mechanical ventilation requirement and ICU admission were observed. Clinical improvement in patients with pneumonia was assessed according to a specifically designed score (decrease in SIMEU class, improvement in radiology imaging, improvement in PaO2/FiO2, reduction in LDH and requirement of oxygen therapy &#8804; 5 days). Score assessment was performed on day-3 (T3) and day-7 (TEnd) of O3-AHT treatment. A significant increase in the score was reported at TEnd, in the O3-AHT treatment arm (0 [0-1] in the SoC arm vs. 2 [1-3] the O3-AHT arm; p = 0.018). No adverse events related O3-AHT treatment was observed. CONCLUSION: In mild-to-moderate pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2, adjuvant oxygen/ozone therapy did not show any effect on mortality, or mechanical intubation but show a clinical improvement a day 7 from randomization in a composite clinical endpoint.

Service users completed assessments and focus groups to provide information on ways to improve privacy policy accessibility, including identifying and rewording jargon. This was supplemented by comparisons of mental health depression apps with social media, music and finance apps using readability analyses and examining whether GDPR affected accessibility. RESULTS: Service users provided a detailed framework for increasing accessibility that emphasised having critical information for consent. Quantitatively, most app privacy policies were too long and complicated for ensuring informed consent (mental health apps mean reading grade = 13.1 (SD = 2.44)). Their reading grades were no different to those for other services. Only 3 mental health apps had a grade 8 or less and 99% contained service user identified jargon.

Between 5 March and 15 April 2020 COVID-19 had spread to 23 southern and east African countries, except Lesotho. The overwhelming majority of these countries imposed general restrictions on their populations from March 2020 and nearly all restricted visits to prisons to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The pandemic and government responses demonstrated the importance of reliable and up to date data on the prison population, and any confined population, as it became evident that such information is sorely lacking. The World Health Organization recommended the release of prisoners to ease congestion, a step supported by the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture. However, the lack of data and the particular African context pose some questions about the desirability of such a move. The curtailment of prison visits by external persons also did away with independent oversight even in states parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT). In the case of South Africa, prison monitors were not listed in the ensuing legislation as part of essential services and thus were excluded from access to prisons. In the case of Mozambique, it was funding being placed on hold by the donor community that prevented the Human Rights Commission from visiting prisons.

This report describes key epidemiological characteristics and corresponding control measures between 17 January 2020 and 26 March 2021. METHODS: COVID-19 notifications made to the State Government Department of Health were used in this analysis. Epidemiological features are described over 4 phases, including enhancements to testing, contact tracing and public health interventions. Demographic and clinical features of cases are described. FINDINGS: Victoria recorded 20,483 cases of COVID-19, of which 1073 (5?2%) were acquired overseas and 19,360 (95%) were locally acquired. The initial epidemic (Phase I) was well-contained through public health interventions and was followed by relaxation of restrictions and low-level community transmission (Phase II). However, an outbreak in a hotel used to quarantine returned travellers led to wide-scale community transmission accounting for a majority (91%) of cases (Phase III). Outbreaks occurred in vulnerable settings including aged care and hospitals, contributing to high hospitalisation (12%) and case fatality rates (3?7%). Aggressive restrictions ultimately led to local elimination, and subsequent outbreaks have been swiftly managed with improved processes (Phase IV). The demographic composition of cases evolved across phases from an older, wealthier population to a less advantaged younger population, with many from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. INTERPRETATION: Over time, adaptations to the public health response have strengthened capacity to respond to new cases and outbreaks in a more effective manner.

The objective of this study was to develop a simple CT severity score (CT-SS) with good inter-observer agreement and assess its correlation with clinical outcome. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), from April-August 2020. All patients who were PCR positive for COVID-19 and underwent CT chest examination at AKUH were included. Severity of disease was described on the basis of a 10-point CT severity score (CT-SS) devised at our institution. CT-SS were categorized as Low (0-7) and High (8-10). Inter-observer reliability between radiologist and COVID-19 intensivist was assessed using the Kappa statistic. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients were included, the majority male (58.9%) with mean age 55.813.93 years. The CT-SS rated on 0-10 showed substantial inter-observer reliability between radiologist and intensivist with a Kappa statistic of 0.78. Patients with CT-SS 8-10 had a significantly higher ICU admission & intubation rate (53.8% vs. 23.5%) and mortality rate (35.9% vs. 11.8%; p=0.017), as compared to those with CT-SS 0-7. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the described CT severity score (CT-SS) is a quick, effective, and easily reproducible tool for prediction of adverse clinical outcome in patients with COVID 19 pneumonia. The tool shows good inter-observer agreement when calculated by radiologist and physician independently.","output":"Correlation Of Computerized Tomography (CT) Severity Score For COVID-19 Pneumonia With Clinical Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 poses an ongoing threat to lives around the world and challenges the existing public health and medical service delivery. The lockdown or quarantine measures adopted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has caused the interruption in ongoing care and access to medical care including to patients with existing neurological conditions. Besides the passivity, isolation, and withdrawal, patients with neurodegenerative diseases experience difficulties in communication due to a limited access to leisure opportunities and interaction with friends and relatives. The communication difficulties may exacerbate the burden on the caregivers. Therefore, assistive-technologies may be a useful strategy in mitigating challenges associated with remote communication. The current paper presents an overview of the use of assistive technologies using virtual reality and virtual body ownership in providing communication opportunities to isolated patients, during COVID-19, with neurological diseases and moderate-to-severe communication difficulties. We postulate that the assistive technologies-based intervention may improve social interactions in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and acquired brain injury-thereby reducing isolation and improving their quality of life and mental well-being.","output":"Virtual Reality as a Technological-Aided Solution to Support Communication in Persons With Neurodegenerative Diseases and Acquired Brain Injury During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic it has become clear that there is a need for therapies that are capable of reducing damage caused to patients from infections.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled 234 participants (patients with COPD and pulmonary infection, patients with COPD without pulmonary infection, and healthy individuals) from January 2017 to December 2019. RESULTS: Levels of interleukin (IL)-6 were lower and levels of IL-8 were higher in patients with COPD and pulmonary infection. Levels of white blood cells (WBCs), C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and CD8+ cells were higher, while levels of CD3+ and CD4+ cells, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1 % predicted (FEV1%pred), and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) (FEV1%FVC) were lower in patients with COPD and pulmonary infection. Levels of WBCs, CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- were negatively associated with FEV1, FEV1%pred and FEV1%FVC.

Data sources: Pubmed, Global Health, PsychInfo, ReliefWeb, OpenGrey (grey literature), Google Scholar, Web of Science (Social Science Index) Eligibility criteria: a structured search strategy was systematically applied to 17 databases as well as registers, websites and other resources to identify materials published between 1 January 2005 and 15 May 2019. Data extraction and synthesis: Those resources that met the inclusion criteria underwent a comprehensive full-text review. A detailed matrix was developed and key data from each resource were extracted to allow for the assessment of patterns in thematic areas. RESULTS: A total of 2108 documents were screened. Overall, 145 documents and 112 tools were reviewed, representing 10 different humanitarian sectors. While numerous resources exist, many lack sufficient information on how to monitor outputs or outcomes of GBV risk mitigation activities. There is also limited guidance on how to integrate the measurement of GBV risk mitigation into existing monitoring and evaluation frameworks. Those reports that aimed to measure GBV risk mitigation activities mostly employed qualitative methods and few measured the impact of a GBV risk mitigation with robust research designs.

Many recent methods use deep neural networks to learn complex sequence representations and predict function from these. Deep supervised models require a lot of labeled training data which are not available for this task. However, a very large amount of protein sequences without functional labels is available. RESULTS: We applied an existing deep sequence model that had been pre-trained in an unsupervised setting on the supervised task of protein molecular function prediction. We found that this complex feature representation is effective for this task, outperforming hand-crafted features such as one-hot encoding of amino acids, k-mer counts, secondary structure and backbone angles. Also, it partly negates the need for complex prediction models, as a two-layer perceptron was enough to achieve competitive performance in the third Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation benchmark. We also show that combining this sequence representation with protein 3D structure information does not lead to performance improvement, hinting that three-dimensional structure is also potentially learned during the unsupervised pre-training.

She was found to have left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and a suspected pulmonary embolism. A large mobile right atrial mass was found on echocardiogram. Given the large thrombus burden that portended an extremely high risk for embolization to the pulmonary arteries, emergent percutaneous aspiration of an organized thrombus (rather than thrombolysis) was performed using the AngioVac system (Angiodynamics Inc., Latham, NY, USA) complicated by haemodynamic collapse due to acute right ventricular failure. An Impella RP (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA) was then placed, with rapid stabilization of haemodynamics. The patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). She was treated with antimicrobial and systemic anticoagulation therapy. She was successfully weaned off the Impella RP on post-operative day 4 and was extubated on day 5.

GSE24946 was downloaded from the GEO database, which included 17 samples of K562-r cells with (n=12) or without drug administration (n=5). Three drug treatment groups were considered for this study: arsenic trioxide (ATO), AMN107, and ATO+AMN107. Each group had one sample at each time point (3, 12, 24, and 48 h). Time-series genes with a ratio of standard deviation/average (coefficient of variation) >0.15 were screened, and their expression patterns were revealed based on Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM). Then, the functional enrichment analysis of time-series genes in each group was performed using DAVID, and the genes enriched in the top ten functional categories were extracted to detect their expression patterns. Different time-series genes were identified in the three groups, and most of them were enriched in the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Time-series genes in the three treatment groups had different expression patterns and functions. Time-series genes in the ATO group (e.g. CCNA2 and DAB2) were significantly associated with cell adhesion, those in the AMN107 group were related to cellular carbohydrate metabolic process, while those in the ATO+AMN107 group (e.g. AP2M1) were significantly related to cell proliferation and antigen processing. In imatinib-resistant CML cells, ATO could influence genes related to cell adhesion, AMN107 might affect genes involved in cellular carbohydrate metabolism, and the combination therapy might regulate genes involved in cell proliferation.","output":"Time-series analysis in imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia K562-cells under different drug treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sensing of pathogens by specialized receptors is the hallmark of the innate immunity. Innate immune response also mounts a defense response against various allergens and pollutants including particulate matter present in the atmosphere. Air pollution has been included as the top threat to global health declared by WHO which aims to cover more than three billion people against health emergencies from 2019 to 2023. Particulate matter (PM), one of the major components of air pollution, is a significant risk factor for many human diseases and its adverse effects include morbidity and premature deaths throughout the world. Several clinical and epidemiological studies have identified a key link between the PM existence and the prevalence of respiratory and inflammatory disorders. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here, we investigated the influence of air pollutant, PM10 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 m) during RNA virus infections using Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) - H5N1 virus. We thus characterized the transcriptomic profile of lung epithelial cell line, A549 treated with PM10 prior to H5N1infection, which is known to cause severe lung damage and respiratory disease. We found that PM10 enhances vulnerability (by cellular damage) and regulates virus infectivity to enhance overall pathogenic burden in the lung cells. Additionally, the transcriptomic profile highlights the connection of host factors related to various metabolic pathways and immune responses which were dysregulated during virus infection.

The definition of potentially infectious players was based on the time of a positive PCR testing and symptom onset. Transmission-relevant contacts on the pitch were evaluated through doubly reviewed video analysis. RESULTS: Out of 1247 identified football matches and training sessions (1071 amateur and youth level, 176 professional level), 104 cases (38 training sessions, 66 matches) with 165 potentially infectious players were detected. Follow-up PCR testing at the professional level (44 cases) revealed no transmission.

METHODS This qualitative photo-elicitation study asked 30 women between 3 and 10 weeks postpartum to take photographs that encompassed their experience as a new mother during the pandemic. Two trained interviewers elicited elements of this experience using the photos as an anchor during virtual, hour-long interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using directed content analysis, including open coding to identify key ideas, codebook development, and codebook refinement. Half of transcripts were team coded to ensure coding accuracy. After coding, the study team organized codes to inform the development of an explanatory model. RESULTS Interviews identified important stressors new mothers experienced that were worsened during the pandemic, namely fear, child care, older children, loss, isolation, and employment. Interviews also highlighted key support structures (self-care, interpersonal, and structural supports) that were at times helpful in alleviating stressors and at others were inadequate to counter stress and even enhanced stress. CONCLUSION For postpartum individuals overall, the pandemic resulted in increased strain during an already stressful time. These findings demonstrate inadequacy of support systems for postpartum women and may highlight action items for stakeholders to improve postpartum care during the pandemic and in the future.","output":"Experiences of New Mothers During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: The cystic fibrosis (CF) modulator drug, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), proved highly effective in controlled clinical trials for individuals with at least one F508del allele, which occurs in at least 85% of people with CF. OBJECTIVES: PROMISE is a postapproval study to understand the broad effects of ETI through 30 months clinical use in a more diverse U.S. patient population with planned analyses after 6 months. METHODS: Prospective, observational study in 487 people with CF age 12 years or older with at least one F508del allele starting ETI for the first time. Assessments occurred before and 1, 3, and 6 months into ETI therapy. Outcomes included change in percent predicted FEV(1) (ppFEV(1)), sweat chloride concentration, body mass index (BMI), and self-reported respiratory symptoms. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Average age was 25.1 years, and 44.1% entered the study using tezacaftor/ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor, whereas 6.7% were using ivacaftor, consistent with F508del homozygosity and G551D allele, respectively. At 6 months into ETI therapy, ppFEV(1) improved 9.76 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.76 to 10.76) from baseline, cystic fibrosis questionnaireCrevised respiratory domain score improved 20.4 points (95% CI, 18.3 to 22.5), and sweat chloride decreased ?41.7 mmol/L (95% CI, ?43.8 to ?39.6). BMI also significantly increased. Changes were larger in those naive to modulators but substantial in all groups, including those treated with ivacaftor at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: ETI by clinical prescription provided large improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms, and BMI in a diverse population naive to modulator drug therapy, using existing two-drug combinations, or using ivacaftor alone. Each group also experienced significant reductions in sweat chloride concentration, which correlated with improved ppFEV(1) in the overall study population.

Owing to their rarity, there is paucity in the literature regarding the clinical findings and treatment. This paper aims to summarize the current understanding of trapezoidal fractures and present a novel classification algorithm. METHODS A diagnostic classification algorithm was created based on the known blood supply and ligamentous attachment of the trapezoid. The proposed treatment algorithm was then applied to trapezoidal fractures in the literature to validate the algorithm and determine whether patients received treatment that was in accordance. RESULTS A total of 19 articles, representing 22 trapezoidal fractures were included, with two additional cases presented by the authors. Presenting symptoms were pain (n = 21) and swelling (n = 12). Diagnosis was made on CT in a majority of the time, 79.2% (n = 18). All outcomes were favorable with symptomatic resolution and full range of motion after treatment, except in four patients that had co-existing wrist injuries. When the algorithm was applied, 89.5% (n = 17) of the patients received treatment in accordance with the proposed algorithm and demonstrated good outcomes. In the remaining patients (n = 2) whose treatment differed, one had diminished grip strength and the other was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Given a degree of clinical suspicion including a history of blunt trauma to the hand and persisting pain, trapezoidal fractures should remain on the differential when plain radiographs fail to identify any fracture. Operative treatment is suggested if there is any significant displacement, compromise of the dorsal surface, or breech of the trapezoidal ligaments causing possible dislocation.

Patients older than 14 years, hospitalized from 2010 to 2016 due to SARI by viral infection, and who were submitted to respiratory virus testing were included. We assessed comorbidity retrospectively through chart review, and calculated 4 variants of the CCI. Of the 291 patients assessed, 72.8% (n=212) presented comorbidities and 24% died (n=70). The most recurrent comorbidities were Chronic Pulmonary Disease (n=76/212, 36%) and HIV (n=50/212, 23.6%).

Many international agencies are devoting efforts to enhance the understanding of the evolving COVID-19 outbreak on an international level, its influences, and preparedness. At present, COVID-19 appears to affect individuals through person-to-person means, like other commonly found cold or influenza viruses. It is widely known and acknowledged that viruses causing influenza peak during cold temperatures and gradually subside in the warmer temperature, owing to their seasonality. Thus, COVID-19, due to its regular flu-like symptoms, is also expected to show similar seasonality and subside as the global temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere with the onset of spring. Despite these speculations, however, the systematic analysis in the global perspective of the relation between COVID-19 spread and meteorological parameters is unavailable. Here, by analyzing the region- and city-specific affected global data and corresponding meteorological parameters, we show that there is an optimum range of temperature and UV index strongly affecting the spread and survival of the virus, whereas precipitation, relative humidity, cloud cover, etc. have no effect on the virus. Unavailability of pharmaceutical interventions would require greater preparedness and alert for the effective control of COVID-19. Under these conditions, the information provided here could be very helpful for the global community struggling to fight this global crisis.

We use the 13 sources detected above 5sigma to estimate the first ALMA galaxy number counts at this wavelength.

Among these, GBM is the most frequent and most malignant one. The highly infiltrative nature of gliomas, and their intrinsic intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity, pose challenges towards developing effective treatments. The glioma microenvironment, in addition, is also thought to play a critical role during tumor development and treatment course. Unlike most other solid tumors, the glioma microenvironment is dominated by macrophages and microglia-collectively known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs, like their homeostatic counterparts, are plastic in nature and can polarize to either pro-inflammatory or immunosuppressive states. Many lines of evidence suggest that immunosuppressive TAMs dominate the glioma microenvironment, which fosters tumor development, contributes to tumor aggressiveness and recurrence and, very importantly, impedes the therapeutic effect of various treatment regimens. However, through the development of new therapeutic strategies, TAMs can potentially be shifted towards a proinflammatory state which is of great therapeutic interest. In this review, we will discuss various aspects of TAMs in the context of glioma. The focus will be on the basic biology of TAMs in the central nervous system (CNS), potential biomarkers, critical evaluation of model systems for studying TAMs and finally, special attention will be given to the potential targeted therapeutic options that involve the TAM compartment in gliomas.","output":"Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Gliomas-Basic Insights and Treatment Opportunities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Overall treatment time is an important factor of local recurrence and indirectly of distant evolution, namely in case of protracted treatments.

However, the mechanisms underlying the procedure remain incompletely understood. Intestinal remodeling involving glucose transporters (GLUTs) may play a crucial role. Rat studies have demonstrated morphological adaptation of GLUTs within adipose and intestinal cells in association with the reprogramming of glucose metabolism. There is a limited understanding of the variations in expression amongst GLUT family receptors in the human intestine. The aim of this study was to evaluate and describe jejunal GLUT expression patterns in the obese versus non-obese. METHODS Tissue samples were collected from 19 adults (age 18) patients with morbid obesity undergoing elective RYGB. Specimens were obtained from excess jejunum removed during the stapled jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. All subjects met National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric surgery (body mass index or BMI 40 or 35 with obesity-related comorbidities). Exclusion criteria included age less than 18, age greater than 65, patients undergoing a revision procedure, and the presence of a seizure disorder (possible association with GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome). Five samples were obtained from non-obese subjects (average BMI 26.7) without diabetes who were consenting organ donors after brain death. Samples of jejunum from non-obese individuals were obtained at the time of organ procurement. Institutional Review Board and Gift of Hope approval was obtained. Specimens underwent quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Western blot densitometry was performed using Image J software. Student T test was performed using SPSS statistics software. RESULTS GLUT-1 and GLUT-7 expression were not detected in the jejunum of either group. No difference in expression pattern was observed for GLUT-2, GLUT-4, and GLUT-9 between the groups. Western blot band density of GLUT-5 to loading control (GADPH) mean ratio was 0.21 (SD = 0.20) in obese specimens compared to 0.56 (SD = 0.17) in non-obese. Densitometry revealed GLUT-5 levels in the jejunum of the obese were significantly lower than non-obese specimens (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The absence of GLUT-1 expression in both the obese and non-obese groups is consistent with the established view of GLUT-1 being abundantly present in fetal intestine but diminished to negligible levels by adulthood. Decreased GLUT-5 expression in samples from subjects with obesity compared to non-obese samples may represent a down-regulation of gene expression amongst the obese. The differential expression of GLUT-5 suggests a possible role in obesity.

However, no study has yet summarized the full body of evidence for the use of propolis and honey in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Objective This study systematically reviews the mechanisms of propolis and honey against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and current evidence for the use of propolis and honey in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Search strategy: A systematic search was conducted of electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library from their inceptions to April 2021. Inclusion criteria: Studies that evaluated the effect of propolis or bee products against SARS-CoV-2 using in silico methods, clinical studies, case reports and case series were included. Data extraction and analysis: A standardized data extraction form was used, and data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Narrative synthesis was used to summarize study results concerning the use of propolis or honey in COVID-19 prevention and treatment and their potential mechanisms of action against SARS-CoV-2. Results A total of 15 studies were included. Nine studies were in silico studies, two studies were case reports, one study was a case series, and three studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In silico studies, using molecular docking methods, showed that compounds in propolis could interact with several target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the main protease enzyme, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and spike protein. Propolis may have a positive effect for clinical improvement in mild and moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients, according to case reports and case series. The included RCTs indicated that propolis or honey could probably improve clinical symptoms and decrease viral clearance time when they were used as adjuvant therapy to standard of care. Conclusion In silico studies showed that compounds from propolis could interact with target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, interfering with viral entry and viral RNA replication, while clinical studies revealed that propolis and honey could probably improve clinical COVID-19 symptoms and decrease viral clearance time.

The minimum threshold dose required to establish infection of the dam and fetus was at least 10(3) colony forming units, with consistent colonization of maternal and fetal tissues achieved only with 10(7) colony forming units. In some instances, rat fetal tissues could be colonized in the absence of concomitant amniotic fluid colonization. Interestingly, there appeared to be a predilection for colonization of the reproductive tissues. CONCLUSIONS: In the Sprague-Dawley rat, the infection rate of both the dam and fetus can be controlled by the inoculum dose. Our data support the concept that hematogenous spread of M pulmonis to the rat fetus can occur without amniotic fluid infection and suggest that the fetus itself can potentially seed the amniotic fluid with microorganisms. Importantly, manipulation of both the route of infection as well as infection dose provide a reproducible way to study both maternal and fetal immune response to infection during pregnancy.","output":"Hematogenous infection of Sprague-Dawley rats with Mycoplasma pulmonis: development of a model for maternal and fetal infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cause important health problems in all cattle husbandry systems. It contributes substantially to the use of antimicrobial substances and compromises animal welfare and the sustainability of the cattle industry. The existing preventive measures of BRD focus at the individual animal or herd level and include vaccination, mass treatment with antimicrobials and improvement of the animal's environment and general health status. Despite progress in our understanding of disease mechanism and technological development, the current preventive measures are not sufficiently effective. Thus, there is a need for alternative, sustainable strategies to combat the disease. Some of the primary infectious agents in the BRD complex are viruses that are easily transmitted between herds such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). This conceptual analysis presents arguments for combatting BRD through improved external biosecurity in the cattle herds. As an example of a population-based approach to the control of BRD, the Norwegian BRSV/BCoV control-program is presented. The program is voluntary and launched by the national cattle industry. The core principle is classification of herds based on antibody testing and subsequent prevention of virus-introduction through improved biosecurity measures. Measures include external herd biosecurity barriers and regulations in the organization of animal trade to reduce direct and indirect transmission of virus. Improved biosecurity in a large proportion of herds will lead to a considerable effect at the population level. Positive herds are believed to gain freedom by time if new introduction is avoided. Vaccination is not used as part of the program. Dissemination of information to producers and veterinarians is essential. We believe that reducing the incidence of BRD in cattle is essential and will lead to reduced antimicrobial usage while at the same time improving animal health, welfare and production. Alternative approaches to the traditional control measures are needed.","output":"Using Biosecurity Measures to Combat Respiratory Disease in Cattle: The Norwegian Control Program for Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Bovine Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Levels of personal anxiety are inevitably escalating in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including individual fear of infection, grief at the loss of loved ones and reactive depression related to loss of employment and livelihood This article considers the importance of compassion in a range of contemporary and emerging contexts during a time of pandemic These include: exposure of medical and care professionals to the acute demands of overstretched institutions resulting in adverse mental health outcomes and compassion fatigue;attitudes towards the burgeoning cohort of welfare recipients;and particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly, and those who are homeless The article considers how we ought to conceive of compassion in these contexts and makes some suggestions for building future compassion interventions and training","output":"Compassion, Law and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores contagion alongside and in relation to its ever-attendant metaphors, examining Heinrich von Kleists short story The Foundling, and finding here a particularly revealing concatenation of ideas of human contact, trade and infection.","output":"Infectious Hospitality and Communicative Disease in Kleists Der Findling: The Disease Inside and Out"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intra-tumoral arterio-hepatic venous shunting (AHVS) poses an impediment to transarterial chemoembolization of liver tumors.

COVID-19 has caused an immense psychological burden on the population, especially among doctors and nurses who are faced with high infection risks and increased workload. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the mental health of medical professionals with nonmedical professionals in different European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that medical professionals, particularly those exposed to COVID-19 at work, would have higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. We also aimed to determine their main stressors and most frequently used coping strategies during the crisis. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during peak COVID-19 months in 8 European countries. The questionnaire included demographic data and inquired whether the participants were exposed to COVID-19 at work or not. Mental health was assessed via the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales32 (23.53)C21 (DASS-21). A 12-item checklist on preferred coping strategies and another 23-item questionnaire on major stressors were completed by medical professionals. RESULTS: The sample (N=609) consisted of 189 doctors, 165 nurses, and 255 nonmedical professionals. Participants from France and the United Kingdom reported experiencing severe/extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress more often compared to those from the other countries. Nonmedical professionals had significantly higher scores for depression and anxiety. Among medical professionals, no significant link was reported between direct contact with patients with COVID-19 at work and anxiety, depression, or stress. Uncertainty about when the epidemic will be under control caused the most amount of stress for health care professionals while taking protective measures was the most frequently used coping strategy among all participants. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 poses a major challenge to the mental health of working professionals as a considerable proportion of our participants showed high values for depression, anxiety, and stress. Even though medical professionals exhibited less mental stress than nonmedical professionals, sufficient help should be offered to all occupational groups with an emphasis on effective coping strategies.","output":"Mental Health Among Medical Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Eight European Countries: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single\\\\cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\\\\seq) technology has become the state\\\\of\\\\the\\\\art approach for unravelling the heterogeneity and complexity of RNA transcripts within individual cells, as well as revealing the composition of different cell types and functions within highly organized tissues/organs/organisms.

For hospices with terminally ill patients, the trade-off between compassion and infection control becomes a difficult decision. This study aimed to survey the changes in visiting policy for all 76 hospice wards in Taiwan during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The altered visiting policies were assessed by the number of visitors per patient allowed at one time, the daily number of visiting slots, the number of hours open daily, and requisites for hospice ward entry. The differences in visiting policies between hospice wards and ordinary wards were also investigated. Data were collected by reviewing the official website of each hospital and were supplemented by phone calls in cases where no information was posted on the website. One quarter (n = 20) of hospice wards had different visiting policies to those of ordinary wards in the same hospital. Only one hospice ward operated an open policy, and in contrast, nine (11.8%) stopped visits entirely. Among the 67 hospice wards that allowed visiting, at most, two visitors at one time per patient were allowed in 46 (68.6%), one visiting time daily was allowed in 32 (47.8%), one hour of visiting per day was allowed in 29 (43.3%), and checking of identity and travel history was carried out in 12 wards (17.9%).

This space is a therapeutic garden adjacent to the CLC that can be accessed by families without having to enter the facility. Participants in the BG reported feelings of peace, undisturbed reflection, and tranquility as they observed and experienced natures life cycle. This show of natures beauty promotes visual, tactile, and olfactory sensory stimulation while attracting hummingbirds, bees, butterflies, and peace to this calm garden space. The BG visitations offers residents, family, and staff opportunities to experience the health benefits of nature during their visits under strict CDC social contact guidelines. From September through December 2020 and from January through March 2021 there were 67 and 184 visits respectively as families became more involved. The feedback from residents, families, and staff indicated that the spirits of all participants were raised by the BG visits despite the difficult challenges of social distancing and limited CLC visitations.

In some poor countries life expectancy is between 37-40 years lower than in rich countries; furthermore, maternal and infant mortality is high and there is lack of access to basic preventive and life-saving medicines, as well a high prevalence of neglected diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Moreover, globalization has made the world more connected than before such that health challenges today are no longer limited within national or regional boundaries, making all persons equally vulnerable. Because of this, diseases in the most affluent countries are closely connected with diseases in the poorest countries. In this paper, we argue that, because of global health inequalities, in a situation of equal vulnerability, there is need for global solidarity not only as a means of reducing health inequalities, but also as a way of putting up a united force against global health challenges. We argue for an African approach to solidarity in which the humanity of a person is not determined by his/her being human or rational capacity, but by his/her capacity to live a virtuous life. According to this view of solidarity, because no one is self-sufficient, no individual can survive alone. If we are to collectively flourish in a world where no individual, nation or region has all the health resources or protection needed for survival, we must engage in solidarity where we remain compassionate and available to one another at all times.","output":"Global health inequalities and the need for solidarity: a view from the Global South."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"LncRNAs act as part of non-coding RNAs at high levels of complex and stimulatory configurations in basic molecular mechanisms. Their extensive regulatory activity in the CNS continues on a small scale, from the functions of synapses to large-scale neurodevelopment and cognitive functions, aging, and can be seen in both health and disease situations. One of the vast consequences of the pathological role of dysregulated lncRNAs in the CNS due to their role in a network of regulatory pathways can be manifested in Alzheimer's as a neurodegenerative disease. The disease is characterized by two main hallmarks: amyloid plaques due to the accumulation of -amyloid components and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) resulting from the accumulation of phosphorylated tau. Numerous studies in humans, animal models, and various cell lines have revealed the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. This scoping review was performed with a six-step strategy and based on the Prisma guideline by systematically searching the publications of seven databases. Out of 1,591 records, 69 articles were utterly aligned with the specified inclusion criteria and were summarized in the relevant table.

The recognition of CTEPH is based on the identification of lung segments or sub-segments without perfusion but preserved ventilation. The presence of mismatched perfusion defects has also been described in a small proportion of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and/or pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PVOD/PCH). Dual-energy CT lung perfusion changes have not been specifically investigated in these two entities. PURPOSE: To compare dual-energy CT (DECT) perfusion characteristics in PAH and PVOD/PCH, with specific interest in PE-type perfusion defects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-three patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH (group A; n = 51) and PVOD/PCH (group B; n = 12) were investigated with DECT angiography with reconstruction of morphologic and perfusion images. RESULTS: The number of patients with abnormal perfusion did not differ between group A (35/51; 68.6%) and group B (6/12; 50%) (p = 0.31) nor did the mean number of segments with abnormal perfusion per patient (group A: 17.9  4.9; group B: 18.3  4.1; p = 0.91). The most frequent finding was the presence of patchy defects in group A (15/35; 42.9%) and a variable association of perfusion abnormalities in group B (4/6; 66.7%). The median percentage of segments with PE-type defects per patient was significantly higher in group B than in group A (p = 0.041).

For this reason, patients presenting with COVID-19 are often put on therapeutic or intermediate anticoagulation upon hospitalization. A common issue of this anticoagulation is the progression to hypocoagulability resulting in hemorrhage. Therefore, monitoring the hemostatic integrity of critically ill COVID-19 patients is of utmost importance. In this case series, we present the cases of three coagulopathic COVID-19 patients whose anticoagulation was guided by thromboelastography (TEG). In each case, TEG permitted the clinical team to simultaneously prevent thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, a difficult task for COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The first two cases illustrate the utility of TEG to guide anticoagulant dosing for COVID-19 patients when the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is inaccurate. The first case was a severely ill COVID-19 patient with end-stage renal disease and a falsely elevated aPTT secondary to hypertriglyceridemia. The second case was a severely ill COVID-19 patient with chronic pulmonary disease who demonstrated a falsely elevated aPTT due to polycythemia and hemoconcentration. In both cases, TEG was sensitive to the hypercoagulability caused by the metabolic derangements which enabled the goal-directed titration of anticoagulants. The last case depicts a severely ill COVID-19 patient with an inherited factor V Leiden mutation who required abnormally high dosing to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation, guided by TEG. Hypercoagulopathic COVID-19 patients are difficult to anticoagulate without development of hypocoagulopathy. Treatment of these patients demands goal-directed therapy by diligent laboratory monitoring. This can be accomplished by the use of TEG coupled with aPTT to guide anticoagulation.

Children 9-11 months of age were randomized to receive one of the following interventions for 24 weeks: 1) Standard micronutrient powder (MNP) containing 4.1 mg zinc and 10 mg iron, daily; 2) High-zinc (10 mg), low-iron (6 mg) (HiZn LoFe) MNP, daily; 3) HiZn (10 mg) LoFe (6 mg)/HiZn (10 mg), no-iron MNPs on alternating days; 4) Dispersible zinc tablet (10 mg), daily; 5) Dispersible zinc tablet (10 mg), daily for two weeks at enrollment and 12 weeks; 6) Placebo powder, daily. Primary outcomes were incidence of diarrhea and change in length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) over the 24-week intervention period. Home visits were conducted twice weekly to assess diarrhea and other morbidity. Incidence and prevalence outcomes were compared among groups with Poisson regression; continuous outcomes were compared using analysis of covariance. RESULTS 2886 children were enrolled between February 2018 and July 2019. The mean incidence and prevalence of diarrhea among all participants was 1.21 episodes per 100 days and 3.76 days per 100 days, respectively. There were no differences in the incidence or prevalence of diarrhea across intervention groups. The decline in LAZ was slightly smaller among children in the daily HiZn LoFe MNP group vs. placebo powder group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The dose of zinc in MNPs as well as the duration and frequency of supplementation evaluated in this trial were not effective in reducing diarrhea; however, the daily HiZn LoFe MNP formulation offered modest improvements in linear growth among young children.

Conventional treatments against the disease are designed to target viral proteins. However, the emergence of viral variants carrying drug-resistant mutations can outpace the development of pathogen-targeting antivirals. Diphyllin and bafilomycin are potent vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, their poor water solubility and potential off-target effect limit their clinical application. METHODS: In this study, we report that nanoparticle encapsulation of diphyllin and bafilomycin improves the drugs anti-influenza applicability. RESULTS: Using PEG-PLGA diblock copolymers, sub-200 nm diphyllin and bafilomycin nanoparticles were prepared, with encapsulation efficiency of 42% and 100%, respectively. The drug-loaded nanoparticles have sustained drug release kinetics beyond 72 hours and facilitate intracellular drug delivery to two different influenza virus-permissive cell lines. As compared to free drugs, the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors exhibited lower cytotoxicity and greater in vitro antiviral activity, improving the therapeutic index of diphyllin and bafilomycin by approximately 3 and 5-fold, respectively. In a mouse model of sublethal influenza challenge, treatment with diphyllin nanoparticles resulted in reduced body weight loss and viral titer in the lungs. In addition, following a lethal influenza viral challenge, diphyllin nanoparticle treatment conferred a survival advantage of 33%.

METHODS: This was a pilot, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Infants 25 0/7C31 6/7 weeks gestational age requiring PPV with supplemental oxygen during resuscitation were enrolled. PPV was initiated with either oxygen (FiO(2)C0.30) + iNO at 20 ppm (iNO group) or oxygen (FiO(2)C0.30) + nitrogen (placebo group). Oxygen was titrated targeting defined SpO(2) per current guidelines. After 10 min, iNO/nitrogen was weaned stepwise per protocol and terminated at 17 min. RESULTS: Twenty-eight infants were studied (14 per group). The mean gestational age in both groups was similar. Cumulative FiO(2) and rate of exposure to high FiO(2) (>0.60) were significantly lower in the iNO group. There were no differences in HR, SpO(2), and need for intubation.

Currently, no proper medicine or effective treatment strategies are available; therefore, repurposing of FDA approved drugs may play an important role in overcoming the situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for 2-O-methyltransferase (2OMTase), which plays a key role in methylation of viral RNA for evading host immune system. In the present study, the protein sequence of 2OMTase of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed, and its structure was modeled by a comparative modeling approach and validated. The library of 3000 drugs was screened against the active site of 2OMTase followed by re-docking analysis. The apo and ligand-bound 2OMTase were further validated and analyzed by using molecular dynamics simulation. KEY FINDINGS: The modeled structure displayed the conserved characteristic fold of class I MTase family. The quality assessment analysis by SAVES server reveals that the modeled structure follows protein folding rules and of excellent quality. The docking analysis displayed that the active site of 2OMTase accommodates an array of drugs, which includes alkaloids, antivirals, cardiac glycosides, anticancer, steroids, and other drugs. The redocking and MD simulation analysis of the best 5 FDA approved drugs reveals that these drugs form a stable conformation with the 2OMTase.

Based on the solubility determination and pseudo-ternary phase diagram, isopropyl palmitate (IPP) was chosen as the oil phase. Meanwhile, Cremophor RH40 and Macrogol 200 (PEG 200) were chosen as the emulsifier and co-emulsifier, respectively. This prescription was further optimized by using central composite design of response surface methodology. The optimized condition was CEP:IPP:Cremophor RH40:PEG 200=3.6:30.0:55.3:11.1 in mass ratio with maximum drug loading (36.21 mg/mL) and the minimum particle size (36.70 nm). The constructed CEP-SEDDS was characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, in vitro release and stability studies. The dissolution level of CEP-SEDDS was nearly 100% after 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 6.8) which was higher than that of the pure CEP (approximately 20%). In addition, in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats showed that CEP-SEDDS dramatically improved bioavailability compared with active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) (the relative bioavailability was 203.46%). In this study, CEP-SEDDS was successfully prepared to enhance the oral bioavailability which might facilitate to increase its better clinical application.

However, the clinical course, and the 60-day mortality and its predictors in critically ill patients have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study is to identify the clinical course, and 60-day mortality and its predictors in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Critically ill adult patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) from 3 hospitals in Wuhan, China, were included. Data on demographic information, preexisting comorbidities, laboratory findings at ICU admission, treatments, clinical outcomes, and results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgM were collected including the duration between symptom onset and negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Of 1748 patients with COVID-19, 239 (13.7%) critically ill patients were included. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 164 (68.6%) patients, coagulopathy in 150 (62.7%) patients, acute cardiac injury in 103 (43.1%) patients, and acute kidney injury (AKI) in 119 (49.8%) patients, which occurred 15.5 days, 17 days, 18.5 days, and 19 days after the symptom onset, respectively. The median duration of the negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 30 (range 6-81) days in 49 critically ill survivors that were identified. A total of 147 (61.5%) patients deceased by 60 days after ICU admission. The median duration between ICU admission and decease was 12 (range 3-36). Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis revealed that age older than 65 years, thrombocytopenia at ICU admission, ARDS, and AKI independently predicted the 60-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Severe complications are common and the 60-day mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is considerably high. The duration of the negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and its association with the severity of critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be seriously considered and further studied.","output":"Clinical course and predictors of 60-day mortality in 239 critically ill patients with COVID-19: a multicenter retrospective study from Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute confusion in pregnancy is generally uncommon, given the relatively young and healthy population obstetricians care for.

METHODS: Reported percentage of changes in and locations for PA and reasons for decreased PA were examined in 3829 US adults who completed the 2020 SummerStyles survey. RESULTS: Overall, 30% reported less PA, and 50% reported no change or no activity during the pandemic; percentages varied across subgroups. Adults who were non-Hispanic Black (Black) or Hispanic (vs. non-Hispanic White, (White)) reported less PA. Fewer Black adults (vs. White) reported doing most PA in their neighborhood. Concern about exposure to the virus (39%) was the most common reason adults were less active.

Therefore, appropriate delineation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants enables us to understand its evolution and transmission patterns. By focusing on the nucleotides that co-substituted, we first identified 42 co-mutation modules that consist of at least two co-substituted nucleotides during the SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Then based on these co-mutation modules, we classified the SARS-CoV-2 population into 43 groups and further identified the phylogenetic relationships among groups based on the number of inconsistent co-mutation modules, which were validated with phylogenetic trees. Intuitively, we tracked tempo-spatial patterns of the 43 groups, of which 11 groups were geographic-specific. Different epidemic periods showed specific co-circulating groups, where the dominant groups existed and had multiple sub-groups of parallel evolution.

The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway participates in the development and progression of DN. Among the different mechanisms involved in JAK/STAT negative regulation, the family of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins has been proposed as a new target for DN. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of SOCS1 mimetic peptide in a mouse model of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) with progressive DN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Six-week-old BTBR (black and tan brachyuric) mice with the ob/ob (obese/obese) leptin-deficiency mutation were treated for 7 weeks with two different doses of active SOCS1 peptide (MiS1 2 and 4 g/g body weight), using inactive mutant peptide (Mut 4 g) and vehicle as control groups. At the end of the study, the animals were sacrificed to obtain blood, urine and kidney tissue for further analysis. RESULTS Treatment of diabetic mice with active peptide significantly decreased urine albumin to creatinine ratio by up to 50%, reduced renal weight, glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage, and restored podocyte numbers. Kidneys from treated mice exhibited lower inflammatory infiltrate, proinflammatory gene expression and STAT activation. Concomitantly, active peptide administration modulated redox balance markers and reduced lipid peroxidation and cholesterol transporter gene expression in diabetic kidneys. CONCLUSION Targeting SOCS proteins by mimetic peptides to control JAK/STAT signaling pathway ameliorates albuminuria, morphological renal lesions, inflammation, oxidative stress and lipotoxicity, and could be a therapeutic approach to T2D kidney disease.","output":"Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and renoprotective effects of SOCS1 mimetic peptide in the BTBR ob/ob mouse model of type 2 diabetes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been recent success in prediction of the three-dimensional folded native structures of proteins, most famously by the AlphaFold Algorithm running on Google's/Alphabet's DeepMind computer. However, this largely involves machine learning of protein structures and is not a de novo protein structure prediction method for predicting three-dimensional structures from amino acid residue sequences. A de novo approach would be based almost entirely on general principles of energy and entropy that govern protein folding energetics, and importantly do so without the use of the amino acid sequences and structural features of other proteins. Most consider that problem as still unsolved even though it has occupied leading scientists for decades. Many consider that it remains one of the major outstanding issues in modern science. There is crucial continuing help from experimental findings on protein unfolding and refolding in the laboratory, but only to a limited extent because many researchers consider that the speed by which real proteins folds themselves, often from milliseconds to minutes, is itself still not fully understood.

Few data exist on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the maternal health care landscape at the national level in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of key obstetrics outcomes (preterm delivery, Cesarean sections, and home births) and length of hospital stay during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the 6 months prior. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women aged 18-44 years in the United States who delivered between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2020, had singleton deliveries, and completed a birth report in the Ovia Pregnancy mobile app. Women were assigned to the prepandemic cohort if they delivered between October 2019 and March 2020, and the pandemic cohort if they delivered between April and September 2020. Gestational age at delivery, delivery method, delivery facility type, and length of hospital stay were compared. RESULTS: A total of 304,023 birth reports were collected, with 152,832 (50.26%) in the prepandemic cohort and 151,191 (49.73%) in the pandemic cohort. Compared to the prepandemic cohort, principal findings indicate a 5.67% decrease in preterm delivery rates in the pandemic cohort (P<.001; odds ratio [OR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.96), a 30.0% increase in home birth rates (P<.001; OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.23-1.4), and a 7.81% decrease in the average hospital length of stay postdelivery (mean 2.48 days, SD 1.35). There were no overall changes in Cesarean section rates between cohorts, but differences were observed between age, race, and ethnicity subgroups.

Methods A single-center propensity-score matched cohort study, including all consecutive COVID-19 patients, admitted to the medical center who were either discharged from the medical center or expired between March 1, 2020, and May 5, 2020, was performed. Patients were stratified according to the receipt of tocilizumab for cytokine storm and matched to controls using propensity scores. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 132 patients were included in the matched dataset (tocilizumab=66; standard of care=66). Approximately 73% of the patients were male. Hypertension (55%), diabetes mellitus (31%), and chronic pulmonary disease (15%) were the most common comorbidities present. There were 18 deaths (27.3%) in the tocilizumab group and 18 deaths (27.3%) in the standard of care group (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.465 - 2.151; p=1.00). Advanced age, history of myocardial infarction, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, and malignancy were significantly more common in patients who died.

Methods: We recruited and followed close contacts of COVID-19 cases for up to 14 days from their last exposure and collected self-reported symptoms, mid-turbinate swabs (MTS) and saliva every two or three days. Ct values and frequency of viral detection by MTS and saliva were compared. Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of detection by days since symptom onset for the two sample types. Results: We enrolled 58 contacts who provided a total of 200 saliva and MTS sample pairs; 14 contacts (13 with symptoms) had one or more positive samples. Overall, saliva and MTS had similar rates of viral detection (p=0.78). Although Ct values for saliva were significantly greater than for MTS (p=0.014), Cohen's Kappa demonstrated substantial agreement ({kappa}=0.83). However, sensitivity varied significantly with time relative to symptom onset. Early in the course of infection (days -3 to 2), saliva had 12 times (95%CI: 1.2, 130) greater likelihood of detecting viral RNA compared to MTS.

This demand has resulted in the development of several commercial assays employing recombinant proteins, but the results of these assays are not reliable as they do not involve comparison with natural viral antigens. We independently used the SARS-CoV-2 whole viral antigen (WVA) and recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rNP) to develop in-house ELISAs for IgG detection; the results of these ELISAs were then compared to obtain reliable results. METHODS: WVA and rNP ELISAs were performed on COVID-19 negative sera from patients before the pandemic in Brazil, and on RT-qPCR-positive or SARS-CoV-2-IgG against rNP and IgG against WVA-positive samples from recently infected patients in Sao Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: Both ELISAs detected a large fraction of infected patients but exhibited certain drawbacks. Higher signals and lower numbers of false-negatives were observed in rNP ELISA; however, a higher fraction of false-positives was observed in control groups. A high number of false-negatives was observed with WVA ELISA. Correlating the results of rNP and WVA ELISAs resulted in improved performance for COVID-19 diagnosis.

Based on participant surveys at three timepoints (preworkshop, postworkshop, and 2-year follow-up), the SCBC was effective in helping participants to increase their communication skills and willingness to engage with the public and other non-specialist audiences.","output":"It is essential to connect: Evaluating a Science Communication Boot Camp."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite significant progress with antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy, a substantial fraction of metastatic melanoma patients show upfront therapy resistance. Biomarkers for outcome are missing and the association of baseline immune function and clinical outcome remains to be determined. We assessed the in vitro nonspecific stimulation of immune response at baseline and during anti-PD-1 therapy for metastatic melanoma. METHODS: Previously untreated metastatic melanoma patients received nivolumab and radiotherapy as part of the multicentric phase II trial NIRVANA (NCT02799901). The levels of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines on in vitro non-specific stimulation of innate and adaptive immune cells were measured in patient sera before treatment, and at week 2 and week 6 after the beginning of the treatment, and correlated with tumorous response, progression-free survival (PFS) and occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The results in melanoma patients were compared with those of a cohort of 9 sex and age-matched healthy donors. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled in this ancillary study. Median follow-up was 16 months (2.2C28.4). The 12-month PFS rate was 67.7%. The incidence of irAEs of any grade was 58.8%. Without in vitro stimulation no differences in cytokines levels were observed between responders and non-responders. On in vitro stimulation, metastatic patients had lower Th1 cytokine levels than healthy donors at baseline for tumor necrosis factor- and interferon- (IFN-) (1136 pg/mL vs 5558 pg/mL, p<0.0001; and 3894 pg/mL vs 17 129 pg/mL, p=0.02, respectively). Responders exhibited increasing cytokine levels from baseline to week 6. Non-responders had lower interleukin 17A (IL-17A) levels at baseline than responders (7 pg/mL vs 32 pg/mL, p=0.03), and lower IFN- levels at week 6 (3.3 ng/mL vs 14.5 ng/mL, p=0.03). A lower level of IL-17A at week 2 and a lower level of IFN- at week 6 correlated with worse PFS (p=0.04 and p=0.04 respectively). At baseline, patients who developed irAEs had higher IL-6 levels (19.3 ng/mL vs 9.2 ng/mL, p=0.03) and higher IL-17A levels (52.5 pg/mL vs 2.5 pg/mL, p=0.009) than those without irAEs.

However, it is unclear how newly synthesized genomes and messenger RNAs can travel from these sealed replication compartments to the cytosol to ensure their translation and the assembly of progeny virions. In this study, we used cellular cryoCelectron microscopy to visualize a molecular pore complex that spans both membranes of the double-membrane vesicle and would allow export of RNA to the cytosol. A hexameric assembly of a large viral transmembrane protein was found to form the core of the crown-shaped complex.

The data was collected from 256 respondents who live in South Asian countries using an online survey. The study employs a descriptive analysis to accomplish the objectives of the study. The analysis initially recognizes that tourist arrivals at global level have drastically dropped (22%) by 2020 compared to 2019 reflecting the changing pattern of peoples travel behaviour at global and regional levels. According to analysis, perceived risk attached to different travel activities such as going to hospital and shopping have been recognized as the most risky type of travels followed by going to school/university and going to work/business. In contrast, virtual meeting and studies have been recognized as low risk as such activities do not involve any physical or social contacts. Moreover, close to half of the respondents (46.7%) who scheduled international travels has completely cancelled while 30.8% has postponed their travels while virtual meetings have become increasingly popular during the pandemic period. In terms of domestic travels, 33.2% of the respondents who had scheduled local travels have completely cancelled their trips and 26.2% have postponed their local travels. Apart from that, types of travel such as leisure, business, health and education are the most affected international and local travel types due to the COVID-19 outbreak in South Asian countries. The study also observes the perceived risk attached to different travelling modes and usage of such travelling modes during the pandemic period. The analysis confirms that usage of public transportation such as bus and train are extremely high risk while the risks attached with personal vehicle, taxi and bike are extremely low. Hence, the risk attached with public transportation such as bus and train essentially avoids the public of using such means of transportation. Instead, people have shifted to personal transportation modes such as personal car, taxi and bike. In conclusion, the study confirms that travelling behaviour and mode of travelling of the people in South Asian countries have significantly changed during the period of COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Dynamics of Travel Behaviour and Mode of Travelling during COVID-19 Outbreak.

METHODS: Patients were contacted via phone-call and a specific questionnaire was administered to evaluate the health status of these patients and to identify those who needed an \\"in-person\\" ambulatory visit due to the worsening of their condition. Secondarily, the patients' perception of a potential shift towards a \\"telemedicine\\" approach to the management of their condition and to indirectly evaluate their desire to return to \\"in-person\\" clinic visits. RESULTS: 607 were contacted by phone-call. 87.5% (531/607) of the cases showed stability of the symptoms so no clinic in-person or emergency visits were needed. 81.5% (495/607) of patients were more concerned about the risk of contagion than their urological condition. The median score for phone visit comprehensibility and ease of communication of exams was 5/5; whilst patients' perception of phone visits' usefulness was scored 4/5. 53% (322/607) of the interviewees didn't own the basic supports required to be able to perform a real telemedicine consult according to the required standards. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine approach limits the number of unnecessary accesses to medical facilities and represents an important tool for the limitation of the risk of transmission of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.

Very few studies have investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 within the nasopharynx, the site of initial infection and viral replication. In this study we profiled changes in the nasal microbial communities as well as in host transcriptional profile during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using 16S amplicon sequencing and RNA sequencing. These analyses were coupled to viral genome sequencing. Our microbiome analysis revealed that the nasal microbiome of COVID patients was unique and was marked by an expansion of bacterial pathogens. Some of these microbes (i.e. Acinetobacter) were shared with COVID negative health care providers from the same medical center but absent in COVID negative outpatients seeking care at the same institutions suggesting acquisition of nosocomial respiratory pathogens. Specifically, we report a distinct increase in the prevalence and abundance of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in COVID patients that correlated with viral RNA load. These data suggest that the inflammatory environment caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially exposure to the hospital environment leads to an expansion of bacterial pathogens in the nasal cavity that could contribute to increased incidence of secondary bacterial infections. Additionally, we observed a robust host transcriptional response in the nasal epithelia of COVID patients, indicative of an antiviral innate immune repones and neuronal damage.

The intended benefits to the older adult and service were for: 1. Daily rehabilitation input for older adults. 2. Older adults to spend less time immobile. 3. Ongoing rehabilitation intervention while awaiting medical clearance for discharge. 4. Increased staff satisfaction 5. Better outcomes on discharge. 6. Rehabilitation ethos on the Health and Ageing wards. METHODS: The quality improvement project was carried out using the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle. Three iterative PDSA cycles were carried out over the course of the project to deliver proactive interventions as a result of analysis of baseline data and stakeholder involvement. These interventions were aimed at developing communication around the rehabilitation list within the team and sustainability of this list. RESULTS: The project resulted in better functional outcomes for older adults and increased staff morale. Between May 2020CJune 2020, a total of 56 patients were seen on the rehabilitation list, with 84% of these patients seeing improvements in their Elderly Mobility Scores (EMS). 27% of patients on the rehabilitation list saw a change to their initial discharge plan, either needing reduced packages of care or reduced need for ongoing rehabilitation in an external setting. CONCLUSIONS: The quality improvement project found that with focussed rehabilitation older adult inpatients with or without COVID-19 can make significant functional gains. These gains have wider effects on their outcomes on discharge and also for the service through increased morale and job satisfaction.

To aid prevention and treatment, there is an urgent need for evidence-based measures to identify individuals at risk for NSSI. Measures that probe past NSSI are most promising, but people are often motivated to conceal NSSI behavior. This problem can be overcome by using implicit measures, which do not require individuals to self-report on their behavior. Yet, prior research typically found weak predictive utility of implicit measures. Based on a new perspective on implicit measures and recent findings in NSSI research, we developed an Implicit Association Test that probes past NSSI (the P-NSSI-IAT). METHOD We report two preregistered studies (N = 83; N = 372) in which we tested the utility of the P-NSSI-IAT to detect past NSSI and predict NSSI one month later.

Methods: : This is a retrospective study conducted in the Huoshenshan hospital. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Feb 5th to March 5th in 2020 who had BUN level tested on admission and on the second day consecutively were included. Patients were stratified into two groups according to the BUN change (increase vs. no increase) during the first 24 hours. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Moreover, other clinical outcomes were also compared. The potential risk factors of in-hospital mortality were analyzed. Results: : There were 266 patients included in the study. The mean change in BUN at 24 hours was 1.0 mg/dL, with 206 patients (77.4%) experiencing no increase in BUN and 60 patients (22.6%) experiencing an increase in BUN. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the BUN increase group compared to no increase group (30.0% vs. 5.8%, P<0.001). BUN increase group also had higher requirement for ICU admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation and incidence of AKI (all P<0.001). After adjusted for related factors, the BUN increase was independently associated with the mortality with an odds ratio of 7.427[95% CI 2.370-23.279]. In the multivariable and survival analysis, BUN increase was also found to be associated with survival regardless of the admission BUN. Conclusions: : In patients with COVID-19, BUN increase at 24 hours was an independent predictor for a composite clinical outcome and in-hospital mortality.

Sliding doors can reduce the containment failure arising from the door motion induced airflows, as compared to the hinged doors that are typically used in healthcare facilities. Such airflow leakage can be measured quantitatively using tracer gas techniques, but detailed observation of the turbulent flow features is very difficult. However, a comprehensive understanding of these flows is important when designing doors to further reduce such containment failures. Experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling, by using Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) flow solver, were used to study airflow patterns in a full-scale mock-up, consisting of a sliding door separating two identical rooms (i.e. one isolation room attached to an antechamber). A single sliding door open/ hold-open/ closing cycle was studied. Additional variables included human passage through the doorway and imposing a temperature difference between the two rooms. The general structures of computationally-simulated flow features were validated by comparing the results to smoke visualizations of identical full-scale experimental set-ups. It was found that without passage the air volume leakage across the doorway was first dominated by vortex shedding in the wake of the door, but during a prolonged hold-open period a possible temperature difference soon became the predominant driving force. Passage generates a short and powerful pulse of leakage flow rate even if the walker stops to wait for the door to open.

The CT imaging-negative patients were younger (P=0.002), had a higher lymphocyte count (P=0.038), had a higher lymphocyte rate (P=0.008), and had more asymptomatic infections (P=0.002) than the CT imaging-positive patients. The RP patients with moderate COVID-19 had lower total scores of for bilateral lung involvement (P=0.030) and a smaller portion of the left lung affected (P=0.024) than non-RP patients. Compared to their first hospitalization, RP patients had a shorter hospitalization period (P< 0.001) and fewer days from the onset of illness to last RNA negative conversion (P< 0.001) at readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Significant CT imaging and clinical feature differences were found between atypical and typical COVID-19 patients for all three atypical presentation categories investigated in this study, which may help provide complementary information for the effective management of COVID-19.","output":"Atypical presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from onset to readmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The latest global health threat is the ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, which was named COVID-19 and multiple ever-evolving neurological complications have since been reported.

Travel restrictions and emergency regulations have had significant impacts on maternity services, including resource stock-outs, and closure of antenatal clinics during the lockdown period. Estimates of the indirect impact of Covid-19 on maternal and perinatal mortality was expected it to be considerable, but little data was yet available. This study aimed to examine the impact of Covid-19 and lockdown control measures on non-Covid outcomes in a government tertiary level maternity unit in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, by comparing maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality before, and after the lockdown was implemented. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study, using a cross-sectional design to compare routine monthly maternal and perinatal statistics three months before and after Covid-19 emergency measures were implemented at Mpilo Central Hospital. RESULTS: Between January-March and April-June 2020, the mean monthly deliveries reduced from 747.3 (SD  61.3) in the first quarter of 2020 to 681.0 (SD  17.6) during lockdown, but this was not statistically significant, p = 0.20. The Caesarean section rates fell from a mean of 29.8% (SD  1.7) versus 28.0% (SD  1.7), which was also not statistically significant, p = 0.18. During lockdown, the percentage of women delivering at Mpilo Central Hospital who were booked at the hospital fell from a mean of 41.6% (SD  1.1) to 35.8% (SD  4.3) which was statistically significant, p = 0.03. There was no significant change, however, in maternal mortality or severe maternal morbidity (such as post-partum haemorrhage (PPH), uterine rupture, and severe preeclampsia/eclampsia), stillbirth rate or special care baby unit admission. There was an increase in the mean total number of early neonatal deaths (ENND) (mean 18.7 (SD  2.9) versus 24.0 (SD  4.6), but this was not statistically significant, p = 0.32. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, maternity services at Mpilo showed resilience during the lockdown period, with no significant change in maternal and perinatal adverse outcomes, with the same number of man-hours worked before and during the lockdown Maternal and perinatal outcomes should continue to be monitored to assess the impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown measures as the pandemic in Zimbabwe unfolds. Further studies would be beneficial to explore women's experiences and understand how bookings and deliveries at local clinics changed during this time.","output":"Resilience and vulnerability of maternity services in Zimbabwe: a comparative analysis of the effect of Covid-19 and lockdown control measures on maternal and perinatal outcomes, a single-centre cross-sectional study at Mpilo Central Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Whole-body vibration (WBV) is an exercise or treatment method used in sports, physiotherapy, and rehabilitation. During WBV, people sit, stand, or exercise on a platform that generates vibrations. These vibrations generally occur between 20 and 60 times per second and have a magnitude of one or several millimeters. Research is focused on the effects of WBV on, for instance, physical and cognitive functions as well as the underlying mechanisms that may explain the effects. Research is not only done in humans but in animals and cell cultures as well. It is important to report the studies correctly, completely, and consistently. This way, researchers can interpret and compare each others studies, and data of different studies can be combined and analyzed together. To serve this goal, we developed new guidelines on how to report on WBV studies. The guidelines include checklists for human and animal/cell culture research, explanations, and examples of how to report. We included information about devices, vibrations, administration, general protocol, and subjects. The guidelines are WBV-specific and can be used by researchers alongside general guidelines for specific research designs. ABSTRACT: Whole-body vibration (WBV) is an exercise modality or treatment/prophylaxis method in which subjects (humans, animals, or cells) are exposed to mechanical vibrations through a vibrating platform or device. The vibrations are defined by their direction, frequency, magnitude, duration, and the number of daily bouts. Subjects can be exposed while performing exercises, hold postures, sitting, or lying down. Worldwide, WBV has attracted significant attention, and the number of studies is rising. To interpret, compare, and aggregate studies, the correct, complete, and consistent reporting of WBV-specific data (WBV parameters) is critical. Specific reporting guidelines aid in accomplishing this goal. There was a need to expand existing guidelines because of continuous developments in the field of WBV research, including but not limited to new outcome measures regarding brain function and cognition, modified designs of WBV platforms and attachments (e.g., mounting a chair on a platform), and comparisons of animal and cell culture studies with human studies. Based on Delphi studies among experts and using EQUATOR recommendations, we have developed extended reporting guidelines with checklists for human and animal/cell culture research, including information on devices, vibrations, administration, general protocol, and subjects. In addition, we provide explanations and examples of how to report. These new reporting guidelines are specific to WBV variables and do not target research designs in general. Researchers are encouraged to use the new WBV guidelines in addition to general design-specific guidelines.","output":"Reporting Guidelines for Whole-Body Vibration Studies in Humans, Animals and Cell Cultures: A Consensus Statement from an International Group of Experts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine diarrhea caused by viruses is a major problem of the pig farming industry and can result in substantial losses of revenue. Thus, diagnosing the infectious agents is important to prevent and control diseases in pigs. We developed novel one-step real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) assays that can detect four porcine diarrheal viruses simultaneously: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and porcine group A rotavirus (PRVA). The qPCR analysis takes only 75 minutes to detect the presence of the four viruses. The limits of detection of our new assays for PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV, and PRVA were 100, 10, 10 and 10 copies per reaction, respectively. The sensitivity of qPCR was 1-1000 times higher than that of published gel-based RT-PCR. We used our qPCR method to successfully diagnose clinical samples from infected pigs, and no false positive results were obtained. In conclusion, qPCR can drastically reduce the diagnostic time to detect viruses compared to currently employed methods. We predict that the qPCR assays will become a useful tool for detecting viral infections that cause diarrhea and other complications in pigs.","output":"Development of one-step real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR-based assays for the rapid and simultaneous detection of four viruses causing porcine diarrhea."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract With the advancement of intelligent manufacturing, different kinds of industrial robots have been applied in modern factories. The liquid crystal display transfer robot (LCDTR) has been widely used in LCD production lines to transport panels. Effective fault diagnosis and prognosis of the industrial robots are of great importance, since unplanned downtime caused by faulty robots significantly reduces the production capacity. Specifically, the ball screw is the critical component in the LCDTR. The failure of the ball screw can cause long downtime. Conventionally, the fault diagnosis of the ball screw is usually based on the vibration signals. However, it is extremely difficult to install the vibration sensors in the industrial robots. Therefore, in order to address this issue in condition monitoring, this paper proposes a data-driven fault diagnosis methodology using the motor current signals of the ball screw. Two time-frequency domain analysis methods are investigated, including short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). The statistical features are extracted, and Fisher score is used to select features. Furthermore, the logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors are applied for the final fault diagnosis. Experiments on a real-world industrial robot dataset are carried out for validation. 100% diagnosis accuracy can be basically achieved by the proposed method, which indicates the non-stationary current signal can be effectively used to identify the health states of the ball screw in the LCDTR.","output":"Fault Diagnosis of Ball Screw in Industrial Robots Using Non-Stationary Motor Current Signals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic spread of COVID 19 caused by the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV- 2) produced a tremendous effect on the life of humanity across the globe.

However, the associations between media exposure to COVID-19 and acute stress responses have not been explored during the early COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: An online survey was conducted to investigate the relationships between media exposure to COVID-19 and acute stress responses, and to recognize associated predictors of acute stress responses on a sample of 1,450 Chinese citizens from February 3 to February 10, 2020. Media exposure questionnaire related to COVID-19 was developed to assess media exposure time, media exposure forms and media exposure content. The Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ) was used to measure acute stress responses, including continuous acute stress symptom scores and the risk of probable acute stress disorder (ASD). A series of regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Longer media exposure time and social media use were associated with higher acute stress and probable ASD. Viewing the situation of infected patients was associated with higher acute stress, whereas viewing the latest news about pandemic data was associated with lower odds of probable ASD. Being females, living in Hubei Province, someone close to them diagnosed with COVID-19, history of mental illness, recent adverse life events and previous collective trauma exposure were risk factors for acute stress responses. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirmed the associations between indirect media exposure to pandemic events and acute stress responses.

The optimal individual preemptive or intraoperative anesthetic modality on postoperative pain control is not well-known. PURPOSE To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis comparing postoperative pain scores (visual analog scale [VAS]), opioid consumption, and incidence of complications during the first 24 hours after primary ACLR in patients receiving spinal anesthetic, adjunct regional nerve blocks, or local analgesics. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Biosis Previews, SPORTDiscus, Ovid, PEDRO, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched from inception to March 2020 for human studies, using a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) level 1 studies reporting on the use of spinal anesthesia, adjunct regional anesthesia (femoral nerve block [FNB] or adductor canal block [ACB]), or local analgesia in patients undergoing primary ACLR and (2) studies reporting on patient-reported VAS, opioid consumption, and incidence of complications related to anesthesia within the first 24 hours after surgery. Non-level 1 studies, studies utilizing a combination of anesthetic modalities, and those not reporting outcomes during the first 24 hours were excluded. Data were synthesized, and a random effects meta-analysis was performed to determine postoperative pain, opioid use, and complications based on anesthetic modality at multiple time points (0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24 hours). RESULTS A total of 263 studies were screened, of which 27 level 1 studies (n = 16 regional blocks; n = 12 local; n = 4 spinal) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. VAS scores were significantly lower in patients receiving a regional block as compared with spinal anesthesia 8 to 12 hours after surgery (P < .01), patients receiving an FNB versus ACB at 12 to 24 hours (P < .01), and those treated with a continuous FNB rather than single-shot regional blocks (FNB, ACB) at 12 to 24 hours (P < .01). No significant difference in VAS was appreciated when spinal, regional, and local anesthesia groups were compared. CONCLUSION Based on evidence from level 1 studies, pain control after primary ACLR based on VAS was significantly improved at 8 to 12 hours in patients receiving regional anesthesia as compared with spinal anesthesia. Pain scores were significantly lower at 12 to 24 hours in patients receiving FNB versus ACB and those treated with continuous FNB rather than single-shot regional anesthetic.","output":"Contribution of Multimodal Analgesia to Postoperative Pain Outcomes Immediately After Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Level 1 Randomized Clinical Trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: University students are increasingly reporting common mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, and they frequently face barriers to seeking psychological support because of stigma, cost, and availability of mental health services. This issue is even more critical in the challenging time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital mental health interventions, such as those delivered via chatbots on mobile devices, offer the potential to achieve scalability of healthy-coping interventions by lowering cost and supporting prevention. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to conduct a proof-of-concept evaluation measuring the engagement and effectiveness of Atena, a psychoeducational chatbot supporting healthy coping with stress and anxiety, among a population of university students. METHODS: In a proof-of-concept study, 71 university students were recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic; 68% (48/71) were female, they were all in their first year of university, and their mean age was 20.6 years (SD 2.4). Enrolled students were asked to use the Atena psychoeducational chatbot for 4 weeks (eight sessions; two per week), which provided healthy-coping strategies based on cognitive behavioral therapy, positive psychology, and mindfulness techniques. The intervention program consisted of conversations combined with audiovisual clips delivered via the Atena chatbot. Participants were asked to complete web-based versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) at baseline and postintervention to assess effectiveness. They were also asked to complete the User Engagement ScaleCShort Form at week 2 to assess engagement with the chatbot and to provide qualitative comments on their overall experience with Atena postintervention. RESULTS: Participants engaged with the Atena chatbot an average of 78 (SD 24.8) times over the study period. A total of 61 out of 71 (86%) participants completed the first 2 weeks of the intervention and provided data on engagement (10/71, 14% attrition). A total of 41 participants out of 71 (58%) completed the full intervention and the postintervention questionnaires (30/71, 42% attrition). Results from the completer analysis showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms for participants in more extreme GAD-7 score ranges (t(39)=0.94; P=.009) and a decrease in stress symptoms as measured by the PSS-10 (t(39)=2.00; P=.05) for all participants postintervention. Participants also improved significantly in the describing and nonjudging facets, based on their FFMQ subscale scores, and asked for some improvements in the user experience with the chatbot. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the benefit of deploying a digital healthy-coping intervention via a chatbot to support university students experiencing higher levels of distress.

Our primary goal is to understand some of the complex coupled dynamics between factors that ultimately regulate the epidemic case load. As potentially crucial factors, we focus on population mobility and vaccination patters (both related to risk of contracting the SARS-Cov2 virus). These factors may in turn depend on demographic parameters (which are unrelated to the epidemic evolution), but also on the population response to the epidemic outbreak itself. In our work, we use correlation analyses, in conjunction with open source data from US states, to investigate the type and strength (1) of the relationships between demographic measures and epidemic, mobility and vaccination timelines during our established time window; (2) of the bidirectional coupling between these timelines. We showed that the wide between-state differences in epidemic outcome correspond to between-state differences in demographic measures (such as density, income, political affiliation). As a potential underlying mechanism, we found that demographic measures are also predictive of the degree of coupling between epidemic timelines (on one hand) and vaccination and mobility timelines (on the other hand), coupling which can be broadly interpreted as the population's behavioral response to the epidemic. In support of this idea, our analysis shows this response to be tightly correlated with epidemic outcome.

The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. These host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation; therefore, relevant analyses on some key genes underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immuno-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones. The findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as non-ISGs that respond differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling from the canonical ISGs.

Furthermore, the significance of virus detection and its relationship to lower airway neutrophilic inflammation is poorly studied. Objectives To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of NPA for detecting respiratory viruses in BAL; and to determine the relationship between viruses and lower airway neutrophilia in children with non-acute respiratory illness. Study design 150 paired NPA and BAL samples were obtained from 75 children aged <18 years undergoing flexible bronchoscopy for investigation of chronic respiratory symptoms. Viral studies were performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cellularity studies were performed on BALs. Diagnostic parameters of NPA compared to BAL and associations between viruses and lower airway %neutrophils were evaluated. Results NPA had a higher yield than BAL for detection of any respiratory virus (52 versus 38, respectively). NPA had a high sensitivity (92%) and low specificity (57%) for detecting HRV in BAL with poor kappa agreement value of 0.398 (95% CI 0.218C0.578, p <0.001). NPA had a fair sensitivity (69%) and good specificity (90.3%) for detecting HAdV on BAL, kappa agreement was 0.561 (95% CI 0.321C0.801, p <0.001).

Our objectives were to evaluate long-term IgG antibody response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and B-cell memory response in COVID-19 convalescent subjects. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from a cohort of subjects recovering from COVID-19 and from healthy subjects who donated blood. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were quantitatively detected by ELISA using anti-S1 spike IgG. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG memory B cells were evaluated by reversed B-cell FluroSpot based on human IgG SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain in a randomly selected group of subjects recovering from COVID-19. Statistical analysis was performed with clinical variables and time post COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Antibody response was not detected in 26 of 392 COVID-19 convalescent subjects (6.6%). Over a period of 9 months, the level of antibodies decreased by 50% but stabilized at 6 months, and a protective level prevailed for up to 9 months. No differences were found regarding IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels for age, gender, and major blood types over time. Over time, asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects did not differ in antibody level from subjects with mild to severe disease. Repeated paired IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody level analyses disclosed that, over 6 and 9 months, 15.3% (nine of 59) and 15.8% (three of 19) of subjects became SARS-CoV-2 IgG-seronegative, respectively, all with a low antibody level at 3 months. Rate of antibody decline was not affected by age, gender, or clinical symptomatology. In a subgroup of recovering subjects, memory B-cell response up to 9 months post-COVID-19 infection was undetectable in 31.8% of subjects (14/44), and there was no correlation with age, SARS-CoV-2 antibody level, or time post infection.

Yet human mobility patterns vary substantially between countries and regions. Quantifying the frequency of travel and length of journeys in well-defined population is therefore critical for predicting the likely speed and pattern of spread of emerging infectious diseases, such as a new influenza pandemic. Here we present the results of a large population survey undertaken in 2007 in two areas of China: Shenzhen city in Guangdong province, and Huangshan city in Anhui province. In each area, 10,000 randomly selected individuals were interviewed, and data on regular and occasional journeys collected. Travel behaviour was examined as a function of age, sex, economic status and home location. Women and children were generally found to travel shorter distances than men. Travel patterns in the economically developed Shenzhen region are shown to resemble those in developed and economically advanced middle income countries with a significant fraction of the population commuting over distances in excess of 50 km. Conversely, in the less developed rural region of Anhui, travel was much more local, with very few journeys over 30 km. Travel patterns in both populations were well-fitted by a gravity model with a lognormal kernel function. The results provide the first quantitative information on human travel patterns in modern China, and suggest that a pandemic emerging in a less developed area of rural China might spread geographically sufficiently slowly for containment to be feasible, while spatial spread in the more economically developed areas might be expected to be much more rapid, making containment more difficult.","output":"Travel Patterns in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased triacylglycerols (TAG) synthesis, insulin resistance, and prolonged liver lipid storage might lead to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

For approximately 56,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Reception and Identification Centers (RICs) and Reception Sites (RS) in Greece, living in severely substandard living conditions, prevention measures have been impossible with limited provision in terms of routine testing, surveillance, and access to healthcare. These migrant populations have experienced prolonged lockdowns and restricted movement since the pandemic began. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on refugees and asylum seekers in reception facilities in Greece and explore implications for policy and practice. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of policy documents and national surveillance data was conducted to identify COVID-19 outbreaks and estimate incidence among asylum seekers and refugees residing in these camps during the first 9 months of the epidemic in Greece (26th February C 15th November 2020). Incidence proportion (IP) of COVID-19 confirmed cases was calculated for three population groups (refugees and asylum seekers in RICs, refugees and asylum seekers in RSs, and the general population in Greece) during three time periods (first wave, second wave, and overall across the 9-month period). FINDINGS: Twenty-five COVID-19 outbreaks were identified in refugee and asylum seeker reception facilities, with 6 (85.7%) of 7 RICs and 18 (56.3%) of 32 RSs reporting at least one outbreak during the study period. The overall 9-month COVID-19 IP among refugee and asylum seeker populations residing in RSs on the Greek mainland was 1758 cases per 100,000 population; in RICs the incidence was 2052 cases per 100,000 population. Compared to the general population the risk of COVID-19 infection among refugees and asylum seekers in reception facilities was 2.5 to 3 times higher (p-value<0.001). The risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection was higher among refugee and asylum seeker populations in RSs on the Greek mainland (IP ratio: 2.45; 95% CI: 2.25C2.68) but higher still among refugee and asylum seeker populations in RICs in the Greek islands and the land border with Turkey (IP ratio: 2.86; 95% CI: 2.64C3.10), where living conditions are particularly poor. INTERPRETATION: We identified high levels of COVID-19 transmission among refugees and asylum seekers in reception facilities in Greece. The risk of COVID-19 infection among these enclosed population groups has been significantly higher than the general population of Greece, and risk increases as living conditions deteriorate. These data have immediate implications for policy and practice. Strategies are now needed to ensure refugee and asylum seeker populations are included in national response plans to reduce transmission in at-risk groups for COVID-19, alongside inclusion in plans for COVID-19 vaccine roll out.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on refugees and asylum seekers in Greece: A retrospective analysis of national surveillance data from 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak in December 2019, starting from the Chinese city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province, and rapidly spreading to the rest of the world.

We argue that this issue is primarily explained by the misalignment between a firm's global sourcing strategy and value expected from its global sourcing activities. This study examines the role of global sourcing strategy on financial and innovation performance of global sourcing activities. Using a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis on 235 firms engaging in global sourcing of business service activities, we identify configurations of global sourcing strategyconcerning (1) disaggregation, (2) dispersion of activities and (3) governance structurethat lead to high financial and innovation performance. The findings suggest that global sourcing strategy leading to high financial performance differs largely from global sourcing strategy leading to high innovation. While most studies selectively focus on one or two components of global sourcing strategy, our study highlights the need for firms to jointly consider the combined effect of degree of disaggregation, degree of dispersion of business service activities and governance structure as well as taking into account the expected outcome when crafting their global sourcing strategy.","output":"Designing Global Sourcing Strategy for Cost Savings and Innovation: A Configurational Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized cancer treatment, with agents such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and cemiplimab targeting programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and durvalumab, avelumab, and atezolizumab targeting PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Ipilimumab targets cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). These inhibitors have shown remarkable efficacy in melanoma, lung cancer, urothelial cancer, and a variety of solid tumors, either as single agents or in combination with other anticancer modalities. Additional indications are continuing to evolve. Checkpoint inhibitors are associated with less toxicity when compared to chemotherapy. These agents enhance the antitumor immune response and produce side- effects known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Although the incidence of immune checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (ICI-Pneumonitis) is relatively low, this complication is likely to cause the delay or cessation of immunotherapy and, in severe cases, may be associated with treatment-related mortality. The primary mechanism of ICI-Pneumonitis remains unclear, but it is believed to be associated with the immune dysregulation caused by ICIs. The development of irAEs may be related to increased T cell activity against cross-antigens expressed in tumor and normal tissues. Treatment with ICIs is associated with an increased number of activated alveolar T cells and reduced activity of the anti-inflammatory Treg phenotype, leading to dysregulation of T cell activity. This review discusses the pathogenesis of alveolar pneumonitis and the incidence, diagnosis, and clinical management of pulmonary toxicity, as well as the pulmonary complications of ICIs, either as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer modalities, such as thoracic radiotherapy.","output":"Pulmonary Toxicities Associated With the Use of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: An Update From the Immuno-Oncology Subgroup of the Neutropenia, Infection & Myelosuppression Study Group of the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic activity in numerous sectors due to multiple forms of disruption, including border closures, a stay-at-home policy, and social isolation; the electricity consumption trends in this region will undoubtedly improve.

User comfort is critically important for societal adoption of exos. Thermal comfort (a persons satisfaction with their thermal environment) represents a key design challenge. Exos must physically attach/interface to the body to apply forces, and these interfaces inevitably trap some heat. It is envisioned that thermal comfort could be improved by designing mode-switching exo interfaces that temporarily loosen around a body segment when assistive forces are not being applied. To inform exo design, a case series study (N = 4) based on single-subject design principles was performed. Our objective was to assess individual responses to skin temperature and thermal comfort during physical activity with a Loose leg-sleeve interface compared with a Form-Fitting one, and immediately after a Form-Fitting sleeve switched to Loose. Skin under the Loose sleeve was 2C3 C (4C6 F) cooler after 25 min of physical activity, and two of four participants reported the Loose sleeve improved their thermal comfort. After completion of the physical activity, the Form-Fitting sleeve was loosened, causing a 2C4 C (3C8 F) drop in skin temperature underneath for all participants, and two participants to report slightly improved thermal comfort. These findings confirmed that an exo that can quickly loosen its interface when assistance is not requiredand re-tighten when it is has the potential to enhance thermal comfort for some individuals and environments. More broadly, this study demonstrates that mode-switching mechanisms in exos can do more than adjust physical assistance: they can also exploit thermodynamics and facilitate thermoregulation in a way that enhances comfort for exo users.","output":"Exoskeletons and Exosuits Could Benefit from Mode-Switching Body Interfaces That Loosen/Tighten to Improve Thermal Comfort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging problem of the present.

Despite the well-known benefits, physical inactivity remains one of the major contributing factors to ill-health throughout industrialized countries. Traditional lifestyle interventions such as group education or telephone counseling are effective at increasing physical activity participation; however, physical activity levels tend to decline over time. Consumer-based wearable activity trackers that allow users to objectively monitor activity levels are now widely available and may offer an alternative method for assisting individuals to remain physically active. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to determine the effects of interventions utilizing consumer-based wearable activity trackers on physical activity participation and sedentary behavior when compared with interventions that do not utilize activity tracker feedback. METHODS A systematic review was performed searching the following databases for studies that included the use of a consumer-based wearable activity tracker to improve physical activity participation: Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, SPORTDiscus, and Health Technology Assessments. Controlled trials of adults comparing the use of a consumer-based wearable activity tracker with other nonactivity tracker-based interventions were included. The main outcome measures were physical activity participation and sedentary behavior. All studies were assessed for risk of bias, and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to rank the quality of evidence. The guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement were followed. A random-effects meta-analysis was completed on the included outcome measures to estimate the treatment effect of interventions that included an activity tracker compared with a control group. RESULTS There was a significant increase in daily step count (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.24; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.33; P<.001), moderate and vigorous physical activity (SMD 0.27; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.39; P<.001), and energy expenditure (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.54; P=.03) and a nonsignificant decrease in sedentary behavior (SMD -0.20; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.03; P=.08) following the intervention versus control comparator across all studies in the meta-analyses. In general, included studies were at low risk of bias, except for performance bias. Heterogeneity varied across the included meta-analyses ranging from low (I2=3%) for daily step count through to high (I2=67%) for sedentary behavior. CONCLUSIONS Utilizing a consumer-based wearable activity tracker as either the primary component of an intervention or as part of a broader physical activity intervention has the potential to increase physical activity participation. As the effects of physical activity interventions are often short term, the inclusion of a consumer-based wearable activity tracker may provide an effective tool to assist health professionals to provide ongoing monitoring and support.","output":"Consumer-Based Wearable Activity Trackers Increase Physical Activity Participation: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies suggested that pharmacological inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by ACE inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase local angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression.

METHODS: We established a Patient Advisory Group (PAG) to co-produce patient information about having surgery during the pandemic, and the risks of perioperative SARS-CoV-2, using information from the CovidSurg international surgical cohort studies. RESULTS: The PAG were keen for patients to understand the high risks of mortality and serious breathing complications associated with perioperative SARS-CoV-2. They wanted detailed information about what patients can do to stay safe and about the measures hospitals are taking to keep them safe. What patients wanted to know was not always what surgeons presupposed. We co-produced patient resources with separate versions for dyslexia and learning disabled patients. We published 18 translations within a few weeks and hosted them in purpose-built web pages. We generated PAG-approved lay summaries to share our original research findings with patients.

Bridging social capital through sports programs had a significant moderating effect on the proposed relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Strong bridging social capital through employer-sponsored sports programs is likely to buffer the detrimental effect of job insecurity on employee well-being.","output":"Employer-Sponsored Sports Programs amid COVID-19: The Approach of Social Capital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Early reports suggest that patients with COVID-19 infection carry a significant risk of altered coagulation with an increased risk for venous thromboembolic events. This report investigates the relationship of significant COVID-19 infection and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) as reflected in the patient clinical/laboratory characteristics. METHODS: We reviewed demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory/radiological evaluations, Results of venous duplex imaging and mortality of COVID-19 positive patients (18-89 years) admitted to the Indiana University Academic Health Center. Using oxygen saturation, radiological findings and need for advanced respiratory therapies; patients were classified into mild, moderate or severe categories of COVID-19 infection. Descriptive analysis was performed using univariate and bivariate Fishers exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to examine the distribution of patient characteristics and compare the DVT outcomes. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the Adjusted Odds Ratio of experiencing DVT while a Receiver Operating Curve (ROC)analysis to identify the optimal cutoff for d-dimer to predict DVT in this COVID-19 cohort. Time to the diagnosis of DVT from admission was analyzed using log-rank test and Kaplan Meier plots. RESULTS: Our study included 71 unique COVID-19 positive patients (mean age 61 years) categorized as having 3% mild, 14% moderate and 83% severe infection and evaluated with 107 venous duplex studies. DVT was identified in 47.8% of patients (37% examinations) at an average of 5.9 days post admission. Patients with DVT were predominantly male (67%, p =0.032) with proximal venous involvement. (29% upper and 39% in the lower extremities with 55% of the latter demonstrating bilateral involvement). Patients with DVT had a significantly higher mean d-dimer of 5447 ng/ml (SD 7032, p=0.0101), and Alkaline Phosphatase (Alk Po4) of 110 IU/L (p=0.0095) than those without DVT. On multivariable analysis, elevated d-dimer (p=0.038) & Alk Po4 (p=0.021) were associated with risk for DVT while age, gender, elevated CRP and ferritin levels were not. ROC analysis suggests an optimal d-dimer value of 2450 ng/ml cutoff with 70% sensitivity, 59.5% specificity, and 61% positive and 68.8% negative predictive values. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that males with severe COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalization are at highest risk for developing DVT.

However, there is yet no general understanding of the rules and optimized conditions governing the virucidal properties of engineered surfaces. The understanding is crucial for designing antiviral surfaces. Previous studies reported that the drying time of a residual thin-film after the evaporation of a bulk respiratory droplet on a smooth surface correlates with the coronavirus survival time. Recently, we [Chatterjee et al., Phys. Fluids. 33, 021701 (2021)] showed that the evaporation is much faster on porous than impermeable surfaces, making the porous surfaces lesser susceptible to virus survival. The faster evaporation on porous surfaces was attributed to an enhanced disjoining pressure within the thin-film due the presence of horizontally oriented fibers and void spaces. Motivated by this, we explore herein the disjoining pressure-driven thin-film evaporation mechanism and thereby the virucidal properties of engineered surfaces with varied wettability and texture. A generic model is developed which agrees qualitatively well with the previous virus titer measurements on nanostructured surfaces. Thereafter, we design model surfaces and report the optimized conditions for roughness and wettability to achieve the most prominent virucidal effect. We have deciphered that the optimized thin-film lifetime can be gained by tailoring wettability and roughness, irrespective of the nature of texture geometry. The present study expands the applicability of the process and demonstrates ways to design antiviral surfaces, thereby aiding to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. ? 2021 Author(s).","output":"Designing antiviral surfaces to suppress the spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To systematically clarify attitudes and influencing factors of the public towards COVID-19 vaccination for children or adolescents.

The historical reluctance to invest in non-coding RNA stems partly from requirements for drug targets to adopt a single stable conformation2. Most RNAs can adopt several conformations of similar stabilities. RNA structures also remain challenging to determine3. Nonetheless, an increasing number of diseases are now being attributed to non-coding RNA4 and the ability to target them would vastly expand the chemical space for drug development. Here we devise a screening strategy and identify small molecules that bind the non-coding RNA prototype Xist5. The X1 compound has drug-like properties and binds specifically the RepA motif6 of Xist in vitro and in vivo. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis reveals that RepA can adopt multiple conformations but favours one structure in solution. X1 binding reduces the conformational space of RepA, displaces cognate interacting protein factors (PRC2 and SPEN), suppresses histone H3K27 trimethylation, and blocks initiation of X-chromosome inactivation. X1 inhibits cell differentiation and growth in a female-specific manner. Thus, RNA can be systematically targeted by drug-like compounds that disrupt RNA structure and epigenetic function.","output":"Targeting Xist with compounds that disrupt RNA structure and X inactivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Background Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) mainly occur in the elderly but can rarely affect younger individuals too. The correct diagnosis relies on careful morphologic evaluation, cytogenetic/molecular results, and excluding reactive conditions mimicking MDS. We present the clinical, pathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of a case of MDS with excess blasts-2 (MDS-EB-2) in a 30-year-old male who was found to have pancytopenia during his hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and discuss the diagnostic challenges of MDS in patients with COVID-19. Case presentation A 30-year-old man presented to an outside hospital with fever, chills, weakness, coughing spells, dizziness and shortness of breath and was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia due to COVID-19. At the outside hospital, he was found to be pancytopenic, and a subsequent bone marrow aspiration and biopsy raised concern for a COVID-19 induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In addition, MDS could not be ruled out. The patient was thus referred to our institute for further management. The patient's peripheral blood showed pancytopenia with occasional dysplastic neutrophils and a few teardrop cells. Given the diagnostic uncertainty, a bone marrow aspiration and a biopsy were repeated revealing a hypercellular bone marrow with erythroid hyperplasia, megakaryocytic hyperplasia, trilineage dysplasia, increased blasts (13%), many ring sideroblasts, and mild to moderate myelofibrosis, consistent with MDS-EB-2. Chromosomal analysis revealed isochromosome 14. Next generation sequencing demonstrated SF3B1 K700E mutation. Discussion and conclusion The diagnosis of MDS can be challenging, particularly in young patients. Cytopenia and myelodysplastic features have been reported in COVID-19 patients, making the diagnosis of MDS more elusive. A careful pathologic examination of the bone marrow with ancillary studies including flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetic and molecular studies in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation, leads to the accurate diagnosis.","output":"Myelodysplastic syndrome in a 30-year-old man with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a diagnostic challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the changes of the respiratory infectious diseases (RID) and air quality during the COVID-19 outbreak over Yangtze River Delta Region, China.

Due to the influence of the antenna radiation power and the low-pass filtering function of the earth medium, an intense amplitude gain cannot be obtained when the signal is intercepted. This article addresses a plane beam signal ground penetrating radar array observation method based on high radiation power gain. The transmitting antenna array simultaneously excites the pulse signal with the same centre frequency. All the transmitted signals interfere with each other at the near surface to form a plane beam signal, and the electromagnetic energy is superimposed mutually to increase the radiation power. We applied the plane beam signal ground penetrating radar array method to different geological models constructed by the finite difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm for numerical simulation in this research. Since there are various offsets in the array ground penetrating radar observation method, we introduce a composite frequency shift-perfect matching layer (CFS-PML) based on the recursive convolution method as the absorbing boundary condition. It eliminates the problem of secondary reflection caused by the angle variation of the incident wave. The research result shows that the plane beam signal illuminates the target uniformly in space, can eliminate the discontinuity in profile data caused by the directivity of the antenna, improve the stability and quality of the echo signal, and enrich the target response parameters.","output":"Research on application of ground penetrating radar array method based on plane beam signal in different geological models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1Minimizing the human and economic costs of the COVID-19 pandemic and of future pandemics requires the ability to develop and deploy effective treatments for novel pathogens as soon as possible after they emerge.

METHODS: We included 424 patients with non-severe COVID-19 on admission from January 17, 2020, to February 17, 2020, in the primary cohort of this retrospective multicenter study. The extent of lung involvement was quantified on chest CT images by a deep learningCbased framework. The composite endpoint was the occurrence of severe or critical COVID-19 or death during hospitalization. The optimal machine learning classifier and feature subset were selected for model construction. The performance was further tested in an external validation cohort consisting of 98 patients. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the prevalence of adverse outcomes (8.7% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.858) between the primary and validation cohorts. The machine learning method extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and optimal feature subset including lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), presence of comorbidity, CT lesion ratio (lesion%), and hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) were selected for model construction. The XGBoost classifier based on the optimal feature subset performed well for the prediction of developing adverse outcomes in the primary and validation cohorts, with AUCs of 0.959 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.936C0.976) and 0.953 (95% CI: 0.891C0.986), respectively. Furthermore, the XGBoost classifier also showed clinical usefulness.

In light of the foregoing, it is suggested that vitamin D may play an important role in the course of COVID-19 infection. This study, therefore, aimed to examine the relationship between vitamin D levels and length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients. METHODS This retrospective study was conducted between March 15th and October 15th, 2020, among 768 patients who were hospitalized due to the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed with PCR tests taken at the Health Sciences University, Antalya Training and Research Hospital. The study included 39 patients aged 18 - 65 years, whose 25 (OH) vitamin D levels were examined within 3 months prior to the diagnosis with PCR, and whose results were found  30 ng/mL, and those patients whose 25 (OH) vitamin D levels were examined within 3 months after the diagnosis with PCR, and whose results were found < 30 ng/mL. The patients were grouped according to 25 (OH) vitamin D levels and evaluated in terms of length of hospital stay. RESULTS Of all the 39 patients in this study, 61.5% were female, 38.5% were male, with a mean age of 48.64  11.79 years. The average of 25 (OH) vitamin D levels of the patients was 21.44  11.17 ng/mL, the average length of hospital stay was 9.41  8.90 days. The length of stay was found to increase significantly in participants who were 45 years and older, who were male, those with chronic diseases, and those with lung involvement detected on thoracic CT imaging at the time of admission. No statistically significant difference appeared with respect to the length of hospital stay when the patients were evaluated according to their 25 (OH) vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS No statistically significant relationship was found between the patients' length of hospital stay due to the COVID-19 infection and their 25 (OH) vitamin D levels in patients aged 18 - 65 years. Further prospective clinical studies still need to be conducted with large numbers of patients excluding independent risk factors such as the presence of a chronic disease.","output":"25 (OH) Vitamin D Levels of Patients with COVID-19 are not Associated with the Length of Hospital Stay."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To prevent the Covid-19 pandemic, the government issued a policy for schools to apply lessons from home.

By firstly reviewing and highlighting relevant technologies and related projects, this report synthesizes the state of the art in offshore energy system integration, by focusing on three key technologies in electrification/floating wind, electrolysis/hydrogen production and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). With a timeframe out to 2050 and model scope including all North Sea neighbouring countries, this analysis explores a total of nine future scenarios for the North Sea energy system. The main results include an immediate electrification of all operational DUC platforms by linking them to the shore and/or a planned Danish energy island. These measures result in cost and CO2 emissions savings compared to a BAU scenario of 72% and 85% respectively. When these platforms cease production, this is followed by the repurposing of the platforms into hydrogen generators with up to 3.6 GW of electrolysers and the development of up to 5.8 GW of floating wind. The generated hydrogen is assumed to power the future transport sector, and is delivered to shore in existing and/or new purpose-built pipelines. The contribution of the O&G sector to this hydrogen production amounts to around 19 TWh, which represents about 2% of total European hydrogen demand for transport in 2050. The levelized costs (LCOE) of producing this hydrogen in 2050 are around 4 euro2012/kg H2, which is around twice those expected in similar studies.

Deletion of Notch4 in Treg cells or therapy with anti-Notch4 antibodies in conventional and humanized mice normalized the dysregulated innate immunity and rescued disease morbidity and mortality induced by a synthetic analog of viral RNA or by influenza H1N1 virus. Mechanistically, Notch4 suppressed the induction by interleukin-18 of amphiregulin, a cytokine necessary for tissue repair. Protection by Notch4 inhibition was recapitulated by therapy with Amphiregulin and, reciprocally, abrogated by its antagonism. Amphiregulin declined in COVID-19 subjects as a function of disease severity and Notch4 expression. Thus, Notch4 expression on Treg cells dynamically restrains amphiregulin-dependent tissue repair to promote severe lung inflammation, with therapeutic implications for COVID-19 and related infections.","output":"Notch4 signaling limits regulatory T-cell-mediated tissue repair and promotes severe lung inflammation in viral infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this period of Covid-19 pandemic, in which there were sudden changes in education, with the transition from traditional education to e-learning, it is essential to analyze the impacts related to access and use of technology in the context of e-learning, in the perception of higher education students.

Data were collected through a questionnaire, which includes a set of 26 items that aim to assess students perceptions about distance learning using six different subscales: Familiarity, Barriers, Anxiety, Usefulness, Ease of use, and Satisfaction concerning the e-learning. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis was performed using Partial Least Squares (PLS), to test the validity of the constructs and the model hypotheses. The results revealed a statistically significant relationship between Satisfaction concerning the distance learning and the constructs Barriers, Ease of use and Usefulness. Based on the model used, other significant interrelationships were registered, such as familiarity with technology positively affects the ease of use of technological resources and barriers, while anxiety negatively affects the ease of use of these resources and the usefulness for students.

Spreading globally, it is now considered pandemic, with approximately 3 million cases worldwide at the end of April. Its symptoms include fever, cough, and headache, but the main one is shortness of breath. In turn, it is believed that there is a relationship between COVID-19 and damage to the heart muscle, and hypertensive and diabetic patients, for example, seem to have worse prognosis. Therefore, COVID-19 may worsen in individuals with underlying adverse conditions, and a not negligible number of patients hospitalized with this virus had cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. Systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression may be behind this association. In addition, the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptors, more precisely ACE2, to penetrate the cell; therefore, the use of ACE inhibitor drugs and angiotensin receptor blockers could cause an increase in these receptors, thus facilitating the entry of the virus into the cell. There is, however, no scientific evidence to support the interruption of these drugs. Since they are fundamental for certain chronic diseases, the risk and benefit of their withdrawal in this scenario should be carefully weighed.

METHODS: Subjects who had prior uncomplicated cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of one of the lenses above were evaluated. Subjects in each group were assessed during a single visit. The uncorrected and best distance-corrected binocular near (40 cm), intermediate (60 cm), and distance visual acuity (VA) were measured, along with a spectacle independence questionnaire, a quality of vision questionnaire and contrast sensitivity measured in both mesopic and photopic conditions. RESULTS: The study included 23 EDOF and 25 trifocal subjects. Binocular Uncorrected VAs were similar at distance and intermediate, but about 1.5 lines better at near with the trifocal (p < 0.001). Binocular best corrected distance C VA was significantly better with the EDOF lens (0.5 lines, p < 0.001), though the mean VA was better than 20/20 in both groups. Distance-corrected intermediate and near VA were significantly better with the trifocal IOL (1 line and 1.5 lines respectively, p < 0.001). Significantly more trifocal subjects had 20/25 or better VA at all three test distances (64% vs 4%, p<0.001). Patient reported spectacle independence was significantly higher in the trifocal group, driven primarily by differences in near vision. Mesopic and photopic binocular contrast sensitivity, satisfaction and subjective quality of vision scores were similar between groups.

The recent trend of vaccinating against COVID-19 pandemic reveals a strong control of infectious disease. On the other hand, it is observed in some countries that, the vaccine application offers less control over the spread of virus, since some portion of vaccinated people is not totally protected/immuned and viable to infection again after a while due to weak/loss immunity offered by the vaccine. This requires transition from vaccinated department to infected for COVID-19. This character of COVID-19 helps us reconsideration of the vaccinated department by letting some part of it being exposed to the infection again. Taking this into account, as a result of modification of the SIR model, the epidemiology is now governed with three main epidemic dimensionless parameters, having provided an initial fraction of infected individuals. The dimensionless model with these parameters is analyzed initially from the stability point of view. The effects of weak immunity are then illustrated numerically on some chosen parameter range. How some of the countries applying the COVID-19 vaccine programs affected by weak/loss immunity is eventually examined with the modified model. The rate of vaccination as well as the basic Reproduction number are found to affect the epidemic demography of the population subject to weak or loss of immunity.

This study aimed to measure the influence of Japanese family physicians attire on the human aspects of medical care in terms of patient-perceived relational empathy. METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective, controlled trial conducted in primary clinics in Japan. We explored the effects of family physician attire (white coat vs. casual attire) on patient-perceived empathy. Family physicians were allocated to alternate weeks of wearing a white coat or casual attire during consultations. Patients perceptions of physician empathy were evaluated using the self-rated Japanese Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure. We used a linear mixed model to analyze the CARE Measure scores, adjusting for cluster effects of patients nested within doctor, age, and sex of patients, and doctors sex and years of clinical experience. We used the same method with Bonferroni adjustment to analyze patient sex differences in perceived empathy. RESULTS: A total of 632 patients of seven family physicians were allocated to white coat-wearing consultations (n = 328), and casual attire-wearing consultations (n = 304). There was no difference in CARE Measure scores between white coat and casual primary care consultations overall (p = 0.162). Subgroup analysis of patient sex showed that CARE Measure scores of male patients were significantly higher in the Casual group than in the White coat group (adjusted p-value = 0.044). There was no difference in female patient scores between White coat and Casual groups (adjusted p-value = 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that physician attire (white coat or casual attire) in a primary care setting did not affect patient-perceived relational empathy overall.

We attempt to quantify the impact of the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic on a paediatric ophthalmology unit in a childrens hospital in the United Kingdom (UK) and report lessons learnt to aid in the recovery of the service. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Two eight-week periods of clinical activity were compared; one during the first UK peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the other during a similar period the previous year. Four areas of clinical activity were included in the study: outpatient clinic appointments, theatre activity, outpatient referrals to ophthalmology and ward reviews. Appointment data was collected from departmental databases. RESULTS: During the first peak of the pandemic, outpatient clinic appointments were reduced by 87.2%, ophthalmic surgery by 90.9%, outpatient referrals to ophthalmology by 50.2% and ward reviews by 50%. The number of actual cancelled appointments was 1377, of which 6.8% were triaged as suitable for teleophthalmology. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically restricted clinical activity in the ophthalmology service.

The increase of coagulant aids dosage improved the effect of adsorption and sweep flocculation significantly. Moreover, jar tests carried in different conditions demonstrated that the current coagulation systems were highly adaptable.","output":"Enhanced removal of polyethylene terephthalate microplastics through polyaluminum chloride coagulation with three typical coagulant aids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fritillaria naturally grows in the temperate region of Northern Hemisphere and mainly distributes in Central Asia, Mediterranean region, and North America. The dried bulbs from a dozen species of this genus have been usually used as herbal medicine, named Beimu in China. Beimu had rich sources of phytochemicals and have extensively applied to respiratory diseases including coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Fritillaria species have alkaloids that act as the main active components that contribute multiple biological activities, including anti-tussive, expectorant, and anti-asthmatic effects, especially against certain respiratory diseases. Other compounds (terpenoids, steroidal saponins, and phenylpropanoids) have also been identified in species of Fritillaria. In this review, readers will discover a brief summary of traditional uses and a comprehensive description of the chemical profiles, biological properties, and analytical techniques used for quality control. In general, the detailed summary reveals 293 specialized metabolites that have been isolated and analyzed in Fritillaria species. This review may provide a scientific basis for the chemical ecology and metabolomics in which compound identification of certain species remains a limiting step.","output":"Natural drug sources for respiratory diseases from Fritillaria: chemical and biological analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: The theft of drugs from healthcare facilities, also known as drug diversion, occurs frequently but is often undetected. This paper describes a research study to develop and test novel drug diversion detection methods. Improved diversion detection and reduction in diversion improves patient safety, limits harm to the person diverting, reduces the public health impact of substance use disorder, and mitigates significant liability risk to pharmacists and their organizations. METHODS: Ten acute care inpatient hospitals across 4 independent health systems extracted 2 datasets from various health information technology systems. Both datasets were consolidated, normalized, classified, and sampled to provide a harmonious dataset for analysis. Supervised machine learning methods were iteratively used on the initial sample dataset to train algorithms to classify medication movement transactions as involving a low or high risk of diversion. Thereafter, the resulting machine learning model classified the risk of diversion in a historical dataset capturing 8 to 24 months of history that included 27.9 million medication movement transactions by 19,037 nursing, 1,047 pharmacy, and 712 anesthesia clinicians and that included 22 known, blinded diversion cases to measure when the model would have detected the diversion compared to when the diversion was actually detected by existing methods. RESULTS: The machine learning model had 95.9% specificity and 96.6% sensitivity in detecting transactions involving a high risk of diversion using the initial sample dataset. In subsequent testing using the much larger historical dataset, the analytics detected known diversion cases (n = 22) in blinded data faster than existing detection methods (a mean of 160 days and a median of 74 days faster;range, 7-579 days faster). CONCLUSION: The study showed that (1) consolidated datasets and (2) supervised machine learning can detect known diversion cases faster than existing detection methods. Users of the technology also noted improved investigation efficiency.","output":"Detecting drug diversion in health-system data using machine learning and advanced analytics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public choice scholars have attended only modestly to issues in public health.

Therefore, there is an imperative to develop novel highly efficient (synthetic) agents against both drug-sensitive-TB and DR-TB. The exploration of various heterocycles as prospective core scaffolds for the discovery, development and optimization of anti-TB drugs remains an intriguing scientific endeavour. Telacebec (Q203;TCB), a molecule containing an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IPA) structural motif, is considered a novel very promising anti-TB agent showing a unique mechanism of action. The compound blocks oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting a mycobacterial respiratory chain due to interference with a specific cytochrome b subunit (QcrB) of transmembrane bc1 menaquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase as an essential component for transporting electrons across the membrane from menaquinol to other specific subunit, cytochrome c (QcrC). Thus, the ability of mycobacteria to synthesize adenosine-5-triphosphate is limited and energy generating machinery is disabled. The TCB molecule effectively fights drug-susceptible, MDR as well as XDR M. tuberculosis strains. The article briefly explains a mechanism of an anti-TB action related to the compounds containing a variously substituted IPA scaffold and is focused on their fundamental structure-anti-TB activity relationships as well. Special consideration is paid to TCB indicating the importance of particular structural fragments for maintaining (or even improving) favourable pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and/or toxicological properties. High lipophilicity of TCB might be regarded as one of the key physicochemical properties with positive impact on anti-TB effect of the drug.

To date, no studies evaluated the posterior component separation with transversus abdominis release (TAR) to repair complex IH after OLT. We aim to report the outcomes of TAR in this scenario. STUDY DESIGN OLT patients who underwent open, elective IH repair with TAR performed at two centers and with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were identified in the Americas Hernia Society Quality Collaborative (AHSQC). Outcomes included 30-day surgical site infections (SSI), surgical site occurrences requiring procedural intervention (SSOPI), unplanned readmissions, reoperations, and hernia recurrence. RESULTS Forty-four patients were identified (mean age 60  8, 75% male, median BMI 30.7 kg/m2) at two centers. Median hernia width was 20 cm [IQR 15-28] and 98% (43) were clean cases. Retromuscular synthetic mesh was used in all cases, and 93% (41) achieved fascial closure with no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, there were 5 SSIs (4 deep, 1 superficial), 6 SSOPIs (4 wound opening, 1 debridement, 1 seroma drainage), four (9%) readmissions, and 3 (7%) reoperations. One patient developed a mesh infection that did not require mesh excision. After a median follow-up of 13 months [IQR 12-17], there were 11 (25%) recurrences; 8 due to central mesh fractures (CMF). Seven recurrences have been repaired either laparoscopically or using an onlay. CONCLUSIONS In a challenging cohort of immunosuppressed patients with large IH, TAR was shown to have acceptable medium-term results, but high recurrence rate driven by CMF. Further studies investigating the mechanism of central mesh fractures are necessary to reduce these recurrences.","output":"Posterior component separation with transversus abdominis release (TAR) for repair of complex incisional hernias after orthotopic liver transplantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines are a powerful and relatively safe tool to protect against a range of serious diseases.

One potential application of RADTs is to facilitate gatherings of individuals, through testing of attendees at the point of, or immediately prior to entry at a venue. Understanding the baseline risk in the tested population is of particular importance when evaluating the utility of applying diagnostic tests for screening purposes. We used incidence data to estimate the prevalence of infectious individuals in the community at a particular time point and simulated mass gatherings by sampling from a series of age cohorts. Nine different illustrative scenarios were simulated, small (n=100), medium (n=1000) and large (n=10,000) gatherings each with 3 possible age constructs: mostly younger, mostly older or a gathering with equal numbers from each age cohort. For each scenario, we estimated the prevalence of infectious attendees, then simulated the likely number of positive and negative test results, the proportion of cases detected and the corresponding positive and negative predictive values, and the cost per case identified. Our findings suggest that for each detected individual on a given day, there are likely to be 13.8 additional infectious individuals also present in the community. Prevalence of infectious individuals at events was highest with mostly younger attendees (1.00%), followed by homogenous age gatherings (0.55%) and lowest with mostly older events (0.26%). For small events (100 attendees) the expected number of infectious attendees was less than 1 across all age constructs of attendees. For large events (10,000 attendees) the expected number of infectious attendees ranged from 26 (95% confidence intervals 12 to 45) for mostly older events, to almost 100 (95% confidence intervals 46 to 174) infectious attendees for mostly younger attendees.

METHODS A randomized, controlled trial included 29 healthy, full-term newborns born at the University of Chicago Hospital. Both groups of infants were given 1.0 mL of 25% sucrose solution 2 minutes before the vaccination, and 1 group additionally was given radiant warmth from an infant warmer before the vaccination. We assessed pain by comparing differences in cry, grimace, heart rate variability (ie, respiratory sinus arrhythmia), and heart rate between the groups. RESULTS The sucrose plus warmer group cried and grimaced for 50% less time after the vaccination than the sucrose alone group (P < .05, respectively). The sucrose plus warmer group had lower heart rate and heart rate variability (ie, respiratory sinus arrhythmia) responses compared with the sucrose alone group (P < .01), reflecting a greater ability to physiologically regulate in response to the painful vaccination.

The chicks were vaccinated against IBV on the second day of life with the vaccine Ma5, but at the age of 18 days, they exhibited clinical signs and macroscopic lesions compatible with avian infectious bronchitis (IB). In the clinical disease stage, the Ma5 vaccine strain was detected in the trachea, lungs, and small intestine of the chicks, while IBV variants were detected in the bursa of Fabricius and kidneys. Subsequently, new samples were collected from the same batch at the end of the production cycle. In this phase, the Ma5 vaccine strain was detected in the kidneys, small intestine, and oviduct of the hens. However, a previously unidentified IBV variant was found in the cecal tonsils. Additionally, a fragment of viral RNA with that was completely identical to the corresponding region of the Ma5 vaccine was detected in the allantoic fluid of viable embryos from the hens under study after 18 days of incubation. These findings suggest that, in addition to the Ma5 vaccine, other strains of IBV variants can coexist, seeming to establish a chronic infection in the chickens, and that they can potentially be transmitted vertically.

We introduce a distinction between potential resilience versus revealed resilience where the former is assessed based on resilience capacities (robustness, adaptability and transformability), while the latter is assessed based on the observed decomposition of total factor productivity (TFP) changes in response to the adverse economic shocks. Hence, the proposed framework directly links productivity with the two types of resilience. We applied the F?re-Primont method of TFP decomposition, into technological change and various types of efficiency changes and a detailed farm survey to distinguish between the drivers of technological changes in each farming sector such as specific innovations and ecosystem services. Our findings show that farms differ in their revealed resilience both among the sectors and between two different shock events. Only field crop farms and granivores farms (pig and poultry) maintained their resilience to both crises, staying robust and/or adaptable.

We have undertaken a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: : CONCOR-1 is an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial. Inclusion criteria include: patients > 16 years;admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection;receiving supplemental oxygen for respiratory complications of COVID-19;and, availability of blood group compatible CCP. Exclusion criteria are: onset of respiratory symptoms more than 12 days prior to randomization;intubated or planned for intubation;and previous severe reactions to plasma. Consenting patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive either approximately 500 mL of CCP or standard of care. CCP will be collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and who have detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies quantified serologically. The primary outcome is intubation or death at Day 30. Secondary outcomes include ventilator free days, length of stay in intensive care or hospital, transfusion reactions, serious adverse events, and reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Exploratory analyses include patients who received CCP containing high titre antibodies. A sample size of 1200 patients gives 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction assuming a 30% baseline risk of intubation or death at 30 days (two-sided test; =0.05). An interim analysis and sample size re-estimation will be done by an unblinded independent biostatistician after primary outcome data are available for 50% of the target recruitment (n= 600).

In this paper, we propose a self-ensembled co-training framework, which is trained by limited labeled data and large-scale unlabeled data, to automatically extract COVID lesions from CT scans. Specifically, to enrich the diversity of unsupervised information, we build a co-training framework consisting of two collaborative models, in which the two models teach each other during training by using their respective predicted pseudo-labels of unlabeled data. Moreover, to alleviate the adverse impacts of noisy pseudo-labels for each model, we propose a self-ensembling strategy to perform consistency regularization for the up-to-date predictions of unlabeled data, in which the predictions of unlabeled data are gradually ensembled via moving average at the end of every training epoch. We evaluate our framework on a COVID-19 dataset containing 103 CT scans. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better performance in the case of only 4 labeled CT scans compared to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation networks.","output":"Self-Ensembling Co-Training Framework for Semi-Supervised COVID-19 CT Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Indian Mental Health Care Act of 2017 (the Act) focuses on the human rights of persons with mental illness.

To assess the situation whether people are wearing mask, automatic identification of face mask in public places is a timely solution and thats where our WearMask in COVID-19 project primarily stands for. As part of our project, to identify whether people wear mask or not, this article analyzes and compares the effectiveness of using CNN architecture built from scratch with pre-trained ResNet50 and MobileNet-v2 models. These models are trained on a combined face mask image dataset having mostly low resolution simulated masked face images and some high resolution real masked face images. The models work through three steps: image pre-processing, image feature extraction and classification using the models above, and model evaluation. Experimental results show that an in-house CNN structure that we have developed from scratch performs better than the ResNet50 model and is comparable to the performance of the MobileNet-v2 model. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"WearMask in COVID-19: Identification of Wearing Facemask Based on Using CNN Model and Pre-trained CNN Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us to live in social isolation and has brought an important element of social life, the events industry, to a complete standstill. In resurrecting the events industry, the most urgent focus is on managing the risk of any crowd-control measures with a view to reducing to zero the danger of the virus spreading. This research focuses on the main issue of the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the organization of sports events (SEs), and in particular, cycling competitions. This study, therefore, aims to provide deeper insights into (a) the measures introduced to face the health emergency situation in cycling events, (b) the comparison of these measures with previous experiences in similar SE contexts, and (c) the possible evolution of organizational models for cycling events in the post-pandemic era. Fifteen semi-structured interviews with cycling athletes, managers, and officials constitute the methodological basis for this study. The results show that countermeasures have been taken that are effective in dealing with pandemic characteristics and are likely to be applied in the future, while others will be phased out or used again only when necessary. This study enhances scientific knowledge by analyzing a renewed approach to risk management for SEs, with a specific focus on pandemics and medical risks. Finally, the study shows that cycling events need to adapt the specifics of such a new approach to the standards projected on future scenarios for which the COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way.","output":"How the Covid-19 Pandemic Influenced the Approach to Risk Management in Cycling Events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"California is widely seen as a climate and environmental policy leader in the U.S. and beyond.

Sequence variability among NWM glycoproteins (GP) poses a challenge to the development of broadly neutralizing therapeutics against the entire clade of viruses. However, blockade of their shared binding site on the apical domain of human Transferrin Receptor 1 (hTfR1/CD71) presents an opportunity for the development of effective and broadly neutralizing therapeutics. Here we demonstrate that the murine monoclonal antibody OKT9, which targets the apical domain of hTfR1, can sterically block cellular entry by viral particles presenting Clade B NWM glycoproteins (GP1-GP2). OKT9 blockade is also effective against viral particles pseudotyped with glycoproteins of a recently identified pathogenic Sabia-like virus. With nanomolar affinity for hTfR1, the OKT9 antigen binding fragment (OKT9-Fab) sterically blocks Clade B NWM-GP1s and reduces infectivity of an attenuated strain of Junin virus. Binding of OKT9 to the hTfR1 ectodomain in its soluble, dimeric state produces stable assemblies that are observable by negative stain electron microscopy. A model of the OKT9-sTfR1 complex, informed by the known crystallographic structure of sTfR1 and a newly determined structure of the OKT9 antigen binding fragment (Fab) suggests that OKT9 and the Machupo virus GP1 share a binding site on the hTfR1 apical domain. The structural basis for this interaction presents a framework for the design and development of high-affinity, broadly acting agents targeting Clade B NWMs. Importance Pathogenic Clade B NWMs cause grave infectious diseases: the South American hemorrhagic fevers. Their etiological agents are Junin (JUNV), Guanarito (GTOV), Sabi (SABV), Machupo (MACV), Chapare (CHAV), and a new Sabi-like (SABV-L) virus recently identified in Brazil. These are priority A pathogens due to their high infectivity and mortality, their potential of person-to-person transmission, and the limited availability of effective therapeutics and vaccines to curb their effects. While low homology between surface glycoproteins of NWMs foils efforts to develop broadly neutralizing therapies targeting NWMs, this work provides structural evidence that OKT9, a monoclonal antibody targeting a single NWM glycoprotein binding site on hTfR1, can efficiently prevent their entry into cells.","output":"Antibody-based inhibition of pathogenic New World Hemorrhagic Fever mammarenaviruses by steric occlusion of the human transferrin receptor 1 apical domain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare providers are at high risk of becoming infected when taking care of patients who have COVID-19, especially while attending aerosol generating procedures. Protective personal equipment must be used in the correct manner to prevent transmission of the disease. Published protocols on protective personal equipment (PPE) donning and doffing have been issued by disease control agencies. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was designed. An online anonymous questionnaire, which was validated and tested for reliability, focused on PPE related knowledge, donning and doffing practices of healthcare providers across the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 312 healthcare providers across the eastern region of Saudi Arabia participated in the study, 208 physicians (66.7%) and 104 non-physicians (33.3%). Results indicate poor practice regarding PPE donning (13.8% reported the correct sequence) and PPE doffing (3.5% reported the correct sequence) among participants. In addition, practice and confidence scores regarding other issues with PPE were analyzed.

METHODS: From March 2-13 of 2020, 4,618 health professionals in China were included in an anonymous, self-rated online survey regarding their concerns on exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaires consisted of five parts: basic demographic information and epidemiological exposure; occupational and psychological impact; concerns during the episode; coping strategies; and the Huaxi Emotional-Distress Index (HEI). RESULTS: About 24.2% of respondents experienced high levels of anxiety or/and depressive symptoms since the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents who worried about their physical health and those who had COVID-19 infected friends or close relatives were more likely to have high HEI levels, than those without these characteristics. Further, family relationship was found to have an independent protective effect against high HEI levels. Their main concerns were that their families would not be cared for and that they would not be able to work properly. Compared to respondents with clear emotional problems, those with somewhat hidden emotional issues adopted more positive coping measures. CONCLUSIONS: About a quarter of medical staff experienced psychological problems during the pandemic of COVID-19.

While some companies have navigated successful journeys through the process of reputational recovery following self-inflicted pain, Boeing faces significant reputational and global complications which have greatly prolonged the recovery process.Design/methodology/approachThis paper is based on a case study approach examining the recovery process for Boeing, considering the safety issues of 2019 and the pandemic crisis during 2020. Although the Covid-19 spread was certainly a black swan event, Boeing had already inflicted a great deal of damage upon its business and reputation because of the 737 Max. This paper examines their recovery process thus far by using a four-step recovery model of replace, restructure, redevelop and re-brand that has been implemented in previous corporate recoveries.FindingsWhen examining the corporate recovery process, though the four-step approach is a model that can work across industries, there are some challenges depending on corporate specifics. The major challenge with Boeing is the ongoing reputational concerns regarding safety combined with the new global reality because of the Covid-19 pandemic. A full corporate recovery will require attention to each of these four prongs of the process, stretched out over several years. Any missteps along the way will only prolong the pain for one of historys most historic and influential manufacturers.Originality/valueWhile several publicly traded companies have overcome significant obstacles over the past five years in the quest to regain trust within the marketplace, Boeing continues to face strong headwinds.

How eligibility for Medicare affects racial and ethnic disparities in access to care and health is poorly understood. Objective To assess the association of Medicare with racial and ethnic disparities in access to care and health. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study uses regression discontinuity to compare racial and ethnic disparities before and after age 65 years, the age at which US adults are eligible for Medicare. There are a total of 2 434 320 respondents in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and 44 587 state-age-year observations in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research Data (eg, the mortality rate for individuals age 63 years in New York in 2017) from January 2008 to December 2018. The data were analyzed between February and May 2021. Exposures Eligibility for Medicare at age 65 years. Main Outcomes and Measures Proportions of respondents with health insurance, as well as self-reported health and mortality. To examine access, whether respondents had a usual source of care, encountered cost-related barriers to care, or received influenza vaccines was assessed. Results Of 2 434 320 participants, 192 346 were Black individuals, 104 294 were Hispanic individuals, and 892 177 were men. Immediately after age 65 years, insurance coverage increased more for Black respondents (from 86.3% to 95.8% or 9.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.6-11.4) and Hispanic respondents (from 77.4% to 91.3% or 13.9 percentage points; 95% CI, 12.0-15.8) than White respondents (from 92.0% to 98.5% or 6.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.1-7.0). This was associated with a 53% reduction compared with the size of the disparity between White and Black individuals before age 65 years (5.7% to 2.7% or 3.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.9-5.1; P = .003) and a 51% reduction compared with the size of the disparity between White and Hispanic individuals before age 65 years (14.6% to 7.2% or 7.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.3-9.5; P < .001). Medicare eligibility was associated with narrowed disparities between White and Hispanic individuals in access to care, lowering disparities in access to a usual source of care from 10.5% to 7.5% (P = .05), cost-related barriers to care from 11.4% to 6.9% (P < .001), and influenza vaccination rates from 8.1% to 3.3% (P = .01). For disparities between White and Black individuals, access to a usual source of care before and after age 65 years was not significantly different: 1.2% to 0.0% (P = .24), cost-related barriers to care from 5.8% to 4.3% (P = .22), and influenza vaccinations from 11.0% to 10.3% (P = .60). The share of people in poor self-reported health decreased by 3.8 percentage points for Hispanic respondents, 2.6 percentage points for Black respondents, and 0.2 percentage points for White respondents.

The state must provide Ukrainian citizens not only with vaccines, but also with reliable information about the need for vaccination. It turns out that the small number of vaccinated people in Ukraine is not only due to the slow pace of procurement and vaccination, but also to the lack of awareness of citizens about all the benefits of the need for vaccination. The main vaccination rates in the world and Ukraine as of mid-April 2021 have been determined.

Methods: This study is an observational cohort study among COVID-19 adult patients from moderate to critically ill admitted to Universitas Airlangga Hospital (UAH) Surabaya with history of hypertension and receiving anti-hypertensive drugs. Results: Patients receiving beta blockers only had a longer length of stay than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) or calcium channel blockers alone (17, 13.36, and 13.73 respectively), had the higher rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission than ACEi/ARB (p 0.04), and had the highest mortality rate (54.55%). There were no significant differences in length of stay, ICU admission, mortality rate, and days of death among the single, double, and triple anti-hypertensive groups.

We devised a protocol for rapid retrieval of pure LMSC, LM and LEPC populations by collagenase digestion of limbal tissue and subsequent fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using antibodies against CD90 and CD117. The sorted cells were characterized by immunophenotyping and functional assays. The effects of LMSC and LM on LEPC were studied in 3D co-cultures and LEPC differentiation status was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Enzymatic digestion and flow sorting yielded pure populations of LMSC (CD117(?)CD90(+)), LM (CD117(+)CD90(?)), and LEPC (CD117(?)CD90(?)). The LMSC exhibited self-renewal capacity (55.0  4.6 population doublings), expressed mesenchymal stem cell markers (CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD44), and transdifferentiated to adipocytes, osteocytes, or chondrocytes. The LM exhibited self-renewal capacity and sustained melanin production. The sorted LEPC expressed epithelial progenitor markers (CK14, CK19, and CK15) and showed a colony-forming ability.

However, these CoVs have acquired strategies to evade innate immune responses by avoiding recognition by host sensors, leading to impaired interferon (IFN) production and antagonizing of the IFN signaling pathways. In contrast, the dysregulated induction of inflammasomes, leading to uncontrolled production of IL-1 family cytokines (IL-1 and IL-18) and pyroptosis, has been associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis.

We examined whether sleep disturbances were associated with psychological distress in New York City (NYC) HCWs during the initial peak of COVID-19 in-patient admissions (April 9 - May 11, 2020). METHODS: HCWs (physicians, nurses, and advanced practice providers) completed a web-based survey which screened for acute stress (4-item Primary Care PTSD screen), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), and anxiety (2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale). Past week insomnia symptoms were assessed with a modified item from the Insomnia Severity Index (5-point Likert Scale: none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe). Insomnia was defined as having moderate, severe, or very severe symptoms. Short sleep (SS) was defined as self-reported sleep duration <6 hours per day. Poisson regression analyses predicting psychological distress from SS and, separately insomnia. adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, clinical setting (COVID-focused or not COVID-focused), physician vs. non-physician status, and redeployment status, were performed. RESULTS: Data included 813 HCWs (80.6% female, 59.0% White, 75.6% worked in a COVID-focused setting). Mean sleep duration was 5.79  1.22 hours/night. The prevalence of SS and insomnia were 38.8% and 72.8%; the prevalence of acute stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety were 57.9%, 33.8% and 48.2%, respectively. Having SS, vs. not was associated with acute stress (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.31), depressive symptoms (PR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.02), and anxiety (PR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.74). Presence of insomnia symptoms vs. none or mild was associated with acute stress (PR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.57, 2.34), depressive symptoms (PR: 3.13, 95% CI: 2.16, 4.52), and anxiety (PR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.86, 3.11). CONCLUSION: Among NYC HCWs, sleep disturbances, including SS and insomnia symptoms during COVID-19 are common.

RESULTS We recruited 395 participants; 64% women, 49% nurses, and 13% physicians. Of these, 233(59.0%) would accept and 163 (41.0%) were vaccine hesitant i.e. would either refuse or were unsure whether they would accept COVID-19 vaccination. People who did not trust that COVID-19 vaccines are effective were the most hesitant (p = 0.038). Older participants and physicians were more likely to accept vaccination than younger participants (p < 0.01) and other HCWs (p = 0.042) respectively. Other predictors of vaccine acceptance were trust that vaccines are compatible with religion (p < 0.001), consideration of benefits and risks of vaccination (p < 0.001), willingness to be vaccinated to protect others (p < 0.001), and viewing vaccination as a collective action for COVID-19 control (p = 0.029).

METHODS: A prospective cohort study in three Belgian professional male football teams was performed during the first half of the 2020C2021 season (June 2020CJanuary 2021). Injury data were collected using established surveillance methods. Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by a PCR test before each official game. RESULTS: Of the 84 included participants, 22 were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 14 players developed a muscle strain during the follow-up period. Coxs proportional hazards regression analyses demonstrated a significant association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of muscle strain (HR 5.1; 95% CI 1.1 to 23.1; p=0.037), indicating an increased risk of developing muscle strains following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: The proning program evolved based on the principles of High Reliability Organizations (HROs) and Crew Resource Management (CRM). Patients with severe ARDS [PaO2:FiO2 ratio (PFr) &#8804; 150 on FiO2 &#8805; 0.6 and PEEP &#8805; 5 cm H2O] received IPP. Patients were placed prone 16 h each day. When PFr was &#8805; 200 for > 8 h supine IPP ceased. IPP used available materials without requiring additional work from the bedside team. Changes in PFr, PaCO2, and the SaO2:FiO2 ratio (SaFr) positionally were evaluated using t-statistics and ANOVA with Bonferroni correction (p < 0.017). RESULTS: Between 14APR2020 and 09MAY2020, at the peak of deaths in New York, there were 202 IPPs in 29 patients. Patients were 58.5  1.7 years of age (37, 73), 76% male and had a body mass index (BMI) of 27.8  0.8 (21, 38). Pressor agents were used in 76% and 17% received dialysis. The PFr prior to IPP was 107.5  5.6 and 1 h after IPP was 155.7  11.2 (p < 0.001 compared to pre-prone). PFr after the patients were placed supine was 131.5  9.1 (p = 0.02). Pre-prone PaCO2 was 60.0  2.5 and the 1-h post-prone PaCO2 was 67.2  3.1 (p = 0.02). Supine PaCO2 after IPP was 60.4  3.4 (p = 0.90). The SaFr prior to IPP was 121.3  4.2 and the SaFr 1 h after positioning was 131.5  5.1 (p = 0.03). The post-IPP supine SaFr was 139.7  5.9 (p < 0.001). With ANOVA and Bonferroni correction there were statistically significant changes in PFr (p < 0.001) and SaFr (p < 0.001) and no significant changes in PaCO2 over the four time points measured.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) of EGFR is also induced by stimuli activating p38 MAPK. Mechanisms of both ligand- and p38-induced endocytosis are not fully understood, and how these pathways intermingle when concurrently activated remains unknown. Here we dissect the mechanisms of p38-induced endocytosis using a pH-sensitive model of endogenous EGFR, which is extracellularly tagged with a fluorogen-activating protein, and propose a unifying model of the crosstalk between multiple EGFR endocytosis pathways. We found that a new locus of p38-dependent phosphorylation in EGFR is essential for the receptor dileucine motif interaction with the 2 subunit of clathrin adaptor AP2 and concomitant receptor internalization. p38-dependent endocytosis of EGFR induced by cytokines was additive to CME induced by picomolar EGF concentrations but constrained to internalizing ligand-free EGFRs due to Grb2 recruitment by ligand-activated EGFRs. Nanomolar EGF concentrations rerouted EGFR from CME to clathrin-independent endocytosis, primarily by diminishing p38-dependent endocytosis.","output":"Mechanism of p38 MAPK-induced EGFR endocytosis and its crosstalk with ligand-induced pathways."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the relationship of COVID-19 to stroke is important.

PURPOSE This study examined the effect of a boxing program, Rock Steady Boxing (RSB), on the health of people with PD from both the boxers' and their caregivers' perspectives as well as evaluated balance, quality of life (QoL), and depressive symptoms after 12 weeks of RSB. METHODS A mixed methods, one-group experimental design with focus groups were embedded within an intervention study. Six boxers completed baseline and 12-week postassessments. RESULTS The majority of boxers maintained or improved scores for balance, QoL, and reduced depressive symptoms. Findings indicate physical and mental benefits of RSB among persons with PD and this was further validated by qualitative data from boxers and caregivers, along with quantitative data of boxers. Caregivers and boxers reported that boxers' ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) improved and is supported by quantitative improvements in the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire-39 ADL subscale. All boxers reported reduced stigma, and caregivers and boxers valued the opportunity to work out in an environment free of stigma, a finding not previously reported. CONCLUSIONS It is important for nurse practitioners to recognize exercise benefits for people with PD and recommend the program to patients and include caregivers in their overall assessment of health and wellness.

This study was conducted to determine if a rate enhancement hybridization (REH) buffer, developed for membrane hybridization, could be used to decrease hybridization time for ISH. Tissue from swine with an enteric disease produced by a swine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was used as a model to standardize hybridization conditions for a rapid ISH technique. Small intestinal sections from pigs experimentally and naturally infected with TGEV were hybridized for various times at 52C and 70C with a radiolabelled or a fluorescein-labelled RNA probe in a standard hybridization or a REH buffer. Viral RNA was detected in intestines from as early as 30 min of hybridization by using both buffers with the radiolabelled probe; however, the signal was stronger with the REH buffer. With the fluorescein-labelled probe, viral RNA was detected in virus-infected cells of the intestines after 30 min of hybridization by using the REH buffer. Signal intensity was greater with the REH buffer than with the standard hybridization buffer when compared at each hybridization time and hybridization temperature using both radiolabelled and fluorescein-labelled probes. With the REH buffer, hybridization signal intensity was greater at 70C than at 52C for both probes. The best results were obtained when small intestinal sections were hybridized at 70C for 2 h using a radiolabelled or a fluorescein-labelled probe diluted in the REH buffer. The fluorescein-labelled RNA probe with REH buffer resulted in a minimal non-specific signal when compared with the radiolabelled probe. These studies demonstrated that the REH buffer can be used to decrease the time of ISH for the detection of viral RNA.

This is the first experimental study to investigate consumer attitudes and satisfaction with anthropomorphic chatbots in food e-commerce. A sample of 401 participants was tested to verify the proposed hypotheses. The test group interacted with a standard chatbot without human-like characteristics, while the control group communicated with the anthropomorphically designed agent. The results confirm the vast potential of anthropomorphic cues in chatbot applications and show that they are positively associated with customer satisfaction and mediated by the variables enjoyment, attitude, and trust.

As governments consider public health and economic strategies to respond to the crisis, it is critical they also address the weaknesses of their economic and social systems that inhibited their ability to respond comprehensively to the pandemic. These same weaknesses have also undermined efforts to advance equality and sustainability. This paper explores over 30 interventions across the following nine categories of change that hold the potential to address inequality, provide all citizens with access to essential goods and services, and advance progress towards sustainability: (1) Income and wealth transfers to facilitate an equitable increase in purchasing power/disposable income; (2) broadening worker and citizen ownership of the means of production and supply of services, allowing corporate profit-taking to be more equitably distributed; (3) changes in the supply of essential goods and services for more citizens; (4) changes in the demand for more sustainable goods and services desired by people; (5) stabilizing and securing employment and the workforce; (6) reducing the disproportionate power of corporations and the very wealthy on the market and political system through the expansion and enforcement of antitrust law such that the dominance of a few firms in critical sectors no longer prevails; (7) government provision of essential goods and services such as education, healthcare, housing, food, and mobility; (8) a reallocation of government spending between military operations and domestic social needs; and (9) suspending or restructuring debt from emerging and developing countries. Any interventions that focus on growing the economy must also be accompanied by those that offset the resulting compromises to health, safety, and the environment from increasing unsustainable consumption. This paper compares and identifies the interventions that should be considered as an important foundational first step in moving beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and towards sustainability. In this regard, it provides a comprehensive set of strategies that could advance progress towards a component of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10 to reduce inequality within countries. However, the candidate interventions are also contrasted with all 17 SDGs to reveal potential problem areas/tradeoffs that may need careful attention.","output":"Addressing inequality: The first step beyond COVID-19 and towards sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been over 2 million deaths globally. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may be the main cause of death. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the clinical features, outcomes, and ARDS characteristics of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Chongqing, China. METHODS: The epidemiology of COVID-19 from January 21, 2020, to March 15, 2020, in Chongqing, China, was analyzed retrospectively, and 75 ICU patients from two hospitals were included in this study. On day 1, 56 patients with ARDS were selected for subgroup analysis, and a modified Poisson regression was performed to identify predictors for the early improvement of ARDS (eiARDS). RESULTS: Chongqing reported a 5.3% case fatality rate for the 75 ICU patients. The median age of these patients was 57 (IQR 25-75) years, and no bias was present in the sex ratio. A total of 93% (n=70) of patients developed ARDS during ICU stay, and more than half had moderate ARDS. However, most patients (n=41, 55%) underwent high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, but not mechanical ventilation. Nearly one-third of patients with ARDS improved (arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration >300 mm Hg) in 1 week, which was defined as eiARDS. Patients with eiARDS had a higher survival rate and a shorter length of ICU stay than those without eiARDS. Age (<55 years) was the only variable independently associated with eiARDS, with a risk ratio of 2.67 (95% CI 1.17-6.08). CONCLUSIONS: A new subphenotype of ARDS-eiARDS-in patients with COVID-19 was identified. As clinical outcomes differ, the stratified management of patients based on eiARDS or age is highly recommended.","output":"Early Improvement of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Patients With COVID-19 in the Intensive Care Unit: Retrospective Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient database in the United States, this study sought to evaluate real-world outcomes after bariatric surgery among patients with heart failure.","output":"In-hospital outcomes after bariatric surgery in patients with heart failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mathematical models are mainly used to depict real world problems that humans encounter in their daily explorations, investigations and activities However, these mathematical models have some limitations as indeed the big challenges are the conversion of observations into mathematical formulations If this conversion is inefficient, then mathematical models will provide some predictions with deficiencies A specific real-world problem could then have more than one mathematical model, each model with its advantages and disadvantages In the last months, the spread of covid-19 among humans have become fatal, destructive and have paralyzed activities across the globe The lockdown regulations and many other measures have been put in place with the hope to stop the spread of this deathly disease that have taken several souls around the globe Nevertheless, to predict the future behavior of the spread, humans rely on mathematical models and their simulations While many models, have been suggested, it is important to point out that all of them have limitations therefore newer models can still be suggested In this paper, we examine an alternative model depicting the spread behavior of covid-19 among humans Different differential and integral operators are used to get different scenarios","output":"A study on the Spread of COVID 19 outbreak by using Mathematical modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with high mortality and may overwhelm health care systems, due to the surge of patients requiring advanced respiratory support. Shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds required many patients to be treated outside the ICU despite severe gas exchange impairment. Helmet is an effective interface to provide continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) noninvasively. We report data about the usefulness of helmet CPAP during pandemic, either as treatment, a bridge to intubation or a rescue therapy for patients with care limitations (DNI). METHODS: In this observational study we collected data regarding patients failing standard oxygen therapy (i.e., non-rebreathing mask) due to COVID-19 pneumonia treated with a free flow helmet CPAP system. Patients' data were recorded before, at initiation of CPAP treatment and once a day, thereafter. CPAP failure was defined as a composite outcome of intubation or death. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included; 42% were deemed as DNI. Helmet CPAP treatment was successful in 69% of the full treatment and 28% of the DNI patients (P < 0.001). With helmet CPAP, PaO2/FiO2 ratio doubled from about 100 to 200 mmHg (P < 0.001); respiratory rate decreased from 28 [22-32] to 24 [20-29] breaths per minute, P < 0.001). C-reactive protein, time to oxygen mask failure, age, PaO2/FiO2 during CPAP, number of comorbidities were independently associated with CPAP failure. Helmet CPAP was maintained for 6 [3-9] days, almost continuously during the first two days. None of the full treatment patients died before intubation in the wards. CONCLUSIONS: Helmet CPAP treatment is feasible for several days outside the ICU, despite persistent impairment in gas exchange. It was used, without escalating to intubation, in the majority of full treatment patients after standard oxygen therapy failed. DNI patients could benefit from helmet CPAP as rescue therapy to improve survival.

Male showed higher confirmed and death cases compared to females in most of the countries. In addition, the case fatality ratio (CFR) for males was higher than for females. This gender variation in COVID-19 cases may be due to males' cultural activities, but similar variations in the number of COVID-19 affected males and females globally. Variations in the immune system can illustrate this divergent risk comparatively higher in males than females. The female immune system may have an edge to detect pathogens slightly earlier. In addition, women show comparatively higher innate and adaptive immune responses than men, which might be explained by the high density of immune-related genes in the X chromosome. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 viruses use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter the host cell, and men contain higher ACE2 than females. Therefore, males may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 than females. In addition, smoking habit also makes men susceptible to COVID-19. Considering the age-wise distribution, children and older adults were less infected than other age groups and the death rate. On the contrary, more death in the older group may be associated with less immune system function. In addition, most of these group have comorbidities like diabetes, high pressure, low lungs and kidney function, and other chronic diseases.

The present study was designed to examine the current practice of SUP in Mecklenburg West Pomerania, Germany, and to identify possible reasons for the dissociation of medical literature and clinical practice. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to elucidate current SUP practices in surgical departments of acute care hospitals in Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, Germany. Results: In most surgical departments (68%), a standard operating procedure (SOP) for SUP had not been developed. In departments with an existing SOP, 47.6% of responding medical staff members (MSM) with prescribing authority did not know of its existence. Of the MSMs aware of the existence of an SUP-SOP, only 42.9% indicated that they were familiar with its content. Critical re-evaluation of SUP indications upon transfer from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the general hospital ward (GHW) and before hospital discharge was performed frequently or systematically by only about half of the responding MSMs. Discussion: In the face of continued massive over-prescription of SUP in the perioperative routine, the development of easy-to-use local guidelines and their strict implementation in the clinical routine, as well as intensified medial education on this subject, may be effective tools to reduce acid-suppressive medication (ASM) associated side effects and economic burden.","output":"Current Practice of Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in Surgical Departments in Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionFervorous investigation and dialogue surrounding the true number of SARS-CoV-2 related deaths and implied infection fatality rates in India have been ongoing throughout the pandemic, and especially pronounced during the nations devastating second wave. We aim to synthesize the existing literature on the true SARS-CoV-2 excess deaths and infection fatality rates (IFR) in India, through a systematic search followed by viable meta-analysis. We then provide updated epidemiological model-based estimates of the wave 1, wave 2 and combined IFRs using an extension of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, using data from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. MethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines, the databases PubMed, Embase, Global Index Medicus, as well as BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and SSRN for preprints (accessed through iSearch), were searched on July 3, 2021 (with results verified through August 15, 2021). Altogether using a two-step approach, 4,765 initial citations were screened resulting in 37 citations included in the narrative review and 19 studies with 41 datapoints included in the quantitative synthesis. Using a random effects model with DerSimonian-Laird estimation, we meta-analyze IFR1 which is defined as the ratio of the total number of observed reported deaths divided by the total number of estimated infections and IFR2 (which accounts for death underreporting in the numerator of IFR1). For the latter, we provide lower and upper bounds based on the available range of estimates of death undercounting, often arising from an excess death calculation. The primary focus is to estimate pooled nationwide estimates of IFRs with the secondary goal of estimating pooled regional and state-specific estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related IFRs in India. We also try to stratify our empirical results across the first and the second wave. In tandem, we present updated SEIR model estimates of IFRs for waves 1, 2, and combined across the waves with observed case and death count data from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. ResultsFor India countrywide, underreporting factors (URF) for cases (sourced from serosurveys) range from 14.3-29.1 in the four nationwide serosurveys; URFs for deaths (sourced from excess deaths reports) range from 4.4-11.9 with cumulative excess deaths ranging from 1.79-4.9 million (as of June 2021). Nationwide pooled IFR1 and IFR2 estimates for India are 0.097% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.067 - 0.140) and 0.365% (95% CI: 0.264 - 0.504) to 0.485% (95% CI: 0.344 - 0.685), respectively, again noting that IFR2 changes as excess deaths estimates vary. Among the included studies in this meta-analysis, the IFR1 generally appear to decrease over time from the earliest study end date to the latest study end date (from 4 June 2020 to 6 July 2021, IFR1 changed from 0.199 to 0.055%), whereas a similar trend is not as readily evident for IFR2 due to the wide variation in excess death estimates (from 4 June 2020 to 6 July 2021, IFR2 ranged from (0.290-1.316) to (0.241-0.651) %). Nationwide SEIR model-based combined estimates for IFR1 and IFR2 are 0.101% (95% CI: 0.097 - 0.116) and 0.367% (95% CI: 0.358 - 0.383), respectively, which largely reconcile with the empirical findings and concur with the lower end of the excess death estimates. An advantage of such epidemiological models is the ability to produce daily estimates with updated data with the disadvantages being that these estimates are subject to numerous assumptions, arduousness of validation and not directly using the available excess death data. Whether one uses empirical data or model-based estimation, it is evident that IFR2 is at least 3.6 times more than IFR1. ConclusionWhen incorporating case and death underreporting, the meta-analyzed cumulative infection fatality rate in India varies from 0.36%-0.48%, with a case underreporting factor ranging from 25-30 and a death underreporting factor ranging from 4-12. This implies, by June 30, 2021, India may have seen nearly 900 million infections and 1.7-4.9 million deaths when the reported numbers stood at 30.4 million cases and 412 thousand deaths (covid19india.org) with an observed case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.35%. We reiterate the need for timely and disaggregated infection and fatality data to examine the burden of the virus by age and other demographics.

RESULTS: The most common stress domains correspond to family (22.97%), financial (22.53%), academic (16.47%), leisure time constraints (14.23%), health (12.48%), peer group (7.63%), and religious concerns (3.69%). These domains are significantly associated with the respondent's country, sex, employment status, and being or not a health worker. Respondents who reported confinement stress also reported higher scores in anxiety, depression, and somatization. The Global Severity Index was significantly predicted by confinement stress, health, academic, and leisure time-related stress, sex, age, being a health worker, COVID-19 Personal Concern, and Perceived Seriousness. Non-significant predictors were employment status, the number of people at home, presence of older adults and children at home, financial, peer group, family, and religious concerns; the regression model had an R2 of 0.26. Similar analyses were conducted for somatization, depression, and anxiety subscales. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on the mental health of the general population, particularly regarding anxiety, depression, and somatization. Specific populations, such as women and healthcare workers, are at particular risk of suffering a deterioration in mental wellbeing. The implications of the study for public policy are discussed.","output":"Coronavirus awareness, confinement stress, and mental health: Evidence from Honduras, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico and Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heavy oils and bitumen are indispensable resources for a turbulent-free transition to a decarbonized global energy and economic system. This is because according to the analysis of the International Energy Agencys 2020 estimates, the world requires up to 770 billion barrels of oil from now to year 2040. However, BPs 2020 statistical review of world energy has shown that the global total reserves of the cheap-to-produce conventional oil are roughly only 520.2 billion barrels. This implies that the huge reserves of the practically unexploited difficult-and-costly-to-upgrade-and-produce heavy oils and bitumen must be immediately developed using advanced upgrading and extraction technologies which have greener credentials. Furthermore, in accordance with climate change mitigation strategies and to efficiently develop the heavy oils and bitumen resources, producers would like to maximize their upgrading within the reservoirs by using energy-efficient and environmentally friendly technologies such as the yet-to-be-fully-understood THAI-CAPRI process. The THAI-CAPRI process uses in situ combustion and in situ catalytic reactions to produce high-quality oil from heavy oils and bitumen reservoirs. However, prolonging catalyst life and effectiveness and maximizing catalytic reactions are a major challenge in the THAI-CAPRI process. Therefore, in this work, the first ever-detailed investigations of the effects of alumina-supported cobalt oxideCmolybdenum oxide (CoMo/-Al(2)O(3)) catalyst packing porosity on the performance of the THAI-CAPRI process are performed through numerical simulations using CMG STARS. The key findings in this study include: the larger the catalyst packing porosity, the higher the accessible surface area for the mobilized oil to reach the inner coke-uncoated catalysts and thus the higher the API gravity and quality of the produced oil, which clearly indicated that sulphur and nitrogen heteroatoms were catalytically removed and replaced with hydrogen. Over the 290 min of combustion period, slightly more oil (i.e. an additional 0.43% oil originally in place (OOIP)) is recovered in the model which has the higher catalyst packing porosity. In other words, there is a cumulative oil production of 2330 cm(3) when the catalyst packing porosity is 56% versus a cumulative oil production of 2300 cm(3) in the model whose catalyst packing porosity is 45%. The larger the catalyst packing porosity, the lower the mass and thus cost of the catalyst required per m(3) of annular space around the horizontal producer well. The peak temperature and the very small amount of produced oxygen are only marginally affected by the catalyst packing porosity, thereby implying that the extents of the combustion and thermal cracking reactions are respectively the same in both models. Thus, the higher upgrading achieved in the model whose catalyst packing porosity is 56% is purely due to the fact that the extent of the catalytic reactions in the model is larger than those in the model whose catalyst packing porosity is 45%.","output":"Detailed investigations of the influence of catalyst packing porosity on the performance of THAI-CAPRI process for in situ catalytic upgrading of heavy oil and bitumen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 crisis has undeniably impacted psycho-social rehabilitation care in France;it can even be considered a challenge During lockdown and the ending of lockdown, all actors in this discipline, which is focused on the outside and on freedom, have had to cope with many difficulties As the field of psychiatry is made up of a wide range of actors and territories, various solutions have been found to adapt to the situation and to care for patients with mental ill-ness In this article, we have identified some of them and we write about our own experience at a rehabilitation center for inpatients at the Grard Marchant Hospital Center, in Toulouse Our purpose is to pinpoint the main issues that the crisis has posed for psychosocial rehabilitation and to identify prospects for reflection and action ? 2020 John Libbey Eurotext All rights reserved La crise du Covid-19 a indniablement impact les soins en rhabilitation psychosociale en France;c'est mme un dfi Durant la priode de confinement et celle de dconfinement qui lui a fait suite, tous les acteurs de cette discipline tourne vers l'extrieur et la libert ont t confronts  des difficults Diverses solutions ont t trouves pour s'adapter Dans cet article, nous avons relev cer-taines d'entre elles et souhaitions tmoigner de notre propre exprience de centre de rhabilitation implant dans et pour le milieu hospitalier,  Toulouse Notre pro-pos est de reprer les principaux enjeux de cette priode et tenter de dgager des perspectives de rflexion et d'action ? 2020 John Libbey Eurotext All rights reserved","output":"Psychosocial rehabilitation and Covid-19 for adult inpatients: The example of C2RPS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine current levels of self-reported professional emergency preparedness competence among nurses.

They are typically assessed using validated, self-completed questionnaires known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs are used in healthcare settings to support care planning, clinical decision-making, patient-practitioner communication and quality improvement. PROMs have a potential role in the delivery of social care where people often have multiple and complex long-term health conditions. However, the use of PROMs in this context is currently unclear. The objective of this scoping review is to explore the evidence relating to the use of PROMs in adult social care. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The electronic databases Medline (Ovid), PsychInfo (Ovid), ASSIA (ProQuest), Social Care Online (SCIE), Web of Science and EMBASE (Ovid) were searched on 29 September 2020 to identify eligible studies and other publically available documents published since 2010. A grey literature search and hand searching of citations and reference lists of the included studies will also be undertaken. No restrictions on study design or language of publication will be applied. Screening and data extraction will be completed independently by two reviewers. Quality appraisal of the included documents will use the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and AACODS (Authority, Accuracy, Coverage, Objectivity, Date, Significance) checklists. A customised data charting table will be used for data extraction, with analysis of qualitative data using the framework method. The review findings will be presented as tables and in a narrative summary. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical review is not required as scoping reviews are a form of secondary data analysis that synthesise data from publically available sources. Review findings will be shared with service users and other relevant stakeholders and disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations.

This study aimed to investigate drug usage in the neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted on 98 patients at the Apollo tertiary care hospital (Bannerghatta, Bangalore, India) in a period of 6 months. The most common indications for neonatal intensive care unit admission, average number of drugs per patient, the most frequently used medication, distribution of patients based on the birth procedure, and possible drug interactions were collected from patient profiles. RESULTS: Among the patients, 52% were males and 48% were females. Notably, 38% of patients were preterm, 60% were term, and only 2% were post-term. Also, 80.6% were born by cesarean section and 19.4% were born by normal vaginal delivery. The highest mean of drug use was in the patient of 1,000-1,500 g (8.06 per patient). Preterm was the most frequent indication for admission in neonatal intensive care unit, followed by hyperbilirubinemia and then respiratory distress syndrome. The most frequently used medication was vitamin K (99%) and antibiotics followed by dextrose. In different types of antibiotics, amikacin (41%), cefoperazone+sulbactam (35%), cephalosporin (1%), ceftriaxone (0.7%), and amoxicillin (0.3%) were commonly administered. There were some possible interactions, such as aminoglycoside with furosemide and calcium gluconate. CONCLUSION: Premature birth and resulting low birth weight were the main reasons for drug prescription. High administration of antibiotics is probably an area of concern and should be seriously considered.","output":"Drug utilization study in neonatal intensive care unit at tertiary care hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is divided into genotypes A to H based on genetic recombination including the spike (S) gene. To investigate the longitudinal transition of the phylogenetic feature of the HCoV-OC43 S gene in a community, phylogenetic analysis of the S1 region of the S gene was conducted using 208 strains detected in Yamagata during 2010 to 2017 with reference strains of the genotype. The S1 sequences were divisible into four groups: A to D. All Yamagata strains belonged to either group B or group D. In group B, 46 (90.2%) out of 51 Yamagata strains were clustered with those of genotype E reference strains (cluster E). In group D, 28 (17.8%) and 122 (77.7%) out of 157 Yamagata strains were clustered, respectively, with genotype F and genotype G reference strains. In cluster G, 28 strains formed a distinct cluster. Monthly distributions of HCoV-OC43 in Yamagata in 2010 to 2017 revealed that group B and group D appeared one after another. In group B, the cluster E strains were prevalent recurrently. In conclusion, epidemics of HCoV-OC43 in Yamagata, Japan might be attributable to two genetically different groups: group B showed a recurrent epidemic of strains belonging to a single phylogenetic cluster and group D showed epidemic strains belonging to multiple clusters.","output":"Longitudinal epidemiology of human coronavirus OC43 in Yamagata, Japan, 2010-2017: Two groups based on spike gene appear one after another"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of new nucleoside analogues based on a C-3 branched ethynyl sugar derivative as present in 3-C-ethynylcytidine (ECyd) and -adenosine (EAdo), combined with modified purine bases was synthetized and evaluated against a broad array of viruses and tumour cell lines.

This study aimed to identify the magnitude, characteristics and underlying motivations of ED visitors with delayed healthcare seeking behaviour during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: Between March 9 and July 92,020, adults visiting the ED of an academic hospital in the East of the Netherlands received an online questionnaire to collect self-reported data on delay in seeking emergency care and subsequent motivations for this delay. Telephone interviews were held with a subsample of respondents to better understand the motivations for delay as described in the questionnaire. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred thirty-eight questionnaires were returned (34.0% response). One in five respondents reported a delay in seeking emergency care. Almost half of these respondents (n = 126; 45.4%) reported that the pandemic influenced the delay. Respondents reporting delay were mainly older adults (mean 61.6; 13.1 years), referred to the ED by the general practitioner (GP; 35.1%) or a medical specialist (34.7%), visiting the ED with cardiac problems (39.7%). The estimated median time of delay in receiving ED care was 3 days (inter quartile range 8 days). Respectively 46 (16.5%) and 26 (9.4%) respondents reported that their complaints would be either less severe or preventable if they had sought for emergency care earlier. Delayed care seeking behaviour was frequently motivated by: fear of contamination, not wanting to burden professionals, perceiving own complaints less urgent relative to COVID-19 patients, limited access to services, and by stay home instructions from referring professionals. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively large proportion of ED visitors reported delay in seeking emergency care during the first wave. Delay was often driven by misperceptions of the accessibility of services and the legitimacy for seeking emergency care. Public messaging and close collaboration between the ED and referring professionals could help reduce delayed care for acute needs during future COVID-19 infection waves.

It is a critical and challenging task to revive public life while minimizing the risk of infection. Reducing interactions between people by social distancing is an effective and prevalent measure to reduce the risk of infection and spread of the virus within a community. Current developments in several countries show that this measure can be technologically accompanied by mobile apps; meanwhile, privacy concerns are being intensively discussed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine central cognitive variables that may constitute peoples motivations for social distancing, using an app, and providing health-related data requested by two apps that differ in their direct utility for the individual user. The results may increase our understanding of peoples concerns and convictions, which can then be specifically addressed by public-oriented communication strategies and appropriate political decisions. METHODS: This study refers to the protection motivation theory, which is adaptable to both health-related and technology-related motivations. The concept of social trust was added. The quantitative survey included answers from 406 German-speaking participants who provided assessments of data security issues, trust components, and the processes of threat and coping appraisal related to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection by social distancing. With respect to apps, one central focus was on the difference between a contact tracing app and a data donation app. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses showed that the present model could explain 55% of the interindividual variance in the participants motivation for social distancing, 46% for using a contact tracing app, 42% for providing their own infection status to a contact tracing app, and 34% for using a data donation app. Several cognitive components of threat and coping appraisal were related to motivation measurements. Trust in other peoples social distancing behavior and general trust in official app providers also played important roles; however, the participants age and gender did not. Motivations for using and accepting a contact tracing app were higher than those for using and accepting a data donation app. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed some important cognitive factors that constitute peoples motivation for social distancing and using apps to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Concrete implications for future research, public-oriented communication strategies, and appropriate political decisions were identified and are discussed.","output":"Motivations for Social Distancing and App Use as Complementary Measures to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic: Quantitative Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluate the feasibility of estimating test-score growth for schools and districts with a gap year in test data.

The spatiotemporal coverage provided by traditional NO2 monitoring methods is insufficient, especially in the suburban and rural areas of north China, which have a high population density and experience severe air pollution. In this study, we implemented a spatiotemporal neural network (STNN) model to estimate surface NO2 from multiple sources of information, which included satellite and in situ measurements as well as meteorological and geographical data. The STNN predicted NO2 with high accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89 and a root mean squared error of 5.8 g/m3 for sample-based 10-fold cross-validation. Based on the surface NO2 concentration determined by the STNN, we analyzed the spatial distribution and temporal trends of NO2 pollution in north China. We found substantial drops in surface NO2 concentrations ranging between 9.1% and 33.2% for large cities during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown when compared to those in 2019. Moreover, we estimated the all-cause deaths attributed to NO2 exposure at a high spatial resolution of about 1 km, with totals of 6082, 4200, and 18,210 for Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Provinces in 2020, respectively. We observed remarkable regional differences in the health impacts due to NO2 among urban, suburban, and rural areas. Generally, the STNN model could incorporate spatiotemporal neighboring information and infer surface NO2 concentration with full coverage and high accuracy. Compared with machine learning regression techniques, STNN can effectively avoid model overfitting and simultaneously consider both spatial and temporal correlations of input variables using deep convolutional networks with residual blocks. The use of the proposed STNN model, as well as the surface NO2 dataset, can benefit air quality monitoring, forecasting, and health burden assessments.","output":"Spatiotemporal neural network for estimating surface NO2 concentrations over north China and their human health impact."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In mid-march in France following the announcement of containment of persons to their home, a number of city dwellers left to the country side.

Many drugs with promising in vitro profiles become ineffective in vivo due to BBB restrictive permeability. In particular, this includes drugs such as antiviral porphyrins, with the ability to fight brain-resident viruses causing diseases such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In the last two decades, BBB shuttles, particularly peptide-based ones, have shown promise in carrying various payloads across the BBB. Thus, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) formed by covalent attachment of a BBB peptide shuttle and an antiviral drug may become key therapeutic tools in treating neurological disorders of viral origin. In this study, we have used various approaches (guanidinium, phosphonium, and carbodiimide-based couplings) for on-resin synthesis of new peptide-porphyrin conjugates (PPCs) with BBB-crossing and potential antiviral activity. After careful fine-tuning of the synthetic chemistry, DIC/oxyma has emerged as a preferred method, by which 14 different PPCs have been made and satisfactorily characterized. The PPCs are prepared by coupling a porphyrin carboxyl group to an amino group (either N-terminal or a Lys side chain) of the peptide shuttle and show effective in vitro BBB translocation ability, low cytotoxicity toward mouse brain endothelial cells, and low hemolytic activity. Three of the PPCs, MP-P5, P4-MP, and P4-L-MP, effectively inhibiting HIV infectivity in vitro, stand out as most promising. Their efficacy against other brain-targeting viruses (Dengue, Zika, and SARS-CoV-2) is currently under evaluation, with preliminary results confirming that PPCs are a promising strategy to treat viral brain infections.","output":"Penetrating the Blood-Brain Barrier with New Peptide-Porphyrin Conjugates Having anti-HIV Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Care in times of Corona: Results of a cross-sectional study in German home care services Abstract.

This study's aim is to compare Dutch and Japanese general publics attitudes and preferences toward EoL care, and EoL decisions. Methods: a cross-sectional survey design was chosen. The survey was held among samples of the Dutch and Japanese general public, using a Nationwide social research panel of 220.000 registrants in the Netherlands and 1.200.000 in Japan. A quota sampling was done (age, gender, and living area). N = 1.040 in each country.

Their analysis of the vCIES (the name given to the virtual conference) process not only provides an example of a disruption to the status quo of the institution of conferencing as a result of a global pandemic, but also extends it by addressing the multiplying concerns, urgent considerations and actions needed within academic communities for more equal and accessible conferencing in the unfolding climate catastrophe. The authors begin by discussing the challenge of academic conferencing in the age of COVID-19 and climate crisis. They highlight how their decolonial political stance (which critiques accepting Western knowledge and Western culture as the norm) and their climate-conscious approach informed their preparation of a virtual conference pilot already intended as an experimental extension to this years on-site event. They suggest the development of this pilot provided the necessary platform for transforming the vCIES into an effective and engaging virtual experience for participants. The vCIES process, including considerations concerning its structure and format and the necessary technology, is detailed in the subsequent sections. In the final part of their article, the authors briefly identify and discuss some of the opportunities, challenges and implications emerging from their vCIES experiences. Ultimately, they suggest that in a time of instability, insecurity and uncertainty, there need to be alternatives to large on-site conferences which require excessive and extensive academic mobility. The vCIES was a step in that direction as an accessible, environmentally responsive, more equal, and intergenerational and multispecies event that welcomed families, children and pets, while opening the space for new interdisciplinary encounters.","output":"Academic conferencing in the age of COVID-19 and climate crisis: The case of the Comparative and International Education Society (CIES)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is a reflective consolidation of our practice experience in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 period, in which social work educators and practitioners needed to work online in a prolonged period of social distancing It illustrates in what ways online practices may denote emerging knowledge and skills that are worth further discussion These reflections have been consolidated as four knowledge/skill domains in our afterthoughts: i) Context, ii) Conversation, iii) Communication-Modality, and iv) Circulation These insights may inspire social work educators and practitioners to comprehend the potential of media technologies more fully","output":"When narrative practice suddenly goes online due to COVID-19 horizontal ellipsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory transmission by airborne droplets is the leading mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 spreads.

We consider a simple momentum balance to calculate the spread of respiratory droplets, accounting for their size evolution as they undergo vaporisation via mass and energy balances. The model shows how an increase in relative humidity leads to larger descent rates, which shorten the lifetime of droplets and therefore reduce the risk of transmission. Emulating indoor air turbulence using a stochastic process, we numerically calculate probability distributions for the lifetime of droplets, showing how an increase in the air turbulent velocity significantly enhances the range of lifetimes. The distributions reveal non-negligible probabilities for very long lifetimes, which potentially escalate the risk of transmission.

Addressing the hypothesized third wave of health care demand due to COVID-19 through VH is critical not only for ongoing military readiness requirements, but holds lessons both good and bad for civilian health care delivery as well.","output":"The Drum Must Beat On: COVID-19 and the U.S. Military's Virtual Health Response in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is both uncertainty regarding the safety of clozapine in COVID-19 patients owing to limited published data and a lack of consensus on continuing clozapine in patients with severe respiratory infections. COVID-19 is known to induce an acute immune response which can affect haematological parameters associated with clozapine monitoring, and systemic infection may reduce clozapine clearance. Clozapine, which has been associated with worse outcomes in some pneumonias, may in theory worsen outcomes in COVID-19. Despite these concerns, there are some data to indicate it is safe to continue clozapine in COVID-19 infection. In this retrospective case series, we describe our experiences of clozapine prescribing and disease progression of eight SARS-CoV-2 positive patients on medical wards in a major London teaching hospital. In four cases clozapine was stopped during the hospital admission. A COVID-19 pneumonia developed in four patients: three of these required intensive care unit admission for an average of 34 days. At the time of writing, three patients had died (two directly from COVID-19 pneumonia), two remained in general hospital wards, two were recovering in the community and one had been transferred to an inpatient psychiatric hospital. Follow-up length varied but in each case was not more than 104 days. Delirium was the most common adverse neuropsychiatric event, and in one case a relapse of psychosis occurred after cessation of clozapine. This retrospective case series illustrates the safe use of clozapine during COVID-19 infection. Our experiences suggest that consideration should be made to continuing clozapine even in those most unwell with COVID-19. We also identify areas which require larger scale hypothesis-testing research.","output":"Clozapine prescribing in COVID-19 positive medical inpatients: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an auto-immune disease, and the mainstay of therapy is immunomodulation.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary measure was vital status at end of study follow-up. Secondary measures included patient characteristics, laboratory analyses, changes to immunosuppression, and treatment administered for COVID-19. Results Twenty-eight patients with HT received a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median age was 64.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 53.5-70.5) years, 22 (79%) were men, and the median time from HT was 8.6 (IQR, 4.2-14.5) years. Comorbid conditions included hypertension in 20 patients (71%), diabetes in 17 patients (61%), and cardiac allograft vasculopathy in 16 patients (57%). Twenty-two participants (79%) were admitted for treatment, and 7 (25%) required mechanical ventilation. Most (13 of 17 [76%]) had evidence of myocardial injury (median high-sensitivity troponin T, 0.055 [IQR, 0.0205-0.1345] ng/mL) and elevated inflammatory biomarkers (median peak high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 11.83 [IQR, 7.44-19.26] mg/dL; median peak interleukin 6, 105 [IQR, 38-296] pg/mL). Among patients managed at the study institution, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued in 16 patients (70%), and 6 (26%) had a reduction in the dose of their calcineurin inhibitor. Treatment of COVID-19 included hydroxychloroquine (18 patients [78%]), high-dose corticosteroids (8 patients [47%]), and interleukin 6 receptor antagonists (6 patients [26%]).

Communication and interaction between different host cells at the early stage of viral infections determine the quality and magnitude of immune responses against the invading virus. The release of membrane-encapsulated extracellular vesicles (EVs), from host cells, is defined as a refined system of cell-to-cell communication. EVs contain a diverse array of biomolecules, including microRNAs (miRNAs). We hypothesized that the activation of the tracheal cells with different stimuli impacts the cellular and EV miRNA profiles. Chicken tracheal rings were stimulated with polyI:C and LPS from Escherichia coli 026:B6 or infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus H4N6. Subsequently, miRNAs were isolated from chicken tracheal cells or from EVs released from chicken tracheal cells. Differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified in treated groups when compared to the control group. Our results demonstrated that there were 67 up-regulated miRNAs, 157 down-regulated miRNAs across all cellular and EV samples. In the next step, several genes or pathways targeted by DE miRNAs were predicted. Overall, this study presented a global miRNA expression profile in chicken tracheas in response to avian influenza viruses (AIV) and toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. The results presented predicted the possible roles of some DE miRNAs in the induction of antiviral responses.

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the prognostic value of the peri-infarct zone on late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance in ischemic cardiomyopathy. METHODS We searched MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), EMBASE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), and CENTRAL (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) from inception to January 2019 for prognostic studies relating peri-infarct size with clinical outcomes in ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction. Pooled effect estimates were calculated with random effects models, risk of bias and strength of evidence were assessed by the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Education, respectively. RESULTS Twenty studies were eligible, representing 14 cohort studies (n=1518) with mean follow-up of 3.6 years and 6 cross-sectional studies (n=189). The extent of the peri-infarct zone was significantly predictive of all-cause mortality (3 studies; n=539; hazard ratio, 1.34/10 g [95% CI, 1.13-1.59]; I2=0%; high-quality evidence), appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy (5 studies; n=361; hazard ratio, 1.31/10 g [95% CI, 1.17-1.47]; I2=0%; high-quality evidence), and inducibility of ventricular tachycardia on electrophysiological study (5 studies; n=167; OR, 2.63/g [95% CI, 1.39-4.96]; I2=14%; low-quality evidence). After adjusting for age and left ventricular ejection fraction, the peri-infarct zone, as a percentage of total infarct size, remained an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (2 studies; n=445; hazard ratio, 1.29/10% [95% CI, 1.15-1.44]; I2=0%; high-quality evidence). CONCLUSIONS There is limited but consistent evidence that quantification of the peri-infarct zone predicts long-term mortality and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Methods: We conducted an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey in 64 countries between May and June 2020. The survey was available in 12 languages and hosted on the Pregistry platform for COVID-19 studies. Participants were sought mainly on social media platforms and online parenting forums. The survey included questions related to demographics, level of worry, support, stress, COVID-19 exposure, frequency of media usage, and mental health indicators. Results: The study included 7,561 participants. Eighty-three percent of all participants indicated that they were either somewhat or very worried. Women 13-28 weeks pregnant were significantly more likely to indicate that they were very worried compared to those who were postpartum or at other stages of pregnancy. When compared with women living in Europe, those in Africa, Asia and Pacific, North America and South/Latin America were more likely to have increased levels of worry, as were those who more frequently interacted with social media. Different forms of support and stress also had an impact upon level of worry, while indicators of stress and anxiety were positively associated with worry level.

Here, we assessed spinal cord autoregulation under normal, hypovolemic, and post-fluid resuscitation conditions compared with cerebral autoregulation. METHODS: Ten pigs (36.1  1.1 kg) were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, before phenylephrine administration at 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 g kg(?1) min(?1) in a stepwise fashion at 10-min intervals (baseline), followed by similar administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Hypovolemia was induced by a 600-ml bleed (25% estimated total blood volume). Only phenylephrine was readministered (same protocol). Hypovolemia was reversed by infusing 600 ml hydroxyethyl starch, before readministering phenylephrine and SNP. The relationships between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord tissue oxygenation indices (TOIs) were evaluated. RESULTS: Thoracic and lumbar spinal cord TOIs were approximately 15% and 10% lower, respectively, than the cerebral TOI at similar MAPs. The average relationship between MAP and each TOI showed an autoregulatory pattern, but negative correlations were observed in the cerebral TOI during phenylephrine infusion. A 600-ml bleed lowered each relationship < 5% and subsequent fluid resuscitation did not change the relationship. Individual oxygenation responses to blood pressure indicated that the spinal cord is more pressure-passive than the cerebrum. Paradoxical responses (an inverse relationship of tissue oxygenation to MAP) were observed particularly in cerebrum during phenylephrine infusion and were rare in the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord autoregulation is less robust than cerebral autoregulation and more pressure-dependent. Similar to cerebral oxygenation, spinal cord oxygenation is volume-tolerant but is more sensitive to hypotension.","output":"Spinal cord autoregulation using near-infrared spectroscopy under normal, hypovolemic, and post-fluid resuscitation conditions in a swine model: a comparison with cerebral autoregulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: COVID-19 Pandemic hit India in January 2020.

The device gradually slows flow of blood into the aneurysm, but the high metal coverage of PED promotes endothelialization of the device. Occasionally, this leads to in-stent stenosis that is clinically well tolerated. We present a multi-institutional Pipeline series that includes three cases of gradual asymptomatic occlusion within the PED and parent vessel. METHODS Institutional databases at each participating center were searched for patients treated with the PED. Patients with at least 50% stenosis or occlusion were selected and all relevant clinical and radiographic data were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 326 cases performed by five neurointerventionalists across four institutions were reviewed. Among these there were three cases of complete occlusion and two cases of stenosis of more than 50%, for an occlusion rate of 0.9%. All patients were clinically asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS A gradual tourniquet-like occlusion can occur following placement of the PED, leading to vessel occlusion. This has been clinically well tolerated by patients in our series due to the formation of pial collaterals as the stenosis progresses, likely due to ischemic preconditioning. Small parent vessel, pre-existing stenosis, fusiform pathology, overlapping devices, and suboptimal antiplatelet therapy seem to be predisposing factors.

Relative risk (95% confidence interval) of developing hypothyroidism for quetiapine use was 4.01 (2.86-5.64) after adjusting for a number of potential confounding factors. A strong dose-response association between quetiapine use and risk of developing hypothyroidism was observed: adjusted relative risks (95% confidence intervals) were 1.00 (0.25-2.59), 4.22 (2.80-6.25), and 5.62 (3.66-8.38), respectively, for low-, medium-, and high-dose quetiapine, as compared with no quetiapine. CONCLUSION Acute phase quetiapine treatment for schizophrenia patients was strongly associated with increased risk of developing new onset hypothyroidism, with a clear dose-response association.","output":"Dose-responses association of acute phase quetiapine treatment with risk of new onset hypothyroidism in schizophrenia patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to closures of non-essential businesses and buildings. The impact of such closures on automated external defibrillator (AED) accessibility compared to changes in foot traffic levels is unknown. METHODS: We identified all publicly available online AED registries in Canada last updated May 1, 2019 or later. We mapped AED locations to location types and classified each location type as completely inaccessible, partially inaccessible, or unaffected based on government-issued closure orders as of May 1, 2020. Using location and mobility data from Googles COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, we identified the change in foot traffic levels between February 15CMay 1, 2020 (excluding April 10C12) compared to the baseline of January 3CFebruary 1, 2020, and determined the discrepancy between foot traffic levels and AED accessibility. RESULTS: We identified four provincial and two municipal AED registries containing a total of 5848 AEDs. Of those, we estimated that 69.9% were completely inaccessible, 18.8% were partially inaccessible, and 11.3% were unaffected. Parks, retail and recreation locations, and workplaces experienced the greatest reduction in AED accessibility. The greatest discrepancies between foot traffic levels and AED accessibility occurred in parks, retail and recreation locations, and transit stations. CONCLUSION: A majority of AEDs became inaccessible during the COVID-19 pandemic due to government-mandated closures. In a substantial number of locations across Canada, the reduction in AED accessibility was far greater than the reduction in foot traffic.","output":"Public defibrillator accessibility and mobility trends during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to measure progress with the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfa), countries have to report back to the United Nations (UN) Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) every five years. Country reports are compiled by national governments, but civil society plays an important role to expose discrepancies in country reports through shadow reports. Women's organisations and other stakeholders in the struggle for gender justice therefore act as a corrective to official views of the state of gender equality/justice in countries. Ilitha Labantu, a South African women's rights organisation, organised a South African consultative forum in 2020 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Beijing conference and reflect on what progress has still to be made, particularly foregrounding the younger generation of feminist leadership in 2020. An objective of the gathering was to provide a forum for women to share their experiences of the struggle for gender equality across generations and to make recommendations on the six action coalitions identified by the Beijing +25 UN Generation Equality campaign to catalyse and drive action and new commitment to gender equality. The consultative meeting was held in preparation for the sixty fourth session of the United Nation's Convention on the Status of Women (UN CSW64), where civil society feedback and discussion were derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The reportback focusses on the meeting's deliberations on youth recommendations on the action coalition themes: gender-based violence;economic justice and rights;bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive health and rights;feminist action for climate change;technology and innovation for gender equality;and feminist movements and leadership, that will include handing over of the reins to a younger generation of feminists.

However, evidence to support these recommendations are limited. We describe the outcome of asymptomatic patients with SARS-COV-2 undergoing surgery or AGPs. METHODS: We implemented a system-wide policy to test all patients requiring intubation or other AGPs at Henry Ford Health System (HFHS), a 5-hospital system in southeast Michigan. This was a retrospective review of asymptomatic surgical patients with COVID-19 infection between 5/1/2020C5/31/2020. All patients with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of upper respiratory tract were included. Demographics, comorbidities, procedural/surgical categories, symptoms and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: 4381 COVID-19 PCR tests were performed pre-procedurally during the study period, of which 18 (0.4%) were positive. Summary of characteristics is presented in Table 1. Mean age was 49.7 years, and the majority were female (61%) and black (67%). Six (33%) of 18 surgeries were performed despite positive COVID-19 PCR as shown in Table 2. Of those who had the procedure performed, none developed symptoms within 14 days. Two (11%) patients developed symptoms within 14 days of positive PCR after their procedures were canceled.

METHODS A multidisciplinary committee developed an EVALI algorithm on the basis of guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients diagnosed with EVALI. Descriptive analyses included sociodemographic characteristics, clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging results, pulmonary function testing, oxygen requirements, and clinic follow-up. RESULTS Thirteen hospitalized adolescents were diagnosed with confirmed or probable EVALI. The majority were female (54%) with a mean age of 15.9 years. Sixty-nine percent of patients presented with respiratory symptoms, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent in 85% of patients. Vaping -9-tetrahydrocannabinol was reported in 92% of patients, and vaping nicotine was reported in 62% of patients. All had bilateral ground-glass opacities on the chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Treatment with glucocorticoids led to clinical improvement in 11 of 12 patients. Treatment with glucocorticoids led to improvement in both forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity (P < .05).

There are differences between the sensitivity and specificity of these tests due to the usage of different viral target proteins and antibody subclasses. In order to evaluate the diagnostic use of these tests, we aimed to examine the diagnostic performance, especially sensitivity and specificity, of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgA and IgG tests of various companies (Abbott, Roche, Euroimmun, Dia.Pro, Anshlabs, Vircell, UnScience and RedCell), which have different principles (ECLIA/CLIA, EIA, LFA). Current (n= 180) and past (n= 180) COVID-19 patients with clinical and molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine Hospital, Pandemic Polyclinic with suspected COVID-19 infection, were included in our study. The patients admitted within the first 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms were included in the current patient group, and those admitted at the third and after the third week were included in the past patient group. Serum samples (n= 180) obtained from Istanbul Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital, Blood Center between April and June 2018 before the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the study as a control group. All the tests included in our study were studied with the recommendations of the manufacturer companies. Between the IgG detection tests with different principles in patients with past COVID-19, the sensitivity and specificity values of the most effective tests were; 86.7%/99.4% (Abbott), 86.1%/98.9% (Dia.Pro), 91.3%/95% (RedCell). Between the IgM detection tests with different principles in current COVID-19 patients, the sensitivity and specificity values were; 67.8%/99.4% (Abbott), 68.9%/98.6% (Vircell), 50%/97.5% (RedCell). Abbott IgM with a kappa coefficient of 0.67 and Vircell IgM + IgA test with a kappa coefficient of 0.65 showed the best fit in patients with current COVID-19 infection. In patients with past COVID-19, Abbott IgG with 0.86 kappa coefficient and Dia.Pro IgG test with 0.85 kappa coefficient showed the best match. Due to the low sensitivity of IgM detection antibody tests, they should not be preferred instead of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in routine diagnosis. IgG detection tests may be preferred to detect the antibody response and the titers in people who have had COVID-19 for population seroprevalence and especially therapeutic immune plasma production. However, it is thought that the combined use of both ECLIA/CLIA-based and EIA/ELISA-based tests together may be more effective in routine use for SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests.","output":"[Evaluation of the Diagnostic Performance of Different Principles of SARS-CoV-2 Commercial Antibody Tests in COVID-19 Patients]./ SARS-CoV-2 ile Ilgili Farkli Prensipli Ticari Antikor Testlerinin COVID-19 Hastalarindaki Tanisal Performanslarinin Degerlendirilmesi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A new General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) was developed.

The scale showed good psychometric indices and convergent and discriminant validity against existing measures. To cross-validate general attitudes with attitudes towards specific instances of AI applications, summaries of tasks accomplished by specific applications of Artificial Intelligence were sourced from newspaper articles.

Critical questions have arisen regarding: (a) the effectiveness of various vaccines in preventing infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death and (b) the magnitude and clinical consequences of post-vaccination infections in the context of emerging variants, especially the Delta variant of SARS-Cov2. While real world experiences with various vaccines have been reported, few have examined comparative effectiveness of various vaccines in one population, as new SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged. Here we present an analysis of COVID-19 related outcomes from Bahrain, a country with a total population of 1.501 million, where four vaccines were deployed (total vaccinated =1,003,960), including Astra-Zeneca (AZ/Covishield), Pfizer/BioNtech, Sinopharm and Sputnik V. By analyzing individual histories of vaccinated versus unvaccinated cases, we provide a granular description of the effectiveness of the four vaccines, disease burden in unvaccinated versus vaccinated individuals over time, and the risk of four outcomes (infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths) due to breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals. We conclude that the four vaccines were effective in reducing all four outcomes in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated individuals, prior to, and during the period when the Delta variant became dominant in the country (May 2021 to the present). However, after censoring early vaccine recipients of Sinopharm vaccine, compared to Pfizer/BionTech recipients, individuals vaccinated with Sinopharm had a higher risk of post-vaccination infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths, especially in those > 50 years old. Our overall findings support the value of vaccination in preventing COVID-19 related events even with the advent of the Delta variant. These data support the urgent need to expand vaccination access around the world, and may serve to guide the choice of vaccines in the context of the Delta variant.","output":"Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 post-vaccination breakthrough infections in association with vaccines and the emergence of variants in Bahrain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Members of the genera Enterovirus and Rhinovirus (family Picornaviridae) cause a wide range of human diseases. An established vaccine is available only for poliovirus, and no effective therapy is available for the treatment of infections caused by any pathogenic picornavirus. Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMO) are single-stranded DNA-like antisense agents that readily enter cells. A panel of PPMO was tested for their antiviral activities against various picornaviruses. PPMO targeting conserved internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence were highly active against human rhinovirus type 14, coxsackievirus type B2, and poliovirus type 1 (PV1), reducing PV1 titers by up to 6 log(10) in cell cultures. Comparative sequence analysis led us to design a PPMO (EnteroX) targeting 22 nucleotides of IRES sequence that are perfectly conserved across greater than 99% of all human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. EnteroX reduced PV1 replication in cell culture to an extent similar to that of other IRES-specific PPMO. Resistant PV1 arose in cell cultures after 12 passages in the presence of EnteroX and were found to have two mutations within the EnteroX target sequence. Nevertheless, cPVR transgenic mice treated once daily by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with EnteroX before and/or after i.p. infection with 3 x 10(8) PFU (three times the 50% lethal dose) of PV1 had an approximately 80% higher rate of survival than the controls. The viral titer in tissues taken at day 5 postinfection showed that animals in the EnteroX-treated group averaged over 3, 4, and 5 log(10) less virus in the small intestine, spinal cord, and brain, respectively, than the amount in the control animals.

However, less is known for people from refugee and asylum-seeking backgrounds. This review aims to systematically summarise the quantitative literature on the relationship between employment and health and wellbeing for refugees and asylum seekers. METHOD: A search strategy was conducted in online databases, including MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMCARE, SCOPUS, CINHAL, ProQuest and Web of Science. Articles were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies published in English between 2000 to October 2021 were included if they used quantitative methods to consider the relationship between employment and health for refugees and asylum seekers in resettlement countries. Study quality was assessed using The Joanna Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal Tools. Findings were synthesised using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Seventy-two papers were identified. The majority of papers (N = 58, 81%) examined the association between employment and mental health outcomes. Overall, while there were inconsistencies in the findings, employment had a positive effect on mental health particularly in reducing levels of psychological distress and depression. Though more limited in number, the papers examining physical health suggest that people who are employed tend to have better physical health than unemployed persons. There was some evidence to support the bi-directional relationship between employment and health. Poor mental and physical health negatively impacted the odds of employment and occupational status of refugees. CONCLUSION: Good quality employment is an essential component of refugee resettlement and this review found that in general employment is also beneficial for refugee health, particularly aspects of mental health. More research regarding the effects of employment on physical health is required. The effects of refugee-specific factors such as gender roles, torture, and trauma on the relationship between employment and health also require further investigation.","output":"The relationship between employment and health for people from refugee and asylum-seeking backgrounds: A systematic review of quantitative studies()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for high morbidity and mortality worldwide, mostly due to the exacerbated inflammatory response observed in critically ill patients.

Faced with these challenges, it is essential to work towards the creation of an environment conducive to creativity, artistic innovation and the diversity of cultural expressions, while providing the best possible support to the sector's digital transition and protecting fundamental freedoms.The cultural and creative industries (CCIs) constitute a real lever for the economic development of countries and contribute to promoting the creativity of societies and offering opportunities to imagine new futures. Before giving a global overview of CCIs, it is important to be aware of their heterogeneity with regard to their size, their sector of activity, their geographical location and the governance frameworks in which they evolve. Today, CCIs are undergoing profound transformations that are challenging their development and, for some, their sustainability.

As the disease lowers the body's immune system, the use of medications that suppress the immune system are not recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to review medications other than steroids used for interventional pain management and the emphasis on mitigation of the untoward consequences of steroid injections on the immune system during the COVID-19 pandemic. LITERATURE SEARCH The literature was searched for articles in English with key words COVID-19, immunity, steroid for pain management injections with steroid, local anesthetics, dextrose water, normal saline, pain and genetic medicine, pain, and regenerative medicine. The sources of articles were PubMed, Embase, and open Google search. LITERATURE REVIEW The medications used for interventional pain management include steroids and opioids. The side effects of these medications are well known but have never been looked at as critically as they are now. Many other medications have been used for interventional pain procedures to relieve pain, such as dextrose water, normal saline solution, local anesthetics, and many adjuvants. Regarding regenerative therapy, despite plenty of evidence in literature, we have not yet considered it as a routine therapy for chronic pain injections. It is now time to move on beyond steroids and consider other types of medications and treatment options.The use of these medications in clinical practice is less auspicious, and thus more research is needed on the practical applications. Further areas for research include studies to determine definitive efficacy and safety assessment and determine whether or not the analgesic effects of these drugs are duration or dose-dependent. The optimal identification of candidates, volume, concentration, and intervals of injection are essential for routine application in interventional chronic pain practice. CONCLUSIONS The future of interventional pain practice is trending toward regenerative medicine and genetic research. Numerous scientific studies have been conducted to investigate the genetic basis of phenotypic variability in individuals with different ethnic groups in terms of susceptibility to chronic pain, as well as response to treatment for the personalized medicine model. Despite the preliminary data on genetic variations, there is no evidence for the use of a pharmacogenomics-based approach to personalized medicine for patients with chronic pain. The field of medicine therefore needs further research in pharmacogenetics, including large-scale prospective studies that focus on pain pathways. However, recent research, including larger studies and larger-scale genomic perspectives, may yield more promising findings in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic proved the need for medications with the most impact and least complications.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications on Interventional Pain Practice-a Narrative Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID19 pandemic has pushed healthcare workers to utilize available therapeutics, often with limited evidence.

This study assessed the clinical utility of open-label tocilizumab in two multiethnic community hospitals in Queens, NY.Tocilizumab (8mg/kg) was given to 114 patients for treatment of COVID19- related respiratory failure between April 4 and May 19 2020 (96% received 1 dose). A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine 28-day clinical success, defined as achieving a score of 1 using a 6-point scale (1=no O2 requirement or discharged home on 2L/min;2=low-flow O2 in hospital 6L/min;3=O2 &gt;6 to 15L/min;4=high-flow, CPAP, or BiPAP;5=mechanically ventilated (MV);6=expired). The decision to administer tocilizumab was made by a committee based on unstable or worsening respiratory status. Mean patient age was 60 years (SD=11);77(67%) were male. 25% were Asian, 23% black (31% black Hispanic), 36% white (73% white Hispanic), and 14% other. A majority of patients had at least 1 significant comorbidity, including HTN 56%, DM 40%, HLD 43%, and COPD/asthma 16%. Median days of symptoms at dose was 14(IQR 10-19);SpO2 on RA at admission was 82%(IQR 67-88%).

Median CRP=19.9, d-dimer=1658, ferritin=593, and LDH=1561. 28-day success was achieved in 35(31%) patients;62(55%) patients expired or were MV on day 28. Of patients who were on high-flow, CPAP, BiPAP or MV at baseline, 80% expired or were on MV on day 28.

While respiratory features are commonly at the forefront of the disease, cardiovascular complications have been observed and associated with a poorer prognosis. The ACE2 enzyme intrinsically involved in the physiology of cardiac function and in the development of hypertension and diabetes has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. It is difficult to highlight the precise mechanisms of cardiac damage because of its possible multiple implications, through direct damage from SARS-CoV-2 responsible for viral myocarditis or indirect damage from the state of exacerbated systemic inflammation associated with hypoxaemia. The treatments of the disease, may also induce adverse effects such as an increase in QT segment duration. Measurements of cardiac biomarkers are required if myocardial damage is suspected and are part of a panel of arguments confronted with clinical features, ultrasonic monitoring and electrocardiogram.

In the real scenario, individuals have a different level of awareness for self-protection when facing the outbreak of an epidemic. To investigate the effects of the heterogeneous self-awareness distribution on the epidemic dynamics, we propose a resource-epidemic coevolution model in this paper. We first study the effects of the heterogeneous distributions of node degree and self-awareness on the epidemic dynamics on artificial networks. Through extensive simulations, we find that the heterogeneity of self-awareness distribution suppresses the outbreak of an epidemic, and the heterogeneity of degree distribution enhances the epidemic spreading. Next, we study how the correlation between node degree and self-awareness affects the epidemic dynamics. The results reveal that when the correlation is positive, the heterogeneity of self-awareness restrains the epidemic spreading. While, when there is a significant negative correlation, strong heterogeneous or strong homogeneous distribution of the self-awareness is not conducive for disease suppression. We find an optimal heterogeneity of self-awareness, at which the disease can be suppressed to the most extent. Further research shows that the epidemic threshold increases monotonously when the correlation changes from most negative to most positive, and a critical value of the correlation coefficient is found. When the coefficient is below the critical value, an optimal heterogeneity of self-awareness exists; otherwise, the epidemic threshold decreases monotonously with the decline of the self-awareness heterogeneity. At last, we verify the results on four typical real-world networks and find that the results on the real-world networks are consistent with those on the artificial network.","output":"Effects of heterogeneous self-protection awareness on resource-epidemic coevolution dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Social distancing and sheltering-in-place mitigate the physical health risks of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19);however, there are concerns about the impact on mental health and social engagement Methods: We used data from a U S -based online survey (March 2020) to examine patterns of social support and prosocial behavior, explore differences between people with and without depression or anxiety, and explore correlates of social engagement in both groups, including symptom severity in the clinical group Results: The clinical group reported greater social engagement In both groups, social engagement was positively associated with COVID-19-related worry and trait moral elevation;mindfulness was positively associated with all outcomes for the clinical group only Social interaction frequency had little influence on outcomes Depressive symptom severity was positively associated with all outcomes, whereas anxiety was negatively associated with prosocial behavior Discussion: These findings highlight how social engagement was experienced early in the U S COVID-19 crisis","output":"Social Engagement Early in the Us Covid-19 Crisis: Exploring Social Support and Prosocial Behavior between Those with and without Depression or Anxiety in an Online Sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Evidence-based clinical data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pharmacotherapies are scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study documented and characterized COVID-19 cases reported in individuals receiving treatment with Pfizer pharmaceutical products and cases that reported use of Pfizer pharmaceutical products for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: This retrospective observational review leveraged the Pfizer safety database containing adverse event data collected in association with use of Pfizer products between 1 October, 2019, and 25 June, 2020; the database includes worldwide adverse event data from various sources. Selected Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA?) Preferred Terms and subsequent clinical review were used to characterize COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Over 1500 relevant cases were identified over an 8-month period. In cases that reported COVID-19, immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents, followed by anticoagulant/antithrombic agents and corticosteroids, were the most frequently reported agents. The frequent reporting of immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents among cases of COVID-19 suggests increased vulnerability to infection among treated patients, either because of immunosuppressive effects of certain agents or the nature of the underlying treated condition. In cases involving off-label pharmacotherapy use for the treatment of COVID-19-related conditions, the most frequently reported therapeutic classes included antibiotics, antimalarial agents, antivirals/antiretroviral agents, immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and immunoglobulin/interferons. The most frequently reported pharmacotherapeutic agents were azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, followed by lopinavir-ritonavir, ceftriaxone, and tofacitinib. The most frequently reported clinical adverse events associated with azithromycin (as sole therapy or combined with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine) include electrocardiogram QT prolonged, drug interaction, hepatitis, diarrhea, and hepatitis acute. Regarding cardiac-related events, 19% (120/645) of azithromycin cases reported events associated with QT prolongation/torsade de pointes (which included seven fatal cardiac events). The most frequently reported clinical adverse events associated with other commonly used agents are also presented.

We aim to describe in detail technical and legal considerations regarding international teleproctoring, a tool that could waive the need for in-person supervision during procedures. METHODS: International teleproctoring was chosen to provide remote supervision during the first three intracranial aneurysm treatments with a new flow diverter (currently subject of a clinical trial) in the US. Real-time, high-resolution transmission software streamed audiovisual data to a proctor located in Canada. The software allowed the transmission of images in a de-identified, HIPAA-compliant manner. RESULTS: All three flow diverters were implanted as desired by operator and proctor and without complication. The proctor could swap between images from multiple sources and reported complete spatial and situational awareness, without any significant lag or delay in communication. Procedural times and radiologic dose were similar to those of uncomplicated, routine flow diversion cases at our institution. CONCLUSIONS: International teleproctoring was successfully implemented in our clinical practice. Its first use provided important insights for establishing this tool in our field. With no clear horizon for lifting the current travel restrictions, teleproctoring has the potential to remove the need for proctor presence in the angiography suite, thereby allowing the field to advance through the continuation of trials and the introduction of new devices in clinical practice. In order for this tool to be used safely and effectively, highly reliable connection and high-resolution equipment is necessary, and multiple legal nuances have to be considered.","output":"International teleproctoring in neurointerventional surgery and its potential impact on clinical trials in the era of COVID-19: legal and technical considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses causing flu or milder coronavirus colds are often referred to as 'seasonal viruses' as they tend to subside in warmer months.

We propose employing a discrete generalized Pareto distribution for the number of positive and negative cases. Our modelling framework allows for the parameters of these distributions to be linked to covariate effects, and for outlying observations to be dealt with via a robust estimation approach. Because meteorological conditions may vary over time, we use meteorological and not calendar variations to explain hospital charge extremes, and our empirical findings highlight their significance. We propose a measure of hospital congestion and a related tool to estimate the resulting CaRe (Charge-at-Risk-estimation) under different meteorological conditions.

Compared to men, women suffer a disproportionate burden of obesity, which adversely affects their health and that of their offspring. This study assessed the changing patterns in prevalence and determinants of overweight and obesity among non-pregnant women in SA aged 15 to 49 years (women of childbearing age (WCBA)) between 1998 and 2017. METHODS: This paper conducts secondary data analysis of seven consecutive nationally representative household surveysthe 1998 and 2016 SA Demographic and Health Surveys, 2008, 2010C2011, 2012, 2014C2015 and 2017 waves of the National Income Dynamics Survey, containing anthropometric and sociodemographic data. The changing patterns of the overweight and obesity prevalence were assessed across key variables. The inferential assessment was based on a standard t-test for the prevalence. Adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression analysis were used to examine the factors associated with overweight and obesity at each time point. RESULTS: Overweight and obesity prevalence among WCBA in SA increased from 51.3 to 60.0% and 24.7 to 35.2%, respectively, between 1998 and 2017. The urban-rural disparities in overweight and obesity decreased steadily between 1998 and 2017. The prevalence of overweight and obesity among WCBA varied by age, population group, location, current smoking status and socioeconomic status of women. For most women, the prevalence of overweight and/or obesity in 2017 was significantly higher than in 1998. Significant factors associated with being overweight and obese included increased age, self-identifying with the Black African population group, higher educational attainment, urban area residence, and wealthier socioeconomic quintiles. Smoking was inversely related to being overweight and obese. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing trend in overweight and obesity in WCBA in SA demands urgent public health attention. Increased public awareness is needed about obesity and its health consequences for this vulnerable population. Efforts are needed across different sectors to prevent excessive weight gain in WCBA, focusing on older women, self-identified Black African population group, women with higher educational attainment, women residing in urban areas, and wealthy women.","output":"Overweight and obesity in non-pregnant women of childbearing age in South Africa: subgroup regression analyses of survey data from 1998 to 2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has severely disrupted the societies and economies of ASEAN and the EU.

MethodsParticipants were a national representative sample of United States (US) adults who completed the National Immunization Survey Adult COVID Module (NIS-ACM) during August-September 2021. Respondents were asked about COVID-19 vaccination and intent, requirements for vaccination, place of work, attitudes surrounding vaccinations, and sociodemographic variables. This analysis focused on HCP respondents. We first calculated the weighted proportion reporting COVID-19 vaccination for HCP by sociodemographic variables. Then we computed unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios for vaccination coverage and key indicators on vaccine attitudes, comparing HCP based on individual self-report of vaccination requirements. ResultsOf 12,875 HCP respondents, 41.5% reported COVID-19 vaccination employer requirements.

Notably, the greatest differences in uptake between HCP with and without employee requirements were seen in sociodemographic subgroups with the lowest vaccination uptake, e.g., HCP aged 18-29 years, HCP with high school or less education, HCP living below poverty, and uninsured HCP. In every sociodemographic subgroup examined, vaccine uptake was more equitable among HCP with vaccination requirements than in HCP without. Finally, HCP with vaccination requirements were also more likely to express confidence in the vaccines safety (68.3% vs. 60.1%) and importance (89.6% vs 79.6%). ConclusionIn a large national US sample, employer requirements were associated with higher and more equitable HCP vaccination uptake across all sociodemographic groups examined. Our findings suggest that employer requirements can contribute to improving COVID-19 vaccination coverage, similar to patterns seen for other vaccines.","output":"Employer Requirements and COVID-19 Vaccination and Attitudes among Healthcare Personnel in the U.S.: Findings from National Immunization Survey Adult COVID Module, August - September 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of IgA vasculitis that occurred 1 week after COVID\\\\19 vaccination.

Invasive ventilation is considered to be essential for patients with HF. Previous studies have shown that driving pressure is associated with mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the relationship between driving pressure and mortality has not yet been examined in ventilated patients with HF. We assessed the association of driving pressure and mortality in patients with HF. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of invasive ventilated adult patients with HF from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database. We used multivariable logistic regression models, a generalized additive model, and a two-piecewise linear regression model to show the effect of the average driving pressure within 24 h of intensive care unit admission on in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Six hundred and thirty-two invasive ventilated patients with HF were enrolled. Driving pressure was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06C1.18; P < 0.001) after adjusted potential confounders. A nonlinear relationship was found between driving pressure and in-hospital mortality, which had a threshold around 14.27 cmH(2)O. The effect sizes and CIs below and above the threshold were 0.89 (0.75 to 1.05) and 1.17 (1.07 to 1.30), respectively.

AIM: We aim to show how Cankids upscaled its shared care model to ensure that COVID designated hospitals connected with other hospitals who have to continue to provide care to childhood cancer patients in the pandemic and thus ensured the continuation of treatment for these patients. METHODS AND RESULT: The need assessment of the beneficiaries was done in discussion with the hospital of origin and destination hospital. The need for shared care was also discussed with the families and consent was taken before shifting their children. Cankids with the help of advisors identified cases of high risk that need immediate attention, proactive regular monitoring, and help in care planning with the perspective and recommendation of the multiple providers. The shared care unit came forward with reasonable and discounted packages for treatment. There was a total of five hospitals requiring shared care, and 55 children were supported from April to November 2020. The median age was 8 years and their hospital of origin are in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Delhi. The expenditure on the treatment of the 55 patients was INR 61 61 636 ($ 84 843), with a median of INR 41765 (IQR 19491C174 129) on each patient.

During this time, the virus structure, action, short- and long-term effects of the infection were discovered, and treatments were developed. This epidemic undoubtedly affected people's lives, but increasing attention is also being paid to the effects of the epidemic on the environment. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, a global scoping review of peer-reviewed information has been conducted on the use of over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their positive and negative effects on the human body, the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on aquatic organisms, and their adverse effects on non-target organisms. The literature from 1998 to 2021 was analysed using the Scopus?, Web of Science? (WoS) and Google Scholar databases. As non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs place a heavy burden on the environment, all reports of the presence of these drugs in the environment during the pandemic period have been thoroughly analysed. Of the 70 peer-reviewed records within the scope, only 14% (n = 10) focussed on the analysis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs concentrations in wastewater and surface waters during the pandemic period. The percentage of these works indicates that it is still an open topic, and this issue should be supplemented with further reports in which the results obtained during the pandemic, which has been going on for several years, will be published.

In particular, if a patients condition is sufficiently severe to require invasive ventilation, it is more likely to lead to death than to recovery. OBJECTIVE: The goal of our study was to analyze the factors related to COVID-19 severity in patients and to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the severity of COVID-19 at an early stage. METHODS: We developed an AI model that predicts severity based on data from 5601 COVID-19 patients from all national and regional hospitals across South Korea as of April 2020. The clinical severity of COVID-19 was divided into two categories: low and high severity. The condition of patients in the low-severity group corresponded to no limit of activity, oxygen support with nasal prong or facial mask, and noninvasive ventilation. The condition of patients in the high-severity group corresponded to invasive ventilation, multi-organ failure with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation required, and death. For the AI model input, we used 37 variables from the medical records, including basic patient information, a physical index, initial examination findings, clinical findings, comorbid diseases, and general blood test results at an early stage. Feature importance analysis was performed with AdaBoost, random forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost); the AI model for predicting COVID-19 severity among patients was developed with a 5-layer deep neural network (DNN) with the 20 most important features, which were selected based on ranked feature importance analysis of 37 features from the comprehensive data set. The selection procedure was performed using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, balanced accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We found that age was the most important factor for predicting disease severity, followed by lymphocyte level, platelet count, and shortness of breath or dyspnea. Our proposed 5-layer DNN with the 20 most important features provided high sensitivity (90.2%), specificity (90.4%), accuracy (90.4%), balanced accuracy (90.3%), and AUC (0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed AI model with the selected features was able to predict the severity of COVID-19 accurately. We also made a web application so that anyone can access the model. We believe that sharing the AI model with the public will be helpful in validating and improving its performance.","output":"Prediction and Feature Importance Analysis for Severity of COVID-19 in South Korea Using Artificial Intelligence: Model Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To elucidate the mechanism of strong inflammatory response in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. METHODS 24 patients managed with a standard corticosteroid protocol developed by Peking Union Medical College Hospital were followed up for 2 months and their clinical outcomes were documented. Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 p70, interferon gamma (IFN gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were determined by quantitative ELISA during the course of disease respectively. 12 healthy blood donors were used as normal controls. RESULTS All SARS patients had remarkably increased plasma IL-8 concentrations (median 31.23 ng/L) at the onset of disease compared with those of normal controls (6.28 ng/L, P < 0.01). Along with the course of disease IL-8 concentration kept going up and 75% (18/24) patients reached a peak median concentration of 149.65 ng/L (P < 0.01) at the third and fourth weeks. IL-8 came back to normal control levels one month after discharged from hospital. Meanwhile, SARS patients also showed high a TNF alpha level (median 23.12 ng/L) (P < 0.01) at the second week and reached a peak median of 136.35 ng/L (P < 0.05) at the third an fourth weeks. One month after discharged from hospital the plasma TNF alpha concentration fell down to a median of 94.88 ng/L, but it was still much higher than normal controls (3.77 ng/L, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION The SARS-associated coronovirus infection may cause complex cytokine cascade.

Eleven subjects (age range, 23-40 years; mean  SD, 30.5  5.2 years) were invited to receive four point-resolved spectroscopy MRSI scans on each of 3 days in both 1.5-T (TR/TE = 1000/144 ms) and 3-T (TR/TE = 1700/144 ms) clinical scanners; a further 20 subjects (age range, 22-40 years; mean  SD, 30.5  4.9 years) were scanned on a single occasion at 3 T. Data were fitted in the time domain to determine the water-N-acetylaspartate chemical shift difference, from which the temperature was estimated. Temperature data were analysed using a linear mixed effects model to determine variance components and systematic temperature changes during the scanning sessions. To characterise the effects of instrumental drift on apparent MRSI brain temperature, a temperature-controlled phantom was constructed and scanned on multiple occasions. Components of apparent in vivo temperature variability at 1.5 T/3 T caused by inter-subject (0.18/0.17 C), inter-session (0.18/0.15 C) and within-session (0.36/0.14 C) effects, as well as voxel-to-voxel variation (0.59/0.54 C), were determined. There was a brain cooling effect during in vivo MRSI of 0.10 C [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.110, -0.094 C; p < 0.001] and 0.051 C (95% CI: -0.054, -0.048 C; p < 0.001) per scan at 1.5 T and 3 T, respectively, whereas phantom measurements revealed minimal drift in apparent MRSI temperature relative to fibre-optic temperature measurements. The mean brain temperature at 3 T was weakly associated with aural (R = 0.55, p = 0.002) and oral (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) measurements of head temperature. In conclusion, the variability associated with MRSI brain temperature mapping was quantified.

In the preparations derived from human leucocytes or cultured B lymphoblastoid cells, which are in routine clinical use, mixtures of a number of distinct subtypes of human IFN have been identified. There are also 3 slightly different verrions of the same single subtype, IFN-2, made by recombinant DNA procedures in bacteria. IFN preparations are injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Dose-related side effects are common but usually tolerable, but prolonged treatment may cause increasing fatigue and depression. Some patients form neutralising antibodies which block the effects of the IFN; these appear to be relatively more common after recombinant IFN-2 than after IFN derived from human cells. Given intranasally, IFT can prevent a subsequent experimental rhinovirus infection, or the spread of natural colds within a family. Repeated administration progressively damages the nasal mucosa, so that long term prophylaxis is not possible. IFN has proved useful in patients with papillomavirus warts of the larynx, ano-genital region (condyloma acuminata) and skin (common warts). Treatment regimens remain to be optimised and are likely to include surgery or other treatments.

Very large doses of IFN are effective against Kaposis sarcoma in some AIDS patients. In chronic hepatitis B, continuing virus replication may lead to cirrhosis or primary liver cancer. Earlier clinical trials with IFN gave inconclusive results, but recent large studies have confirmed that 25 to 40% of patients obtain benefit; this probably results from both the antiviral and the immunomodulatory effects of IFN.

We hypothesized that the study would reduce the economic burden and loss of productivity of both individuals and small businesses resulting from standard isolation methods, while providing new insights into virus-host dynamics. Study participants (27 employees and 27 household members) consented to provide frequent nasal or oral swab samples that were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two study participants were found to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the study. One subject, a household member, was SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive for at least 71 days and had quantifiable serum virus-specific antibody concentrations for over 1 year. One unrelated employee became positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over the course of the study but remained asymptomatic, with low associated viral RNA copy numbers, no detectable serum IgM and IgG concentrations, and IgA concentrations that decayed rapidly (half-life: 1.3 days).

Here, we used the Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (a disease that affects oyster farms around the world) as a model to study the genetic diversity of its causative agent, the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) in the three main French oyster-farming areas. Using ultra-deep sequencing on individual moribund oysters and an innovative combination of bioinformatics tools, we de novo assembled twenty-one OsHV-1 new genomes. Combining quantification of major and minor genetic variations, phylogenetic analysis, and ancestral state reconstruction of discrete traits approaches, we assessed the connectivity of OsHV-1 viral populations between the three oyster-farming areas. Our results suggest that the Marennes-Olron Bay represents the main source of OsHV-1 diversity, from where the virus has dispersed to other farming areas, a scenario consistent with current practices of oyster transfers in France. We demonstrate that phylodynamic approaches can be applied to aquatic DNA viruses to determine how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape their diversity patterns.","output":"Genetic diversity and connectivity of the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 populations in France: A first attempt to phylogeographic inference for a marine mollusc disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Real-world evidence has demonstrated the effectiveness of secukinumab in the treatment of psoriasis; however, limited data are available on patient profiles of US secukinumab initiators over time and clinical outcomes in biologic-naive patients. This study describes clinical characteristics of secukinumab initiators by year, and the clinical outcomes in patients after 6- and/or 12-month follow-up visits, stratified by prior biologic use. METHODS: This observational study included patients enrolled in the CorEvitas (formerly Corrona) Psoriasis Registry. Analyses were conducted in two patient cohorts: (1) all secukinumab initiators, stratified by year, and (2) those who initiated and maintained secukinumab through a 6- and/or 12-month follow-up visit. For all secukinumab initiators, patient characteristics at initiation were described per calendar year; in initiators with follow-up visits, mean (SD) differences in percentage affected body surface area (BSA), five-point Investigators Global Assessment (IGA), and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores between baseline and follow-up visits were calculated. Analyses were conducted separately for biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients. RESULTS: Between 2015 and 2020, the proportion of secukinumab initiators in the registry who were biologic-naive increased each year from 12.5% to 49.7%. Overall, 1518 patients initiated secukinumab at or after enrollment; 980 (64.6%) were biologic experienced, and 538 (35.4%) were biologic naive. At 6 months, biologic-experienced and biologic-naive patients reported mean (SD) decreases in BSA (?9.3 [14.5] versus ?11.7 [16.6]), IGA (?1.4 [1.3] versus ?1.7 [1.4]), and PASI (?5.2 [6.6] versus ?6.7 [7.8]). The proportion of patients with an IGA score of clear/almost clear (0/1) increased over fivefold, irrespective of biologic experience. At 12 months, similar improvements were seen. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of biologic-naive secukinumab initiators increased over time. Biologic-naive patients demonstrated similar improvements in clinical outcomes compared with biologic-experienced patients, suggesting that secukinumab may be considered as a first-line therapy for psoriasis.

It is known to be associated with several gastroenteric disorders, including gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. The H. pylori genome encodes a gene product TlyA that has been shown to display potent membrane damaging properties and cytotoxic activity. On the basis of such properties, TlyA is considered as a potential virulence factor of H. pylori. In this study, we show that the H. pylori TlyA protein has a strong propensity to convert into the amyloid-like aggregated assemblies, upon exposure to elevated temperatures. Even at the physiological temperature of 37 C, TlyA shows a strong amyloidogenic property. TlyA aggregates that are generated upon exposure at temperatures of 37 C show prominent binding to dyes like thioflavin T and Nile Red. Transmission electron microscopy also demonstrates the presence of typical amyloid-like fibrils in the TlyA aggregates generated at 37 C. Conversion of TlyA into the amyloid-like aggregates is found to be associated with major alterations in the secondary and tertiary structural organization of the protein. Finally, our study shows that the preformed amyloid-like aggregates of TlyA are capable of exhibiting potent cytotoxic activities against human gastric adenocarcinoma cells. Altogether, such a propensity of H. pylori TlyA to convert into the amyloid-like aggregated assemblies with cytotoxic activity suggests potential implications for the virulence functionality of the protein.","output":"Helicobacter pylori TlyA Forms Amyloid-like Aggregates with Potent Cytotoxic Activity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein machines are clusters of protein assemblies that function in order to control the transfer of matter and energy in cells. For a specific protein machine, its working mechanisms are not only determined by the static crystal structures, but also related to the conformational transition dynamics and the corresponding energy profiles. With the rapid development of crystallographic techniques, the spatial scale of resolved structures is reaching up to thousands of residues, and the concomitant conformational changes become more and more complicated, posing a great challenge for computational biology research. Previously, a coarse-grained (CG) model aiming at conformational free energy evaluation was developed and showed excellent ability to reproduce the energy profiles by accurate electrostatic interaction calculations. In this study, we extended the application of the CG model to a series of large-scale protein machine systems. The spike protein trimer of SARS-CoV-2, ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) tetramer, and P4-ATPases systems were carefully studied and discussed as examples. It is indicated that the CG model is effective to depict the energy profiles of the conformational pathway between two endpoint structures, especially for large-scale systems. Both the energy change and energy barrier between endpoint structures provide reasonable mechanism explanations for the associated biological processes, including the opening of receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, the phospholipid transportation of P4-ATPase, and the loop translocation of ACLY.

We assessed the probability of target attainment and compared efficacy outcomes from ASPECT-NP in participants with augmented renal clearance (ARC) versus those with normal renal function. METHODS: Baseline renal function was categorized as normal renal function (creatinine clearance 80C130 mL/min) or ARC (creatinine clearance > 130 mL/min). Population pharmacokinetic models informed Monte Carlo simulations to assess probability of target attainment in plasma and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid. Outcomes included 28-day all-cause mortality and clinical cure and per-participant microbiologic cure rates at the test-of-cure visit. RESULTS: A > 99% and > 80% probability of target attainment was demonstrated for ceftolozane and tazobactam, respectively, in simulated plasma and epithelial lining fluid. Within treatment arms, 28-day all-cause mortality rates in participants with normal renal function (C/T, n = 131; meropenem, n = 123) and ARC (C/T, n = 96; meropenem, n = 113) were comparable (data comparisons presented as rate; treatment difference [95% CI]) (C/T: normal renal function, 17.6%; ARC, 17.7%; 0.2 [? 9.6 to 10.6]; meropenem: normal renal function, 20.3%; ARC, 17.7%; ? 2.6 [? 12.6 to 7.5]). Clinical cure rates at test-of-cure were also comparable across renal function groups within treatment arms (C/T: normal renal function, 57.3%; ARC, 59.4%; ? 2.1 [? 14.8 to 10.8]; meropenem: normal renal function, 59.3%; ARC, 57.5%; 1.8 [? 10.6 to 14.2]). Per-participant microbiologic cure rates at test-of-cure were consistent across renal function groups within treatment arms (C/T: normal renal function, 72.2% [n/N = 70/97]; ARC, 71.4% [n/N = 55/77]; 0.7 [? 12.4 to 14.2]; meropenem: normal renal function, 75.0% [n/N = 66/88]; ARC, 70.0% [n/N = 49/70]; 5.0 [? 8.7 to 19.0]).

This study's objective was to devise a method to measure the prevalence of improper mask use and no mask use in indoor public areas without relying on self-report. A stratified random sample of retail trade stores (public areas) in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, was selected and targeted for observation by trained surveyors during December 14-20, 2020. The stratification allowed for investigating mask use behavior by city district, retail trade group, and public area size. The total number of visited public areas was 382 where mask use behavior of 2,080 visitors and 1,510 staff were observed. The average prevalence of mask use among observed visitors was 96%, while the average prevalence of proper use was 86%. In 48% of the public areas, at least one improperly masked visitor was observed and in 17% at least one unmasked visitor was observed. The average prevalence of proper mask use among staff was 87%, similar to the average among visitors. However, the percentage of public areas where at least one improperly masked staff was observed was 33. Significant disparities in mask use and its proper use were observed among both visitors and staff by public area size, retail trade type, and geographical area. Observing unmasked and improperly masked visitors was more common in small (less than 1500 square feet) public areas than larger ones, specifically in food and grocery stores as compared to other retail stores.

Data of ABG analysis {pH, PaO2 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood), PaCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood) and bicarbonate (HCO3)} in 314 adult COVID-19 positive cases were obtained from ICU records. All critically ill COVID-19 patients those who were admitted in ICU and age more than 15 years of age were included in this study. Data were analysed and Pearson correlation test was applied for statistical significance. Results: Among the study subjects, 234 (74.5%) were male. Most affected age group was 51-60 years among males and above 60 years among females. Most common ABG finding was high pH indicating alkalosis, found among 183 (58.3%) patients. Acidosis was rare and seen in only 19 (6.0%) patients. A total of 174 (55.4%) patients developed respiratory alkalosis with low PaCo2. Hypoxaemia was found in 144 (45.9%) patients. High HCO3, indicating metabolic alkalosis, was seen in 144 (45.9%) patients. Statistically significant correlation was found between PaCO2 and pH (person correlation coefficient (r) =-0.153, p=0.007) and PaCO2 and HCO3 standard (r=0.185, p=0.001).

This has happened due to rapid nutritional transition over the past few decades. As childhood obesity is multi-factorial in origin and unhealthy foods, packaged foods, high calorie foods are considered as important behavioral risk factors. The aim of this article is to opine whether appropriate food labeling is one of the preventable methods in prevention of childhood obesity. METHODS: A thorough literature search on childhood obesity articles on well-known search engines like Cochrane Library, PubMed, Google Scholar and Embase electronic data base was done to reach an opinion and derive a conclusion. RESULTS: Among many interventions to prevent NCDs, it is evident that effective FPL can reduce the burden of NCDs, including childhood obesity. Additionally, it was found that during purchasing any food items, consumer knowledge/information plays a crucial role for food purchasing which is commonly recognized by food labels. The problems with the existing food labels are-these are misleading/not completely understandable/not clearly visible to the consumers due to multiple reasons like low literacy levels, diverse languages, small font size and many more. Globally, there exists multiple food labeling system which are consumer friendly. It is the right time for us to join other countries in experimenting with creative food labelling systems. The Chilean system being the gold standard in this regard. CONCLUSION: It is evident that good food labeling can effectively reduce the burden of non-communicable disease/childhood obesity (indirect evidence) by empowering customers to buy the right/healthy foods.

Current approaches to framing fall into two primary categories. On one hand, models grounded in reductionist perspectives tend to oversimplify the problems and thus fall short of capturing the true complexity that must be understood to make tangible progress. On the other, notable attempts to achieve holism are more effective at incorporating contextual nuance, but still lack systematicity to identify and drive effective inclusion of critical issues, and also tend to suffer from the inherent bias of select expert input. In this article, we report on an extension of holistic problem framing techniques called comprehensive success factor analysis (CSFA) that makes-sense of web-mined information reflective of both expert and general population perspectives as well as pattern-informed ontological knowledge organization structure, to yield richer pictures of grand challenges. This method has been developed and refined over a seven-year period by application on a variety of distinct socio-technical challenges, and emphasizes that framing complex problems requires one to embrace multiple levels of abstraction, a plurality of perspectives, careful contextualization, and an overarching system view. The CSFA method results in success factor trees that are seemingly more comprehensive than seen otherwise and present a holistic view of the essential factors that need to be considered when engaging on large scale socio-technical problems. The success factor trees provide common grounds for meaningful collaboration and discourse on grand challenges, facilitate more informed resource allocation decisions, and provide guidance for designing solutions through careful consideration of system factors that are not always apparent. The paper illustrates CSFA applied to the challenge of food security for a nation in a developing economy context to ascertain the value of the approach and finds that it results in a robust view of the challenge that greatly exceeds perspectives arrived at in the literature on dimensions of scope, levels of abstraction, plurality, and context detail, using current framing methods.","output":"Framing the Intractable C Comprehensive Success Factor Analysis for Grand Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extent of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in many African countries remains unclear, underlining the need for antibody sero-surveys to assess the cumulative attack rate.

Runners of all abilities were recruited via social media to complete a custom Qualtrics survey. Demographics, running volume, behaviors, motivations, and injury status were assessed for the year prior to the pandemic, and during social isolation measures. Descriptive statistics and Students t-tests were used to assess changes in running outcomes during the pandemic. Logistic regressions were used to assess the influence of demographics on running behaviors and injury. Adjusted RRI risk ratios were calculated to determine the odds of sustaining an injury during the pandemic. Alpha was set to.05 for all analyses. A total of 1147 runners (66% females, median age: 35 years) across 15 countries (96% United States) completed the survey. Runners reported increased runs per week (Mean Difference with Standard Error [MD]: 0.30 [0.05], p < .001), sustained runs (MD: 0.44 [0.05], p < .001), mileage (MD: 0.87 [0.33], p = .01), and running times of day (MD: 0.11 [0.03], p < .001) during the pandemic, yet reported less workouts (i.e. sprint intervals; MD: -0.33 [0.06], p < .001), and less motives (MD [SE]: -0.41 [0.04], p < .001). Behavior changes were influenced by running experience and age. There was 1.40 (CI: 1.18,1.61) times the RRI risk during the pandemic compared to prior to the social isolation period. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced runners behaviors with increased training volume, decreased intensity and motivation, and heightened injury risk. These results provide insights into how physical activity patterns were influenced by large-scale social isolation directives associated with the pandemic.","output":"Running behaviors, motivations, and injury risk during the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey of 1147 runners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 1952, inspired by the \\"tissue therapy\\" which was being carried out nationwide at that time, Yu Changshi, a folk science enthusiast, proposed \\"chicken blood therapy\\" .

Intriguingly, since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, it is technically impossible to distinguish SNPs and RNA modifications from the RNA-seq data alone without solid evidence, making it difficult to tell the evolutionary patterns behind the mutation spectrum. Researchers should clarify their biological significance before they automatically regard the mutations as SNPs or RNA modifications.

Different public organisms are leading the Health Promotion (HP) agenda without a real integration of the approach. An interdisciplinary group of health professionals working on HP carried out a qualitative study to assess barriers, facilitators and recommendations of health professionals and public policy managers for applying HP. METHODS: Six focus groups with 52 purposively selected professionals of different health disciplines and three in-depth interviews with public policy managers were conducted between March 2017-February 2020 until saturation was reached. An external expert on Sociology conducted all interviews and codification was done by three researchers from the group. Literature review helped to complete triangulation. RESULTS: The salutogenic approach was mostly unknown. The health system was not set with a people-centred perspective and HP not integrated within health services. Different public organisms competed for leadership and resources in HP. There was limited expenditure for the primary health care services working on HP. Coordination across healthcare services levels and sectors was scarce. Roles and responsibilities related to HP were not defined. Health professionals were not aware of evidence-based approaches. Some interdepartmental public health plans were already designed but not fully deployed, mainly due to lack of funding and disaggregated mechanisms of governance and financing. Initiatives such as the Municipal Health Committees or social prescription were positively perceived. CONCLUSIONS: The Catalan Public Health Agency and health providers should work aligned. Financing and reallocation of resources for Public Health and HP should be enhanced. Health should be a core value in educational plans. Local and regional stakeholders should have a higher role in resetting health services. KEY MESSAGES: Governance for Health in All Policies needs intersectoral partnerships.

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on university students' dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Participants were students (n=125) from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina. An online questionnaire was administered retrospectively (for pre-pandemic) and prospectively (during the pandemic) to examine students' dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Overall, nutrient and caloric intakes were significantly reduced (p<0.05) during the pandemic, and alcohol intake increased (p=0.03). Before the pandemic, 16% and 54% of the participants were meeting the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults (18-64 years) of 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity and 8 hours or less of sedentary activity respectively. Only 10% met the guidelines for physical activity while 30% met the guidelines for sedentary behaviour during the pandemic. The minutes per week spent engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity during the pandemic decreased by approximately 20% (p<0.001). The hours spent in sedentary activities increased by 3 hours per day (p<0.001). Our findings confirm that during the pandemic, students' inadequate dietary intake, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour were significantly compounded. Novelty During COVID-19, the nutrient and caloric intakes of university students decreased, and alcohol intake increased significantly. University students' physical activity levels decreased, and sedentary activity increased significantly during COVID-19.

Methods: The observations of social distancing, daily deaths, infections along with the needed hospital resources for COVID-19 patient hospitalizations including the numbers of all hospital beds, beds needed in ICUs and infection wards, nursing staffs needed in ICUs and infection wards were collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) by the University of Washington. The observations of social distancing were based on the reduction in human contact relative to background levels for each location quantified by cell phone mobility data collected from IHME. The weighted data per 100,000 population gathered in a 40-day period of the first wave of the pandemic in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Statistical technique of panel data analysis is used to measure the associations between our social distancing and COVID-19 indicators in long-run. Results: Results of dynamic long-run models confirm that a 1% rise in social distancing by reducing human contacts may decline daily deaths, daily infections, all hospital beds needed, beds/nurses needed in ICUs and beds/nurses needed in infection wards due COVID-19 pandemic by 1.13%, 15.26%, 1.10%, 1.17% and 1.89%, respectively. Moreover, results of error correction models verify that if the equilibriums between these series are disrupted by a sudden change in social distancing, the lengths of restoring back to equilibrium are 67, 62, 40, 22 and 49 days for daily deaths, daily infections, all hospital beds needed, nurses/beds needed in ICUs and nurses/beds needed in infection wards, respectively. Conclusion: Proper social distancing was a successful policy for tackling COVID-19 with falling mortality and infection rates as well as the needed hospital resources for patient hospitalizations in Nordic countries. The results alert governments of the need for continuously implementing social distancing policies while using vaccines to prevent outbreaks and reduce the burden of patient hospitalizations on nursing and medical staff.","output":"Role of social distancing in tackling COVID-19 during the first wave of pandemic in Nordic region: Evidence from daily deaths, infections and needed hospital resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanjing, as one of the core cities in the Yangtze River Delta, has developed industries and serious air pollution. In order to further study the pollution status in Nanjing, MODIS and CALIPSO's aerosol products were used to analyze the aerosol characteristics of Nanjing from 2011 to 2019. Then, four kinds of common reactive gases (SO2, NO, NO2 and O3) in the atmosphere of Nanjing in winter were analyzed based on the data of ground-based reactive gas analyzer. The results shows that: (1) The AOD over Nanjing showed a downward trend in the whole nine years, and the AOD could reach 0.7 in winter. The pollution degree was the highest in the four seasons. The aerosol was mainly composed of coarse particles and absorbent particles in winter. (2) The near surface atmosphere (within 2 km) of Nanjing was dominated by large particles and irregular particles. Mainly, the proportion of fine particles and regular particles gradually increased within 2-6 km, and the volume of particles changed little within 2-6 km. (3) Among the four common reactive gases in winter, the (NO) in the atmosphere was the most significant, and the maximum value was 16010-9, and the change trend of NO2 and O3 was opposite. Due to the emission limitation and the promotion of desulfurization measures, and the influence of photochemical reaction, the (SO2) was the lowest, only about 310-9. Combined with OMI data, the (NOx) over Nanjing remained at a low level in early 2020 due to the shutdown of factories because of COVID-19. Studies have shown that the particulate pollution in Nanjing has improved in recent years, but it is still necessary to pay attention to the emission of coarse particles, and it is necessary to strictly control the emission of gaseous pollutants from factories, especially NOx. ? 2021, Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Health on the Net (HON) principles were used as a validated benchmark to assess the reliability of websites which appeared in the first 150 results of a search using the Google search engine. A variety of urological search terms were used, grouped into three broad categories with varying relevance to patients and medical students. Further analysis focused on the sponsorship of assessed websites. RESULTS 5,400 websites were assessed for validation over a set of 36 search terms. Only 843/5400 (15.6%) of these were HONcode accredited, indicating a large proportion of unverified and potentially unreliable information. Search engine rankings usually favoured accredited websites (P=0.0093), and accreditation peaked at 51.1% (184/360) in the first page of results, but sorting became weaker outside the highest search results. The percentage of accredited websites varied significantly between different subcategories of search terms such as conditions (18.3% (329/1800), P=0.0029) and procedures (13.5% (243/1800), P=0.0426).

METHODOLOGY A sentinel surveillance study was conducted at Cairo University Hospital (CUH) between February 2010 and May 2011. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs were collected from all children admitted with SARIs. Viruses were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS Out of 1,046 children, 380 (36%) were positive for one or more viruses; these included respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (22.9%), adenovirus (6.2%), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs1-3) (5.1%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (4.5%), influenza A (1.4%), and influenza B (0.6%). Viral etiology was mainly detected in children under one year of age (88.9%). Prolonged length of stay was independently associated with the presence of cyanosis and underlying chronic illness (OR 7.4, CI: 1.8-30.32 [p = 0.005], OR 2.5, CI: 1.36-4.64 [p = 0.004], respectively). Virus type did not affect the length of hospital stay (p > 0.05). Oxygen therapy was required in 91% of the patients. A total of 43 patients (11.6%) required intensive care admission. Twenty-one patients (5.5%) died, and 15 of them (71.4%) had an underlying chronic illness. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrated the important burden of respiratory viruses as a cause of SARI in hospitalized children in a tertiary Egyptian hospital. Cyanosis and underlying chronic illness were significantly associated with prolonged length of stay.","output":"Risk factors of prolonged hospital stay in children with viral severe acute respiratory infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The following sections are included: Introduction Leadership Lesson 1: Authentic Leaders Demonstrate Vulnerability and Transparency Leadership Lesson 2: Lead with a Focus on Creativity, Not Productivity Leadership Lesson 3: Leaders Create a Vision Leadership Lesson 4: Aim for Operational Excellence to Ensure Organisational Success Leadership Lesson 5: The Need to Develop Emotional Intelligence References. ? 2021 by Editors.","output":"How to enhance organisation functioning in a pandemic: COVID-19 lessons in leadership"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of Alphacoronavirus, has caused huge economic losses for the global pork industry recently. The spike (S) protein mediates PEDV entry into host cells. Herein, we investigated the interactions between the S protein and its receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) or co-receptor sugars. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 domain is bound to pAPN. The prototype strain demonstrated similar receptor-binding activity compared with the variant field isolate. Three loops at the tips of the -barrel domains did not play crucial roles in the PEDV S-pAPN association, indicating that PEDV conforms to a different receptor recognition model compared with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of the PEDV S1 domain could bind sugar, a possible co-receptor for PEDV. The prototype strain exhibited weaker sugar-binding activity compared with the variant field isolate. Strategies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) may be helpful for developing vaccines or antiviral drugs for PEDV. Understanding the differences in receptor binding between the prototype and the variant strains may provide insight into PEDV pathogenesis.","output":"Identification and Comparison of Receptor Binding Characteristics of the Spike Protein of Two Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have been carried out to evaluate different immune system components to search for prognostic biomarkers of the disease. A broad multiparametric antibody panel of cellular and humoral components of the innate and the adaptative immune response in patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection has been evaluated in this study. A total of 155 patients were studied at admission into our center and were categorized according to the requirement of oxygen therapy as mild or severe (the latter being those with the requirement). The patients with severe disease were older and had high ferritin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, troponin, interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and neutrophilia with lymphopenia at admission. Moreover, the patients with mild symptoms had significantly increased circulating non-classical monocytes, innate lymphoid cells, and regulatory NK cells. In contrast, severe patients had a low frequency of Th1 and regulatory T cells with increased activated and exhausted CD8 phenotype (CD8(+)CD38(+)HLADR(+) and CD8(+)CD27(?)CD28(?), respectively). The predictive model included age, ferritin, D-dimer, lymph counts, C4, CD8(+)CD27(?)CD28(?), and non-classical monocytes in the logistic regression analysis.

This study investigated physicians' perceptions and experiences of caring for critically ill patients in the context of actual or anticipated resource strain during the COVID-19 pandemic, and explored implications for the healthcare workforce and the delivery of patient care. METHODS: We recruited a diverse sample of critical care physicians from 13 Canadian Universities with adult critical care training programs. We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews between March 25-June 25, 2020 and used qualitative thematic analysis to derive primary themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Fifteen participants (eight female, seven male; median age = 40) from 14 different intensive care units described three overarching themes related to physicians' perceptions and experiences of caring for critically ill patients during the pandemic: 1) Conditions contributing to resource strain (e.g., continuously evolving pandemic conditions); 2) Implications of resource strain on critical care physicians personally (e.g., safety concerns) and professionally (e.g. practice change); and 3) Enablers of resource sufficiency (e.g., adequate human resources). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has required health systems and healthcare providers to continuously adapt to rapidly evolving circumstances. Participants' uncertainty about whether their unit's planning and resources would be sufficient to ensure the delivery of high quality patient care throughout the pandemic, coupled with fear and anxiety over personal and familial transmission, indicate the need for a unified systemic pandemic response plan for future infectious disease outbreaks.","output":"A qualitative study of physician perceptions and experiences of caring for critically ill patients in the context of resource strain during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics have ravished the globe periodically, often associated with war, at times commencing as fever and rash, beginning in recorded history in the crowded walled city of Athens during the Peloponnesian War as described in great detail by the Athenian historian and military general Thucydides in 430 BCE.

We report on the first case of a patient with acute severe ulcerative colitis and mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who received rescue infliximab therapy, followed by a relapse caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli 0157:H7. The treatment challenges we faced were biologic therapy administration during active COVID-19, about which little was known at the time, and how to treat EHEC due to the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Acute severe ulcerative colitis was treated with rescue infliximab therapy, and enteric infection with an antibiotic, both with satisfactory clinical response. The decision to induce biologic therapy for inflammatory bowel disease relapse in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients should be made on a case-to-case basis and should be driven by the dominant disease. Our patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but actually had mild disease. At the same time, she had acute severe ulcerative colitis, so we started anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy despite serological tests and the recommendation to delay biological therapy administration for two-weeks.

As more than one year elapsed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a multitude of medical studies involving the SARS-CoV-2 virus helped researchers and medical practitioners in understanding the effects it has on all sorts of patients until effective vaccines were finally developed and distributed for mass vaccination. Still, the SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants remain a potential threat towards all categories of patients, including a more delicate group represented by pregnant women. Thus, the current study aims to investigate the potential effects on obstetrical outcomes after a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: This single-center prospective cohort study investigated the pregnancy outcomes in a total of 1039 eligible pregnant women between 30 August 2020 and 30 January 2021. Multiple patient characteristics and obstetrical outcomes were tested and analyzed in a multivariate regression model to establish potential risks determined by a COVID-19-positive pregnancy towards the mother and the newborn. Results: In the study sample, there were 938 pregnancies included without COVID-19 and 101 pregnant women identified with a positive COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 was significantly associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of premature rupture of membranes and 1.5 times higher risk of preterm birth with emergency c-sections and lower APGAR scores. Also, significantly more newborns were given birth prematurely, with lower APGAR scores after the mothers were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: A third-trimester infection with SARS-CoV-2 is a significant risk factor for preterm birth via an emergency cesarean section, a premature rupture of membranes, and a lower APGAR score in newborns, as compared with pregnancies where COVID-19 was not identified.","output":"Exploring Pregnancy Outcomes Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States.

Vaccines have been developed that provide protection against the highest risk HPV strains. Despite HPV vaccines having been proven to be safe and effective, uptake has been low. Religiosity has been negatively correlated with HPV vaccine uptake in some studies. It is hypothesized that religiosity and Christian religious affiliation could impact parents decision to vaccinate their children against HPV via teachings and beliefs about sexual behaviors.

ObjectiveTo assess the evolving seroprevalence and seroincidence with regards to a national lock-down in Belgium. Design, setting and participantsIn this prospective serial cross-sectional nationwide seroprevalence study, stratified by age, sex and region, 3000-4000 residual samples were collected in each of five collection periods during and after national lockdown between 30 March and 5 July 2020. Residual sera from outside hospitals were randomly selected by diagnostic laboratories and analyzed for IgG antibodies against S1 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with a semi-quantitative commercial ELISA. Seropositivity (overall, by age category and sex) and seroincidence over 3 to 4 week periods were estimated for the Belgian population. ExposureRecent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was estimated in the Belgian population. Main outcomes and measuresThe primary study outcomes were the weighted seroprevalence and seroincidence against SARS-CoV-2 in the Belgian population during five consecutive periods in Belgium. ResultsThe weighted overall seroprevalence initially increased from 2.9% (95% CI 2.3 to 3.6) to 6.0% (95% CI 5.1 to 7.1), implying a seroincidence of 3.1% (95% CI 1.9 to 4.3) between the 1st and 2nd collection period. Thereafter, seroprevalence stabilized and decreased from the 3rd to 5th period from 6.9% (95% CI 5.9 to 8.0) to 4.5% (95% CI 3.7 to 5.4). Conclusions and relevanceDuring lockdown, an initial small but increasing fraction of the Belgian population showed serologically detectable signs of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which did not further increase when confinement measures eased and full lockdown was lifted. In combination with the reported COVID-19 cases in Belgium, the estimated seroprevalences reported in this study may have helped to calibrate the Belgian response to the epidemics first wave and to guide policy makers to control for potential future waves. Seroprevalence estimates indicate that we are far from herd-immunity. Moreover, more research is needed to confirm if seropositivity correlates to protective immunity against the virus. Key points QuestionWhat is the seroprevalence, i.e. prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood serum, and seroincidence in Belgium during the first epidemic wave? FindingsThis prospective serial cross-sectional nationwide seroprevalence study using residual samples indicated that SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence doubled within 3 weeks time from 3% to 6% during the initial phase of the lockdown period.

Conventional methods for virus detection are labourious, time consuming, and only a single virus can be analysed in one assay. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to develop a novel real-time PCR method for multiple virus detection by melting curve analysis using Taqman probes in a single reaction. STUDY DESIGN: As a model, six respiratory viruses were detected in one tube using three fluorophores. The specificity was assessed by cross-reaction tests with other common respiratory pathogens. The analytical sensitivity was assessed by testing the limit of detection of the assay using artificial plasmids as the positive template. The clinical evaluation of the established assay was evaluated for the detection of respiratory viruses in clinical samples, and the results were compared with direct fluorescent antibody testing (DFA). RESULTS: The six respiratory viruses were clearly distinguished by their respective melting temperature values in the corresponding fluorescence detection channels. No cross reactions were observed by cross reaction tests. The detection limits of this assay were 2 to 2  10(3) copies per reaction for each virus. The clinical evaluation of this assay was demonstrated by analysing 352 clinical samples, and 67(19.0%) samples were positive for at least one virus. The accordance rate between the established PCR and DFA testing was high, and ranged from 94.57% to 100%.

Materials and Methods: Lectin-modified macromolecular lipid magnetic spheres were prepared by thin-film hydration method using lentil lectin derivatives (LCA-HQ) and cholesterol as raw materials. Alpha-fetoprotein variants (AFP-L3) in serum from healthy people, liver disease and liver cancer patients were isolated using the prepared lectin-modified macromolecular lipid magnetic spheres, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and AFP-L3 were detected by fully automatic time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. Results: The lectin polymer lipid magnetic sphere prepared in this study was superparamagnetic and encapsulated by a lectin derivative. There was no significant difference in the recovery rate of AFP-L3 between avidin magnetic ball-automatic time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay and manual micro-affinity column method (p>0.05). We found that AFP-L3 can be used as a differential indicator between liver cancer and liver disease. The positive rate of AFP and AFP-L3 in liver cancer patients was higher than that in healthy people and liver disease patients (p<0.001). The AUC (95% CI) of AFP and AFP-L3 were 0.743  0.031 and 0.850  0.024, respectively. AFP-L3 AUC value is greater than AFP; therefore, AFP-L3 distinguishes liver cancer more accurately, and the difference is statistically different, p<0.05. Conclusion: We proposed a novel method for integration of the lectin polymer lipid magnetic spheres and time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay that enables simple, accurate and rapid determination of AFP-L3 in clinical samples.

During this time, medical students had no opportunity to participate in academic discussions and were also socially isolated. Furthermore, medical doctors and professors of medical schools were given additional responsibilities during the pandemic because they were the frontliners in the fight against COVID-19. As a result, they did not have enough time to contribute effectively to medical student education. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the establishment of the Cerrahpasa Neuroscience Society Journal Clubs, a group of entirely student-run online journal clubs at Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa. METHODS: The website, mass emailing, and social media accounts were used to announce the online journal clubs. Only medical students were eligible to apply. Journal clubs included psychiatry, neuroradiology, neurosurgery, neurology, and neuroscience. Following the last journal club meeting, a questionnaire created by the societys board was distributed to the participants. SPSS Statistics (version 26) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Since March 15, 2021, synchronous online journal club meetings have been held every 2 weeks on a weekday using Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom. Meetings of each journal club lasted approximately 1 hour on average. Interstudent interaction across multiple institutions was achieved since a total of 45 students from 11 different universities attended the meetings on a regular basis. Students on the societys board served as academic mentors for the clubs. The clubs received excellent feedback from participants, with an overall contentment score of 4.32 out of 5. CONCLUSIONS: By establishing these clubs, we have created a venue for academic discussions, which helps to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic on education. In addition, we believe it greatly aided students in staying in touch with their peers, thereby reducing the sense of isolation. We realize that traditional journal clubs are run by faculty; however, we believe that this experience demonstrated that medical students could run a journal club on their own since the feedback from participants was excellent. Additionally, as a medical student, being a journal club academic mentor is a challenging responsibility; however, having this responsibility significantly improved our academic mentors leadership abilities.","output":"Student-Run Online Journal Club Initiative During a Time of Crisis: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abnormal weather caused by global warming has brought about unprecedented torrential rain, causing heavy rain disasters in various parts of Japan.

Aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs), techniques that can generate infectious, virus-laden aerosols, could potentially amplify transmission among healthcare workers (HCWs). Thus, it was widely recommended that HCWs use airborne precautions when performing AGMPs. However, in clinical settings it is often unclear what procedures constitute AGMPs and how the risk varies by procedure or pathogen. We set out to further define AGMPs and assess the risk for nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other high-risk viruses via AGMPs. METHODS: We identified potential AGMPs and emerging viruses that were high-risk for nosocomial transmission through reviewing experimental and clinical data. Potential AGMPs were those associated with previous virus transmission or mechanically capable of transmission. High-risk viruses were defined as those that cause severe disease in humans for which limited therapies or interventions exist, are infectious via aerosols in humans or non-human primates (NHPs), found in the respiratory tract of infected humans or NHPs, and had previous evidence of nosocomial transmission. RESULTS: We identified multiple potential AGMPs, which could be divided into those that generate aerosols or induce a patient to form aerosols, as well as eight families of high-risk viruses. All of the viruses were emerging zoonotic RNA viruses. In the family Coronaviridae, we identified potential evidence for SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission via AGMPs. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 were also found to be similarly stable when aerosolized. CONCLUSION: Multiple emerging zoonotic viruses pose a high risk for nosocomial transmission through a variety of AGMPs. Given the similar stability of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV-1 when aerosolized and prior nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-1 via AGMPs, we suspect that certain AGMPs pose an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Additional experimental studies and on-site clinical sampling during AGMPs are necessary to further risk stratify AGMPs. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"491.

A number of studies have reported that adolescents are significantly less susceptible than older adults. Summer 2020 provided an opportunity to examine data on prevalence since after months of lockdowns, with the easing of restrictions, people were mingling, leading to surges in cases. METHODS: We examined data from six U.S. states experiencing surges in the number of cases to determine prevalence of COVID-19, and two other measures, related to prevalence in adolescents and youth as compared to older adults. The two other measures were: Percentage of cases observed in a given age group / by the percentage of cases expected based on population demographics; and percentage deviation, or [(% observed- % expected)/ % expected] x100. RESULTS: Prevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and for youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p<.00001), as was percentage observed / percentage expected (p<.005). The percentage deviation was significantly greater in adolescents/youth than in older adults (p<0.00001) when there was an excess of observed cases over what was expected, and significantly less when observed cases were fewer than expected (p<0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are contrary to previous findings that adolescents are less susceptible than older adults. The findings have implications for school re-openings. The age groups 10-19 and 15-24 are students in middle school, high school, college, and the first two years of professional/graduate school.

COVID-19 was then declared as a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). The initial mortality rate of COVID-19 declared by WHO was 2%; however, this rate has increased to 3.4% as of 3 March 2020. People of all ages can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but those aged 60 or above and those with underlying medical conditions are more prone to develop severe symptoms that may lead to death. Patients with severe infection usually experience a hyper pro-inflammatory immune reaction (i.e., cytokine storm) causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has been shown to be the leading cause of death in COVID-19 patients. However, the factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, resistance and severity remain poorly understood. In this review, we thoroughly explore the correlation between various host, viral and environmental markers, and SARS-CoV-2 in terms of susceptibility and severity.","output":"Markers Associated with COVID-19 Susceptibility, Resistance, and Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Materials hosting tilted Dirac/Weyl fermions provide an emergent spacetime structure for the solid state physics.

Currently, the World Health Organization recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy as the first-line treatment for multi-drug-resistant malaria. Due to the various research articles on the use of antimalarial drugs to treat coronaviruses, a question is raised: do A. annua and its compounds provide anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) properties. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed articles that investigated the antiviral effects and mechanisms of A. annua and its phytochemicals against SARS-CoVs. Particularly, articles that studied the herbs role in inhibiting the coronavirus-host proteins were favored. Nineteen studies were retrieved. From these, fourteen in silico molecular docking studies demonstrated potential inhibitory properties of artemisinins against coronavirus-host proteins, including 3CL(PRO), S protein, N protein, E protein, cathepsin-L, helicase protein, nsp3, nsp10, nsp14, nsp15, and GRP78 receptor. Collectively, A. annua constituents may impede the SARS-CoV-2 attachment, membrane fusion, and internalization into the host cells, and hinder the viral replication and transcription process. This is the first comprehensive overview of the application of compounds from A. annua against SARS-CoV-2/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) describing all target proteins. A. annuas biological properties, the signaling pathways implicated in the COVID-19, and the advantages and disadvantages for repurposing of A. annua compounds are discussed. The combination of A. annuas biological properties, action on different signaling pathways and target proteins, and a multi-drug combined-therapy approach may synergistically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and assist in the COVID-19 treatment. Also, A. annua may modulate the host immune response to better fight the infection.","output":"An overview of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties of Artemisia annua, its antiviral action, protein-associated mechanisms, and repurposing for COVID-19 treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The occurrence of the COVID-19-virus led to drastic short-term measures to reduce its spread and influence. Regulations such as \\"physical distancing,\\" mentioned as \\"social distancing,\\" and the closure of public facilities during the lockdown could be perceived as burdensome especially by individuals who feel a strong need for social exchange and belonging. These components such as need to belong and the fear of missing out also play a major role in the development and maintenance of a problematic use of social networks. Researchers have argued recently that an increase of addictive (online) behaviors may be a likely consequence of subjectively experienced restrictions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study investigates the interplay of perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions and the fear of missing out (FoMO) as well as of symptoms of problematic social-networks use. We hypothesized that perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions mediates the effect of specific predisposing variables related to social needs on the symptom severity of a problematic use. To assess the perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions, we developed a specific questionnaire asking for perceived COVID-19-related strain in several domains of everyday-life. An exploratory factor analysis identified five factors: perceived strain related to restrictions of (1) social contacts, (2) travel, (3) childcare, (4) work, and (5) own health. In a sample of 719 German participants and data collection during the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 30th until April 3rd 2020), a structural equation model was calculated showing that higher levels of need to belong and FoMO increase perceived COVID-19-related strain, which is related to symptoms of a problematic social-networks use. The effect of need to belong on problematic social-networks use is mediated by experienced COVID-19-related strain and FoMO-online. Even if the use of social networks is not pathological per se, it may be associated with suffering for a vulnerable part of users. We conclude that specific needs and fear-associated predisposing variables contribute to experiencing physical distance and other pandemic-related restrictions as more stressful, which may increase problematic social-networks use and potentially other addictive behaviors as well in the context of the COVID-19-related lockdown.","output":"Perceived Strain Due to COVID-19-Related Restrictions Mediates the Effect of Social Needs and Fear of Missing Out on the Risk of a Problematic Use of Social Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the related disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to a pandemic proportion, increasing the demands on health systems for the containment and management of COVID-19.

Results: Although many agents have been proposed as possible treatment, to date, any of the potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2 has shown to be safe and effective for treating COVID-19. Despite the lack of definitive evidence, remdesivir remains the only antiviral with encouraging effects in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

The objectives of thoracic ultrasonography (TUS) are to aid the clinician in differentiating between pneumonia, effusions, interstitial edema and collections, and in estimating the volume status of patients with liver disease using inferior vena cava dynamic indices. The use of POCUS in patients with cirrhosis has since evolved. It is now widely used to help diagnose volume status, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction, and right ventricular dilation due to pulmonary embolism and to determine the causes for weaning failures such as effusions, lung collapse, and pneumothorax.

We examined the total number of emergency psychiatric hospital presentations and the proportion of children and adolescents presenting with severe self-harm as our two main outcome measures. In addition, we examined sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and clinical management variables for those presenting with self-harm. To compare the number of hospital presentations between 2020 and 2019 a negative binomial model was used. For other variables, individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses were carried out.

Balanced regulation of cell death and inflammatory immune responses is essential to promote protection against coronavirus infection; however, the underlying mechanisms that control these processes remain to be resolved. Here we demonstrate that infection with the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and inflammatory cell death in the form of PANoptosis. Deleting NLRP3 inflammasome components or the downstream cell death executioner gasdermin D (GSDMD) led to an initial reduction in cell death followed by a robust increase in the incidence of caspase-8- and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-mediated inflammatory cell deathafter coronavirus infection. Additionally, loss of GSDMD promoted robust NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, the amounts of some cytokines released during coronavirus infection were significantly altered in the absence of GSDMD. Altogether, our findings show that inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, is induced by coronavirus infection and that impaired NLRP3 inflammasome function or pyroptosis can lead to negative consequences for the host. These findings may have important implications for studies of coronavirus-induced disease.","output":"Impaired NLRP3 inflammasome activation/pyroptosis leads to robust inflammatory cell death via caspase-8/RIPK3 during coronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly modified the behavior of societies.

A descriptive cross-sectional correlational study was carried out. A virtual survey was conducted from April 14 to 26, 2020, and was answered mainly by social network users. During this period, Argentina was in a strict lockdown. The sample was finally composed of 1371 people between 18 and 79 years old. It was observed that most of the participants preferred the new acoustic environment. Mainly in the larger cities, before the isolation, mechanical sounds predominated, accompanied by the perception of irritation. Confinement brought a decrease in mechanical sounds and an increase in biological sounds, associated with feelings of tranquility and happiness.

Since E-CR1 expression is influenced by the genetic polymorphisms in the CR1 gene, a major genetic polymorphism located within intron 27 of the CR1 gene was simultaneously analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).

The remaining challenges are the obvious scale difference between different types of COVID-19 lesions and the similarity between the lesions and normal tissues. This work aims to segment lesions of different scales and lesion boundaries correctly by utilizing multiscale and multilevel features. A novel multiscale dilated convolutional network (MSDC-Net) is proposed against the scale difference of lesions and the low contrast between lesions and normal tissues in CT images. In our MSDC-Net, we propose a multiscale feature capture block (MSFCB) to effectively capture multiscale features for better segmentation of lesions at different scales. Furthermore, a multilevel feature aggregate (MLFA) module is proposed to reduce the information loss in the downsampling process. Experiments on the publicly available COVID-19 CT Segmentation dataset demonstrate that the proposed MSDC-Net is superior to other existing methods in segmenting lesion boundaries and large, medium, and small lesions, and achieves the best results in Dice similarity coefficient, sensitivity and mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) scores of 82.4%, 81.1% and 78.2%, respectively. Compared with other methods, the proposed model has an average improvement of 10.6% and 11.8% on Dice and mIoU. Compared with the existing methods, our network achieves more accurate segmentation of lesions at various scales and lesion boundaries, which will facilitate further clinical analysis. In the future, we consider integrating the automatic detection and segmentation of COVID-19, and conduct research on the automatic diagnosis system of COVID-19.","output":"Semantic segmentation of COVID-19 lesions with a multiscale dilated convolutional network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the downregulation of all elective interventions during the period from 15 March 2020 to 15 May 2020 in Germany led to a decrease in operations. The impact on the number of specific operations in visceral surgery is so far unknown. METHODS: This retrospective study included 301 patients who underwent a cholecystectomy or appendectomy at a university hospital or a primary care facility between 15 March 2020 and 15 May 2020 (vs. 2018 and 2019). The number of cases and the clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The suspension of elective surgery resulted in a significant reduction in elective cholecystectomy and emergency appendectomy. At the University Hospital the number of appendectomies decreased by 33% from 24 in 2018 to 16 in 2020 and the number of cholecystectomies declined by 57% from 30 in 2018 to 13 in 2020. At the primary care hospital, the number of appendectomy patients decreased by 48% from 23 in 2018 to 12 in 2020 and the number of cholecystectomies increased from the year 2018 to 2019 and subsequently declined by 30% in 2020. The duration of surgery, length of hospital stay and clinical course of patients did not significantly differ from the previous year time periods. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in frequently carried out visceral surgical interventions. In order to maintain the optimal medical care for the total population, current options for surgical and conservative treatment must be weighed against each other depending on the numbers of local infections and the individual comorbidities of the patients.","output":"Auswirkungen der ersten COVID?19-Welle auf die Viszeralchirurgie: Ein retrospektiver Fallzahlenvergleich an einem Universit?tsklinikum und einem Krankenhaus der Grund- und Regelversorgung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public welfare fundraising has been used to collect donations for medical supplies and has played an important role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the five days of Hajj, a total of 185 pilgrims were enrolled in the study. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) of 126/185 patients (68.11%) tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses by PCR. Among the 126 pilgrims whose NPS were PCR positive: (a) there were 93/126 (74%) with a single virus infection, (b) 33/126 (26%) with coinfection with more than one virus (up to four viruses): of these, 25/33 cases had coinfection with two viruses; 6/33 were infected with three viruses, while the remaining 2/33 patients had infection with four viruses. Human rhinovirus (HRV) was the most common detected viruses with 53 cases (42.06%), followed by 27 (21.43%) cases of influenza A (H1N1), and 23 (18.25%) cases of influenza A other than H1N1. Twenty-five cases of CoV-229E (19.84%) were detected more than other coronavirus members (5 CoV-OC43 (3.97%), 4 CoV-HKU1 (3.17%), and 1 CoV-NL63 (0.79%)). PIV-3 was detected in 8 cases (6.35%).

We aimed to describe the impact of the initial wave of the pandemic on admissions, care quality, and outcomes in patients with acute stroke in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Registry-based cohort study of patients with acute stroke admitted to hospital in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland between October 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020, and equivalent periods in the 3 prior years. RESULTS: One hundred fourteen hospitals provided data for a study cohort of 184 017 patients. During the lockdown period (March 23 to April 30), there was a 12% reduction (6923 versus 7902) in the number of admissions compared with the same period in the 3 previous years. Admissions fell more for ischemic than hemorrhagic stroke, for older patients, and for patients with less severe strokes. Quality of care was preserved for all measures and in some domains improved during lockdown (direct access to stroke unit care, 1-hour brain imaging, and swallow screening). Although there was no change in the proportion of patients discharged with good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, &#8804;2; 48% versus 48%), 7-day inpatient case fatality increased from 6.9% to 9.4% (P<0.001) and was 22.0% in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (adjusted rate ratio, 1.41 [1.11-1.80]). CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that the true incidence of acute stroke did not change markedly during the pandemic, hospital avoidance may have created a cohort of untreated stroke patients at risk of poorer outcomes or recurrent events. Unanticipated improvements in stroke care quality should be used as an opportunity for quality improvement and to learn about how to develop resilient health care systems.","output":"Stroke Care in the United Kingdom During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients are at high risk of severe complications and death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The first part of the article describes a case of COVID-19 in our patient after a recent kidney transplant. The second part of the article presents the outcome of literature search from multiple resources from April 2020 until March 2021. Abstracts were screened, followed by full-text review with data extraction. Part 2 discusses current treatment options of COVID-19, and part 3 refers to this treatment application in patients after solid organ transplant. RESULTS: We have summarized 45 studies from China, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Mortality rates from published studies were variable. Based on early data from Spain, 42% of patients who developed COVID-19 within 60 days of transplant died. According to results of the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database collaboration group, the 28-day COVID-19-related mortality is 21.3% for kidney transplant recipients, which is still markedly higher than what is observed in other populations. Acute kidney injury was common, and mycophenolate mofetil and mammalian target of rapamycin were discontinued in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: Effective therapy has been sought since the outbreak of the pandemic, and at the same time intensive work has been done to produce a vaccine that could effectively protect against the disease. Summing up the efforts of numerous groups of researchers from around the world that have been continued since the beginning of 2020, we may assume the following: (1) we still do not have causal drugs that would reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and allow its complete elimination, but antispike monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 seem to be very promising, and (2) the withdrawal of antiproliferative and antimetabolic drugs and the continuation of steroids and calcineurin inhibitors is now a commonly accepted approach in patients after organ transplant.","output":"The Course of SARS-CoV-2 in a Patient After a Recent Kidney Transplant: A Literature Review on COVID-19 Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2021.636089.].","output":"Corrigendum: Major Stress-Related Symptoms During the Lockdown: A Study by the Italian Society of Psychophysiology and Cognitive Neuroscience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Addressing racism is key in moving forward as a nation and creating a more equitable environment.

Trocar site hernias are mostly located in the umbilical region with a small size. Laparoscopic repair could be a choice due to the appearance of large defects and requirement of mesh repair for lateral sided TSH. We aimed to share our experience with laparoscopic repair of lateral sided trocar site hernia (LRTSH) with a long term follow up. Material and Methods Twenty-three patients who underwent LRTSH between March 2013 and July 2015 were included in our study. Four edges of the mesh were fixed with pre-tied 2/0 polypropylene suture for 9 patients initially (Group 1). Unexpected complication of chronic pain in 3 patients led us to revise our method and we avoided to position the mesh with transabdominal sutures for the rest of the patients (Group 2). Results Nineteen (82.6%) female and 4 (17.4%) male patients, with a mean age of 50.9 years underwent laparoscopic repair. Following the revision and avoiding transabdominal sutures to position the mesh, no complaint of chronic pain was observed, and the difference was statistically significant between the groups (p<0.05). Conclusion Previous laparoscopic surgery indicates the lack of obstacle in laparoscopic repair of TSH, and LRTSH can be considered as first option in treatment. Shorter mean operative time in obese patients and lack of recurrence in our series support this view. Using transabdominal sutures should be avoided to prevent chronic pain in LRTSH.","output":"Laparoscopic repair of lateral sided trocar site hernias."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and related social distancing public health recommendations will have indirect consequences for individuals with current and remitted substance use disorder (SUD). Not only will stressors increase risk for symptom exacerbation and/or relapse, but individuals will also have limited service access during this critical time. Individuals with SUD are using free, online digital recovery support services (D-RSS) that leverage peer-to-peer connection (i.e., social-online D-RSS) which simultaneously help these individuals to access support and adhere to public health guidelines. Barriers to SUD treatment and recovery support service access, however, are not unique to the COVID-19 epoch. The pandemic creates an opportunity to highlight problems that will persist beyond its immediate effects, and to offer potential solutions that might help address these long-standing, systemic issues. To help providers and other key stakeholders effectively support those interested in, or who might benefit from, participation in free, social-online D-RSS, this review outlines the following: 1) theories of expected therapeutic benefits from, and potential drawbacks of social-online D-RSS participation; 2) a typology that can be used to describe and classify D-RSS; 3) a D-RSS \\"case study\\" to illustrate how to apply the theory and typology; 4) what is known empirically about social-online D-RSS; and 5) whether and how to engage individuals with these online resources. METHOD: Narrative review combining research and theory on both in-person recovery supports and social-online D-RSS. RESULTS: Studies examining in-person recovery support services, such as AA and other mutual-help organizations, combined with theory about how social-online D-RSS might confer benefit, suggest these digital supports may engage individuals with SUD and mobilize salutary change in similar ways. While people may use in-person and digital supports simultaneously, when comparing the two modalities, communication science and telemedicine group therapy data suggest that D-RSS may not provide the same magnitude of benefit as in-person services. D-RSS can be classified based on the a) type of service, b) type of platform, c) points of access, and d) organizations responsible for their delivery. Research has not yet rigorously tested the effectiveness of social-online D-RSS specifically, though existing data suggest that those who use these services generally find their participation to be helpful. Content analyses suggest that these services are likely to facilitate social support and unlikely to expose individuals to harmful situations. CONCLUSIONS: When in-person treatment and recovery support services are limited, as is the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, expected therapeutic benefits and emerging data, taken together, suggest providers, mentors, and other community leaders may wish to refer individuals with current and remitted SUD to free, social-online D-RSS. Given the array of available services in the absence of best practice guidelines, we recommend that when making D-RSS referrals, stakeholders familiarize themselves with theorized benefits and drawbacks of participation, use a typology to describe and classify services, and integrate current empirical knowledge, while relying on trusted federal, academic, and national practice organization resource lists.","output":"Online digital recovery support services: An overview of the science and their potential to help individuals with substance use disorder during COVID-19 and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viability is the ability of a supply chain (SC) to maintain itself and survive in a changing environment through a redesign of structures and replanning of performance with long-term impacts. In this paper, we theorize a new notion-the viable supply chain (VSC). In our approach, viability is considered as an underlying SC property spanning three perspectives, i.e., agility, resilience, and sustainability. The principal ideas of the VSC model are adaptable structural SC designs for supply-demand allocations and, most importantly, establishment and control of adaptive mechanisms for transitions between the structural designs. Further, we demonstrate how the VSC components can be categorized across organizational, informational, process-functional, technological, and financial structures. Moreover, our study offers a VSC framework within an SC ecosystem. We discuss the relations between resilience and viability. Through the lens and guidance of dynamic systems theory, we illustrate the VSC model at the technical level. The VSC model can be of value for decision-makers to design SCs that can react adaptively to both positive changes (i.e., the agility angle) and be able to absorb negative disturbances, recover and survive during short-term disruptions and long-term, global shocks with societal and economical transformations (i.e., the resilience and sustainability angles). The VSC model can help firms in guiding their decisions on recovery and re-building of their SCs after global, long-term crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We emphasize that resilience is the central perspective in the VSC guaranteeing viability of the SCs of the future. Emerging directions in VSC research are discussed.","output":"Viable supply chain model: integrating agility, resilience and sustainability perspectives-lessons from and thinking beyond the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the role of pulmonary rehabilitation in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

CASE REPORT: A 46-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain, hypotension, skin hyperpigmentation after COVID-19 infection. The patient had hyponatremia, serum cortisol <1.0 ug/dL, ACTH of 807 pg/mL and aldosterone <3 ng/dL. Computed tomography (CT) findings of adrenal enlargement with no parenchymal and minimal peripheral capsular enhancement after contrast were consistent with bilateral adrenal infarction. The patient had autoimmune hepatitis and positive antiphospholipid antibodies, but no previous thrombotic events. The patient was treated with intravenous hydrocortisone, followed by oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. DISCUSSION: Among 115 articles, we identified nine articles, including case reports, of new-onset adrenal insufficiency and/or adrenal hemorrhage/infarction on CT in COVID-19. Adrenal insufficiency was hormonally diagnosed in five cases, but ACTH levels were measured in only three cases (high in one case and normal/low in other two cases). Bilateral adrenal non- or hemorrhagic infarction was identified in five reports (two had adrenal insufficiency, two had normal cortisol levels and one case had no data). Interestingly, the only case with well-characterized new-onset acute primary adrenal insufficiency after COVID-19 had a previous diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. In our case, antiphospholipid syndrome diagnosis was established only after the adrenal infarction triggered by COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the association between bilateral adrenal infarction and antiphospholipid syndrome triggered by COVID-19. Therefore, patients with positive antiphospholipid antibodies should be closely monitored for symptoms or signs of acute adrenal insufficiency during COVID-19.","output":"Primary adrenal insufficiency due to bilateral adrenal infarction in COVID-19: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Consumption is the strongest force in directly stimulating economy growth. After the outbreak of Covid-19, catering, retail sales, lodging and traveling and other service industries were seriously hit. In order to push consumption, Foshan is the first city in Guangdong to issue city-level consumer coupons, and the act received great multiple effect. Following the consumption boom, all the districts in Foshan have distributed local consumer coupons. This essay takes Foshan as an example to research on the issuance of consumer coupons after Covid-19. By collecting data about the effects of all coupons, it shows how city-level and district-level consumer coupons stimulate consumption in the local consumption environment. A large total amount of coupons attracted consumers and the well-designed coupon packages satisfied consumers' needs. Therefore, the potential of consumption in Foshan has been released and it helped stores increase their turnovers to get through the economic recession. Moreover, the further analysis in the comparison between different coupons indicates the importance of online platforms and provides feasible solutions for government to distribute consumer coupons. The proper adjustment about coupons and more investment in the total amount in coupons are highly recommended in consumption stimulation. ? 2020 IEEE.","output":"Research on Issuance of Consumer Coupons after Covid-19 Based on Data Analysis Take Foshan, Guangdong as Examples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate gender and racial/ethnic disparities in mental health and treatment use in college and graduate students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Based on a large-scale online survey (N = 1,415) administered during the weeks following a pandemic-related university-wide campus closure in March 2020, we examined gender and racial disparities in current internalizing severity and treatment use with t-tests and logistic regression models. Results: Specifically, we found that students with marginalized gender (e.g., woman [p <.001], non-binary gender [p <.001]) or Hispanic/Latinx identity (p = .002) reported higher levels of internalizing problem severity compared to their privileged counterparts (e.g., man, non- Hispanic/Latinx White). Regarding treatment use, Asian (p <.001) and multiracial students (p = .002) reported lower treatment use after controlling for internalizing problem severity. Internalizing severity was generally associated with higher treatment use (logit = 0.53, p = .001), indicating a match of objective needs with service use. However, this relationship was offset by a negative interaction between internalizing problem severity and Asian (logit = -0.49, p <.001) or Black identity (logit = -0.57, p = .03) in predicting treatment use. Conclusion: The findings revealed unique mental health challenges faced by different demographic groups and served as a call that specific actions to enhance mental health equity, such as continued mental health support for students with marginalized gender identities, additional COVID-related mental and practical support for Hispanic/Latinx students, and promotion of mental health awareness and trust in Asian/Black students, are desperately needed.","output":"Gender and Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Undergraduate and Graduate Students Mental Health and Treatment Use amid the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral myocarditis has been identified as a major cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) that can lead to heart failure.

Clinical pharmacists are well positioned to expand the patient care services they already provide to address patients' basic social needs, which may otherwise impede medication access and adherence. Objectives The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate the feasibility of expanding a comprehensive medication management (CMM) telepharmacy service to include SDOH support. This service was offered as part of four primary care clinics in rural and underserved North Carolina communities. More specifically, the study aimed to describe the expanded service, evaluate stakeholders' experience with the service, and assess short-term impact on patients with diabetes. Methods Data collected over the first 4 months of implementation included administrative data used to describe the expanded service;a clinic survey and interviews to assess clinic team members' experience with the service;and patient surveys to evaluate patient satisfaction, as well as impact on SDOH self-efficacy and diabetes quality of life. Results Through SDOH screening, the pharmacist identified 26 unresolved COVID-prompted SDOH concerns across 66 patients. These concerns were addressed by the pharmacist through three types of brief interventions, including information provision/education (71%), access to resources (21%), and additional care coordination (7%). Clinic team members perceived the expanded service as highly satisfactory and beneficial. Patients also reported high levels of satisfaction and significantly increased their SDOH self-efficacy and diabetes quality of life as a result of the service. Conclusion These data provide preliminary insights into the expanded role that pharmacists can play to address current population health gaps that can directly impact patients' engagement with their medication regimen and overall health status.","output":"The pharmacist as a public health resource: Expanding telepharmacy services to address social determinants of health during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. Background/Introduction: Global reports are suggestive of decline in number of patients attending hospital with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and a reduction in the number of cardiac procedures since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare the trend of presentations and management among ACS patients in a single tertiary cardiac centre in the West midlands of United Kingdom (UK) during the early lock down period of COVID-19 pandemic (Group 2020) in comparison to the same period of 2019 (Group 2019). METHODS: In this descriptive study patients records were extracted retrospectively from the electronic database who presented with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non- ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and Unstable angina (UA), during the 30 day period from mid-March to mid-April of 2020 (Group 2020), and the same period of 2019 (Group 2019). RESULTS: In comparison to group 2019, total number of ACS (153 vs 91) including STEMI (70 vs 59), NSTEMI (76 vs 31) and UA (7 vs 1) were lower in group 2020 (Fig 1A). Inter-hospital transfer (IHT) dropped from 2019 to 2020 (55 vs 17). In group 2020, percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) for STEMI was similar to group 2019 (83.05% vs 88.57%) but PCI for NSTEMI were higher (80.65% vs 48.68%). No coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) services were available during the studied period (Fig 1B). In terms of troponin I (Trop I) levels at the time of admission, 47.25% of all ACS presentations were over 1000ng/L in group 2020 compared to 28.76% in group 2019 (Fig 1C). On assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at the time of admission, 24% of all ACS were severely impaired (LVEF < 40%) compared to 13.79% in 2019 (Fig 1D). 37 (31 IHT) patients in group 2019 and 16 (11 IHT) patients in group 2020 had no transthoracic echocardiogram data. There was an overall reduction in number of days spent in hospital per ACS patient from 4.78 days in 2019 to 3.70 days in 2020 and a further reduction for STEMI patients from 5.16 days in 2019 to 3.83 days in 2020. 5 ACS patients died in 2020 in comparison to 6 patients in 2019. CONCLUSION: The reduced number of admissions is likely to be a result of nation-wide lock-down and public fear. Proportion of ACS patients with high level of troponin I values and severely impaired LVEF may be explained due to late presentation. It remains necessary to address public fear and to ensure that ACS patients are managed in accordance with ACS management guidelines even in the times of COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on admissions and management of acute coronary syndrome: a single tertiary cardiac centre experience in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Frente a la pandemia generada por el coronavirus, los gobiernos y los medios se encontraron de repente con el difcil reto de comunicar sobre este tema con la poblaci?n y trasladar al gran pBblico conceptos tcnicos y grandes volBmenes de datos Haba que buscar una manera de hacer accesibles esos contenidos no familiares para todos, a travs de f?rmulas conocidas y asimilables En ese contexto, la estrategia elegida para hacer ms eficiente esa comunicaci?n estaba clara: transmitir toda esa informaci?n vital a travs de la representaci?n visual de datos En este trabajo analizamos los problemas asociados con los datos involucrados en esas visualizaciones y revisamos una selecci?n de buenas y malas prcticas utilizadas en esas estrategias comunicativas Alternate abstract: In the pandemic generated by the coronavirus, governments and the media were suddenly faced with the difficult challenge of communicating about this issue with the population and transferring technical concepts and large volumes of data to the general public It was necessary to find a way to make this unfamiliar content accessible to everyone, using known and assimilable formulas In this context, the strategy chosen to make this communication more efficient was clear: transmit all this vital information through the visual representation of data In this work we analyze the problems associated with the data involved in these visualizations and review a selection of good and bad practices used in these communication strategies","output":"Comunicacin visual de una emergencia sanitaria mundial: el caso de la Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Ripe figs, barks, and wood of Ficus vallis-choudae are used in traditional medicine against several conditions including nausea and malaria. However, its use is still to be scientifically documented and validated. Hence, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the antiplasmodial activity of the dichloromethane-methanol (DCM-MeOH (1:1)) crude extract, their hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and methanoli fractions, as well as the isolated chemical constituents. The chemical study of the DCM-MeOH (1:1) crude extract of F. vallis-choudae figs led to the isolation of fifteen (15) known compounds identified based on their spectroscopic data [one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry] and by comparison of these data with those reported in the literature. Some of the isolated compounds were assessed in vitro for their antiplasmodial activity against Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-sensitive 3D7 (Pf3D7) and multidrug-resistant Dd2 strains. The dichloromethane fraction exhibited very good antiplasmodial activity against both strains with IC(50) values of 13.86 g/mL and 8.18 g/mL, respectively. Among the tested compounds, wighteone (2) was the most active against P. falciparum 3D7 (IC(50) = 24.6  1.5 M) and Dd2 (IC(50) = 11.9  2.4 M) strains. The obtained results could justify the traditional uses of F. vallis-choudae against malaria. Wighteone appears to be the most active ingredient. However, further consideration of this compound as starting point for antimalarial drug discovery will depend upon its selectivity of action towards Plasmodium parasites. HIGHLIGHTS: ? 15 (fifteen) compounds were isolated from the dichloromethane-methanol extract of Ficus vallis-choudae. ? Their structures were determined on the basis of their spectroscopic data. ?

Then, based on the aligned cross-modality input, we directly generate the mel-spectrogram of the edited speech with a transformer-based decoder.

Although surgical cricothyroidotomy remains the technique recommended in many 'CICV' algorithms, the insertion of a tracheostomy as a cannula over a trocar, or using the Seldinger method, may have advantages as they are more familiar to the anaesthetist. We compared the utility of three cuffed cricothyroidotomy devices: cuffed Melker?, Quicktrach 2?, and PCK? devices, with surgical cricothyroidotomy. METHODS After ethical committee approval and written informed consent, 20 anaesthetists performed cricothyroidotomy with all four devices in random order, in a pig larynx and trachea model covered in cured pelt. The primary endpoints were the rate of successful placement of the cricothyroidotomy device into the trachea and the duration of the insertion attempt. RESULTS The Melker? and Quicktrach 2? devices possessed advantages over the surgical approach, in contrast to the PCK? device, which performed less well. All 20 participants inserted the Melker?, with 19 being successful using the surgical approach and the Quicktrach 2?, whereas only 12 successfully inserted the PCK? device (PCK? vs surgical, P=0.02). The Quicktrach 2? had the fastest insertion times and caused least trauma to the posterior tracheal wall. The Melker? was rated highest by the participants and was the only device rated higher than the surgical technique. CONCLUSIONS The Melker? and Quicktrach 2? devices appear to hold particular promise as alternatives to surgical cricothyroidotomy.

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections could improve clinical outcomes and reduce the use of antibiotics and treatment sessions. Advances in diagnostic technology contribute to the accurate detection of viruses. We performed a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to investigate the viral etiology in pediatric patients and compared the detection rates with those determined using traditional antigen tests and virus cultures. Fifteen respiratory viruses were included in our investigation: respiratory syncytial virus A/B (RSV), influenza virus A (FluA) and influenza virus B (FluB), human metapneumovirus (MPV), enterovirus (EV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1C4, human rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus OC43, NL63, and 229E, human adenovirus (ADV), and human bocavirus (Boca). In total, 474 specimens were collected and tested. Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently by PCR (357, 75.3%) than they were by traditional tests (229, 49.3%). The leading pathogens were RSV (113, 23.8%), RV (72, 15.2%), PIV3 (53, 11.2%), FluA (51, 10.8%), and ADV (48, 10.1%). For children younger than 5 years, RSV and RV were most prevalent; for children older than 5 years, FluA and ADV were the most frequently detected. Of the specimens, 25.8% (92/357) were coinfected with two or more viruses. RV, Boca, PIV2, FluB, and PIV4 had higher rates of coinfection; MPV and PIV1 had the lowest rates of coinfection (9.1% and 5.3%). To conclude, the detection power of PCR was better than that of traditional antigen tests and virus cultures when considering the detection of respiratory viruses. RSV and RV were the leading viral pathogens identified in the respiratory specimens. One-quarter of the positive specimens were coinfected with two or more viruses. In the future, further application of PCR may contribute to the rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses and could improve patient outcomes.","output":"Increased Detection of Viruses in Children with Respiratory Tract Infection Using PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the past 25 years, botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has become the most widely used medical intervention in children with cerebral palsy.

We review limitations in our knowledge regarding the mechanisms underlying the development of contractures and the difficulty in preventing them. It is clear from this review that injection of BoNT-A in the large muscles of both the upper and lower limbs of children with cerebral palsy will result in a predictable decrease in muscle activity, which is usually reported as a reduction in spasticity, for between 3 and 6 months. These changes are noted by the use of clinical tools such as the Modified Ashworth Scale and the Modified Tardieu Scale. Decreased muscle over-activity usually results in improved range of motion in distal joints. Injection of the gastrocnemius muscle for toe-walking in a child with hemiplegia or diplegia usually has the effect of increasing the passive range of dorsiflexion at the ankle. In our review, we found that this may result in a measurable improvement in gait by the use of observational gait scales or gait analysis, in some children. However, improvements in gait function are not always achieved and are small in magnitude and short lived. We found that some of the differences in outcomes in clinical trials may relate to the use of adjunctive interventions such as serial casting, orthoses, night splints and intensive therapy. We note that the majority of clinical trials of the use of BoNT-A in children with cerebral palsy have focussed on a single injection cycle and this is insufficient to understand the balance between benefit and harm. Most outcomes were reported in terms of changes in muscle tone and there were fewer studies with robust methodology that reported improvements in function. Changes in the domains of activities and participation have rarely been reported in studies to date. There were no clinical reviews to date that consider the findings of studies in human volunteers and in experimental animals and their relevance to clinical protocols. In this review we found that studies in human volunteers and in experimental animals show muscle atrophy after an injection of BoNT-A for at least 12 months. Muscle atrophy was accompanied by loss of contractile elements in muscle and replacement with fat and connective tissue. It is not currently known if these changes, mediated at a molecular level, are reversible. We conclude that there is a need to revise clinical protocols by using BoNT-A more thoughtfully, less frequently and with greatly enhanced monitoring of the effects on injected muscle for both short-term and long-term benefits and harms.","output":"Botulinum Toxin in the Management of Children with Cerebral Palsy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV2 virus has been identified in abdominal cavity of the COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the potential viral transmission from any surgical created smoke in these patients is of concern especially in laparoscopic surgery. This study aimed to compare the amount of surgical smoke and surgical field contamination between laparoscopic and open surgery in fresh cadavers. METHODS: Cholecystectomy in 12 cadavers was performed and they were divided into 4 groups: laparoscopic approach with or without smoke evacuator, and open approach with or without smoke evacuator. The increased particle counts in surgical smoke of each group were analyzed. In the model of appendectomy, surgical field contamination under ultraviolet light and visual contamination scale between laparoscopic and open approach were compared. RESULTS: Open cholecystectomy significantly produced a greater amount of overall particle sizes, particle sizes < 5 m and particle sizes  5 m than laparoscopic cholecystectomy (10,307  10(3) vs 3738  10(3), 10,226  10(3) vs 3685  10(3) and 81  10(3) vs 53  10(3) count/m(3), respectively at p < 0.05). The use of smoke evacuator led to decrease in the amount of overall particle sizes of 58% and 32.4% in the open and laparoscopic chelecystectomy respectively. Median (interquatile range) visual contamination scale of surgical field in open appendectomy [3.50 (2.33, 4.67)] was significantly greater than laparoscopic appendectomy [1.50 (0.67, 2.33)] at p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy yielded less smoke-related particles than open cholecystectomy. The use of smoke evacuator, abeit non-significantly, reduced the particles in both open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic appendectomy had a lower degree of surgical field contamination than the open approach.","output":"Laparoscopic surgery produced less surgical smoke and contamination comparing with open surgery: the pilot study in fresh cadaveric experiment in COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, online learning is widely being used due to the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 1.2 billion learners being affected by school closures and confinement.

The study was to explore the relationship of Physical Activity (PA) and Sedentary Time (SED) with mood states among Chinese adolescents during the pandemic. METHODS: A total of 4898 adolescents (16.3  1.3 years old) from 49 middle schools in 13 urban and rural areas in Yan'an, China volunteered to participate in this study and completed online questionnaires. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) were used to measure PA and SED, and Profile of Mood States were used to evaluate mood states. We used Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test to assess differences in PA and SED in different sex and grade group, respectively. Mixed linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between PA/SED and mood states. RESULTS: Participants in our study accumulated 12.5  26.0 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA and 363.6  148.4 min of SED per day. The mood states of boys were better than that of girls (p < 0.01). The mood states of the students in Grade 3 Senior High School were at the highest level of mood disturbance. Higher levels of PA were significantly associated with lower levels of total mood disturbance in this population (High PA group according to IPAQ: B = -3.22, SE = 0.40, p < 0.001; Moderate: B = -1.47, SE = 0.37, p < 0.001, compared to Low PA group). CONCLUSION: Chinese adolescents maintained a sedentary lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. Girls and students in Grade 3 Senior High School had higher level of mood disturbance.

Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to transport farther in the air, and make the current social distancing policy insufficient. To provide evidence and insight into the \\"social distancing\\" guidelines, a validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000 m, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16 km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze. The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%. The distances between the two virtual humans are 1.83 m and 3.05 m (6 feet and 10 feet). The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. Numerical results indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05 m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people. High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can transport from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 seconds. Due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 1.83 m (6 feet) needs to be considered. Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers.","output":"Influence of wind and relative humidity on the social distancing effectiveness to prevent COVID-19 airborne transmission: A numerical study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The COVID-19 virus is spread by pulmonary droplets.

BACKGROUND A PCI is performed in about 25% of TAVR candidates, but procedural features and late outcomes of pre-TAVR PCI remain largely unknown. METHODS Multicenter study including 1197 consecutive patients who had PCI in the work-up pre-TAVR. A total of 1,705 lesions (1.5  0.7 lesions per patient) were included. Death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were recorded, as well as target lesion failure (TLF) and target vessel failure (TVF). RESULTS Half of patients exhibited a multivessel disease and the mean SYNTAX (SYNergy between PCI with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) score was 12.1  9.1. The lesions were of B2/C type, calcified, bifurcation, and ostial in 49.9%, 45.8%, 21.4%, and 19.3% of cases, respectively. After a median follow-up of 2 (interquartile range: 1 to 3) years, a total of 444 (37.1%) patients presented an MACCE. Forty patients exhibited TVF (3.3%), with TLF identified in 32 (2.7%) patients. By multivariable analysis, previous peripheral artery disease (p < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.002), atrial fibrillation (p = 0.003), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.012), and incomplete revascularization (p = 0.014) determined an increased risk of MACCE. In patients with unprotected left main or SYNTAX score >32 (n = 128), TLF, TVF, and MACCE rates were 3.9%, 6.3%, and 35.9%, respectively (p = 0.378; p = 0.065, and p = 0.847, respectively, vs. the rest of the population). CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing PCI in the work-up pre-TAVR frequently exhibited complex coronary lesions and multivessel disease. PCI was successful in most cases, and TLF and TVF rates at 2-year follow-up were low, also among patients with high-risk coronary features. However, overall MACCE occurred in about one-third of patients, with incomplete revascularization determining an increased risk.

Methods: We studied 144 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to a single center in intensive or subintensive care units. Those with previous thyroid dysfunctions or taking interfering drugs were excluded. Differently from previous reports, TSH, FT3, FT4, thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-Tg autoantibodies (TgAb) were measured at baseline and every 3-7 days. C-reacting protein (CRP), cortisol and IL-6 were also assayed. Results: The majority of patients had a normal TSH at admission, usually with normal FT4 and FT3. Low TSH levels were found either at admission or during hospitalization in 39% of patients, associated with low FT3 in half of the cases. FT4 and Tg levels were normal, and TgAb-negative. TSH and FT3 were invariably restored at the time of discharge in survivors, whereas were permanently low in most deceased cases, but only FT3 levels were predictors of mortality. Cortisol, CRP and IL-6 levels were higher in patients with low TSH and FT3 levels. Conclusions: Almost half of our COVID-19 patients without interfering drugs had normal TFTs both at admission and during follow-up. In this series, the transient finding of low TSH with normal FT4 and low FT3 levels, inversely correlated with CRP, cortisol and IL-6 and associated with normal Tg levels, is likely due to the cytokine storm induced by SARS-Cov-2 with a direct or mediated impact on TSH secretion and deiodinase activity, and likely not to a destructive thyroiditis.","output":"The spectrum of thyroid function tests during hospitalization for SARS COV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are short synthetic DNA molecules designed to inhibit translation of a targeted gene to protein via interaction with messenger RNA.

The current study aimed to (1) conduct a preliminary assessment of patients perspectives regarding this transition, and (2) explore potential demographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors associated with these perspectives. METHODS: Sixty-three patients with EDs whose treatment was moved to an online format, were surveyed during the COVID-19 lockdown (AprilCMay 2020). A 6-item measure was developed to examine their perspectives toward this transition. Exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) were conducted to confirm the rational-theoretical structure of the measure (Eigenvalue = 3.745, explaining 62.4% of variance). The Cronbachs alpha value was excellent ( = 0.878). Validated questionnaires were used to measure ED symptoms, general psychopathology, therapeutic alliance, and pandemic anxiety, and their associations with our transition-focused scale and telemedicine satisfaction were examined. RESULTS: Mixed views were found regarding the transition, with the majority (68%) stating that they would not choose to continue online therapy given the option. Longer duration of treatment (r = 0.291, p = 0.022), stronger therapeutic alliance (r = 0.293, p = 0.028), and higher COVID-19 anxiety (r = 0.276, p = 0.029) were linked with more positive views towards the transition.

This has become observable through the rituals of the Pakistani government of containment to deal with COVID-19. Such entanglements are visible in the case of strategies to tackle infected viral bodies, as the government has enacted its authority: (1) to bury what I am terming the dead viral body without its beloved ones present; (2) to return or not to return this body to family members in a coffin; (3) or to provide the grieving family with a symbolic empty coffin. These Covidian politics have led to the question: Who in actuality owns the body? In conclusion, I argue that the problem lies in the discriminatory and contradictory rituals of containment of the government, not in using scientific evidence and guidelines.","output":"Rituals of Containment: Many Pandemics, Body Politics, and Social Dramas During COVID-19 in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This book explores the interconnections between urbanization and capitalism to examine the current condition of cities due to capitalism.

This review will summarize the key findings from the CORONADO study and put them in perspectives with others studies published on the subject. RECENT FINDINGS: For almost 2 years, the new SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2), which causes COVID-19, has spread all around the world leading to a pandemic. From the first epidemiological reports, diabetes mellitus has rapidly emerged as a major risk factor associated with severe forms of COVID-19 but few data were available about diabetes characteristics in hospitalized people with COVID-19. SUMMARY: Between March 10 and April 10, 2020, 2951 patients were included in 68 centers throughout the national territory, including overseas territories. In the CORONADO study, the primary outcome was a composite endpoint combining invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or death within day 7 (D7). Secondary outcomes included death, IMV, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and hospital discharge, all considered within D7 and day 28 (D28). The primary outcome occurred in 29.0% participants within D7 following hospital admission. Within D28, the end of the follow-up period, the mortality rate was 20.6%, while 50.2% of patients were discharged. In multivariable analysis, advanced age, microvascular complications, treatment with insulin or statin prior to admission, dyspnea on admission, as well as biological markers reflecting the severity of the infection (high levels of transaminases, leukocytes and CRP, and low platelet levels) were associated with an increased risk of death. Several exploratory analyses were performed to clarify the influence of some parameters such as weight status, sex, type of diabetes, and some routine drugs, including metformin or statins.","output":"COVID-19 and Diabetes Outcomes: Rationale for and Updates from the CORONADO Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and purpose The magnitude of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the healthcare system, economy, education, and social networking is dreadful, the least to say. Surprisingly, and unlike previous epidemics, the impact has been universal, and even top-ranking countries with solid economies were not immune. The purpose of this study is to develop a better understanding of the Saudi community's response and reaction to the preventative measures implemented by the government to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology A cross-sectional study using a self-administered online-based questionnaire was conducted among 920 participants from March 2020 to February 2021 among the Saudi community across the Kingdom. Results Among the studied participants, the majority (60%) are always committed to washing their hands according to the Ministry of Health (MoH) instructions, and 74% indicated that they were always compliant with the sneezing etiquette outlined by the MoH. Studied participants were affected through different influencers of life aspects. Moreover, 63% of them gained new skills and behaviors during the pandemic curfew. Additionally, many studied participants assumed that \\"life will not return to what it used to be\\" as a future perception.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian plastic surgery residents practice, wellness, and overall training. METHODS: Surveys for program directors and residents were created and disseminated to all English-speaking Canadian plastic surgery residency training programs. Survey results were pooled and presented as a percentage of responses for each question. RESULTS: Response rates were 50% (n = 5/10) and 25% (n = 19/77) for program directors and residents, respectively. All program directors believed that the pandemic has a negative effect on resident wellness, 80% (n = 4/5) of which believed that their residents were coping effectively. They rated program support for resident wellness as neutral or supportive. Most programs (80%; n = 4/5) introduced strategies to support resident well-being. Most trainees (84%; n = 16/19) reported the pandemic as having a negative effect on their well-being, with approximately 50% endorsing worse emotional, social, psychological, and physical wellness, as well as feelings of burnout. Some reported difficulties coping (21%; n = 4/19). Residents felt that their wellness was supported externally by their own resilience (89%; n = 17/19), family members (74%; n = 14/19), friends (74%; n = 14/19), their partner (68%; n = 13/19), or co-residents (53%; n = 10/19). Internal support by their program was rated as neutral or negative (63%; n = 12/19).

Understanding the clinical characteristics, interactions with the environment, and the variables that favor or hinder its dissemination help the public authorities in the fight and prevention, leading for a rapid response in society. Using models to estimate contamination scenarios in real time plays an important role. Population compartments models based on ordinary differential equations (ODE) for a given region assume two homogeneous premises, the contact mechanisms and diffusion rates, disregarding heterogeneous factors as different contact rates for each municipality and the flow of contaminated people among them. This work considers a hybrid model for covid-19, based on local SIR models and the population flow network among municipalities, responsible for a complex lag dynamic in their contagion curves. Based on actual infection data, local contact rates ( ? ) are evaluated. The epidemic evolution at each municipality depends on the local SIR parameters and on the inter-municipality transport flow. When heterogeneity of ? values and flow network are included, forecasts differ from those of the homogeneous ODE model. This effect is more relevant when more municipalities are considered, hinting that the latter overestimates new cases. In addition, mitigation scenarios are assessed to evaluate the effect of earlier interventions reducing the inter-municipality flux. Restricting the flow between municipalities in the initial stage of the epidemic is fundamental for flattening the contamination curve, highlighting advantages of a contamination lag between the capital curve and those of other municipalities in the territories.","output":"Scaling effect in COVID-19 spreading: The role of heterogeneity in a hybrid ODE-network model with restrictions on the inter-cities flow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor used to treat multiple solid-organ malignancies.

Despite promise of their acceptability, many mental health apps on the market suffer from high dropout due to a multitude of issues. Understanding user opinions of currently available mental health apps beyond star ratings can provide knowledge which can inform the development of future mental health apps. This study aimed to conduct a review of current apps which offer screening and/or aid diagnosis of mental health conditions on the Apple app store (iOS), Google Play app store (Android), and using the m-health Index and Navigation Database (MIND). In addition, the study aimed to evaluate user experiences of the apps, identify common app features and determine which features are associated with app use discontinuation. The Apple app store, Google Play app store, and MIND were searched. User reviews and associated metadata were then extracted to perform a sentiment and thematic analysis. The final sample included 92 apps. 45.65% (n = 42) of these apps only screened for or diagnosed a single mental health condition and the most commonly assessed mental health condition was depression (38.04%, n = 35). 73.91% (n = 68) of the apps offered additional in-app features to the mental health assessment (e.g., mood tracking). The average user rating for the included apps was 3.70 (SD = 1.63) and just under two-thirds had a rating of four stars or above (65.09%, n = 442). Sentiment analysis revealed that 65.24%, n = 441 of the reviews had a positive sentiment.

Methods: CDU and CEUS with Sonovue? were used to evaluate 25 CBT lesions. The comparison between these ultrasonic modalities included the size, Shamblin type, vascularity, and feeding vessels of the lesion areas. The time-intensity curve (TIC) analysis was used to obtain the dynamics of the contrast-enhancement features of CBTs. Results: The TIC analysis presented a fast wash-in [wash-in time: 3.00  1.10 s, mean  SD] and slow wash-out [wash-out time: 58.79  24.21 s, mean  SD] pattern in the CBT lesions, with a high area under the curve (AUC) of 669.68  143.46 mm2 (mean  SD). In comparison with CDU, CEUS was superior in identifying Shamblin type I or III CBT lesions (2 = 17.389, p=0.002). It detected a significant difference in the AUC between moderate and marked vascularity groups (563.33  102.63 vs. 707.22  138.81, t=-2.311, p=0.031.), while CDU observed no significant difference between these two groups.

The recycling of blades, which are made from composite material, is costly and thus far no high volume recycling solution exists. Repurposing blades into second life structures is an alternative which is gaining in popularity, but has many challenges. Green Public Procurement has the potential to help drive demand for blade products in Irish public works. The Re-Wind project has generated a Design Atlas with 47 blade product concepts and these are screened for their ability to overcome repurposing challenges. Three Irish scenarios are developed based on this ranking, maximal utilization of the blade, and on the end customer. Life Cycle Assessment is used to determine the marginal environmental impacts of the raw material substitution provided by the use of blade material. Focusing on greenhouse gas emissions, an estimated 342 kg CO2 e can be saved for every tonne of blade waste used in these scenarios. Blade substitution of steel products was found to provide the most impact, followed by substitution of concrete products. Although repurposing is unlikely to offer an end-of-life solution for all Irish blade waste, the use of 20% of this material annually would divert 315 tonnes of blade waste from landfill, as well as avoiding emissions of 71,820 kg CO2 e. Green procurement has the potential to create a demand for repurposed blade products, which in turn could create jobs in high unemployment areas.

The process of automated lung segmentation is challenging due to (a) CT radiation dosage and (b) ground-glass opacities caused by COVID-19. The lung segmentation methodologies proposed in 2020 were semi- or automated but not reliable, accurate, and user-friendly. The proposed study presents a COVID Lung Image Analysis System (COVLIAS 1.0, AtheroPoint?, Roseville, CA, USA) consisting of hybrid deep learning (HDL) models for lung segmentation. Methodology: The COVLIAS 1.0 consists of three methods based on solo deep learning (SDL) or hybrid deep learning (HDL). SegNet is proposed in the SDL category while VGG-SegNet and ResNet-SegNet are designed under the HDL paradigm. The three proposed AI approaches were benchmarked against the National Institute of Health (NIH)-based conventional segmentation model using fuzzy-connectedness. A cross-validation protocol with a 40:60 ratio between training and testing was designed, with 10% validation data. The ground truth (GT) was manually traced by a radiologist trained personnel. For performance evaluation, nine different criteria were selected to perform the evaluation of SDL or HDL lung segmentation regions and lungs long axis against GT. Results: Using the database of 5000 chest CT images (from 72 patients), COVLIAS 1.0 yielded AUC of ~0.96, ~0.97, ~0.98, and ~0.96 (p-value < 0.001), respectively within 5% range of GT area, for SegNet, VGG-SegNet, ResNet-SegNet, and NIH. The mean Figure of Merit using four models (left and right lung) was above 94%. On benchmarking against the National Institute of Health (NIH) segmentation method, the proposed model demonstrated a 58% and 44% improvement in ResNet-SegNet, 52% and 36% improvement in VGG-SegNet for lung area, and lung long axis, respectively. The PE statistics performance was in the following order: ResNet-SegNet > VGG-SegNet > NIH > SegNet. The HDL runs in <1 s on test data per image. Conclusions: The COVLIAS 1.0 system can be applied in real-time for radiology-based clinical settings.","output":"COVLIAS 1.0: Lung Segmentation in COVID-19 Computed Tomography Scans Using Hybrid Deep Learning Artificial Intelligence Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been one of the worst global health crises in the 21st century. The currently available rollout vaccines are not 100% effective for COVID-19 due to the evolving nature of the virus. There is a real need for a concerted effort to fight the virus, and research from diverse fields must contribute. Artificial intelligence-based approaches have proven to be significantly effective in every branch of our daily lives, including healthcare and medical domains. During the early days of this pandemic, artificial intelligence (AI) was utilized in the fight against this virus outbreak and it has played a major role in containing the spread of the virus. It provided innovative opportunities to speed up the development of disease interventions. Several methods, models, AI-based devices, robotics, and technologies have been proposed and utilized for diverse tasks such as surveillance, spread prediction, peak time prediction, classification, hospitalization, healthcare management, heath system capacity, etc. This paper attempts to provide a quick, concise, and precise survey of the state-of-the-art AI-based techniques, technologies, and datasets used in fighting COVID-19. Several domains, including forecasting, surveillance, dynamic times series forecasting, spread prediction, genomics, compute vision, peak time prediction, the classification of medical imagingincluding CT and X-ray and how they can be processedand biological data (genome and protein sequences) have been investigated. An overview of the open-access computational resources and platforms is given and their useful tools are pointed out. The paper presents the potential research areas in AI and will thus encourage researchers to contribute to fighting against the virus and aid global health by slowing down the spread of the virus.

However, it is unclear whether this increased risk is affected by any changes in lockdown restrictions, and whether any lifestyle changes could moderate this increased risk. METHODS: In a longitudinal UK population-based cohort (The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC) we assessed the relationship between pre-pandemic measures of disordered eating and self-harm and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2,657 young adults. Regression models examined the relationship between self-reported disordered eating, self-harm, and both disordered eating and self-harm at age 25 years and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and mental wellbeing during a period of eased restrictions in the COVID-19 pandemic (May-July 2020) when participants were aged 27C29 years. Analyses were adjusted for sex, questionnaire completion date, pre-pandemic socioeconomic disadvantage and pre-pandemic mental health and wellbeing. We also examined whether lifestyle changes (sleep, exercise, alcohol, visiting green space, eating, talking with family/friends, hobbies, relaxation) in the initial UK lockdown (April-May 2020) moderated these associations. RESULTS: Pre-existing disordered eating, self-harm and comorbid disordered eating and self-harm were all associated with the reporting of a higher frequency of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, and poorer mental wellbeing during the pandemic compared to individuals without disordered eating and self-harm. Associations remained when adjusting for pre-pandemic mental health measures. There was little evidence that interactions between disordered eating and self-harm exposures and lifestyle change moderators affected pandemic mental health and wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with pre-pandemic disordered eating, self-harm and comorbid disordered eating and self-harm are at increased risk for developing symptoms of depression, anxiety and poor mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, even when accounting for pre-pandemic mental health. Lifestyle changes during the pandemic do not appear to alter this risk. A greater focus on rapid and responsive service provision is essential to reduce the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of these already vulnerable individuals.","output":"Disordered eating and self-harm as risk factors for poorer mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A population-based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health emergency generated by COVID-19 and the massive closure of schools has given rise to an unprecedented situation for education systems worldwide. This situation has raised fundamental questions about the role of the school in contemporary societies and whether it still fulfils a particular function as a social institution. This article forwards a theoretical discussion on these issues from a critical sociological approach and, especially, from the perspective of social justice. It argues that the two main functions of schools, namely, socialisation and selection, cannot be fully achieved by distance schooling. Moreover, it contends that the lockdown of schools reinforced the crisis of meaning within the school system by hindering its ability to ensure learning for all students. Overall, the article presents a reflection on the meaning of the school institution in the 21st century, representing a key contribution to contemporary debates on the sociology of education.

The efficacy of electrostatic aerosol precipitation (EAP) and continuous aerosol evacuation (CAE) to eliminate bioaerosols during laparoscopic surgery was verified. METHODS: Ex-vivo laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LCs) were simulated +/- EAP or CAE in a pelvitrainer equipped with swine gallbladders. Release of bioaerosols was initiated by performing high-frequency electrosurgery with a monopolar electro hook (MP-HOOK) force at 40 W (MP-HOOK40) and 60 W (MP-HOOK60), as well as by ultrasonic cutting (USC). Particle number concentrations (PNC) of arising aerosols were analyzed with a condensation particle counter (CPC). Aerosol samples were taken i) within the pelvitrainer near to the source, ii) outside the pelvitrainer at the working trocar and iii) in the breathing zone of the surgeon. RESULTS: Within the pelvitrainer, MP-HOOK40 (6.4 x 10(5) cm(-3)) and MP-HOOK60 (7.3 x 10(5) cm(-3)) showed significant higher median PNCs compared to USC (4.4 x 10(5) cm(-3)) (p = 0.001). EAP lead to a significant decrease of the median PNCs in all three groups. A high linear correlation with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.852, 0.825 and 0.759 were observed by comparing MP-HOOK40 (+/- EAP), MP-HOOK60 (+/- EAP) and USC (+/- EAP), respectively. During ex-vivo LC and CAE, significant bioaerosol contaminations of the operating room occurred. Ex-vivo LC with EAP lead to a considerable reduction of the bioaerosol concentration. CONCLUSION: EAP was found to be efficient for intraoperative bioaerosol elimination and reducing the risk of bioaerosol exposure for surgical staff.","output":"Experimental Model to Test Electrostatic Precipitation Technology in the COVID-19 Era: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to develop a model to quantitatively assess the potential effectiveness of face shield (visor) in reducing airborne transmission risk of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 during the current COVID-19 pandemic using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The studies with and without face shield in both an infected and healthy person have been considered in indoor environment simulation. In addition to the influence of the face shield and the synchronization of the breathing process while using the device, we also simulated the effect of small air movements on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate (outdoor environment simulation). The contact with infectious particles in the case without a face shield was 12C20 s (s), in the presence of at least one person who was positive for SARS-CoV-2. If the infected person wore a face shield, no contact with contaminated air was observed during the entire simulation time (80 s). The time of contact with contaminated air (infection time) decreases to about 11 s when the surrounding air is still and begins to move at a low speed. Qualitative differences between simulations performed on the patients with and without the face shield are clearly visible. The maximum prevention of contagion is probably a consequence of wearing a face shield by an infected person. Our results suggest that it is possible to determine contact with air contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 using the CFD method under realistic conditions for virtually any situation and configuration. The proposed method is probably the fastest and most reliable among those based on CFD-based techniques.","output":"Mitigation effect of face shield to reduce SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission risk: Preliminary simulations based on computed tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor progression and inhibit anti-tumor immune response by producing various mediators and preferentially express CD163, CD204, and CD206.

EGF production of TAM subsets isolated from OSCC patients was assessed by flow cytometry. We also examined the effect of conditioned medium from TAM subsets on the proliferation of OSCC cells. CD163(+) cells were detected diffusely all over the tumor and connective tissue area, while CD204(+) and CD206(+) cells were mainly detected in/around the tumors. Flow cytometric analysis found that CD206(+) TAMs strongly produced EGF compared with CD163(+) and CD204(+) TAMs. Cell proliferation and invasion of OSCC cells cultured with conditioned medium of CD206(+) TAMs were strongly enhanced and inhibited by anti-EGFR. The number of CD206(+) TAMs positively correlated with worse clinical prognosis. Our results revealed differences in localization and EGF production among these TAM subsets.

Starting in Aug 2013, goats in the Jiangsu and Anhui provinces of eastern China suffered severe respiratory diseases. In order to identify the causative agent, numerous related pathogens were tested with RT-PCR or PCR. A unique PIV3 strain was detected in most of the clinical nasal swabs or serum samples. The virus was isolated on MDBK cells and characterized by RT-PCR, nucleotide sequence analysis and hemagglutination test. The entire M and F gene coding regions, HN, 5-UTR-N and L gene fragments were amplified using pairs of degenerate primers. Nucleotide, amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses based on these genes indicated that the goat-derived PIV3 strain was distinct from previously reported BPIV3 genotypes and HPIV3 strains. The novel isolate, named JS2013, might be a potentially new member of the respirovirus genus. Goats were experimentally infected with JS2013 culture. The virus-inoculated goats displayed coughing and nasal discharges that were related to respiratory diseases. Viremia and virus shedding were detected during 4C10 days post-inoculation (dpi).

The p-adic number system offers a natural representation of hierarchical organization of complex networks. The p-adic random graph interprets n as the cardinality of a set of p-adic numbers. Constructing a vast space of hierarchical structures is equivalent for combining number sequences. Although the giant component is vital in dynamic evolution of networks, the structure of multiple big components is also essential. Fitting the sizes of the few largest components to empirical data was rarely demonstrated. The p-adic ultrametric enables the ER model to simulate multiple big components from the observations of genetic interaction networks, social networks, and epidemics.

Subsequent myeloid cell HIF stabilisation plays key roles in the innate immune response, alongside emerging oxygen\\\\independent roles. Manipulation of regulatory proteins of the HIF transcription factor family can profoundly influence inflammatory profiles, innate immune cell function and pathogen clearance and, as such, has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy against inflammatory diseases. The direction and mode of HIF manipulation as a therapy is dictated by the inflammatory properties of the disease in question, with innate immune cell HIF reduction being, in general, advantageous during chronic inflammatory conditions, while upregulation of HIF is beneficial during infections. The therapeutic potential of targeting myeloid HIFs, both genetically and pharmacologically, has been recently illuminated in vitro and in vivo, with an emerging range of inhibitory and activating strategies becoming available. This review focuses on cutting edge findings that uncover the roles of myeloid cell HIF signalling on immunoregulation in the contexts of inflammation and infection, and explores future directions of potential therapeutic strategies.","output":"If its not one thing, HIFs another: immunoregulation by hypoxia inducible factors in disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Skin cancers are the most common malignancies in the United States. Total body skin examination by a physician, especially a dermatologist, is the gold standard for detecting suspicious lesions that may require further evaluation. Non-medical professionals (NMPs) including massage therapists, estheticians, hairdressers, and cosmetologists have the unique opportunity to frequently examine their client's skin outside of a clinical setting. By evaluating their knowledge of and comfort with evaluation of suspicious lesions, multiple studies have gauged the utility of patient encounters with NMPs for skin cancer detection. Several studies have also focused on assessment of intervention strategies for assessing and improving NMPs ability to detect suspicious lesions and to refer for physician evaluation when necessary. A narrative literature review identified 16 articles evaluating the role of NMPs in identification of suspicious lesions on client skin. A total of 8 cross-sectional studies examined the knowledge and attitudes of NMPs toward skin evaluation, and 8 studies assessed interventional strategies for improving NMPs ability to assess skin lesions for consideration of physician referral. This review finds that NMPs are open to the idea of examining the exposed body surfaces relevant to their work with clients and are willing to refer for physician evaluation when needed. Multiple interventional strategies have demonstrated success with educating NMPs on the importance of skin surveillance and the characteristic physical exam findings associated with skin cancers. Strengthening the readiness of NMPs to examine their client's skin offers an opportunity to reduce time to skin cancer diagnosis, improve patient outcomes, and lower healthcare-associated costs of skin cancer treatment.","output":"Skin Cancer Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices among Non-Medical Skin Care Professionals: A Narrative Review of Cross-sectional and Interventional Studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding protein corona formation in an aqueous environment at the molecular and atomistic levels is critical to applications such as biomolecule-detection and drug delivery.

Our study showed that protein corona formation is governed by protein-surface and protein-protein interactions, as well as the surface hydrophobic effect. The corona structure was found to be dependent on protein types and the size of nanoparticles. Ovispirin proteins form homogeneous single-layered adsorption in comparison with the lysozyme's inhomogeneous multilayered aggregates on gold NP surfaces.

PARTICIPANTS: Patients records (2019C2020; group A) and (2020C2021; group B) were assessed for missed follow-up visits, medication adherence, number of trabeculectomies performed, and uncontrolled patients. In addition, a telephone-based questionnaire involving randomly chosen 200 patients from B.G.U. was carried out to clarify the potential causes of poor patients compliance. RESULTS: There was a marked decline in the number of newly diagnosed patients and patients on regular follow-up with incidence rates 0.208 and 0.088 in group (A) and group (B), respectively (P-value < 0.0001). The number of compliant patients in group B decreased with an incidence rate difference of 0.312.

METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken, in Max Super Specialty Hospital Saket, from June 2015 to May 2018, which included 586 cases of TLH (for benign gynecological conditions), of which 287 were performed using intra-corporeal endosuturing (Group 1) and 299 were performed using energy sources (Group 2). To avoid bias, baseline matching was done for body mass index (BMI), indications for surgery, size of uterus, previous abdominal surgeries and comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension after which there were 172 patients in each group. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 48.24  6.76 years.

METHODOLOGY: Retrospective propensity score-matched analysis in a single centre from 1st April to 31st July 2020. We retrospectively analyzed data of 280 hospitalized patients developing CRS initially. PSM was used to minimize bias from non-randomized treatment assignment. Using PSM 1:1, 90 patients were selected and assigned to 2 equal groups. Forced matching was done for disease severity, routine standard care and advanced supportive care. Many other Co-variates were matched. Primary outcome was 28 days overall survival. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalization, CRS resolution time and timing of viral clearance on Polymerase chain reaction testing. RESULTS: After PS-matching, the selected cohort had a median age of 60 years (range 32C73 in TPE, 37C75 in controls), p = 0.325 and all were males. Median symptoms duration was 7 days (range 3C22 days TPE and 3C20 days controls), p = 0.266. Disease severity in both groups was 6 (6.6%) moderate, 40 (44.4%) severe and 44 (49%) critical.

How \\"race\\" is presented to medical students may influence both their implicit biases and future clinical practices, potentially widening racial disparities in care. METHODS We conducted in-depth interviews with twenty-two preclinical mostly non-white medical students attending a public medical school in a major metropolitan area in the northeastern United States. Interview content focused on how medical students experience the presentation of race in medical education, use race in their learning experiences, and envision using race as physicians in future clinical encounters. Transcripts were analyzed using the framework method and emergent themes were identified. RESULTS Participants described being most aware of the presentation of race in board-style questions and least aware of the presentation of race during lectures. They described being aware of race in problem-based learning (PBL) modules if the case revolved around a likely race-disease association. They identified imprecision in how race was presented during lectures and insufficient explanations of causes of racial disparities in health. Participants described feeling ill-prepared to obtain racial self-identification and receiving mixed messages around the utility of race in diagnosing a patient. Participants reported experiences of cognitive dissonance around the presentation of race in board-style questions and lectures. CONCLUSIONS Critical evaluation of the presentation of and instruction around \\"race\\" is needed to address whether it is presented as a biological vs. social construct, the level of precision of racial categorization in curricular content, and the causes of and mechanisms behind race-disease associations. This has the potential to minimize false beliefs about race as a biological construct and the resultant negative impacts on clinical care. Future research could evaluate whether problem-based or experiential (OSCE) learning, in contrast to board-style questions and didactic lectures, are the most effective way to educate students around race in health and illness. Additionally, future research can investigate if the mission (i.e. social) and composition (Predominantly White Institution or Historically Black College/University) of the faculty impacts student experiences of the presentation of race.","output":"Thinking with two brains: Student perspectives on the presentation of race in preclinical medical education."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, supply chain management performance seems to be struggling.

DP was seen as a positive step forward for the departments involved, and for the wider germ cell tumour network, and was completed without significant issues. Whilst there were challenges, the transition to DP was regarded as worthwhile, and examples of benefits to patients are already recognised. Conclusion: Pathology networks, including highly specialised services, such as in this study, are ideally suited to be digitised. We highlight many of the benefits but also the challenges that must be overcome for such clinical transformation. Overall, from the survey, the change was seen as universally positive for our service and highlights the importance of engagement of the whole team to achieve success.","output":"Digital Pathology Transformation in a Supraregional Germ Cell Tumour Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND A next-generation networked operating room, \\"Smart Cyber Operating Theater (SCOT?),\\" has been developed in cooperation with medical engineers, which integrates standalone medical devices, including intraoperative MRI using the \\"OPeLiNK\\" communication interface. Here, we report the application of this newly developed advanced type of operating theater for the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA), along with an evaluation of our initial experiences. METHODS The study population consisted of 18 patients with parasellar tumor. All patients underwent surgery via the EEA in SCOT?. During all procedures, various types of intraoperative information, including electrophysiological monitoring, anatomical orientation with navigation system, intraoperative MRI, and endoscopic images of the operative field, were collected and stored by OPeLiNK?. Furthermore, the intraoperative information was shared with the surgical strategy desk, where a senior neurosurgeon can direct and manage the surgical procedure in real-time. RESULTS We successfully completed the surgical procedures in SCOT? in all cases. Using OPeLiNK?, operators in SCOT? were able to share various data, such as images obtained intraoperatively and surgical instrument position from navigation systems, as well as images of the surgical field with senior neurosurgeons at the surgical strategy desk in all cases. Surgically relevant information from these sources was transmitted through an application and displayed to all surgical staff. The necessary nuances were reflected in the surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS The SCOT?, which is considered an innovative operation system in neurosurgery, enables both quality and safety in the EEA. Furthermore, the use of SCOT? may also contribute to the education of young neurosurgeons.","output":"Endoscopic Endonasal Approach in the Smart Cyber Operating Theater (SCOT?): preliminary clinical application."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, an emerging coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide. Older people and those with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe illness. Vaccines against coronavirus have been developed recently. In India, the two vaccine currently authorized to use are namely ChAdOx1 nCov, Covishield and Covaxin; both of which require 2 shots few weeks apart for adequate protection. Although COVID antibody test has not been done following vaccination in my subjects, it was observed that those who were vaccinated with one or two doses had less clinical severity compared to non vaccinated patients. In this study, we did a comparative analysis of the laboratory markers of severity in elderly COVID patients who were fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and non vaccinatednon-vaccinated. MATERIAL: This study is conducted with COVID-19 patients in age group more than 65 years for duration of 6 months. Participants were divided in three group Fully Vaccinated group who received 2 doses, Partially Vaccinated group with only 1 dose and non-vaccinated group. Assessment of inflammatory markers like CRP, LDH and Ferritin, Procalcitonin, RDW and NLR were done in the three groups. OBSERVATION: A total of 52 fully vaccinated, 120 partially vaccinated and 458 non vaccinated patients were included in this study. The mean LDH, ferritin, procalcitonin, RDW, NLR in the fully vaccinated group were 381.61167.53 U/l, 286.77226.73 ng/ml, 0.400.32 ng/ml, 14.231.80 % and 8.8510.36 respectively; that in the partially vaccinated group were 413.89209.75 U/l, 387.44317.55 ng/ml, 1.082.98 ng/ml, 14.451.42 % and 10.2012.30 respectively; and in the non vaccinated group were 583.97638.90 U/l, 479.03332.85 ng/ml, 5.3015.91 ng/ ml, 14.931.96 % and 11.9712.57 respectively. Significant differences were found in terms of LDH, Ferritin, RDW and CRP among the groups with p values of <0.01, <0.0001, <0.01 and <0.05 respectively. However, no significant difference (p>0.05) was observed in terms of procalcitonin and NLR among the groups although the average values were found to increase from fully vaccinated to partially vaccinated to non-vaccinated groups.

Three main policy issues are addressed, and the results can be summarized as follows. First, age-based lockdown policies are associated with limited output losses and, therefore, are an efficient strategy to limit the spread of the virus in a pandemic, especially in presence of strong age-dependent fatality rates. Second, lockdown policies generate substantial spillover effects;hence, international policy coordination avoiding that too many countries are in lockdown contemporaneously or that such coordination takes place across the countries with the highest integration of over-60 workers along GVCs may be helpful in reducing disruptions. Third, non-targeted lockdowns are much more costly than age-based ones;therefore, other things equal, age-based policies should always be preferred to non-targeted ones. Our analysis also suggests that, in our sample, the over-60 workers are relatively more numerous in sectors where the value added and the integration in GVCs is lower;this feature should be kept in mind in the design of other policies as it might play an important role.","output":"The optimality of age-based lockdown policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus infection disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) was associated with a physical\\\\functional and emotional decline in patients with COVID\\\\19 hospital internment.

Taking into account the emotional deficiencies originated during the pandemic, among the most powerful tools to achieve engagement along with the identification, control and management of emotions is emotional intelligence (EI). The present study aims to establish the effect of the current confinement on the teaching-learning process and academic performance and the impact of the application of EI on university students. In total, 47 volunteers of the second course of the Degree in Pharmacy of the University of Granada (Spain) took part in this experience. Two temporary periods were established: at the beginning of the confinement period and after teaching several concepts of emotional intelligence online for two months. The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey Inventory (MBI-SS) and the Spanish version of Utrech Work Engagement Scale-Students (UWES-S) were used to evaluate the intervention. In total, 63.5% of the students presented academic burnout during the confinement before the intervention. After the EI workshops and seminars, only 31.1% presented academic burnout. Before the intervention with the emotional intelligence workshops, 44.6% experienced exhaustion, 41.7% cynicism and 60.3% felt it was ineffective in their academic performance. After the emotional intelligence workshops and seminars, 29.1% experienced exhaustion, 30.1% cynicism and 28.8% felt it was ineffective.

Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) might improve voiding symptoms by treating dysfunctional voiding. The aim of this study is to report our experience with SNM in patients treated with surgery for DIE. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 13 patients with VS/Ds after surgery for DIE. All patients were investigated with urodynamic studies (UDS) and agreed to undergo SNM. Pre-existing VS/Ds, bowel disorders and pelvic pain, DIE surgical procedures, UDS and SNM test results were recorded. RESULTS: After surgery for DIE, functional bladder outflow obstruction and detrusor acontractility were observed in nine and four patients, respectively. Chronic pelvic pain was present in seven cases. Twelve patients developed constipation, whilst one patient had de novo faecal incontinence. After the SNM testing period, nine patients (69.2%) experienced a significant improvement of symptoms that led to definitive implant. Four patients (30.8%) had no symptom relief and the system was removed. CONCLUSIONS: Functional bladder outflow obstruction and urinary retention are the most common VS/Ds after surgery for DIE.

In this study, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis in stroke patients on prescribed antiplatelet therapy in the WAKE-UP trial. Methods WAKE-UP was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to study the efficacy and safety of MRI-guided intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase in patients with an acute stroke of unknown onset time. The medication history of all patients randomized in the WAKE-UP trial was documented. The primary safety outcome was any sign of hemorrhagic transformation on follow-up MRI. The primary efficacy outcome was favorable functional outcome defined by a score of 0-1 on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days after stroke, adjusted for age and baseline stroke severity. Logistic regression models were fitted to study the association of prior antiplatelet treatment with outcome and treatment effect of intravenous alteplase. Results Of 503 randomized patients, 164 (32.6%) were on antiplatelet treatment. Patients on antiplatelet treatment were older (70.3 vs. 62.8 years, p < 0.001), and more frequently had a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and hemorrhagic transformation on follow-up imaging did not differ between patients with and without antiplatelet treatment. Patients on prior antiplatelet treatment were less likely to achieve a favorable outcome (37.3% vs. 52.6%, p = 0.014), but there was no interaction of prior antiplatelet treatment with intravenous alteplase concerning favorable outcome (p = 0.355). Intravenous alteplase was associated with higher rates of favorable outcome in patients on prior antiplatelet treatment with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.106 (95% CI 1.047-4.236). Conclusions Treatment benefit of intravenous alteplase and rates of post-treatment hemorrhagic transformation were not modified by prior antiplatelet intake among MRI-selected patients with unknown onset stroke.

However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems.

Several postoperative complications related to the in situ distal stomach have been described, and few cases of undetected gastric carcinoma located in this segment of stomach have been published. In this paper, we present our early postoperative results in patients submitted to laparoscopic gastric bypass with resection of distal stomach in patients with morbid obesity. METHODS One hundred twelve consecutive patients were included in this study. The mean body weight was 112.155.1 (range 78C145), and BMI was 40.56.9 kg/m2 (32.9C50.3). Patients were submitted to resectional gastric bypass by laparoscopic approach. The operative time was 133.729.1 min (range 120C240). RESULTS Postoperative complications occurred in 12 patients (10.7%) without any mortality. Early complications were observed in 11 patients while one patient presented a late complication, four patients were re-hospitalized, three of them without operation and other four of them were re-operated due to early (three patients) or late complication (one patient). One hundred patients (89.2%) were discharged at fourth postoperative day, seven patients remained in hospital between 5 and 10 days, and four patients after the tenth day due to complications.

Promising serum biomarkers include interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-, procalcitonin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), and D-dimer. In addition to c-reactive protein and leucocyte esterase, promising biomarkers that can be measured in synovial fluid include antimicrobial proteins such as human -defensin (HBD)-2 and human -defensin (HBD)-3, and cathelicidin LL-37, as well as several interleukins such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, TNF- , interferon-, and vascular endothelial growth factor.","output":"The Role of Biomarkers for the Diagnosis of Implant-Related Infections in Orthopaedics and Trauma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several recent reviews have suggested a role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, but its interplay with disease severity has not been revealed yet. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association between the severity of COVID\\\\19 and oxidative stress parameters.

Production of oxidant (hydrogen peroxide) and defense antioxidants (total antioxidant capacity, reduced and oxidized glutathione, glutathione s-transferase), and oxidative damage (malondialdehyde, carbonyl, and sulfhydryl) were assessed using the serum samples. The results revealed that severe patients who presented high serum leukocyte count and CRP level stayed for a longer period in the hospital. However, there was no correlation observed between the oxidative stress parameters and degree of COVID-19 severity in the present study.

Antenatal breastmilk expression (ABE) may facilitate earlier breastfeeding, but feasibility of introducing ABE and its acceptance among Scandinavian women have previously not been investigated. METHODS: This observational trial was conducted between the 1 January 2019 and the 12 March 2020 in Troms?, Norway. We aimed to determine the feasibility of ABE in terms of practicality and acceptability among women with medically (metformin or insulin) treated diabetes. Women were invited to participate during antenatal visits from 32 weeks gestation. Participants received instruction and started ABE from gestation week 37 + 0. Participants, and their infants, were followed until 6C8 weeks after birth. We collected data on breastfeeding rates, infant hypoglycemia, transfer to the neonatal unit, and the womens overall experience and satisfaction with antenatal breastmilk expression. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 34 (82%) invited women consented to participate. All started ABE from week 37 + 0, and continued until hospital admission. No women reported any discomfort or side effects. Labor was induced at 38 weeks gestation. Twenty-four women brought harvested colostrum to the maternity ward, which was given to their infants during the first 24 h of life. Breastfeeding rates at discharge were 24/28 (86%) and 21/27 (78%) at 6C8 weeks after delivery. Seven (25%) infants were transferred to the neonatal unit; four because of hypoglycemia. Maternal satisfaction assessed 6C8 weeks after delivery revealed that all participants felt positive about the ABE, but one woman would not recommend it to other pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a structured ABE guideline for women with medically treated diabetes was feasible. The intervention was associated with high level of satisfaction among study participants. No obvious side effects were observed, and breastfeeding rates at discharge and 6C8 weeks after delivery were higher than in comparable studies.

It is argued that the contradictions of indigeneity concern not only indigenousstate relations, but also narratives on tradition and history, and most of all, economic contradictions. It is the recognition of the overall framework of capitalism and the state which makes possible the emergence of alternative local economies based upon solidarity.

We computed a reproduction parameter, Rv, using the next generation matrix. Analytical and numerical approach is used to investigate the results. In the analytical study of the model: we showed the local and global stability of disease-free equilibrium, the existence of the endemic equilibrium and its local stability, positivity of the solution, invariant region of the solution, transcritical bifurcation of equilibrium and conducted sensitivity analysis of the model. From these analysis, we found that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for Rv < 1 and unstable for Rv > 1. A locally stable endemic equilibrium exists for Rv > 1, which shows persistence of the disease if the reproduction parameter is greater than unity.

Methods It is an intervention study with a convenient sample, 67 children (6C13 years old;50.7% girls). An intervention occurred according to the Brazilian Base Nacional Comum Curricular (BNCC) and the State Education Secretary orientations for remote Physical Education classes. SPPF was evaluated through a questionnaire (QAPA). Generalized estimative equations (GEE) and the prevalence of changes in individual score delta () from baseline to follow-up determined the effects. Results Positive individual changes in SPPF were observed for 21.2% of girls and 26.4% of boys. Older children presented fewer SPPF total points.

Background COVID-19 has now spread throughout world. There is a serious need to find potential therapeutic agents. The 3C-like protease (Mpro/6LU7) is an attractive molecular target for rational anti-CoV drugs. Methods The tertiary structure of COVID-19 Mpro was obtained from a protein data bank repository, and molecular docking screening was performed by Molegro Virtual Docker, ver. 6, with a grid resolution of 0.30 ?. Docking scores (DOS) are representative of calculated ligand-receptor (protein) interaction energy; therefore, more negative scores mean better binding tendency. Another docking study was then applied on each of the selected drugs with the best ligands separately and using a more accurate RMSD algorithm. Results The docking of COVID-19 major protease (6LU7) with 17 selected drugs resulted in four FDA approved viral antiprotease drugs (Temoporfin, Simeprevir, Cobicistat, Ritonavir) showing the best docking scores. Among these 4 compounds, Temoporfin exhibited the best DOS (-202.88) and the best screened ligand with COVID-19 Mpro, followed by Simeprevir (-201.66), Cobicistat (-187.75), and Ritonavir (-186.66). As the best screened ligand, Temoporfin could target the Mpro with 20 different conformations, while Simeprevir, Cobicistat, and Ritonavir make 14, 10, and 10 potential conformations at the binding site, respectively. Conclusion The findings showed that the four selected FDA approved drugs can be potent inhibitors against COVID-19; among them, Temoporfin may be more potent for the treatment of the disease.

One of the threats in this process is cheating;cheating is a major concern for professors and institutions, especially when universities conduct exams online due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It means to consider the academic work of others in its place. Cheating can have a devastating effect on the performance, reputation, and longevity of an institution. When academic institutions do not have control over cheating, the result will be employers' dissatisfaction with the graduates' job performance. The first line of defense to prevent cheating is the adoption of ethical codes. In this regard, it is necessary to hold empowerment courses for teachers to train them to design appropriate questions. Other factors include setting a time limit for each question, designing questions with different arrangements, random distribution of questions, holding several midterm exams and reducing the volume of end-of-semester test resources, changing the scoring system to qualitative, matching the taught content with the exams, facilitate vague and complex lessons, project assessments, and reduce exams. The use of web-based cameras (webcams) as a technology-based solution to prevent cheating has also been suggested.

The COVID-19 mortality rate is higher among older people, who may find that wearing a face mask protects their physical health but jeopardizes their mental health. This study aimed to explore the associations between depressive symptoms, health beliefs, and face mask wearing behaviors among older people. By means of an online survey conducted between March and April 2020, we assessed depressive symptoms, health beliefs regarding COVID-19, and face mask use and reuse among community-dwelling older people. General linear models were employed to explore the associations among these variables. Of the 355 valid participants, 25.6% experienced depressive symptoms. Health beliefs regarding the perceived severity of disease (p = 0.001) and perceived efficacy of practicing preventive measures (p = 0.005) were positively associated with face mask use. Those who reused face masks (p = 0.008) had a stronger belief in disease severity (p < 0.001), had poorer cues to preventive measures (p = 0.002), and were more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Mask reuse was significantly associated with depression only among those who perceived the disease as serious (p = 0.025) and those who had poorer cues to preventive measures (p = 0.004). In conclusion, health beliefs regarding perceived severity and efficacy contributed to more frequent face mask use, which was unrelated to depressive symptoms. Older people who had a stronger belief in disease severity had less adequate cues to preventive measures and reused face masks experienced greater depressive symptoms. A moderation effect of health beliefs (i.e., disease severity and cues to preventive measures) on face mask reuse and depression was observed.","output":"Face Mask Wearing Behaviors, Depressive Symptoms, and Health Beliefs Among Older People During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has prompted the need for near real-time genomic surveillance to inform public health interventions.

METHODS In compliance with MOOSE and PRISMA guidelines, AMED, CINAHL, MEDLINE, ProQuest Health & Medical Collection, ProQuest Nursing & Allied Health Database, and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched for studies published from database inception until 1st October 2020 [Prospero CRD42020166614]. Reference lists of included studies were further screened. Methodological quality was appraised using a modified critical appraisal tool for quantitative studies developed by McMaster University. RESULTS A total of 35 non-randomised observational studies were suitable for inclusion. Within these, 20 studies evaluated plantar tissue thickness, 19 studies evaluated plantar tissue stiffness, 9 studies evaluated Achilles tendon thickness and 5 studies evaluated Achilles tendon stiffness outcomes. No significant differences in plantar tissue thickness were found between people with and without diabetes in 55% of studies (11/20), while significantly increased plantar tissue stiffness was found in people with diabetes in 47% of studies (9/19). Significantly increased Achilles tendon thickness was found in people with diabetes in 44% of studies (4/9), while no significant differences in Achilles tendon stiffness were found between people with and without diabetes in 60% of studies (3/5).

Until a vaccine is available, personal protection, social distancing, and disinfection are the main tools against SARS-CoV-2. Although it is quite infectious, the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself is an enveloped virus that is relatively fragile because its protective fatty layer is sensitive to heat, ultraviolet radiation, and certain chemicals. However, heat and liquid treatments can damage some materials, and ultraviolet light is not efficient in shaded areas, so other disinfection alternatives are required to allow safe re-utilization of materials and spaces. As of this writing, evidences are still accumulating for the use of ozone gas as a disinfectant for sanitary materials and ambient disinfection in indoor areas. This paper reviews the most relevant results of virus disinfection by the application of gaseous ozone. The review covers disinfection treatments of both air and surfaces carried out in different volumes, which varies from small boxes and controlled chambers to larger rooms, as a base to develop future ozone protocols against COVID-19. Published papers have been critically analyzed to evaluate trends in the required ozone dosages, as a function of relative humidity (RH), contact time, and viral strains. The data have been classified depending on the disinfection objective and the volume and type of the experimental set-up. Based on these data, conservative dosages and times to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 are estimated. In small chambers, 10-20 mg ozone/m3 over 10 to 50 min can be sufficient to significantly reduce the virus load of personal protection equipment. In large rooms, 30 to 50 mg ozone/m3 would be required for treatments of 20-30 min. Maximum antiviral activity of ozone is achieved at high humidity, while the same ozone concentrations under low RH could result inefficient. At these ozone levels, safety protocols must be strictly followed. These data can be used for reducing significantly the viral load although for assuring a safe disinfection, the effective dosages under different conditions need to be confirmed with experimental data.","output":"Ozone potential to fight against SAR-COV-2 pandemic: facts and research needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to examine recent papers on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, including implications for some of the groups of people already less included in society.

Leading cardiac societies recommend exercise as an integral part of cardiovascular rehabilitation because it reduces the morbidity and mortality of patients with CAD. Continuous low-intensity exercise using shortening muscle actions (concentric, CON) is a common training modality during cardiovascular rehabilitation. However, a growing clinical interest has been recently developed in high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for stable patients with CAD. Exercise performed with lengthening muscle actions (eccentric, ECC) could be tolerated better by patients with CAD as they can be performed with higher loads and lower metabolic cost than CON exercise. OBJECTIVE We developed a clinical protocol on a soft robot to compare cardiovascular and muscle effects of repeated and work-matched CON versus ECC pedaling-type interval exercise between patients with CAD during cardiovascular rehabilitation. This study aims to ascertain whether the developed training protocols affect peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), peak aerobic power output (Ppeak), and parameters of muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2) during exercise, and anaerobic muscle power. METHODS We will randomize 20-30 subjects to either the CON or ECC group. Both groups will perform a ramp test to exhaustion before and after the training period to measure cardiovascular parameters and SmO2. Moreover, the aerobic skeletal muscle power (Ppeak) is measured weekly during the 8-week training period using a simulated squat jump and a counter movement jump on the soft robot and used to adjust the training load. The pedaling-type interval exercise on the soft robot is performed involving either CON or ECC muscle actions. The soft robotic device being used is a closed kinetic chain, force-controlled interactive training, and testing device for the lower extremities, which consists of two independent pedals and free footplates that are operated by pneumatic artificial muscles. RESULTS The first patients with CAD, who completed the training, showed protocol-specific improvements, reflecting, in part, the lower aerobic training status of the patient completing the CON protocol. Rehabilitation under the CON protocol, more than under the ECC protocol, improved cardiovascular parameters, that is, VO2peak (+26% vs -6%), and Ppeak (+20% vs 0%), and exaggerated muscle deoxygenation during the ramp test (248% vs 49%). Conversely, markers of metabolic stress and recovery from the exhaustive ramp test improved more after the ECC than the CON protocol, that is, peak blood lactate (-9% vs +20%) and peak SmO2 (+7% vs -7%). Anaerobic muscle power only improved after the CON protocol (+18% vs -15%). CONCLUSIONS This study indicates the potential of the implemented CON and ECC protocols of pedaling-type interval exercise to improve oxygen metabolism of exercised muscle groups while maintaining or even increasing the Ppeak. The ECC training protocol seemingly provided a lower cardiovascular stimulus in patients with CAD while specifically enhancing the reoxygenation and blood lactate clearance in recruited muscle groups during recovery from exercise.

Currently, there is no consensus on the technical standards for LPD. Objective The aim of this consensus statement is to guide the continued safe progression and adoption of LPD. Evidence Review An international panel of experts was selected based on their clinical and scientific expertise in laparoscopic and open pancreaticoduodenectomy. Statements were produced upon reviewing the literature and assessed by the members of the expert panel. The literature search and its critical appraisal were limited to articles published in English during the period from 1994 to 2019. The Web of Science, Medline, and Cochrane Library and Clinical Trials databases were searched, The search strategy included, but was not limited to, the terms 'laparoscopic', 'pancreaticoduodenectomy, 'pancreatoduodenectomy', 'Whipple's operation', and 'minimally invasive surgery'. Reference lists from the included articles were manually checked for any additional studies, which were included when appropriate. Delphi method was used to establish expert consensus and the AGREE II-GRS Instrument was applied to assess the methodological quality and externally validate the final statements. The statements were further discussed during a one-day face-to-face meeting at the 1st Summit on Minimally Invasive Pancreatico-Biliary Surgery in Wuhan, China. Findings Twenty-eight international experts from 8 countries constructed the expert panel. Sixteen statements were produced by the members of the expert panel. At least 80% of responders agreed with the majority (80%) of statements. Other than three randomized controlled trials published to date, most evidences were based on level 3 or 4 studies according to the AGREE II-GRS Instrument. Conclusions and Relevance The Wuhan international expert consensus meeting on LPD has produced a set of clinical practice statements for the safe development and progression of LPD. LPD is currently in its development and exploration stages, as defined by the international IDEAL framework for surgical innovation.

It was hypothesised that high care disruptions and psychological stress would be observed among paediatric and adult CHD patients in the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, international, electronic survey study was completed. Eligible participants included parents of children with acquired or CHD, adults with CHD, or caregivers of adults with CHD. RESULTS: A total of 1220 participants from 25 countries completed the survey from 16 April to 4 May, 2020. Cardiac care disruption was significant with 38% reporting delays in pre-pandemic scheduled cardiac surgeries and 46% experiencing postponed cardiac clinic visits. The majority of respondents (75%) endorsed moderate to high concern about the patient with heart disease becoming ill from COVID-19. Worry about returning for in-person care was significantly greater than worry of harm to patient due to postponed care. Clinically significant psychological stress was high across the sample including children (50%), adults with CHD (42%), and caregivers (42%). CONCLUSIONS: The early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to considerable disruptions in cardiac care for patients with paediatric and adult CHD. COVID-19-related fears are notable with potential to impact willingness to return to in-person care. Psychological stress is also very high necessitating intervention.

The majority of patients with COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre-DM (23.9%) with elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), or a body mass index >30 with normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) (4.3%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared with non-diabetics. Severe COVID-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients, including those with DM, preDM, and obesity. COVID-19 is associated with elevated FBG and several patients presented with new onset DM or in DKA. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis involves a novel interplay with glucose metabolism.

The development of appropriate model cell behavior is intended to simulate two scenarios: the first is mechanical deformation during a crash and the second is an internal short circuit in lithium-ion cells during the actual effect scenarios. The punch test has been used as a benchmark to analyze the effects of different state of charge conditions on high-energy lithium-ion battery cells. This article explores the impact of three separate factors on the outcomes of mechanical punch indentation experiments. The first parameter analyzed was the degree of prediction brought about by experiments on high-energy cells with two different states of charge (greater and lesser), with four different sizes of indentation punch, from the cells reaction during the indentation effects on electrolyte. Second, the results of the loading position, middle versus side, are measured at quasi-static speeds. The third parameter was the effect on an electrolyte with a different state of charge. The repeatability of the experiments on punch loading was the last test function analyzed. The test results of a greater than 10% state of charge and less than 10% state of charge were compared to further refine and validate this modeling method. The different loading scenarios analyzed in this study also showed great predictability in the load-displacement reaction and the onset short circuit. A theoretical model of the cell was modified for use in comprehensive mechanical deformation. The overall conclusion found that the loading initiating the cells electrical short circuit is not instantaneously instigated and it is subsequently used to process the development of a precise and practical computational model that will reduce the chances of the internal short course during the crash.","output":"Performance Analysis of Indentation Punch on High Energy Lithium Pouch Cells and Simulated Model Improvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Hepatitis E virus is a small, nonenveloped RNA virus that is feco-orally transmitted and causes viral hepatitis in humans.

This has exciting implications for exploiting the VLP as a nanocarrier for foreign epitopes or encapsulated deliverables. By exhaustively studying the structure of the virus, we have been successful in designing and synthesizing chimerized VLPs that either carry foreign epitopes, are capable of encapsulating foreign DNA, or both.

HCV PI showed differential potency in short-term treatment assays based on detection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in VeroE6 cells. Linear PI boceprevir, telaprevir and narlaprevir had 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of a40 M.

METHODS Prenatal/early neonatal data were obtained for all mother-child pairs. A subgroup of infants had cranial ultrasonography, eye fundoscopy, hearing and neurological examinations, and Bayley III screening tests within three months of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalence of pregnancy losses and anomalies detected at birth or within three months according to the gestational age of infection. RESULTS Overall, 511 ZIKV-infected women were identified from a total of 1116 symptomatic women; as there were two twins, there were a total of 513 fetuses included. In total, 13 of these 513 (2.5%;95%CI:1.5-4.3) presented with major signs of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Of the 511 women there were 489 livebirths and 24 (4.7%) pregnancy losses (20 miscarriages and 4 stillbirths). ZIKV-related anomalies occurred in the offspring of 42/511(8.2%) mothers. Microcephaly or other CNS malformations were diagnosed in 1/4 (25.0%) stillbirths and in 19/489(3.9%;95% CI:2.5-5.9) of the live-born infants. Fetal abnormalities were 14.0 (95%CI:7.6-26.0) times more likely with gestational infection occurring in 11 weeks.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of multiple SVS algorithms in tandem (stepwise agreement) is a valid variable selection procedure. Computer simulations were developed to address stepwise agreement. Three popular SVS algorithms were tested (backward elimination, forward selection, and stepwise) on three statistical methods (linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression). Other simulation parameters explored were the sample size, number of predictors considered, degree of correlation between pairs of predictors, p-value-based entrance and exit criteria, predictor type (normally distributed or binary), and differences between stepwise agreement between any two or all three algorithms. Among stepwise methods, the rate of agreement, agreement on a model including only those predictors truly associated with the outcome, and agreement on a model containing the predictors truly associated with the outcome were measured. These rates were dependent on all simulation parameters. Mostly, the SVS algorithms agreed on a final model, but rarely on a model with only the true predictors. Sample size and candidate predictor pool size are the most influential simulation conditions. To conclude, stepwise agreement is often a poor strategy that gives misleading results and researchers should avoid using multiple SVS algorithms to build multivariable models.

The assessment is based on three criteria that reflect real-life settings, namely, (i) immediate antiviral effect, (ii) effect after repeated cleaning of the coated surface, and (iii) antiviral activity in the presence of organic material. The results showed that only a copper compound-based coating successfully met all three criteria. A quaternary ammonium compound-based coating did not meet the second criterion, and a coating based on reactive oxygen species showed no antiviral effect. Moreover, the study demonstrated that HCoV-229E is a relevant SARS-CoV-2 surrogate for such experiments. This new approach allows benchmarking of currently available antiviral coatings and future coating developments to avoid unjustified claims. The deployment of efficient antiviral coatings can offer an additional measure to mitigate the risk of transmission of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 or influenza viruses from high-touch surfaces. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is transmitted mainly person-to-person through respiratory droplets, while the contribution of fomite transmission is less important than suspected at the beginning of the pandemic. Nevertheless, antiviral-coating solutions can offer an additional measure to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from high-touch surfaces. The deployment of antiviral coatings is not new, but what is currently lacking is solid scientific evidence of the efficacy of commercially available self-disinfecting surfaces under real-life conditions. Therefore, we developed a novel, robust approach to evaluate the antiviral activity of such coatings, applying strict quality criteria to three commercially available products to test their efficacies against SARS-CoV-2. We also showed that HCoV-229E is a relevant surrogate for such experiments. Our approach will also bring significant benefit to the evaluation of the effects of coatings on the survival of nonenveloped viruses, which are known to be more tolerant to desiccation and disinfectants and for which high-touch surfaces play an important role.","output":"Assessment of Antiviral Coatings for High-Touch Surfaces by Using Human Coronaviruses HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Ischaemic stroke may be a major complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Studying and characterising the different aetiological subtypes, clinical characteristics, and functional outcomes may be valuable in guiding patient selection for optimal management and treatment.

The aim of this study is to present our short-terms results in the treatment of laparoscopic paraesophageal hiatal hernia (LPHH) with a synthetic polyglycolic acid:trimethylene carbonate mesh (Gore Bio A(?)). METHODS From January 2011 to December 2012, 10 patients with large paraesophageal hiatal hernias and hiatal defect over 5 cm were included. Primary simple suture of the crura and additional reinforcement with a Gore Bio A(?) mesh was performed. Hiatal hernia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms recurrence, dysphagia and mesh-related complications were investigated. RESULTS Of the 10 patients undergoing mesh repair, there were 7 women and 3 men with a mean age of 65.5 years. All operations were completed laparoscopically. Median postoperative stay was 3 days. After a median follow-up of 20.3 months, one patient developed a recurrent hiatal hernia (10%). There were no mesh-related complications. CONCLUSIONS The use of Gore Bio A(?) mesh for the laparoscopic repair of large paraesophageal hiatal hernias is safe and with a reasonably low recurrence rate in this short-term study. Additional long-term studies with ample numbers carried out for years will be necessary to see if this synthetic mesh is not only safe but also successful in the prevention of recurrences.","output":"Short-term results for laparoscopic repair of large paraesophageal hiatal hernias with Gore Bio A? mesh."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The next step was to test the analysis of vitamin C from 3 samples of cookies using the Iodometric Titration Method, to determine the amount of Vitamin C (mg/100g) and the antioxidant activity with 2 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) with triple repeat per sample The amount of vitamin C obtained at S1 was 60 401 00 mg/100 g with 15 550 05% antioxidant activity, S2 was 55 950 05 mg/100 g with 10 600 30% antioxidant activity and S3 was 77 920 02 mg/100 g with 22 100 10% antioxidant activity [ ]these product can be a potential Anti SARS-CoV-2, which SARS-Cov-2 itself attacks immunity and causes inflammation in the body3","output":"Probiotic drink from the fermentation of banana flower (Ontong) with addition of kluthuk banana leaves (Musa balbisiana)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper contributes to debates on humanCtechnologies relations and labour geographies.

Drawing on 40 semi\\\\structured interviews conducted with airport labour in Singapore in 2020 at the height of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, the paper offers an analysis of how airport workers variously and viscerally capitulate to, abandon, and/or desire to collaborate with automation, in ways that are both unstable and atmospherically implicated. To the extent that these affective responses have the potential to change the course of technological and labour futures in airport infrastructures, atmospheres  especially those deliberately advocated by the state and airport management  are also a political force to be reckoned with.

Mental health problems and trauma symptoms are consistently associated with sexual and reproductive health behavior. Despite their intersection, few interventions address them simultaneously or engage female caregivers (FC) as collaborators. This study presents findings from a pilot test of an empirically supported culturally adapted family-based HIV-prevention program, Informed Motivated Aware and Responsible Adolescents and Adults- South Africa (IMARA-SA), on AGYW anxiety, depression, and trauma. METHODS: Sixty 15C19-year-old AGYW (mean age = 17.1 years) and their FC from outside Cape Town were randomized to IMARA-SA or a health promotion control program. AGYW reported their anxiety using the GAD-7, depression using the PHQ-9, and trauma using the PC-PTSD-5 at baseline and follow-up (6C10 months post). Both interventions were delivered by Xhosa-speaking Black South African women in groups over 2 days for approximately 10 h. We examined intervention effects using zero-inflated negative binomial regression for anxiety, multinomial logistic regression for depression, and logistic regression for trauma. RESULTS: At baseline, groups did not differ in demographic characteristics but AGYW randomized to IMARA-SA had higher depression scores than controls (p = 0.04) and a greater proportion screened positive for PTSD (p = .07). Controlling for baseline mental health scores, AGYW who received IMARA-SA compared to controls had significantly fewer anxiety symptoms at follow-up (adjusted incidence rate ratio for count model = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.29C0.99, p = 0.05), were less likely to report at least one depressive symptom relative to no symptoms (relative risk ratio = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.95, p = 0.04), and were less likely to report symptoms of PTSD relative to no symptoms, but this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health is implicated in risky sexual behavior, and reducing emotional distress can mitigate exposure to poor sexual and reproductive health outcomes.

In this study we examine the efficacy of LSG as a stand-alone operation in the veteran population. METHODS This is a retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent LSG as a stand-alone procedure at the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs medical center with a minimum 12-month follow-up. RESULTS Of 205 patients undergoing bariatric surgery, 71 patients had a sleeve gastrectomy, 40 of whom had the operation performed at least 12 months previously. Thirty-six (90%) were available for 1-year follow-up, with a mean follow-up duration of 22 months (range: 12-42), a mean body mass index of 48.3 kg/m(2), and an 83% male population. Mean percent excess weight loss was 61% at an average of 22 months, with no significant difference between severely obese, morbidly obese, and super obese cohorts. Diabetes remission was seen in 56% of patients, hypertension remission in 51.6%, and obstructive sleep apnea remission in 46.4%, and gastroesophageal reflux disease improved or did not change in 83%. Medication use significantly decreased after surgery. CONCLUSION LSG is safe and effective as a stand-alone bariatric operation in the high-risk veteran population. It is effective in severely obese, morbidly obese, and super obese patients.

We have investigated the effect of cumulative dose and duration of glucocorticoids on blood pressure and renal function in VLBW infants. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, medical records of infants (GA  35 weeks) born January 2015 to December 2019 were reviewed to extract demographic and clinical characteristics, dose and duration of steroids, blood pressure (BP), and creatinine at the time of discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-three neonates with average GA (28  3 weeks) and birthweight (1060381 g). Twenty-eight percent (33/116) of infants who received postnatal steroids developed hypertension versus 16% (27/167) of controls (OR = 2.0, p = 0.011). There was a correlation between the cumulative dosage of postnatal steroids and systolic BP (R(2) = 0.06, p < 0.001). With increasing steroid dose and total steroid days, there was a significant increase in creatinine clearance at the time of discharge (R(2) = 0.13, p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.13, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative dose of postnatal steroids and duration of use is associated with increased systolic BP in premature infants. Postnatal steroids should be used prudently to prevent long-term cardiovascular and renal morbidity. IMPACT: Preterm neonates are exposed to a high dose of glucocorticoids during their neonatal intensive care stay. The dose and duration of use of postnatal glucocorticoids was associated with significant increase in blood pressure at the time of discharge in preterm neonates. Postnatal glucocorticoid use is associated with improved creatinine clearance likely due to a state of hyperfiltration and may lead to chronic kidney disease later in life. Postnatal glucocorticoids should be used prudently in this highly vulnerable population.","output":"Postnatal glucocorticoid use impacts renal function in VLBW neonates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Du point de vue thique, sanitaire, social et politique, les premiers mois de lpidmie (pandmie)  coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) ont t C et restent C une exprience dstabilisante.

High rates of HGT increase the genetic pool and the effective population size (N(e)), resulting in open pan-genomes. In contrast, selective pressures can lead to local adaptation by purging the variation introduced by HGT and mutation, resulting in closed pan-genomes and clonal lineages. In this study, we explored both hypotheses, elucidating the pan-genome of Vibrionaceae isolates after a perturbation event in the endangered oasis of Cuatro Cinegas Basin (CCB), Mexico, and looking for signals of adaptation to the environments in their genomes. RESULTS: We obtained 42 genomes of Vibrionaceae distributed in six lineages, two of them did not showed any close reference strain in databases. Five of the lineages showed closed pan-genomes and were associated to either water or sediment environment; their high N(e) estimates suggest that these lineages are not from a recent origin. The only clade with an open pan-genome was found in both environments and was formed by ten genetic groups with low N(e), suggesting a recent origin. The recombination and mutation estimators (r/m) ranged from 0.005 to 2.725, which are similar to oceanic Vibrionaceae estimations. However, we identified 367 gene families with signals of positive selection, most of them found in the core genome; suggesting that despite recombination, natural selection moves the Vibrionaceae CCB lineages to local adaptation, purging the genomes and keeping closed pan-genome patterns. Moreover, we identify 598 SNPs associated with an unstructured environment; some of the genes associated with these SNPs were related to sodium transport. CONCLUSIONS: Different lines of evidence suggest that the sampled Vibrionaceae, are part of the rare biosphere usually living under famine conditions. Two of these lineages were reported for the first time. Most Vibrionaceae lineages of CCB are adapted to their micro-habitats rather than to the sampled environments. This pattern of adaptation is concordant with the association of closed pan-genomes and local adaptation.","output":"Population genomics of Vibrionaceae isolated from an endangered oasis reveals local adaptation after an environmental perturbation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The recent outbreak of the COVID\\\\19 altered the traditional paradigm of clinical medical education. While individual clerkships have shared their curricular adaptations via social and academic networking media, there is currently no organizational standard in establishing a non\\\\clinical, Emergency Medicine (EM) virtual rotation (VR). The primary objective of this study was to describe EM clerkship directors (CDs) perspectives on their experience adapting an EM VR curriculum during the onset of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS: A 21\\\\item survey with quantitative and qualitative questions was disseminated between June and August 2020 to EM CDs via the Clerkship Director of Emergency Medicine (CDEM) Listserv to describe their experience and perspectives in adapting a VR during the spring of 2020. RESULTS: We analyzed 59 out of 77 EM clerkship survey responses. Among respondents, 52% adapted a VR while 47.5% did not. Of those who adapted a VR, 71% of CDs had 2 weeks or less to develop the new curriculum, with 84% reporting usual or increased clinical load during that time. Clerkships significantly diversified their asynchronous educational content and utilized several instructional models to substitute the loss of clinical experience. Reflecting on the experience, 71% of CDs did not feel comfortable writing a standardized letter of evaluation for students based on the VR, with the majority citing inability to evaluate students competencies in a clinical context. CONCLUSION: A crisis, such as COVID\\\\19 necessitates change in all facets of medical education.

Serological tests for the measurement of immune response could represent an effective tool for the rapid monitoring of the population with asymptomatic infections and for estimating the proportion of immune in a territory, too. OBJECTIVES: to describe the distribution of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of the Municipality of Borgosesia (Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) and to estimate the efficacy of this strategy for the identification of asymptomatic cases. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with administration of a rapid test to assess the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: all subjects resident in Borgosesia over the age of 18, where invited to participate. A rapid serological test was administered to enrolled participants to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies on peripheral blood. Subjects with IgG or IgM positivity were offered to perform a swab test for viral RNA research. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the prevalence of IgM and IgG, and the relative risks of having positive swab test and of having symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 in the recent past has been estimated. RESULTS: 4,987 subjects participated to study, 44.5% of the adult population of Borgosesia. The average age was 55 years.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to apply digital epidemiology to the current COVID-19 pandemic to determine the utility of providing adjunctive epidemiologic information on outbreaks of this disease and evaluate this methodology in the case of future pandemics. METHODS: An epidemiologic time series analysis of online search trends relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was performed from January 9, 2020, to April 6, 2020. BI was used to obtain online search data for China, while GT was used for worldwide data, the countries of Italy and Spain, and the US states of New York and Washington. These data were compared to real-world confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. Chronologic patterns were assessed in relation to disease patterns, significant events, and media reports. RESULTS: Worldwide search terms for shortness of breath, anosmia, dysgeusia and ageusia, headache, chest pain, and sneezing had strong correlations (r>0.60, P<.001) to both new daily confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. GT COVID-19 (search term) and GT coronavirus (virus) searches predated real-world confirmed cases by 12 days (r=0.85, SD 0.10 and r=0.76, SD 0.09, respectively, P<.001).

SUMMARY ANSWER: A delay in IVF treatment up to 180 days does not affect the live birth rate for women with diminished ovarian reserve when compared to women who initiate IVF treatment within 90 days of presentation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In clinical practice, treatment delays can occur due to medical, logistical or financial reasons. Over a period of years, a gradual decline in ovarian reserve occurs which can result in declining outcomes in response to IVF treatment over time. There is disagreement among reproductive endocrinologists about whether delaying IVF treatment for a few months can negatively affect patient outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective cohort study of infertile patients in an academic hospital setting with diminished ovarian reserve who started an IVF cycle within 180 days of their initial consultation and underwent an oocyte retrieval with planned fresh embryo transfer between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Diminished ovarian reserve was defined as an anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH) <1.1 ng/ml. In total, 1790 patients met inclusion criteria (1115 immediate and 675 delayed treatment). Each patient had one included cycle and no subsequent data from additional frozen embryo transfer cycles were included. Since all cycle outcomes evaluated were from fresh embryo transfers, no genetically tested embryos were included. Patients were grouped by whether their cycle started 1-90 days after presentation (immediate) or 91-180 days (delayed). The primary outcome was live birth (&#8805;24 weeks of gestation). A subgroup analysis of more severe forms of diminished ovarian reserve was performed to evaluate outcomes for patients with an AMH <0.5 and for patients >40 years old with an AMH <1.1 ng/ml (Bologna criteria for diminished ovarian reserve). Logistic regression analysis, adjusted a priori for patient age, was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% CI. All pregnancy outcomes were additionally adjusted for the number of embryos transferred. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The mean  SD number of days from presentation to IVF start was 50.5  21.9 (immediate) and 128.8  25.9 (delayed). After embryo transfer, the live birth rate was similar between groups (immediate: 23.9%; delayed: 25.6%; OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85-1.38). Additionally, a similar live birth rate was observed in a subgroup analysis of patients with an AMH <0.5 ng/ml (immediate: 18.8%; delayed: 19.1%; OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65-1.51) and in patients >40 years old with an AMH <1.1 ng/ml (immediate: 12.3%; delayed: 14.7%; OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77-1.91). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There is the potential for selection bias with regard to the patients who started their IVF cycle within 90 days compared to 91-180 days after initial consultation. In addition, we did not include patients who were seen for initial evaluation but did not progress to IVF treatment with oocyte retrieval; therefore, our results should only be applied to patients with diminished ovarian reserve who complete an IVF cycle. Finally, since we excluded patients who started their IVF cycle greater than 180 days from their first visit, it is not known how such a delay in treatment affects pregnancy outcomes in IVF cycles. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A delay in initiating IVF treatment in patients with diminished ovarian reserve up to 180 days from the initial visit does not affect pregnancy outcomes. This observation remains true for patients who are in the high-risk categories for poor response to ovarian stimulation.

The disease has since rapidly evolved, causing a public health emergency throughout the country but especially in our region, one of the most widely affected areas. We reorganized the daily routine of our cancer center to reduce the risk of contagion. A temporary tensile structure was set up as an entry-point triage, and a COVID-19 route was created with a dedicated CT scanner. A pre-access telephonic triage was performed the day before a patient was scheduled to come in for an examination. At the time of writing (May 4), 4053 patients had been to our center since the emergency officially began (9.03.2020) and the COVID-19 route had been activated for only 9 paucisymptomatic outpatients and 7 symptomatic inpatients. We also re-evaluated patient radiology examination lists and rescheduled non-urgent tests in consensus with the referring oncologist. Out of a total of 1438 patients scheduled for radiological examinations, 456 were postponed for a total volume reduction of 29.1%. Nine asymptomatic patients with typical CT findings of COVID-19 were identified during routine CTs, but none were RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. We guaranteed all urgent and semi-urgent examinations, including those to stage newly diagnosed cancers and to evaluate response to treatment, ensuring the continuation of the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway of our patients.

NICE have published guidance (CG149) for treating infants based on antenatal risk factors and clinical indicators. In the UK, 13C20% of infants are treated for suspected EONS based on CG149. This represents a significant burden, impacting on family bonding, breastfeeding, physical trauma through repeated cannulation, as well as on hospital bed status and finances. Covid-19 has compounded the issue, implementing restricted visitation disrupting the family unit. The Kaiser Permanente Sepsis Tool (KPT) was developed to determine the likelihood of infection based on multivariate analysis, has been used in the USA to successfully and safely to reduce the numbers of babies being prophylactically treated for this rare condition. Following on for their success we have now evaluated KPT for use within a UK demographic at Medway Maritime Hospital.ObjectivesCan KPT reduce prophylactic IV antibiotic use in well babies, when compared to NICE guideline CG149Can KPT achieve this safely within our local demographicMethodsData was collected from 62 newborn infants treated at Medway Maritime Hospital, between November 2019 and January 2020. These patients received prophylactic IV antibiotics as per NICE CG149. Inclusion criteria;34 weeks gestation and infants who were clinically well enough to be managed on the postnatal ward. The following data was obtained at the point of starting treatment;gestation, clinical examination, maternal peripartum temperature, rupture of membranes, maternal group B streptococcus. Subsequently peak CRP, blood and/or CSF culture results and duration of stay were recorded. Infants were classified into a risk category based on their peak CRP (Low <5, Medium 5C10, High >10). These findings were then compared to treatment recommended by the KPT (local incidence of EONS 1/1000 live births).Results16 infants were classed as high risk (26%), 16 infants medium risk (27%) and 29 infants low risk (47%). The most common indication to treat was maternal pyrexia. Of infants screened, KPT recommended antibiotics for 2 infants (3%);both of these were low risk. 47% of infants would have been kept under enhanced observations, with antibiotics being started if clinical symptoms developed. All blood and CSF cultures were negative. Of the infants classified as high risk, 50% of these infants would have been allocated to routine care. In the infants classified as high risk, there were no differences in the risk factors for neonatal sepsis, when compared with other risk categories.ConclusionsKPT represents a lucrative opportunity to reduce antibiotic use in well infants on the postnatal ward. However in line with similar studies, our results have highlighted that, just as with NICE CG149, is not infallible and liable to occasionally missing an asymptomatic child. Clinical vigilance is of the utmost importance and implementation of KPT would be have to marry with robust systems of neonatal observation and workforce training. A more conservative approach to EONS will invariably be associated with risk and ultimately it will be up to individual units to agree on what is acceptable.","output":"Early onset neonatal sepsis: evaluation of the kaiser permanente sepsis calculator for use at a tertiary neonatal unit in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hck, a Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SFK), has recently been established as an attractive pharmacological target to improve pulmonary function in COVID-19 patients. Hck inhibitors are also well known for their regulatory role in various malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Curcumin has been previously identified as an excellent DYRK-2 inhibitor, but curcumin's fate is tainted by its instability in the cellular environment. Besides, small molecules targeting the inactive states of a kinase are desirable to reduce promiscuity. Here, we show that functionalization of the 4-arylidene position of the fluorescent curcumin scaffold with an aryl nitrogen mustard provides a stable Hck inhibitor (Kd = 50  10 nM). The mustard curcumin derivative preferentially interacts with the inactive conformation of Hck, similar to type-II kinase inhibitors that are less promiscuous. Moreover, the lead compound showed no inhibitory effect on three other kinases (DYRK2, Src and Abl). We demonstrate that the cytotoxicity may be mediated via inhibition of the SFK signalling pathway in triple-negative breast cancer and murine macrophage cells. Our data suggest that curcumin is a modifiable fluorescent scaffold to develop selective kinase inhibitors by remodelling its target affinity and cellular stability.","output":"Selective targeting of the inactive state of hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck) with a stable curcumin derivative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gender disparities persist in many aspects of working life for women in academic rheumatology.

Disordered apoptosis can cause a variety of diseases; therefore, sensing apoptosis can provide help in study of mechanism of the relevant diseases and drug development. It is known that caspase-3 is a key enzyme involved in apoptosis and the expression of its activity is an indication of apoptosis. Here, we present a genetically encoded switch-on mNeonGreen2-based molecular biosensor. mNeonGreen2 is the brightest monomeric green fluorescent protein. The substrate of caspase-3, DEVD amino acid residues, is inserted in it, while cyclized by insertion of Nostoc punctiforme DnaE intein to abolish the fluorescence (inactive state). Caspase-3-catalyzed cleavage of DEVD linearizes mNeonGreen2 and rebuilds the natural barrel structure to restore the fluorescence (activated state). The characterization exhibited that the Caspase-3 biosensor has shortened response time, higher sensitivity, and prolonged functional shelf life in detection of caspase-3 amongst the existing counterparts. We also used the Caspase-3 biosensor to evaluate the effect of several drugs on the induction of apoptosis of HeLa and MCF-7 tumor cells and inhibition of Zika virus invasion.

Reports about excess mortality in this regard have mostly focused on overall death counts during specific pandemic phases. OBJECTIVE: To investigate hospitalization rates and compare in-hospital mortality rates with absolute mortality incidences across a broad spectrum of diseases, comparing 2020 data with those of prepandemic years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, cross-sectional, multicentric analysis of administrative data from 5 821 757 inpatients admitted from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020, to 87 German Helios primary to tertiary care hospitals. EXPOSURES: Exposure to SARS-CoV-2. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Administrative data were analyzed from January 1, 2016, to March 31, 2021, as a consecutive sample for all inpatients. Disease groups were defined according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10; German modification) encoded main discharge diagnoses. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for hospital admissions and hospital mortality counts, as well as relative mortality risks (RMRs) comparing 2016-2019 with 2020 (exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic), were calculated with Poisson regression with log-link function. RESULTS: Data were examined for 5 821 757 inpatients (mean [SD] age, 56.4 [25.3] years; 51.5% women), including 125 807 in-hospital deaths. Incidence rate ratios for hospital admissions were associated with a significant reduction for all investigated disease groups (IRR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.86; P < .001). After adjusting for age, sex, the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score, and SARS-CoV-2 infections, RMRs were associated with an increase in infectious diseases (RMR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.21-1.34; P < .001), musculoskeletal diseases (RMR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.04-1.36; P = .009), and respiratory diseases (RMR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.14; P < .001) but not for the total cohort (RMR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.02; P = .66). Regarding in-hospital mortality, IRR was associated with an increase within the ICD-10 chapter of respiratory diseases (IRR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.13-1.46; P < .001) in comparing 2020 with 2016-2019, in contrast to being associated with a reduction in IRRs for the overall cohort and several other subgroups. After exclusion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, IRRs were associated with a reduction in absolute in-hospital mortality for the overall cohort (IRR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84; P < .001) and the subgroup of respiratory diseases (IRR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study of inpatients from a multicentric German database suggests that absolute in-hospital mortality for 2020 across disease groups was not higher compared with previous years. Higher IRRs of in-hospital deaths observed in patients with respiratory diseases were likely associated with individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"A Comparative Analysis of In-Hospital Mortality per Disease Groups in Germany Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic From 2016 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we introduce a contact process in an evolving random environment (CPERE) on a connected and transitive graph with bounded degree, where we assume that this environment is described through an ergodic spin systems with finite range.

As The George Washington University (GWU), a large urban university, prepared to reopen for the Fall 2020 semester, GWU established protocols to protect the health and wellness of all members of campus community. Reopening efforts included a cadre of COVID-19 surveillance systems including development of a public health COVID-19 laboratory, weekly and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing and daily risk screening and symptom monitoring. Other activities included completion of a mandatory COVID-19 training and influenza vaccination for the on-campus population, quarantining of students returning to campus, campus-focused case investigations and quarantining of suspected close contacts, clinical follow-up of infected persons, and regular communication and monitoring. A smaller on-campus population of 4,435 students, faculty and staff returned to campus with later expansion of testing to accommodate GWU students living in the surrounding area. Between August 17 and December 4, 2020, 38,288 tests were performed; 220 were positive.

We considered five different meteorological factors. For the first time, we used a dynamic panel model and considered two different kinds of channels between climate and Covid-19 virus: direct/physical factors related to the survival and durability dynamics of the virus on surfaces and outdoors and indirect/social factors through human behaviour and individual mobility, such as walking or driving outdoors, to capture the impact of weather on social distancing and, thus, on Covid-19 cases and fatalities. Our work revealed that temperature, humidity and solar radiation, which has been clearly under considered in previous studies, significantly reduce the number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities. Indirect effects through human behaviour, i.e., correlations between temperature (or solar radiation) and human mobility, were significantly positive and should be considered to correctly assess the effects of climatic factors. Increasing temperature, humidity or solar radiation effects were positively correlated with increasing mobility effects on Covid-19 cases and fatalities. The net effect from weather on the Covid-19 outbreak will, thus, be the result of the physical/direct negative effect of temperature or solar radiation and the mobility/indirect positive effect due to the interaction between human mobility and those meterological variables. Reducing direct effects of temperature and solar radiation on Covid-19 cases and fatalities, when they were significant, were partly and slightly compensated for positive indirect effects through human mobility.

Pharmacotherapy represents the first-line treatment option; however, only approximately one third of patients respond to the first treatment because of the ineffectiveness or side effects of antidepressants. Precision medicine in psychiatry might offer clinicians the possibility to tailor treatment according to the best possible evidence of efficacy and tolerability for each subject. In this context, our study aims to carry out a clinical validation of a combinatorial pharmacogenomics (PGx) test in an Italian MDD patient cohort with advocacy license independence. METHODS: Our study is a prospective participant- and rater-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical observational trial enrolling 300 MDD patients who are referred to psychiatric services to receive a new antidepressant due to the failure of their current treatment and/or the onset of adverse effects. Eligible participants are randomized to the TGTG group (Treated with Genetic Test Guide) or TAU group (Treated as Usual). For all subjects, DNA is collected with a buccal brush. The primary outcome is the reduction in depressive symptomatology. The secondary outcomes involve a range of scales that assess MDD symptoms and social functioning outcomes. The assessment is performed at four timepoints: baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. DISCUSSION: This project represents the first randomized controlled clinical trial to investigate whether a non-commercial PGx test improves outcomes in an MDD naturalistic cohort. Moreover, the identification of new genetic variants associated with non-response or side effects will improve the efficacy of the test, leading to further cost-saving.

Consequences of wearing RPMs, especially regarding perception and production of spoken communication, are gradually emerging. The present study explored how three prevalent RPMs affect various speech and voice sound properties. METHODS: Pre-recorded sustained [a] vowels and read sentences from 47 subjects were played by a speech production model ('Voice Emitted by Spare Parts', or 'VESPA') in four conditions: without RPM (C1), with disposable surgical mask (C2), with FFP2 mask (C3), and with transparent plastic mask (C4). Differences between C1 and masked conditions were assessed with Dunnett's t test in 26 speech sound properties related to voice production (fundamental frequency, sound intensity level), voice quality (jitter percent, shimmer percent, harmonics-to-noise ratio, smoothed cepstral peak prominence, Acoustic Voice Quality Index), articulation and resonance (first and second formant frequencies, first and second formant bandwidths, spectral center of gravity, spectral standard deviation, spectral skewness, spectral kurtosis, spectral slope, and spectral energy in ten 1-kHz bands from 0 to 10 kHz). RESULTS: C2, C3, and C4 significantly affected 10, 15, and 19 of the acoustic speech markers, respectively. Furthermore, absolute differences between unmasked and masked conditions were largest for C4 and smallest for C2. CONCLUSIONS: All RPMs influenced more or less speech sound properties. However, this influence was least for surgical RPMs and most for plastic RPMs. Surgical RPMs are therefore preferred when spoken communication is priority next to respiratory protection.","output":"Are Acoustic Markers of Voice and Speech Signals Affected by Nose-and-Mouth-Covering Respiratory Protective Masks?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the global spread of COVID-19 and the respective measures, the Internet of Things (IoT) is enabling frontline applications Drones are being used for public surveillance to control the quarantine and the wearing of masks Robots and digital assistants help us cope with indoor isolation more easily With the aid of capable IoT devices, one can trace the origins of outbreaks and ensure patient compliance with vital medical recommendations This motivates further investment in the IoT development Even though the underlying IoT technologies are ready to assist in fighting the disease, challenges do remain Some IoT solutions are fragmented and not always best connected Platforms may not be able to scale adequately and demonstrate their dependability The present sixth appearance of the Internet of Things and Sensor Networks Series of IEEE Communications Magazine continues to follow the cornerstone IoT advancements that have the potential to transform our world","output":"Internet of Things and Sensor Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, many state governors faced an increasing number of acts of defiance as well as political and legal challenges to their public health emergency orders.

However, the efficacy and safety comparing it with conventional non-barbed suture (CS) for UVA is still controversial. AIMS The objective of this study is to assess the current evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of UBS compared with CS for UVA during RARP. METHODS We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, SinoMed (Chinese) and other databases on Oct. 9, 2014 to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other comparative studies evaluating these two types of suture. The outcome measures included anastomosis time operative time, posterior reconstruction (PR) time, postoperative leakage (PL) rate and continence rates at different time points (4-6 weeks, 3 months, 6-12 months) after surgery. Secondary outcomes included estimated blood loss (EBL) and length of catheterization (LOC). RESULTS Three RCTs and six observational studies including 786 cases were identified. Meta-analysis of extractable data showed that use of UBS could significantly reduce anastomosis time (weighted mean difference [WMD]:-3.98min; 95% confidence interval [CI], -6.02 -1.95; p = 0.0001), operative time (WMD:-10.06min; 95% CI, -15.45--4.67; p = 0.0003) and PR time (WMD:-0.93min; 95% CI, -1.52--0.34; p = 0.002). No significant difference was found in PL rate, EBL, LOC, or continence rates at 4-6 weeks, 3 months and 6-12 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analysis indicates that UBS appears to be safe and efficient as CS for UVA during RARP with not only shorter anastomosis time, operative time, PR time, but also equivalent PL rate, EBL, LOC, and continence rates at 4-6 weeks, 3 months and 6-12 months after surgery. For the inherent limitations of the eligible studies, future more persuasive RCTs are needed to confirm and update our findings.","output":"The Use of Unidirectional Barbed Suture for Urethrovesical Anastomosis during Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Efficacy and Safety."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected people around the world.

Given that COVID-19 has been detected in a range of other organs, the COVID-19-associated disease is an alert of aberrant activation of host immune response which drives un-controlled inflammation that affects multiple organs. Complement is a vital component of innate immunity where it forms the first line of defense against potentially harmful microbes, but its role in COVID-19 is still not clear. Notably, the abnormal activation and continuous deposits of complement components were identified in the pre-clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, which have been confirmed in animal models. Recent evidence has revealed that the administration of complement inhibitors leads to relieve inflammatory response in ARDS.

The variety of acute respiratory distress syndrome phenotypes implies personalization of those settings. To guide personalized positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume, physicians need to have an in-depth understanding of the physiologic effects and bedside methods to measure the extent of these effects. In the present article, a step-by-step physiologic approach to select personalized positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume at the bedside is described. DATA SOURCES: The present review is a critical reanalysis of the traditional and latest literature on the topic. STUDY SELECTION: Relevant clinical and physiologic studies on positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume setting were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Reappraisal of the available physiologic and clinical data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Positive end-expiratory pressure is aimed at stabilizing alveolar recruitment, thus reducing the risk of volutrauma and atelectrauma. Bedside assessment of the potential for lung recruitment is a preliminary step to recognize patients who benefit from higher positive end-expiratory pressure level. In patients with higher potential for lung recruitment, positive end-expiratory pressure could be selected by physiology-based methods balancing recruitment and overdistension. In patients with lower potential for lung recruitment or in shock, positive end-expiratory pressure could be maintained in the 5C8 cm H(2)O range. Tidal volume induces alveolar recruitment and improves gas exchange. After setting personalized positive end-expiratory pressure, tidal volume could be based on lung inflation (collapsed lung size) respecting safety thresholds of static and dynamic lung stress. Positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume could be kept stable for some hours in order to allow early recognition of changes in the clinical course of acute respiratory distress syndrome but also frequently reassessed to avoid crossing of safety thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: The setting of personalized positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume based on sound physiologic bedside measures may represent an effective strategy for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.","output":"Personalized Positive End-Expiratory Pressure and Tidal Volume in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Bedside Physiology-Based Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To investigate the agreement between the intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements in the awake condition and under different stages of general inhalational anesthesia using sevoflurane in both glaucomatous and normal children. METHODS A prospective study was performed on 43 glaucomatous children and 30 age-matched controls. Baseline IOP of one eye was measured immediately before general anesthesia using Perkins tonometer and then re-measured under light, intermediate, and deep anesthesia, and then after intubation. Depth of anesthesia was determined using bispectral index pediatric sensor. The agreement between the IOP measurements before and during different stages of anesthesia was analyzed using Bland-Altman plots. Systematic and proportionate deviations between the IOP measurements were analyzed. RESULTS The mean age was 58.6  41.99 months. The mean IOP was significantly lower at all stages of anesthesia in both groups. The coefficient of variation was over 20% in all measurements under anesthesia. For all IOP measurements during anesthesia, the limits of agreement were > 7 mmHg difference in the control group and > 20 mmHg in the glaucomatous group. The best agreement was with the IOP measurement after intubation (mean limit of agreement of -1.4 mmHg, 1.96 s range, -8.8-6 mm Hg) in the control group and with the IOP measurement under intermediate anesthesia (mean limit of agreement of -4.2 mmHg, 1.96 s range, -15.1-6.8 mm Hg) in the glaucomatous group.

Therefore, an extensive online search for scientific research on factors related to diabetes has been performed for the identification of new factors of unexplained etiology. A better understanding of the role of viral, bacterial, and yeast-like fungi infections related to the risk of T1DM in children and adolescents and the identification of new risk factors, especially those spread by the droplet route, is of great importance for people and families with diabetes. ABSTRACT: The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing worldwide. The onset of T1D usually occurs in childhood and is caused by the selective destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells (-cells) by autoreactive T cells, leading to insulin deficiency. Despite advanced research and enormous progress in medicine, the causes of T1D are still not fully understood. Therefore, an extensive online search for scientific research on environmental factors associated with diabetes and the identification of new factors of unexplained etiology has been carried out using the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases. The search results were limited to the past 11 years of research and discovered 143 manuscripts published between 2011 and 2022. Additionally, 21 manuscripts from between 2000 and 2010 and 3 manuscripts from 1974 to 2000 were referenced for historical reference as the first studies showcasing a certain phenomenon or mechanism. More and more scientists are inclined to believe that environmental factors are responsible for the increased incidence of diabetes. Research results show that higher T1D incidence is associated with vitamin D deficiency, a colder climate, and pollution of the environment, as well as the influence of viral, bacterial, and yeast-like fungi infections. The key viral infections affecting the risk of developing T1DM are rubella virus, mumps virus, Coxsackie virus, cytomegalovirus, and enterovirus. Since 2020, i.e., from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more studies have been looking for a link between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and diabetes development.

The adoption of patient-operated Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) allows the patients to actively participate in their consultation and treatment. The consultation can be divided into three different phases: before, during, and after the meeting. The difference is identified by the activities in preparation (before), the meeting, conducted either physically or in other forms of non-face-to-face interaction (during), and the follow-up activities after the meeting (after). Consultations can be supported by various ICT-based interventions, often referred to as eHealth, mHealth, telehealth, or telemedicine. Nevertheless, the use of ICTs in healthcare settings is often accompanied by security and privacy challenges due to the sensitive nature of health information and the regulatory requirements associated with storing and processing sensitive information. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to map the existing knowledge and identify gaps in research about ICT-based interventions for chronic diseases consultations. The review objective is guided by three research questions: (1) which ICTs are used by people with chronic diseases, health personnel, and others before, during, and after consultations; (2) which type of information is managed by these ICTs; and (3) how are security and privacy issues addressed? METHODS: We performed a literature search in ACM, IEEE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science and included primary studies published between January 2015 and June 2020 that used ICT before, during, and/or after a consultation for chronic diseases. This review presents and discusses the findings from the included publications structured around the three research questions. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Only five studies reported the use of ICTs in all three phases: before, during, and after consultations. The main ICTs identified were smartphone applications, web-based portals, cloud-based infrastructures, and electronic health record systems. Different devices like sensors and wearable devices were used in 23 studies to gather diverse information. Regarding the type of information managed by these ICTs, we identified nine categories: physiological data, treatment information, medical history, consultation media like images or videos, laboratory results, reminders, lifestyle parameters, symptoms, and patient identification. Security issues were addressed in 20 studies, while only eight of the included studies addressed privacy issues. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review highlights the potential for a new model of consultation for patients with chronic diseases. Furthermore, it emphasizes the possibilities for consultations besides physical and remote meetings. The scoping review also revealed a narrow focus on security and privacy. Security issues were more likely to be mentioned in the included publications, although with limited details. Future research should focus more on security and privacy due to the increasing amount of sensitive information gathered and used for consultations.","output":"Information and communication technology-based interventions for chronic diseases consultation: Scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS It is reported that almost one in five women will need some form of pelvic organ prolapse surgery in their lifetime, with anterior wall repair accounting for nearly half of these.

Paravaginal defects are very common in women presenting with cystocele, thus highlighting the importance of paravaginal defect repair for optimal cystocele correction in the majority of cases. Although there are several paravaginal defect repair procedures, some entail complex techniques, whereas others rely on the use of transvaginal mesh, which is currently not permitted in many countries. METHODS In this video article we present a novel trans-obturator native tissue paravaginal defect repair for the management of cystocele.

Nowadays, Covid-19 is considered a serious health problem worldwide. The host cellular environment is the key determinant of pathogen Infectivity. Most respiratory viral infections have a strong association with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Hence, modern RNA alignment algorithms routinely take structural information into account. In order to discover yet unknown RNA families and infer their possible functions, the structural alignment of RNAs is an essential task. This task demands a lot of computational resources, especially for aligning many long sequences, and it therefore requires efficient algorithms that utilize modern hardware when available. A subset of the secondary structures contains overlapping interactions (called pseudoknots), which add additional complexity to the problem and are often ignored in available software. RESULTS: We present the SeqAn-based software LaRA 2 that is significantly faster than comparable software for accurate pairwise and multiple alignments of structured RNA sequences. In contrast to other programs our approach can handle arbitrary pseudoknots. As an improved re-implementation of the LaRA tool for structural alignments, LaRA 2 uses multi-threading and vectorization for parallel execution and a new heuristic for computing a lower boundary of the solution. Our algorithmic improvements yield a program that is up to 130 times faster than the previous version. CONCLUSIONS: With LaRA 2 we provide a tool to analyse large sets of RNA secondary structures in relatively short time, based on structural alignment. The produced alignments can be used to derive structural motifs for the search in genomic databases.","output":"LaRA 2: parallel and vectorized program for sequenceCstructure alignment of RNA sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors represents nowadays a marked improvement in cancer treatment.

We studied 200 patients with RA in clinical remission evaluated with the DAS28. All patients were vaccinated for SARS CoV-2 with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. The value of anti-SARS-CoV 2 Spike RBD IgG antibodies was determined at T1 (3 weeks after first vaccination) and T2 (3 weeks after booster). In addition, patients underwent assessment of lymphocyte subpopulations by flow cytometry analysis before starting the vaccination cycle (T0). Furthermore, the serum antibody levels of 96 health care workers (HCWs) were analyzed for comparison. DAS28 values at T0, T1, and T2 indicated remission or low disease activity in all patients. Levels of anti-SARS CoV-2 IgG at T1 were higher in HCWs than in patients groups: 1562.00 BAU WHO/mL [975.00C1632.00] vs 416.00 BAU WHO/mL [110.00, 1581.00], p <0.001.

In particular, in the current epidemiological situation caused by COVID-19 pandemic, swift and accurate prediction of disease diagnosis with machine learning algorithms could facilitate identification and care of vulnerable clusters of population, such as those having multi-morbidity conditions. In order to build a useful disease diagnosis prediction system, advancement in both data representation and development of machine learning architectures are imperative. First, with respect to data collection and representation, we face severe problems due to multitude of formats and lack of coherency prevalent in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This causes hindrance in extraction of valuable information contained in EHRs. Currently, no universal global data standard has been established. As a useful solution, we develop and publish a Python package to transform public health dataset into an easy to access universal format. This data transformation to an international health data format facilitates researchers to easily combine EHR datasets with clinical datasets of diverse formats. Second, machine learning algorithms that predict multiple disease diagnosis categories simultaneously remain underdeveloped. We propose two novel model architectures in this regard. First, DeepObserver, which uses structured numerical data to predict the diagnosis categories and second, ClinicalBERT_Multi, that incorporates rich information available in clinical notes via natural language processing methods and also provides interpretable visualizations to medical practitioners.

An underdeveloped and underutilized area in microbial forensics is how the host interacts with microorganisms in a way that provides unique signatures for forensic use. For investigative and forensic purposes, an immediate goal is to distinguish a potential victim and innocent person from a perpetrator and to distinguish between a naturally acquired or intentional infection. Two principal methods that are sufficiently developed are characterization of the humoral immune response and identification of vaccine-induced immunity or antibiotics that may be present in a possible perpetrator. The primary aims of a microbial forensics investigation are to identify the biological agent, its source, and the individuals responsible for the event.

In order to control the pandemic, rapid tests for detecting existing infections and assessing virus spread are critical. Approaches to detect viral RNA based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) hold outstanding promise towards greatly simplified and broadly applicable testing methods. RT-LAMP assays appear more robust than qPCR-based methods and only require incubation at a constant temperature, thus eliminating the need for sophisticated instrumentation. Here, we tested a two-color RT-LAMP protocol using clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples and also established a protocol that does not require prior RNA isolation (\\"swab-to-RT-LAMP\\"). Our study is based on several hundred clinical patient samples with a wide range of viral loads, thus allowing, for the first time, to accurately determine the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. We found that RT-LAMP can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 samples with a qPCR threshold cycle number (CT value) of up to 30 in the standard RT-qPCR assay. We used both, either purified RNA or direct pharyngeal swab specimens and showed that RT-LAMP assays have, despite a decreased sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, excellent specificity. We also developed a multiplexed LAMP-sequencing protocol as a validation and backup procedure to double-check the results of visual RT-LAMP assays. LAMP-sequencing is fully scalable and can assess the results of thousands of LAMP reactions in parallel.

METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed using prospectively collected data. Survivors completed questionnaires assessing quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and symptoms (Distress Thermometer, Patient's Disease and Treatment Assessment Form)). Survivors were assessed by a clinical psychologist for the presence of fear of cancer recurrence. Clinical and quality of life variables were evaluated for associations with fear of cancer recurrence. RESULTS Overall, 315 survivors (181 breast cancer, 134 colorectal cancer) were included. In total, 201 survivors (64%) had fear of cancer recurrence according to psychology assessment, and of the 118 that had fear of cancer recurrence severity recorded, 64 (54%) were rated as moderate-severe. On univariate analysis, fear of cancer recurrence was associated with younger age (P < 0.001), higher distress thermometer score (P = 0.001) and poorer overall wellbeing (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, younger age (P = 0.043), being bothered by side effects of treatment (P = 0.023), feeling sad (P = 0.020) and greater worry that their condition will get worse (P = 0.017) were independently associated with fear of cancer recurrence.

We aimed to prospectively study cancer patients and oncology healthcare workers for COVID19 serology. In IgG+ cases, immune profile was determined to portray the pattern of immune response to SARS-CoV2. Methods: Cancer patients on active treatment and healthcare workers were enrolled. During the study period (3/2020-6/2020), demographic data and blood were collected at three time points. Expression of IgG, IgM, and IgA were assessed. In SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ cases and matched negative cases, we performed mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) analysis on the basis of the expression of surface markers. Results: The study included 164 cancer patients on active intravenous treatment and 107 healthcare workers at the cancer center. No symptomatic cases were reported during the study period. Serology analysis revealed four IgG+ patients (2.4%) and two IgG+ healthcare workers (1.9%)-all were asymptomatic. CyTOF analysis demonstrated substantial reduction in myeloid cells in healthcare workers who were SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ compared to those who were SARS-CoV-2 IgG-, whereas in cancer patients, the reduction was relatively milder (&#8776;50% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ cancer patients compared with &#8776;90% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ workers).

We (i) assessed associations between residential green space and cumulative incidence of, and relief from, loneliness over 4 years; and (ii) explored contingencies by age, sex, disability and cohabitation status. METHODS: Multilevel logistic regressions of change in loneliness status in 8049 city-dwellers between 2013 (baseline) and 2017 (follow-up) in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia study. Associations with objectively measured discrete green-space buffers (e.g. parks) (<400, <800 and <1600 m) were adjusted for age, sex, disability, cohabitation status, children and socio-economic variables. Results were translated into absolute risk reductions in loneliness per 10% increase in urban greening. RESULTS: The absolute risk of loneliness rose from 15.9% to 16.9% over the 4 years; however, a 10% increase in urban greening within 1.6 km was associated with lower cumulative incident loneliness [odds ratio (OR) = 0.927, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.862 to 0.996; absolute risk reduction = 0.66%]. Stronger association was observed for people living alone (OR = 0.828, 95% CI = 0.725 to 0.944). In comparison to people with <10% green space, the ORs for cumulative incident loneliness were 0.833 (95% CI = 0.695 to 0.997), 0.790 (95% CI = 0.624 to 1.000) and 0.736 (95% CI = 0.549 to 0.986) for 10C20%, 20C30% and >30% green space, respectively. Compared with the <10% green-space reference group with 13.78% incident loneliness over 4 years and conservatively assuming no impact on incident loneliness, associations translated into absolute risk reductions of 1.70%, 2.26% and 2.72% within populations with 10C20%, 20C30% and >30% green space, respectively. These associations were stronger again for people living alone, with 10C20% (OR = 0.608, 95% CI = 0.448 to 0.826), 20C30% (OR = 0.649, 95% CI = 0.436 to 0.966) and >30% (OR = 0.480, 95% CI = 0.278 to 0.829) green space within 1600 m. No age, sex or disability-related contingencies, associations with green space within 400 or 800 m or relief from loneliness reported at baseline were observed.

In a study conducted in Brazil, we test the relative importance of these explanations by examining whether and how support for social distancing varies according to self-identified political orientation and personal economic vulnerability. Results show that while economic vulnerability does not influence support for social distancing, conservatives are systematically less supportive of these practices than liberals.

METHODS: Medline/Pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. In addition, the records in PROSPERO and Epistemonikos and PEDro were consulted. Systematic reviews of different conditions, populations and contexts, where the intervention to be evaluated is telerehabilitation by physical therapy were included. The outcomes were clinical effectiveness depending on specific condition, functionality, quality of life, satisfaction, adherence and safety. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were carried out by a reviewer with non-independent verification by a second reviewer. The findings are reported qualitatively by tables and figures. RESULTS: Fifty-three systematic reviews were included of which 17 were assessed as having low risk of bias. Fifteen reviews were on cardiorespiratory rehabilitation, 14 on musculoskeletal conditions and 13 on neurorehabilitation. Other 11 reviews addressed other types of conditions and rehabilitation. Thirteen reviews evaluated with low risk of bias showed results in favor of telerehabilitation versus in-person rehabilitation or no-rehabilitation, while 17 reported no differences between the groups. Thirty-five reviews with unclear or high risk of bias showed mixed results. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the contradictory results, telerehabilitation in physical therapy could be comparable to in-person rehabilitation or better than no-rehabilitation for conditions such as osteoarthritis, low back pain, hip and knee replacement, multiple sclerosis, and also in the context of cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation. It is imperative to conduct better quality clinical trials and systematic reviews.

The developed model has two players including interdictor (COVID-19) and fortifier (government). Accordingly, the aim of the first player (COVID-19) is to maximize system costs and causing further damage to the system. The goal of the second player (government) is to minimize the costs of location, routing and allocation due to budget limitations. Design/methodology/approach: The approach of evolutionary games with environmental feedbacks was used to develop the proposed model. Moreover, the game continues until the desired demand is satisfied. The Lagrangian relaxation method was applied to solve the proposed model. Findings: Empirical results illustrate that with increasing demand, the values of the objective functions of the interdictor and fortifier models have increased. Also, with the raising fixed cost of the established depot, the values of the objective functions of the interdictor and fortifier models have raised. In this regard, the number of established depots in the second scenario (COVID-19 wave) is more than the first scenario (normal COVID-19 conditions).

Moreover, in this study, only the information of drivers and experts about transportation costs has been considered. In order to implement the presented solution approach for the real case study, high RAM and CPU hardware facilities and software facilities are required, which are the limitations of the proposed paper. Originality/value: The main contributions of the current research are considering evolutionary games with environmental feedbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and location, routing and allocation of the medical centers to the distribution depots during the COVID-19 outbreak. A real case study is illustrated, where the Lagrangian relaxation method is employed to solve the problem. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"A bi-level mathematical model for logistic management considering the evolutionary game with environmental feedbacks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There is recognition that the overuse of procedures, tests and medications strains the healthcare system financially and can cause unnecessary stress and harm to patients. In recent years, several initiatives have targeted the reduction or elimination of low-value practices in healthcare. Research suggests that passive interventions, such as the publication of guidelines, are often not sufficient to change behaviour and that active change interventions - interventions which actively implement strategies to change practices - are required to effect significant, sustained practice change. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify and characterise studies of active change interventions designed to reduce or eliminate low-value healthcare practices. METHODS We will conduct a review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus databases from inception. Building on previous research, 40 key terms will be used to search literature. The screening process will be conducted separately by two researchers, with discrepancies resolved by a third. Empirical studies of active change interventions used to reduce or eliminate low-value practices will be included. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis will be used to categorise the characteristics of the studies. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required for this study. This scoping review will provide insights into the impact of several characteristics of active change interventions, including the number of interventions (single-faceted or multifaceted) and the level of implementation (individual or organisational). These results can provide guidance and direction for future research in de-implementation. The results will be disseminated through presentations at national and international conferences and the publication of a manuscript.","output":"Active change interventions to de-implement low-value healthcare practices: a scoping review protocol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Recently, considerable efforts have been focused on intensifying the screening process for asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in the Chinese Mainland, especially for up to 10 million citizens living in Wuhan City by nucleic acid testing. However, a high percentage of domestic asymptomatic cases did not develop into symptomatic ones, which is abnormal and has drawn considerable public attention. Here, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 infections in the Chinese Mainland from a statistical perspective, as it is of referential significance for other regions. By conservatively assuming a development time lag from pre-symptomatic (i.e. referring to the infected cases were screened prior to the COVID-19 symptom onset) to symptomatic as an incubation time of 5.2 days, our results indicated that 92.5% of those tested in Wuhan City, China and 95.1% of those tested in the Chinese Mainland should have COVID-19 syndrome onset, which was extremely higher than their corresponding practical percentages of 0.8% and 3.0%, respectively. We propose that a certain false positive rate may exist if large-scale nucleic acid screening tests for asymptomatic cases are conducted in common communities with a low incidence rate. Despite adopting relatively high-sensitivity, high-specificity detection kits, we estimated a very low prevalence of COVID-19 infections, ranging from 10?6 to 10?4 in both Wuhan City and the Chinese Mainland. Thus, the prevalence rate of asymptomatic infections in China had been at a very low level. Further, given the lower prevalence of the infection, close examination of the data for false positive results is necessary to minimize social and economic impacts.","output":"Modeling the Prevalence of Asymptomatic COVID-19 Infections in the Chinese Mainland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to find the impact of COVID-19 on values of Annual Effective Dose Equivalent of the natural Gamma dose rate from Balod, Durg and Bemetara districts of Chhattisgarh (India).

Purpose: To investigate the staging duration and classification of CT images of patients with COVID-19 based on quantitative analysis. Materials and Methods: This is an ambispective observational cohort study based on 125 patients with COVID-19 from Jan 23 to Feb 28, 2020. The stage of CT and pulmonary lesion size were quantitatively analyzed. The categorical regression analysis based on optimal scale (CATREG) was performed to evaluate the association of CT score, age, and gender with the clinical type. Results: The CT images of 125 patients with COVID-19 (50.13 plus-or-minus 16.91 years, 66 women) were analyzed in this study. Except for pre-early stage, the duration of early, progression-consolidation, and dissipation stage of CT images was 3.40 plus-or-minus 2.31, 10.07 plus-or-minus 4.91, and 20.60 plus-or-minus 7.64 days, respectively. The median CT score was 5.00 (2.00-8.50) during the first 30 days, which reached a peak on the 11th day. Significant differences were found between the median CT scores of different clinical types (P less than 0.05).

We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity.

Like training programs nationwide, telemedicine training and assessment had not been systematically incorporated into our residency. In response, a scheduled Internal Medicine (IM) Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) was adapted to a remote modality to become virtual care-focused learning experience for trainees and to provide valuable feedback to educators. Methods: Standardized Patients (SPs) rated residents on their communication (including information gathering, relationship development and patient education), patient activation and satisfaction, and telemedicine skills. Analyses included a comparison of domain scores for residents who participated in both the 2020 remote and 2019 in-person OSCEs, and a review of written resident comments about the virtual OSCE. Results: During 2020's video visit OSCE (VOSCE), residents (n = 23) excelled at nonverbal communication but struggled with virtual physical exams and information gathering. In debrief, residents expressed substantial interest in more opportunity to practice virtual visit skills going forward. In comparing scores of the virtual care (2020) OSCE with the in-person (2019) version, the small subset of residents who participated in both assessments (n = 9) performed similarly on communication skills, patient satisfaction and activation. Patient education scores were significantly lower during the virtual care OSCE (P =.008). Conclusion: Our reformulated OSCE accomplished 3 goals including;(1) physically distancing residents from SPs per COVID regulations, (2) providing residents with the opportunity to practice critical virtual visit skills, and (3) alerting our educators to curricular improvement areas.

However, selection for mechanical thrombectomy in this patient group has only been performed using specialized image processing platforms, which are not widely available. We hypothesized that quantitative lesion water uptake calculated in acute stroke computed tomography (CT) may serve as imaging biomarker to estimate ischemic lesion progression and predict clinical outcome in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy in the extended time window. METHODS All patients with ischemic anterior circulation stroke presenting within 4.5 to 24 hours after symptom onset who received initial multimodal CT between August 2014 and March 2020 and underwent mechanical thrombectomy were analyzed. Quantitative lesion net water uptake was calculated from the admission CT. Prediction of clinical outcome was assessed using univariable receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS One hundred two patients met the inclusion criteria. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, net water uptake (odds ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64-0.95], P=0.01), age (odds ratio, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88-0.99]; P=0.02), and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (odds ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.79-0.99], P=0.03) were significantly and independently associated with favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 1), adjusted for degree of recanalization and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. A multivariable predictive model including the above parameters yielded the highest diagnostic ability in the classification of functional outcome, with an area under the curve of 0.88 (sensitivity 92.3%, specificity 82.9%).

Fixed values can be used for the sensitivity and specificity of the tests, or existing methods for belief elicitation can be used to include uncertainty in these values.

In this prospective observational cohort study, we analyzed serological immune responses in 190 individuals before, 3 weeks after 1(st) and 3 weeks after 2(nd) vaccination with BNT162b2. Unvaccinated COVID-19-convalescent subjects served as reference. End points comprised serum anti-spike IgG and IgA titers as well as neutralization capacities against unmutated and mutated SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains including B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. We found that antibody titers and neutralization capacities up to 3 weeks after 2(nd) vaccination with BNT162b2 were significantly higher in COVID-19-convalescent as compared to COVID-19-naive vaccinees. Moreover, pre-vaccination anti-NCP IgG titers, but not age or gender, had a high impact on the strength and kinetics of post-vaccination neutralization capacity development. Most importantly, BNT162b2-induced neutralization capacity was cross-reactive with VOCs. In contrast to unvaccinated convalescents, vaccinated convalescent individuals of all ages acquired strong neutralizing capacities against current VOCs. The present study suggests that COVID-19-convalescent individuals with a broad age range between 18 and 98 years benefit from BNT162b2 vaccination by developing strong and broad neutralizing immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 including current VOCs.","output":"BNT162b2 Vaccination Elicits Strong Serological Immune Responses Against SARS-CoV-2 Including Variants of Concern in Elderly Convalescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the first study focused on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in different freshwater environments of an urban setting.

Incorrectly doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) increases the risk of transmission. A cheap, single-use variation of the face shield invented by a Singaporean team, SG Shield, aims to reduce this risk. This manikin study aimed to study the efficacy of the SG Shield in combination with standard PPE. METHODS A person attired in full PPE whose face and chest was lined with grid paper stood in front of an airway manikin in an enclosed room. A small latex balloon containing ultraviolet fluorescent dye was placed in the oral cavity of the manikin and inflated until explosion to simulate a cough. Three study groups were tested: (a) control (no shield), (b) face shield and (c) SG Shield. The primary outcome was droplet dispersion, determined quantitatively by calculating the proportion of grid paper wall squares stained with fluorescent dye. The secondary outcome was the severity of provider contamination. RESULTS The SG Shield significantly reduced droplet dispersion to 0% compared to the controls (99.0%, p = 0.001). The face shield also significantly reduced droplet contamination but to a lesser extent (80.0%) compared to the control group (p = 0.001). Although the qualitative severity of droplet contamination was significantly lower in both groups compared to the controls, the face shield group had more contamination of the provider's head and neck.

RESULTS Frequencies were compared between 11 subpopulations including Armani, Balouch, Bandari, Turk, Turkaman, Arab, Fars, Kurd, Gilaki, Lor and Mazani. In total, 17 HLA-A alleles were detected, one of which (HLA-A*74) was present only among Lors. HLA-A*23 and -A*26 were the most frequent HLA-A alleles among Armanis. HLA-A*23 was also common among Turkamans. HLA-A*11 and -A*26 were most frequent among the Balouch subpopulation. The former allele was also frequent among Bandaris. HLA-A*02 was identified as the most common HLA-A allele among Turk, Arab and Fars subpopulations. HLA-A*30 were strongly enriched among Gilakis. A total of 31 HLA-B alleles were detected across the target population. While all alleles were present among Fars subgroup, Armanis and Turkamans had the lowest degree of diversity among the alleles examined. Moreover, HLA-B*35 and B*49 alleles were strongly enriched among Armanis and Turkamans, respectively. A total of 13 HLA-C alleles were identified across the population, all of which were present in the Fars subpopulation.

Concerns exist that hospitals that care for hip fracture patients may be penalized in BPCI. The purpose of this study is to compare the episode-of-care (EOC) costs of hip fracture patients to elective THA patients. METHODS We reviewed a consecutive series of 4096 THA patients from 2015 to 2018. Patients were grouped into elective THA (n = 3686), fracture THA (n = 176), and hemiarthroplasty (n = 274). Using CMS claims data, we compared EOC costs, postacute care costs, and performance against the target price between the groups. To control for confounding variables, we performed a multivariate analysis to identify the effect of hip fracture diagnosis on costs. RESULTS Elective THA patients had lower EOC ($18,200 vs $42,605 vs $38,371; P < .001) and postacute care costs ($4477 vs $28,093 vs $23,217; P < .001) than both hemiarthroplasty and THA for fracture. Patients undergoing arthroplasty for fracture lost an average of $23,122 (vs $1648 profit for elective THA; P < .001) with 91% of cases exceeding the target price (vs 20% for elective THA; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, patients undergoing arthroplasty for fracture had higher EOC costs by $19,492 (P < .001). CONCLUSION Patients undergoing arthroplasty for fracture cost over twice as much as elective THA patients.

Amino acid changes in the RBD have been implicated with increased infectivity and potential for immune evasion. Reliably predicting the effect of amino acid changes in the ability of the RBD to interact more strongly with the hACE2 receptor can help assess the public health implications and the potential for spillover and adaptation into other animals. Here, we introduce a two-step framework that first relies on 48 independent 4-ns molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of RBD-hACE2 variants to collect binding energy terms decomposed into Coulombic, covalent, van der Waals, lipophilic, generalized Born electrostatic solvation, hydrogen-bonding, - packing and self-contact correction terms. The second step implements a neural network to classify and quantitatively predict binding affinity using the decomposed energy terms as descriptors. The computational base achieves an accuracy of 82.2% in terms of correctly classifying single amino-acid substitution variants of the RBD as worsening or improving binding affinity for hACE2 and a correlation coefficient r of 0.69 between predicted and experimentally calculated binding affinities. Both metrics are calculated using a 5-fold cross validation test. Our method thus sets up a framework for effectively screening binding affinity change with unknown single and multiple amino-acid changes. This can be a very valuable tool to predict host adaptation and zoonotic spillover of current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Computational prediction of the effect of amino acid changes on the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the great potential, there has been a lack of progress in the development of sharable and scalable tools for digital mental health due to difficulty in reproducibility and clinical application.

Subsequently, changes in the expression of genes encoding egg white proteins were confirmed in the oviduct tissue. The levels of MUC5B, ORM1, RTBDN, and TENP mRNA were significantly high in the oviduct, and the genes were repressed in the regression phase, whereas these were expressed in the recrudescence phase, particularly in the luminal epithelium and glandular epithelium of the oviduct, during molting.

Our results revealed a distinct oropharyngeal microbiota composition in the COVID-19 patients, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Veillonella and Megasphaera and depletion of Pseudopropionibacterium, Rothia, and Streptococcus. Based on the relative abundance of the oropharyngeal microbiome, we built a microbial classifier to distinguish COVID-19 patients from flu patients and healthy controls with an AUC of 0.889, in which Veillonella was identified as the most prominent biomarker for COVID-19 group. Several members of the genus Veillonella, especially Veillonella parvula which was highly enriched in the oropharynx of our COVID-19 patients, were also overrepresented in the BALF of COVID-19 patients, indicating that the oral cavity acts as a natural reservoir for pathogens to induce co-infections in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. We also found the increased ratios of Klebsiella sp., Acinetobacter sp., and Serratia sp. were correlated with both disease severity and elevated systemic inflammation markers (neutrophilClymphocyte ratio, NLR), suggesting that these oropharynx microbiota alterations may impact COVID-19 severity by influencing the inflammatory response. Moreover, the oropharyngeal microbiome of COVID-19 patients exhibited a significant enrichment in amino acid metabolism and xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism. In addition, all 26 drug classes of antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in the COVID-19 group, and were significantly enriched in critical cases.

Approximately 220 people were killed and around 7,000 were injured, of which 12% were hospitalized. Despite being weakened by economic crisis and increasing numbers of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, the national health care system responded promptly. Within a day, international health care assistance in the form of International Emergency Medical Teams (I-EMTs) started arriving. Previous studies have found that I-EMTs have arrived late and have not been adapted to the context and dominating health care needs. The aim of this study was to document the organization, type, activity, and timing of I-EMTs deployed to Beirut and to discuss their relevance in relation to medical needs. METHODS Data on all deployed I-EMTs were retrieved from all available sources, including internet searches, I-EMT contacts, and from the World Health Organization (WHO) EMT coordination cell (EMT CC) in Lebanon. The WHO EMT classification was used to categorize deployed teams. Information on characteristics, timing, and activities was retrieved and systematically assessed. RESULTS Nine I-EMTs were deployed to Beirut following the explosion. Five were equivalent to EMT Type 2 (field hospitals), out of which three were military. The first EMT Type 2 arrived within 24 hours, while the last EMT set up one month after the explosion. Four civilian I-EMTs provided non-clinical support as EMT Specialized Care Teams. A majority of the I-EMTs were focused on trauma care. Three of the four I-EMT Specialized Care Teams were rapidly re-tasked to support COVID-19 care in public hospitals. CONCLUSION A majority of the deployed I-EMT Type 2 were military and focused on trauma care rather than the normal burden of disease including COVID-19. Re-tasking of EMTs requires flexible EMTs. To be better adapted, the I-EMT response should be guided by a systematic assessment of both health care capacities in the affected country as well as the varying health effects of hazards before deployment.","output":"The Response by International Emergency Medical Teams Following the Beirut Harbor Explosion in 2020 - Who Were They, When Did They Arrive, What Did They Do, and Were They Needed?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pollution and pollution-related consequences have a historic reputation, being even considered as chief causative agents behind several tragedies linked to a huge impact on health and environment.

We conclude that both are likely to play important roles in the future, and simultaneously serve as competitors and complements. We anticipate that 5G will remain the preferred technology for wide-area coverage, while Wi-Fi 6 will remain the preferred technology for indoor use, thanks to its much lower deployment costs.

Although multiple barriers restrict the flow of both bacteria and genes, pathogens recurrently acquire new resistance factors from other species, thereby reducing our ability to prevent and treat bacterial infections. Evolutionary events that lead to the emergence of new resistance factors in pathogens are rare and challenging to predict, but may be associated with vast ramifications. Transmission events of already widespread resistant strains are, on the other hand, common, quantifiable and more predictable, but the consequences of each event are limited. Quantifying the pathways and identifying the drivers of and bottlenecks for environmental evolution and transmission of antibiotic resistance are key components to understand and manage the resistance crisis as a whole. In this Review, we present our current understanding of the roles of the environment, including antibiotic pollution, in resistance evolution, in transmission and as a mere reflection of the regional antibiotic resistance situation in the clinic.

Twelve patients with syphilis but non-NS (NNS) were also included. We measured the CSF levels of interleukin- (IL-) 1?, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-21, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) &#945;; the CSF levels of the microglial activation marker soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2); and the CSF levels of the neuronal injury marker neurofilament light proteins (NFL) using the human cytokine multiplex assay or ELISA. Of the measured cytokines in the CSF, only IL-10 levels were significantly increased in NS patients compared to NNS patients (p < 0.001). In a subgroup analysis, the CSF levels of IL-10 were significantly elevated in SNS patients compared to ANS and NNS patients (p = 0.024 and p < 0.001, respectively). The CSF IL-10 levels had a significant correlation with the markers of microglial activation and neuronal injury, and they also correlated with CSF rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer, CSF white blood cell (WBC) count, and CSF protein concentration.

This volunteer study assessed the feasibility of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with and without DIBH for respiratory motion management during radiation treatment with an MR-linear accelerator (MR-linac). METHODS AND MATERIALS: MR imaging safety was first addressed by placing the CPAP device in an MR-safe closet and configuring a tube circuit via waveguide to the magnet bore. Reproducibility and linearity of the final configuration were assessed. Six healthy volunteers underwent thoracic imaging in a 0.35T MR-linac, with one free breathing (FB) and 2 DIBH acquisitions being obtained at 5 pressures from 0 to 15 cm-H(2)O. Lung and heart volumes and positions were recorded; repeatability was assessed by comparing 2 consecutive DIBH scans. Blinded reviewers graded images for motion artifact using a 3-point grading scale. Participants completed comfort and perception surveys before and after imaging sessions. RESULTS: Compared with FB alone, FB-10, FB-12, and FB-15 cm H(2)O significantly increased lung volumes (+23%, +34%, +44%; all P <.05) and inferiorly displaced the heart (0.86 cm, 0.96 cm, 1.18 cm; all P < . 05). Lung volumes were significantly greater with DIBH-0 cm H(2)O compared with FB-15 cm H(2)O (+105% vs +44%, P = .01), and DIBH-15 cm H(2)O yielded additional volume increase (+131% vs +105%, P = .01). Adding CPAP to DIBH decreased lung volume differences between consecutive breath holds (correlation coefficient 0.97 at 15 cm H(2)O vs 0.00 at 0 cm H(2)O). The addition of 15 cm H(2)O CPAP reduced artifact scores (P = .03) compared with FB; all DIBH images (0-15 cm H(2)O) had less artifact (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the feasibility of integrating CPAP in an MR-linac environment in healthy volunteers. Extending this work to a larger patient cohort is warranted to further establish the role of CPAP as an alternative and concurrent approach to DIBH in MR-guided radiation therapy.","output":"Application of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Thoracic Respiratory Motion Management: An Assessment in a Magnetic Resonance ImagingCGuided Radiation Therapy Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The integrative environment-health sciences including One Health, Conservation Medicine, EcoHealth and Planetary Health embody the transdisciplinary synthesis needed to understand the multitude of factors that underpin emerging infections and their management.

The aim of this study was to evaluate surgical outcomes of standard intraperitoneal onlay mesh (sIPOM) versus fascial defect closure with intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM-Plus) for large incisional hernia repair. METHODS Of 49 patients who underwent laparoscopic incisional hernia repair between November 2005 and December 2016, 26 cases with large incisional hernia (transverse diameter 10 cm) were examined to compare surgical outcomes between sIPOM (n = 12) and IPOM-Plus (n = 14). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and Fisher's exact test. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS We compared sIPOM with IPOM-Plus for similar hernia types during median follow-up periods of 53 and 21 months, respectively. The operation time was 150 min for sIPOM and 148 min for IPOM-Plus (P = 0.6220). Early postoperative complications including seroma formation were observed in four sIPOM patients (33%) and three IPOM-Plus patients (21%) (P = 0.6652). Significantly more mesh bulged with sIPOM than with IPOM-Plus (50% vs 0%; P = 0.0082). Chronic pain lasting 3 months after the operation was found in two cases of IPOM-Plus (14%), but this was not statistically significant. Postoperative hospital stay was longer for sIPOM patients than for IPOM-Plus patients. Only one recurrence was observed in the sIPOM group (8%), but this was not statistically significant.

In the Swedish beef cattle population however, no investigations have yet been performed regarding the prevalence and geographical distribution of BCV and BRSV. A cross-sectional serological survey for BCV and BRSV was carried out in Swedish beef cattle to explore any geographical patterns of these infections. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 2,763 animals located in 2,137 herds and analyzed for presence of antibodies to BCV and BRSV. Moran's I was calculated to assess spatial autocorrelation, and identification of geographical cluster was performed using spatial scan statistics. RESULTS: Animals detected positive to BCV or BRSV were predominately located in the central-western and some southern parts of Sweden. Moran's I indicated global spatial autocorrelation. BCV and BRSV appeared to be spatially related: two areas in southern Sweden (Skaraborg and Sk?ne) had a significantly higher prevalence of BCV (72.5 and 65.5% respectively); almost the same two areas were identified as being high-prevalence clusters for BRSV (69.2 and 66.8% respectively).

We aimed to conduct a systematic review to assess the benefits and harms of physical activity interventions for men's bone health. METHODS We used standard methods and searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (duration, 6 months) published in all languages across multiple databases and trial registries. The last search was conducted on July 22, 2020. RESULTS We included 11 studies (14 publications), resulting in a sample of N=723 men (range, 17-132 participants). We found low-certainty evidence that physical activity has little influence on the areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the total hip (5 RCTs, N=324; mean difference [MD], 0.03 [95 confidence interval (CI), 0.01 to 0.05]) and little or no influence on the aBMD at the femoral neck (3 RCTs, N=186; MD, 0.00 [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.04]), lumbar spine (3 RCTs; N=213; MD, 0.05 [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11]), and whole body (4 RCTs, N=203; MD, -0.00 [95% CI, -0.03 to 0.02]).

We conducted this analysis to better understand tocilizumab treatment for COVID-19 patients. MAIN TEXT: We searched major databases for manuscripts reporting the effects of tocilizumab on COVID-19 patients. A total of 25 publications were analyzed with Revman 5.3 and R for the meta-analysis. Significant better clinical outcomes were found in the tocilizumab treatment group when compared to the standard care group [odds ratio (OR) = 0.70, 95% confidential interval (C): 0.54C0.90, P = 0.007]. Tocilizumab treatment showed a stronger correlation with good prognosis among COVID-19 patients that needed mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.37C0.93, P = 0.02). Among stratified analyses, reduction of overall mortality correlates with tocilizumab treatment in patients less than 65 years old (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.60C0.77, P < 0.00001), and with intensive care unit patients (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.55C0.70, P < 0.00001). Pooled estimates of hazard ratio showed that tocilizumab treatment predicts better overall survival in COVID-19 patients (HR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24C0.84, P = 0.01), especially in severe cases (HR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.49C0.68, P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that tocilizumab treatment is associated with a lower risk of mortality and mechanical ventilation requirement among COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab may have substantial effectiveness in reducing mortality among COVID-19 patients, especially among critical cases. This systematic review provides an up-to-date evidence of potential therapeutic role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 management.

Due to rapid climatic warming and enhanced human development, the boreal region may have begun transitioning from a net C sink to a net source. This raises serious concern that old biogenic soil C can be re-introduced into the modern C cycle in near future.

However, case definitions do not include assessments of disease severity, which may be impacted by prior vaccination. Objective: To measure how the severity of respiratory disease changed among inpatients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and to measure the impact of vaccination status on these trends, in order to evaluate the accuracy of the metric of hospitalization plus a positive SARS-CoV-2 test for tracking pandemic severity. Design: Retrospective cohort of inpatients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. All data were obtained from electronic health records. Setting: Multi-center, nationwide study conducted in the healthcare system of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from March 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021. Participants: All VA patients admitted to a VA hospital with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within the 14-days prior to admission or during the hospital admission. Main Outcome: Moderate-to-severe COVID-19 disease, defined by use of any supplemental oxygen or documented SpO2 <94%, during an inpatient hospitalization between one day before and two weeks after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status at the time of hospitalization. Patients were regarded as fully vaccinated starting 14 days after receiving the second of a 2-dose regimen or 14 days after receipt of a single-dose vaccine. Results: Among 47,742 admissions in 38,508 unique patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, N=28,731 met the criteria for moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The proportion with moderate-to-severe disease prior to widespread vaccine availability was 64.0% (95% CI, 63.1-64.9%) versus 52.0% in the later period (95% CI, 50.9-53.2%), p-value for non-constant effect, <0.001. Disease severity in the vaccine era among hospitalized patients was lower among both unvaccinated (55.0%, 95% CI, 53.7-56.4%) and vaccinated patients (42.6%, 95% CI, 40.6-44.8%). Conclusions: and Relevance : The proportion of hospitalizations that are due to severe COVID-19 has changed with vaccine availability, thus, increasing proportions of mild and asymptomatic cases are included in hospitalization reporting metrics. The addition of simple measures of disease severity to the case definition of a SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization is a straightforward and objective change that should improve the value of the metric for tracking SARS-CoV-2 disease burden.","output":"The COVID-19 Hospitalization Metric in the Pre- and Post-vaccination Eras as a Measure of Pandemic Severity: A Retrospective, Nationwide Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I.AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has demonstrated that accurate forecasts of infection and mortality rates are essential for informing healthcare resource allocation, designing countermeasures, implementing public health policies, and increasing public awareness.

The replication inhibitors are under investigation due to the importance of prevention of the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In coronavirus replication, the virus enters the cell by endocytosis. After uncoating, the positive-strand RNA is translated to produce the non-structural protein (NCP) precursors. These precursors are cleaved and form mature, functional helicase and RNA polymerase. A replication-transcription complex (RTC) is then formed. Targeting the various stages of this process may be useful in preventing the spread of this epidemic. According to the similarity of the COVID-19 replication to the other single-stranded RNA viruses such as HCV, Ebola Virus, and Marburg, the best way to prevent the spread of infection is the viral genome replication targeting with specific drugs after exposure to the virus.

A total of 11% and 8% of pts experienced clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression (HADS 11), whereas 15% were borderline (HADS score 8-10). Two thirds of pts (67%) thought that the vaccination may reduce the infection risks and 56% felt safer. Overall, 59% of pts did not believe that vaccine-related side effects may interfere with the oncological treatment and 49% considered the vaccination safe. Conclusions: Most cancer pts undergoing COVID-19 vaccination presented mild levels of anxiety, depression and distress. Oncological pts undergoing vaccination felt safe and judged the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination to overweight the potential side effects. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors.

Drug repurposing is a feasible method for emergency treatment. As lowCmolecular-weight drugs have high potential to completely match interactions with essential SARS-CoV-2 targets, we propose a strategy to identify such drugs using the fragment-based approach. Herein, using ligand- and protein-observed fragment screening approaches, we identified niacin and hit 1 binding to the catalytic pocket of the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), thereby modestly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of Mpro. Chemical shift perturbations induced by niacin and hit 1 indicate a partial overlap of their binding sites, i.e., the catalytic pocket of Mpro may accommodate derivatives with large molecular sizes. Therefore, we searched for drugs containing niacin or hit 1 pharmacophores and identified carmofur, bendamustine, triclabendazole, and emedastine; these drugs are highly capable of inhibiting protease activity. Our study demonstrates that the fragment-based approach is a feasible strategy for identifying lowCmolecular-weight drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 and other potential targets lacking specific drugs.","output":"Repurposing lowCmolecular-weight drugs against the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spreading of epidemics in complex networks has been a subject of renewed interest of several scientific branches In this regard, we have focused our attention on the study of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, within a Monte Carlo numerical simulation approach, representing the spreading of epidemics in a clustered homophilic network The competition between infection and recovery that drives the system either to an absorbing or to an active phase is analyzed We estimate the static critical exponents ¨M, 1M and èM, through finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis of the order parameter  and its fluctuations, showing that they differ from those associated with the contact process on a scale-free network, as well as those predicted by the heterogeneous mean-field theory","output":"Critical properties of the SIS model on the clustered homophilic network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Procalcitonin expression is thought to be stimulated by bacteria and suppressed by viruses via interferon signalling. Consequently, during respiratory viral illness, clinicians often interpret elevated procalcitonin as evidence of bacterial coinfection, prompting antibiotic administration. We sought to evaluate the validity of this practice and the underlying assumption that viral infection inhibits procalcitonin synthesis. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalised with pure viral infection (n=2075) versus bacterial coinfection (n=179). The ability of procalcitonin to distinguish these groups was assessed. In addition, procalcitonin and interferon gene expression were evaluated in murine and cellular models of influenza infection. RESULTS Patients with bacterial coinfection had higher procalcitonin than those with pure viral infection, but also more severe disease and higher mortality (p<0.001). After matching for severity, the specificity of procalcitonin for bacterial coinfection dropped substantially, from 72% to 61%. In fact, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that procalcitonin was a better indicator of multiple indices of severity (eg, organ failures and mortality) than of coinfection. Accordingly, patients with severe viral infection had elevated procalcitonin. In murine and cellular models of influenza infection, procalcitonin was also elevated despite bacteriologic sterility and correlated with markers of severity. Interferon signalling did not abrogate procalcitonin synthesis. DISCUSSION These studies reveal that procalcitonin rises during pure viral infection in proportion to disease severity and is not suppressed by interferon signalling, in contrast to prior models of procalcitonin regulation. Applied clinically, our data suggest that procalcitonin represents a better indicator of disease severity than bacterial coinfection during viral respiratory infection.","output":"Severe respiratory viral infection induces procalcitonin in the absence of bacterial pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telecom industry is significantly evolving all over the globe than ever.

The frequency of cardiac injury remains highly uncertain and confounded in current publications; myocarditis is one of several mechanisms that have been proposed. METHODS: We prospectively assessed patients with myocardial injury hospitalized for COVID-19 using transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and endomyocardial biopsy. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury were included in this study. Echocardiography revealed normal to mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 52.5% (46.5%-60.5%) but moderately to severely reduced left ventricular global longitudinal strain of -11.2% (-7.6% to -15.1%). Cardiac magnetic resonance showed any myocardial tissue injury defined by elevated T1, extracellular volume, or late gadolinium enhancement with a nonischemic pattern in 16 patients (83.3%). Seven patients (38.9%) demonstrated myocardial edema in addition to tissue injury fulfilling the Lake-Louise criteria for myocarditis. Combining cardiac magnetic resonance with speckle tracking echocardiography demonstrated functional or morphological cardiac changes in 100% of investigated patients. Endomyocardial biopsy was conducted in 5 patients and revealed enhanced macrophage numbers in all 5 patients in addition to lymphocytic myocarditis in 1 patient. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any biopsy by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Finally, follow-up measurements of left ventricular global longitudinal strain revealed significant improvement after a median of 52.0 days (-11.2% [-9.2% to -14.7%] versus -15.6% [-12.5% to -19.6%] at follow-up; P=0.041).

We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity.

However, these studies comprised of an estimate rather than a broad analysis of exact numbers. In this study, we planned to investigate whether the pandemic really resulted in an increase in facial paralysis cases admitted to the hospital by evaluating the cases who applied to our hospital due to facial paralysis in the COVID-19 pandemic year and in the previous 4 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who applied to our hospital due to facial paralysis between March 2016-February 2017 (Group 1), between March 2017-February 2018 (Group 2), between March 2018-February 2019 (Group 3), between March 2019-February 2020 (Group 4), and between March 2020-February 2021 (Group 5) were investigated and detailed data were noted.

In parallel to the growing pandemic, alcohol sales grew in the USA, with people stockpiling alcohol. Alcohol-induced blackouts are one particularly concerning consequence of heavy drinking, and the extent to which blackout prevalence may change in the context of a pandemic is unknown. The purpose of the current study is to describe the prevalence of publicly available tweets in the USA referencing alcohol-induced blackouts prior to and during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used Crimson Hexagon's ForSight tool to access all original English tweets written in the USA that referenced alcohol-related blackouts in 2019 and 2020. Using infoveillance methods, we tracked changes in the number and proportion of tweets about blackouts. RESULTS: More alcohol-related blackout tweets were written between 13 March and 24 April in 2020 than 2019. In addition, a greater proportion of all tweets referenced blackouts in 2020 than in 2019. In the period prior to the 'stay at home' orders (January to mid-March), the proportion of blackout tweets were higher in 2020 than 2019. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that references to high-risk drinking persist during the pandemic despite restrictions on large social gatherings. Given that the internet is a common source of information for COVID-19, the frequent posting about blackouts during this period might normalise the behaviour. This is concerning because alcohol use increases susceptibility to COVID-19, and alcohol-related mortality can further tax hospital resources.","output":"Describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol-induced blackout tweets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anorectal malignant melanoma(AMM)is a relatively rare disease with an extremely poor prognosis.

There is a concerted effort within the global scientifi c community to identify (and thereby potentially mitigate) the possible modes of transmission through which the virus spreads throughout populations. OBJECTIVE Summarize the ways in which SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted and provide scientifi c support for the prevention and control of COVID-19. EVIDENCE AQUISITION We conducted an extensive literature search using electronic databases for scientifi c articles addressing SARSCoV-2 transmission published from December 28, 2019 through July 31, 2020. We retrieved 805 articles, but only 302 were included and discussed in this review. The report captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) viral survival, 2) transmission period and transmissibility, and 3) routes of viral spread. DEVELOPMENT Currently available evidence indicates that SARSCoV-2 seems to have variable stability in different environments and is very sensitive to oxidants, such as chlorine. Temperature and humidity are important factors infl uencing viral survival and transmission. SARSCoV-2 may be transmitted from person to person through several different routes. The basic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets, or via indirect contact. Aerosolized transmission is likely the dominant route for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in healthcare facilities. Although SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in non-respiratory specimens, including stool, blood and breast milk, their role in transmission remains uncertain. A complicating factor in disease control is viral transmission by asymptomatic individuals and through what would otherwise be understood as innocuous human activities.

Data from 26,580 UK adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed from 12/4/2020 15/5/2020. Regression models were used to identify predictors of coping styles (problem focused, emotion-focused, avoidant, and socially-supported): model 1 included demographic and socio-economic variables, model 2 additionally included psychosocial factors, and model 3 further included experience of specific adverse worries or events. The demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial predictors of coping align with usual predictors of coping styles not occurring during a pandemic. However, even when controlling for the wide range of these previously known predictors specific adversities were associated with use of specific strategies. Experience of worries about finances, basic needs, and events related to Covid-19 were associated with a range of strategies, while experience of financial adversities was associated with problem-focused, emotion-focused and avoidant coping. There were no associations between coping styles and experiencing challenges in meeting basic needs, but Covid-19 related adversities were associated with a lower use of socially-supported coping.This paper demonstrates that there are not only demographic and social predictors of coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic, but specific adversities are related to the ways that adults cope.

Regression analyses revealed that although psychological distress and maladaptive emotion regulation tendencies (worry, suppression) were significantly correlated with burnout, only tendency to worry and depression levels predicted burnout in a stepwise linear regression model. These findings highlight the role of maladaptive coping strategies, specifically worry, in job burnout among healthcare workers, and might have implications for both the assessment and treatment of healthcare workers.

Factors predicting anxiety symptoms were age, marital status, income level, educational level, and Cantonese fluency. Older participants, married, have higher income and education, and are more fluent in Cantonese were less likely to experience anxiety than their counterparts. Factors predicting depression symptoms were age, marital status, English fluency, and Cantonese fluency. Older participants, married, and more fluent in English and Cantonese were less likely to experience depression than their counterparts.

European research on anxiety and stress among hospital workers during the pandemic is limited. This study aimed to describe the anxiety levels of Finnish hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The multidimensional, cross-sectional survey was distributed to all hospital staff working at two Finnish specialized medical care centres in the spring of 2020 (n = 1,995). The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale was used to measure the workers' anxiety. RESULTS: The total mean GAD-7 score was 4.88, indicating normal anxiety levels. However, 30% (n = 1,079) of the respondents had mild, 10% (n = 194) moderate and 5% (n = 88) severe anxiety. Key risk factors were young age, working in a university hospital, problems in cooperation between co-workers, difficulty concentrating at work, a health-threatening physical and psychological workload, and a fear of being infected at work. CONCLUSION: Hospital staff experienced a variety of work-related stress and anxiety issues that should be visible to hospital administrators and policymakers alike. The anxiety is independent of whether the worker is directly involved in caring for or in any way coming into contact with COVID-19 patients. Key message Fifty-five percent of hospital staff have normal anxiety levels. The remaining workers may need targeted support interventions, and a smaller proportion (15%) are in danger of developing longer-term problems affecting their well-being. The anxiety experienced by hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than that of the population on average. If the pandemic continues, the well-being of hospital staff may be widely threatened. Despite the different geographical locations and COVID-19 situations, hospital workers in Finland and China had similar anxiety levels. The anxiety is independent of whether staff are working in the front line of managing the COVID-19 pandemic or of the number of covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital. The hospital workers felt anxiety because they were facing a new situation which causes changes in their work and daily routine. Health care employers should engage in long-term follow-up as regards the personnel's recovery from the burden caused by the pandemic and from work in general. It is necessary to make easily attainable, flexibly delivered and cost-effective treatment interventions for anxiety available to hospital staff.","output":"COVID-19: anxiety among hospital staff and associated factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If we focus our attention on seven main features of COVID-19 infection (heterogeneity, fragility, lack of effective treatments and vaccines, \\"miraculous cures\\", psychological suffering, deprivation, and globalization), we may establish parallelism with the challenges faced in the steep road to the understanding and treatment of neoplastic diseases. How the similarities between these two conditions can help us cope with the emergency effort represented by the management of cancer patients in the COVID-19 era, today and in the future? In a manner similar to the Cancer Moonshot initiative in the United States, we can hypothesize a multinational moonshot project towards the management of cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we believe that the main road to elaborate meaningful scientific evidence is represented by the collection of all the data on COVID-19 and cancer comorbidity that are and will become available in cancer centers, coupled with the design of large clinical studies. To address this goal, it is essential to identify the entity that can produce this scientific evidences and the potentially most successful research strategy to undertake. The largest Italian organization for cancer research, Alliance Against Cancer (Alleanza Contro il Cancro, ACC), is called to play a scientific leadership in addressing these challenges, which requires the coordination of oncology teams at regional, national, and international levels.

An understanding of risk factors associated with maternal syphilis infection can guide prevention of congenital syphilis through prenatal diagnosis and treatment. We aimed to describe factors associated with maternal syphilis and congenital syphilis at a public medical center in Chicago, Illinois. Methods Maternal syphilis diagnoses were identified using a database for local health department reporting. Medical records were reviewed for infant congenital syphilis diagnoses, sociodemographic information, medical history, and other behavioral factors. Maternal characteristics associated with congenital syphilis were assessed using logistic regression. Results Of 106 maternal syphilis diagnoses between 2014 and 2018, 76 (72%) had a known pregnancy outcome; of these, 8 (11%) delivered an infant with congenital syphilis. Women with psychiatric illness and noninjection substance use each had a >5-fold increased odds of having an infant with congenital syphilis. Cases with congenital syphilis were more likely to have late or scant prenatal care and initiated treatment nearly 3 months later in pregnancy. None were human immunodeficiency virus positive or reported incarceration, intravenous substance use, sex work, or having sex with men who have sex with men. Conclusions Maternal psychiatric illness and substance use may have complicated prenatal care and delayed syphilis treatment, describing a population in need of public health intervention. Women experiencing such barriers to care may benefit from closer follow-up after a prenatal syphilis diagnosis to prevent congenital transmission.","output":"Characteristics of Pregnant Women With Syphilis and Factors Associated With Congenital Syphilis at a Chicago Hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Current literature shows benefit of steroid treatment for 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) but there is scarcity of data about outcomes in COVID-19 patients on chronic corticosteroids for comorbid conditions. We aim to evaluate the critical care outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients on chronic corticosteroids for coexisting conditions. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review within our hospital network to identify COVID-19 patients on chronic corticosteroids for coexisting diseases. We collected data on patient characteristics and critical care outcomes. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and on corticosteroids (equivalent of Prednisone &gt; 5 mg daily) for at least 30 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis met inclusion criteria. We excluded patients less than 18 years of age and patients treated as an outpatient. The means and frequencies of patient characteristics and critical care outcomes were calculated utilizing SPSS version 26. P-values were calculated through chi-square and Fisher exact test as indicated. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 948 charts were reviewed and 139 met inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into elderly (&gt; 65 years) and non-elderly (&lt; 65 years) groups. Median age amongst the elderly was 79 years (range 65-97 years) and 58 years (range 19-64 years) amongst the non-elderly. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the elderly group were Caucasian and nursing homes residents while the non-elderly group had a higher proportion of obese patients. There were no additional statistically significant variations between other characteristics, the proportion of patients admitted to the ICU or in the complications they subsequently suffered during hospital course (Table 1). Significantly more patients from the non-elderly group received steroids, vasopressors (p=0.03) and mechanical ventilation (p=0.03);however, the mortality was high in both groups of ICU patients (p=0.30). When comparing overall mortality, there was a significantly larger proportion of patient deaths in the elderly group (35.0% vs 7.6%, p= 0.001) and the hospital stay duration was significantly less (8.5 vs 11.7 days, p=0.04). These results contributed to fact that the elderly were sicker on admission and died shortly after limiting their access to critical care and overall admission length. Conclusion: Our data shows that COVID-19 patients on chronic corticosteroids have higher mortality rates than the general population, and identifies elderly, obese, non-Caucasians and those requiring critical care support as high risk groups. Therefore, our study supports current literature that advocates cautious use of chronic corticosteroids when only clinically necessary.","output":"Critical care outcomes in COVID-19 patients on long-term corticosteroids for coexisting conditions: Does age matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In response to COVID-19, national ministries of health adapted HIV service delivery guidelines to ensure uninterrupted access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and limit the frequency of contact with health facilities. In this commentary, we summarize four ways in which differentiated service delivery (DSD) for HIV treatment has been accelerated during COVID-19 in policy and implementation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) - (i) expanding eligibility for DSD for HIV treatment, (ii) extending multi-month dispensing (MMD) and reducing the frequency of clinical consultations, (iii) emphasizing community-based models and (iv) integrating/aligning with TB preventative therapy (TPT), non-communicable disease (NCD) treatments and family planning commodities. DISCUSSION: Across SSA in 2020, countries both adapted and emphasized policies supporting DSD for HIV treatment in response to COVID-19. Access to DSD for HIV treatment was expanded by reducing the time required on ART before eligibility and being more inclusive of specific populations including children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women and those on second- and third-line regimens. Access to extended ART refills, or MMD, was accelerated across many countries. A renewed focus was given to out-of-facility community-based models of ART distribution. In some settings, there was acknowledgement of the need to integrate or align other chronic medications with ART. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptations to DSD for HIV treatment in response to COVID-19 have resulted in rapid policy change and in some cases, acceleration of implementation in SSA. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, there is a critical need to assess the impact of these adaptations and, where beneficial, ensure that policies implemented in response to COVID-19 become the new normal.","output":"Acceleration of differentiated service delivery for HIV treatment in sub-Saharan Africa during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Live-stream shopping has witnessed a leap in development since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak.

In this entry process, a diversity of host cell proteases and andro-gen receptor play a very important role directly or indirectly. These features of SARS-CoV-2 entry contribute to its rapid spread and severe symptoms, high fatality rates among infected patients. This review is based on latest published literature including review articles, research articles, hypothetical manuscript, pre-print articles and official documents. The literature search was made from various published papers on physiological aspects relevant to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In this report, we focus on the role of host cell proteases (ACE2, ADAM17, TMPRSS2) and androgen receptor (AR) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The hypotheses put forth by us are based on the role played by the proteases ACE2, ADAM17, TMPRSS2 and AR in SARS-CoV-2 infection which were deduced based on various studies.

Despite the challenges, ISPRS is organizing its second consecutive virtual Congress to motivate, inspire and connect geospatial researchers around the globe to share the knowledge and communicate their research results. This year Commission IV shares the successful research endeavours of many members of working groups and their graduate students and research teams.In the years since the XXIII ISPRS congress, 2016, there have been many important developments. Managing the social and economic challenges brought by increased complexity and interconnectivity of activities in human society requires new dimensions of analysing information and specifically spatial information. The increased pressure on the usage of geographic space, maintaining sustainable development and creating liveable community environments increases the requirements for spatial decision-making tools. The last years of Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns pose a range of new challenges to spatial information such as occupancy estimations, efficient use of building space and safe navigation within buildings. The focus on dynamic changes and analysing real-time sensor data is increasing. The developments of Spatial Digital Twins are maturing in the context of providing tools and methods for high density human settlements to be more resilient, sustainable, liveable, and safe.Commission IV Spatial Information Science (2016C2022) is dedicated to advance research activities in spatial information sciences for modelling, structuring, management, analysis, visualization and simulation of (big) data with focus on the third spatial dimension and taking into consideration dynamic changes. Special attention is given to linking information about real-world physical phenomena with societal, governmental, organizational and legal information in order to address the complexity of issues in their entirety. The Commission has contributed to advancements in data modelling, data fusion and management, visualization (web-based, VR and AR), simulation and city analytics, and 3D applications. The work had largely been implemented in cooperation with international organizations such as FIG, UDMS, 3DGeoinfo, ICA, OGC, ISO and Web3D.The Commission consists of 10 scientific areas of research that is coordinated by 10 working groups (WG) and one inter commission working group (ICWG) as follows C WG1: Multidimensional spatial models;WG2: Ontologies, semantics and knowledge representation for geospatial information;WG3: Spatial data analysis, statistic and uncertainty modelling;WG4: Collaborative crowdsourced cloud mapping (C3M);WG5: Indoor/outdoor seamless modelling, LBS and mobility;WG6: SDI: Internet of things and spatial decision support;WG7: Geo-data management;WG8: Geo-computation and geo-simulation;WG9: Geovisualisation, augmented and virtual reality;WG10: Advanced geospatial applications for smart cities and regions;ICWG IV/III: Global mapping: updating, verification and interoperability.The papers received for the ISPRS virtual event reflect the above-mentioned scientific research areas. The reported research ranges from advancements in new and emerging theories, through experiments and analysis to demonstration of technologies in different applications. The research was captured through papers and abstracts published in the collection of ISPRS Annals and ISPRS Archives. The ISPRS Annals contain 24 papers and the ISPRS Archives contain 56 papers. The diversity of the research presented in the published papers clearly indicates the wide range of topics within the field of Spatial Information Science. A rigorous peer-review process by the ISPRS TC IV Scientific Committee contributed to high quality proceedings.In closing we would like to note the commissions plans for the upcoming year. Because the pandemic has forced many to work remotely, we have been motivated to find new ways to remain informed of changes in the work of the commission and working gr ups.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of respondents to the 2011 Census of England and Wales in private households, linked to death registrations and adjusted for emigration (n = 47 872 412). The outcome of interest was death involving COVID-19 between 2 March 2020 and 15 May 2020. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic-minority groups compared with the White population, controlling for individual, household and area characteristics. HRs were estimated on the full outcome period and separately for pre- and post-lockdown periods. RESULTS: In age-adjusted models, people from all ethnic-minority groups were at elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality; the HRs for Black males and females were 3.13 (95% confidence interval: 2.93 to 3.34) and 2.40 (2.20 to 2.61), respectively. However, in fully adjusted models for females, the HRs were close to unity for all ethnic groups except Black [1.29 (1.18 to 1.42)]. For males, the mortality risk remained elevated for the Black [1.76 (1.63 to 1.90)], Bangladeshi/Pakistani [1.35 (1.21 to 1.49)] and Indian [1.30 (1.19 to 1.43)] groups. The HRs decreased after lockdown for all ethnic groups, particularly Black and Bangladeshi/Pakistani females. CONCLUSION: Differences in COVID-19 mortality between ethnic groups were largely attenuated by geographical and socio-demographic factors, though some residual differences remained. Lockdown was associated with reductions in excess mortality risk in ethnic-minority populations, which has implications for a second wave of infection.","output":"Ethnic-minority groups in England and Walesfactors associated with the size and timing of elevated COVID-19 mortality: a retrospective cohort study linking census and death records"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case series describes three patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 who developed polyradiculoneuritis as a probable neurological complication of COVID-19.

In this study, we aimed to identify the pattern of local transmission of COVID-19 using mathematical modeling and predict the epidemic size and the timing of the end of the spread. Methods We modeled the COVID-19 outbreak in the Republic of Korea by applying a mathematical model of transmission that factors in behavioral changes. We used the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data of daily confirmed cases in the country to estimate the nationwide and Daegu/Gyeongbuk area-specific transmission rates as well as behavioral change parameters using a least-squares method. Results The number of transmissions per infected patient was estimated to be about 10 times higher in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area than the average of nationwide. Using these estimated parameters, our models predicts that about 13,800 cases will occur nationwide and 11,400 cases in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area until mid-June. Conclusion We mathematically demonstrate that the relatively high per-capita rate of transmission and the low rate of changes in behavior have caused a large-scale transmission of COVID-19 in the Daegu/Gyeongbuk area in the Republic of Korea.

Rwanda has made notable efforts to fight the pandemic. However, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the countrys economy are numerous and the refugees residing in Rwanda are not spared these effects. As of December 2020, 164,000 people were granted refugee status in Rwanda according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The majority were from neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes regions, including DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) and Burundi. The impact the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy has led to a decline in donations to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which in turn has significantly reduced the food rations of refugees. Such paucity will no doubt cause unprecedented impacts on the people residing in refugee camps, who completely depend on humanitarian aid to meet their basic food requirements. This lack of access to adequate and affordable food will expose refugees to extreme hunger and starvation, putting their lives in danger by triggering forced returns, infections, social conflicts and thus higher morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, such stressful environments would no doubt put the mental health of these already vulnerable communities at risk. It is unsurprising that refugees are more likely to experience poor mental health compared to local population, including higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to investigate the knowledge structure, hotspots, and trends of evolution of the TKIs research by co-word analysis and literature visualization and help researchers in this field to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current status and trends. METHODS: We retrieved all academic papers about TKIs published between 2016 and 2020 from the Web of Science. By counting keywords from those papers, we generated the co-word networks by extracting the co-occurrence relationships between keywords, and then segmented communities to identify the subdirections of TKIs research by calculating the network metrics of the overall and local networks. We also mapped the association network topology, including the network within and between TKIs subdirections, to reveal the association and structure among varied subdirections. Furthermore, we detected keyword bursts by combining their burst weights and durations to reveal changes in the focus of TKIs research. Finally, evolution venation and strategic diagram were generated to reveal the trends of TKIs research. RESULTS: We obtained 6782 unique words (total frequency 26,175) from 5584 paper titles. Finally, 296 high-frequency words were selected with a threshold of 10 after discussion, the total frequency of which accounted for 65.41% (17,120/26,175). The analysis of burst disciplines revealed a variable number of burst words of TKIs research every year, especially in 2019 and 2020, such as HER2, pyrotinib, next-generation sequencing, immunotherapy, ALK-TKI, ALK rearrangement. By network calculation, the TKIs co-word network was divided into 6 communities: C1 (non-smallCcell lung cancer), C2 (targeted therapy), C3 (chronic myeloid leukemia), C4 (HER2), C5 (pharmacokinetics), and C6 (ALK). The venation diagram revealed several clear and continuous evolution trends, such as non-smallCcell lung cancer venation, chronic myeloid leukemia venation, renal cell carcinoma venation, chronic lymphocytic leukemia venation. In the strategic diagram, C1 (non-smallCcell lung cancer) was the core direction located in the first quadrant, C2 (targeted therapy) was exactly at the junction of the first and fourth quadrants, which meant that C2 was developing; and C3 (chronic myeloid leukemia), C4 (HER2), and C5 (pharmacokinetics) were all immature and located in the third quadrant. CONCLUSIONS: Using co-word analysis and literature visualization, we revealed the hotspots, knowledge structure, and trends of evolution of TKIs research between 2016 and 2020. TKIs research mainly focused on targeted therapies against varied tumors, particularly against non-smallCcell lung cancer. The attention on chronic myeloid leukemia and pharmacokinetics was gradually decreasing, but the focus on HER2 and ALK was rapidly increasing. TKIs research had shown a clear development path: TKIs research was disease focused and revolved around gene targets/targeted drugs/resistance mechanisms. Our outcomes will provide sound and effective support to researchers, funders, policymakers, and clinicians.","output":"Global Research Trends in Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors: Coword and Visualization Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To report data of the use of high-flow nasal therapy (HFNT) in the palliative care setting. METHODS Five hypoxaemic patients were treated by HFNT in a 1-year period in a palliative care setting, either in the last days of life or as part of an intensive treatment for a reversible cause of hypoxic dyspnoea. RESULTS Four patients had a similar clinical pattern. After starting HFNT, dyspnoea intensity decreased and oxygen saturation improved, providing a clinical improvement for a duration of 2-3 days, but after 48-72 hours, their conditions deteriorated and patients underwent palliative sedation. Indeed, one patient with pulmonary embolism and pneumonia was treated by HFNT successfully and was discharged home 2 weeks after admission. CONCLUSIONS HFNT may be helpful for severely hypoxaemic patients who are unresponsive to common measures adopted in the last weeks/days of life of patients with advanced cancer or to treat reversible conditions.

We sought to determine the effect of SAPB on pain and incentive spirometry (IS) maximal vital capacity in adult patients with rib fractures. METHODS: We enrolled a prospective sample of adult patients with at least two unilateral rib fractures who were being admitted for pain control. SAPB was performed by trained emergency physicians. Patients reported pain on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale at rest and during IS, before, 15, and 60 minutes after SAPB. RESULTS: Mean pain scores decreased by 1.8 (SD 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-2.81) at 15 minutes and 2.5 (SD 2.69, 95% CI: 1.24-3.76) at 60 minutes. Compared to pre-block pain scores during IS, mean pain scores decreased by 1.95 (SD 1.99, 95% CI: 1.02-2.88) at 15 minutes and 2.4 (SD 2.42, 95% CI: 1.27-3.53) at 60 minutes.

Without an effective drug therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is essential when invasive mechanical ventilation fails in severe cases. Our study carried out a systematic review of the studies published in 2020 to analyze the mortality of patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 who required ECMO. Methods: A systematic review was conducted on Medline combining keywords on SARS-CoV-2 and ECMO. All studies published during 2020 with positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 treated with ECMO were included, whether observational studies or case series. However, due to the heterogeneity in the methodology of the studies, a proper statistical analysis could not be carried out, which ended up limiting our findings. Results: Our research identified 41 publications during this period including 2007 cases of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection who required invasive support with ECMO. Among these, 985 (49%) improved clinically and were decannulated or discharged from the hospital, while 660 (32.8%) died despite invasive mechanical support. Only 357 patients (17.7%) still needed ventilation support with ECMO at the time of publication of these studies without describing the final clinical outcome. Conclusions: ECMO therapy could be useful in patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 according to the recommendations established in the clinical guidelines and based on the availability of financial resources during the pandemic. Conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing the use of ECMO with conventional invasive ventilatory therapy would provide more evidence on this regard and, consequently, more data on the management of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. ? 2021 Sociedad Espa?ola de Cardiologa.

COVID-19 transmission is faster than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pneumonia outbreak in 2002. This is mainly attributed to the different pathways of virus-infected host cells, coupled with patients' atypical clinical characteristics. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact, infecting lung tissues before damaging other body organs, such as the liver, brain, kidney and heart.

We included 106 patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2, followed up until they had 2 sequential negative tests. Exploratory regression analyses identified potential prognostic symptoms or risk factors associated with outcomes, including emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and time to resolution of viral shedding. The mean (range) patient age was 51 (18-86) years, 50% were men, and 36.5% had at least 1 risk factor, most commonly asthma (16%) and diabetes (10%).

Vitamin D plays an important role in immune function and inflammation. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the impact of vitamin D status and supplementation on COVID-19 related mortality and health outcomes. METHODS: We searched four databases until December 18th 2020, and trial registries until January 20th 2021. Two reviewers screened the studies, collected data, assessed the risk of bias, and graded the evidence for each outcome across studies, independently and in duplicate. Pre-specified outcomes of interest were mortality, ICU admission, invasive and non-invasive ventilation, hospitalization, time of hospital stay, disease severity and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We only included data from peer-reviewed articles in our primary analyses. RESULTS: We identified 31 peer-reviewed observational studies. In our primary analysis, there was a positive trend between serum 25(OH)D level <20a?ng/ml and an increased risk of mortality, ICU admission, invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation or SARS-CoV-2 positivity. However, these associations were not statistically significant. Mean 25(OH)D levels was 5.9a?ng/ml (95% CI [-9.5, -2.3]) significantly lower in COVID-19 positive, compared to negative patients. The certainty of the evidence was very low. We identified 32 clinical trial protocols, but only three have published results to-date. The trials administer vitamin D doses of 357 to 60,000a?IU/day, from one week to 12a?months. Eight megatrials investigate the efficacy of vitamin D in outpatient populations. A pilot trial revealed a significant decrease in ICU admission with calcifediol, compared to placebo (ORa?=a?0.003), but the certainty of the evidence was unclear. Another small trial showed that supplementation with cholecalciferol, 60,000a?IU/day, decreased fibrinogen levels, but did not have an effect on D-dimer, procalcitonin and CRP levels, compared to placebo. The third trial did not find any effect of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 related health outcomes. CONCLUSION: While the available evidence to-date, from largely poor-quality observational studies, may be viewed as showing a trend for an association between low serum 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 related health outcomes, this relationship was not found to be statistically significant. Calcifediol supplementation may have a protective effect on COVID-19 related ICU admissions. The current use of high doses of vitamin D in COVID-19 patients is not based on solid evidence. It awaits results from ongoing trials to determine the efficacy, desirable doses, and safety, of vitamin D supplementation to prevent and treat COVID-19 related health outcomes.","output":"The link between COVID-19 and VItamin D (VIVID): A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised many intriguing questions both in the EU and globally, from the critical task of safeguarding lives to technical legal issues about competences to regulate health as well as the boundaries of emergency laws.

In this context, the origin of information plays a central role in the dissemination of evidence-based information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. On February 2, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) constituted a massive infodemic and argued that this situation makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. OBJECTIVE: This infoveillance study, conducted during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on the social media platform Twitter. It allows monitoring of the dynamic pandemic situation on a global scale for different aspects and topics, languages, as well as regions and even whole countries. Of particular interest are temporal and geographical variations of COVID-19Crelated tweets, the situation in Europe, and the categories and origin of shared external resources. METHODS: Twitters Streaming application programming interface was used to filter tweets based on 16 prevalent hashtags related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Each tweets text and corresponding metadata as well as the users profile information were extracted and stored into a database. Metadata included links to external resources. A link categorization schemeintroduced in a study by Chew and Eysenbach in 2009was applied onto the top 250 shared resources to analyze the relative proportion for each category. Moreover, temporal variations of global tweet volumes were analyzed and a specific analysis was conducted for the European region. RESULTS: Between February 9 and April 11, 2020, a total of 21,755,802 distinct tweets were collected, posted by 4,809,842 distinct Twitter accounts. The volume of #covid19-related tweets increased after the WHO announced the name of the new disease on February 11, 2020, and stabilized at the end of March at a high level. For the regional analysis, a higher tweet volume was observed in the vicinity of major European capitals or in densely populated areas. The most frequently shared resources originated from various social media platforms (ranks 1-7). The most prevalent category in the top 50 was Mainstream or Local News. For the category Government or Public Health, only two information sources were found in the top 50: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at rank 25 and the WHO at rank 27. The first occurrence of a prevalent scientific source was Nature (rank 116). CONCLUSIONS: The naming of the disease by the WHO was a major signal to address the public audience with public health response via social media platforms such as Twitter. Future studies should focus on the origin and trustworthiness of shared resources, as monitoring the spread of fake news during a pandemic situation is of particular importance. In addition, it would be beneficial to analyze and uncover bot networks spreading COVID-19Crelated misinformation.","output":"Temporal and Location Variations, and Link Categories for the Dissemination of COVID-19CRelated Information on Twitter During the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Europe: Infoveillance Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of specific antivirals is an urgent unmet need for SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. This study focuses on host proteases that proteolytically activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, critical for its fusion after binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as antiviral targets. We first validated cleavage at a putative furin substrate motif at SARS-CoV-2 spike by expressing it in VeroE6 cells and found prominent syncytium formation. Both cleavage and syncytium were abolished by treatment with furin inhibitors decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (CMK) and naphthofluorescein but not by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor camostat. CMK and naphthofluorescein showed antiviral effects in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells by decreasing viral production and cytopathic effects. Further analysis revealed that, similar to camostat, CMK blocks virus entry, but it further suppresses the cleavage of spike and syncytium. Naphthofluorescein instead acts primarily by suppressing viral RNA transcription. Therefore, furin inhibitors may become promising antivirals for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Furin Inhibitors Block SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Cleavage to Suppress Virus Production and Cytopathic Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent complication of COVID-19, so that the importance of adequate in-hospital thromboprophylaxis in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is well established.

In this prospective observational single-center study, we report the incidence of VTE 6 weeks after hospitalization and the use of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. METHODS: Patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were invited to a multidisciplinary follow-up clinic 6 weeks after discharge. D-dimer and C-reactive protein were measured, and all patients were screened for deep vein thrombosis with venous duplex-ultrasound. Additionally, selected high-risk patients received computed tomography pulmonary angiogram or ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan to screen for incidental pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: Of 485 consecutive patients hospitalized from March through June 2020, 146 patients were analyzed, of which 39% had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Postdischarge thromboprophylaxis was prescribed in 28% of patients, but was used more frequently after ICU stay (61%) and in patients with higher maximal D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels during hospitalization. Six weeks after discharge, elevated D-dimer values were present in 32% of ward and 42% of ICU patients. Only one asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (0.7%) and one symptomatic pulmonary embolism (0.7%) were diagnosed with systematic screening. No bleedings were reported.

We aimed to compare the community burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza across different age groups and study years and gain insight into the extent to which traditional surveillance underestimates this burden. METHODS: Using preseason and postseason serology, weekly illness reporting, and RT-PCR identification of influenza from nasal swabs, we tracked the course of seasonal and pandemic influenza over five successive cohorts (England 2006C11; 5448 person-seasons' follow-up). We compared burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic strains. We weighted analyses to the age and regional structure of England to give nationally representative estimates. We compared symptom profiles over the first week of illness for different strains of PCR-confirmed influenza and non-influenza viruses using ordinal logistic regression with symptom severity grade as the outcome variable. FINDINGS: Based on four-fold titre rises in strain-specific serology, on average influenza infected 18% (95% CI 16C22) of unvaccinated people each winter. Of those infected there were 69 respiratory illnesses per 100 person-influenza-seasons compared with 44 per 100 in those not infected with influenza. The age-adjusted attributable rate of illness if infected was 23 illnesses per 100 person-seasons (13C34), suggesting most influenza infections are asymptomatic. 25% (18C35) of all people with serologically confirmed infections had PCR-confirmed disease. 17% (10C26) of people with PCR-confirmed influenza had medically attended illness. These figures did not differ significantly when comparing pandemic with seasonal influenza. Of PCR-confirmed cases, people infected with the 2009 pandemic strain had markedly less severe symptoms than those infected with seasonal H3N2. INTERPRETATION: Seasonal influenza and the 2009 pandemic strain were characterised by similar high rates of mainly asymptomatic infection with most symptomatic cases self-managing without medical consultation. In the community the 2009 pandemic strain caused milder symptoms than seasonal H3N2.

For disease prediction tasks, most existing graph-based methods tend to define the graph manually based on specified modality (e.g., demographic information), and then integrated other modalities to obtain the patient representation by Graph Representation Learning (GRL). However, constructing an appropriate graph in advance is not a simple matter for these methods. Meanwhile, the complex correlation between modalities is ignored. These factors inevitably yield the inadequacy of providing sufficient information about the patient's condition for a reliable diagnosis. To this end, we propose an end-to-end Multi-modal Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction with multi-modality. To effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated with the disease, modality-aware representation learning is proposed to aggregate the features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity between the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the graph manually, the latent graph structure is captured through an effective way of adaptive graph learning. It could be jointly optimized with the prediction model, thus revealing the intrinsic connections among samples. Our model is also applicable to the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data.

Fasting during illness may contribute to low blood glucose and caretakers' feeding practices during childhood illnesses may thus play a role in the development of low or hypo glycaemia. This study aims to describe the caretaker's feeding practices and association of fasting with low or hypo glycaemia in sick children in Malawi. METHODS: A mixed method approach was used combining quantitative cross-sectional data for children aged 0-17 years admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), a tertiary hospital in Malawi, with qualitative focus group discussions conducted with caretakers of young children who were previously referred to QECH from the five health centres around QECH. Logistic regression was used to analyse the quantitative data and thematic content analysis was conducted for qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: Data for 5131 children who were admitted through the hospital's Paediatric Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) were analysed whereof 2.1% presented with hypoglycaemia (< 2.5 mmol/l) and 6.6% with low glycaemia (&#8805;2.5mmoll/l - < 5 mmol/l). Fasting for more than eight hours was associated with low glycaemia as well as hypoglycaemia with Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) of 2.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 2.3-3.7) and 4.6, (95% CI 3.0-7.0), respectively. Caretakers demonstrated awareness of the importance of feeding during childhood illness and reported intensified feeding attention to sick children but face feeding challenges when illness becomes severe causing them to seek care at a health facility. CONCLUSION: Results suggests that caretakers understand the importance of feeding during illness and make efforts to intensify feeding a sick child but challenges occur when illness is severe leading to fasting. Fasting among children admitted to hospitals may serve as a marker of severe illness and determine those at risk of low and hypoglycaemia.","output":"Feeding practices and association of fasting and low or hypo glycaemia in severe paediatric illnesses in Malawi - a mixed method study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reduced port surgery (RPS), in which fewer ports are used than that in a conventional laparoscopic procedure, is becoming increasingly popular for various surgeries.

In preparation for the management of health care personnel that are likely to be infected, we looked in to the data collected during the Influenza pandemic in 2009, caused by a novel strain of H1N1 influenza called swine flu. The care of healthcare personnel in our institution, who had an acute febrile respiratory illness (AFRI) during that period was routed through a single channel using a uniform protocol. We retrospectively analysed the available data, during the initial four months of the pandemic, to draw lessons from it. Objective: To study the prevalence, clinical profile and risk factors of swine flu among health care personnel during the pandemic of 2009 in a tertiary care hospital in South India. Methodology: This retrospective study enrolled all the health care personnel including students of a tertiary care institution in South India, who presented with an AFRI between June to August, the initial four months of the swine flu pandemic of 2009. The clinical profile and risk factors were extracted. The results of the RT PCR for swine flu was obtained. Prevalence in each demographic group was calculated and compared. Characteristics of those with swine flu were compared with those who turned negative for the swine flu. Results: The prevalence of all AFRI and only swine flu among health care personnel during the study period was 18 per thousand and 8.7 per thousand respectively. Highest prevalence of swine flu was found among students and office staff. After adjusting for confounding factors, hyperthermia at presentation was significantly higher {OR = 1.97; 95% CI (1.01C3.76)} among those who tested positive for swine flu as compared with those with other AFRI's. Only 2.5% of the entire AFRI group required admission and there was no mortality. Conclusion: Health care personnel are at increased risk of acquiring infection. Our study demonstrated that students and office staff were the most susceptible. Unprotected exposure to unknown infectious patients and relatives is likely to have been an important factor. Though the mode of transmission is similar, compared to H1N1, COVID-19 is associated with different comorbidities and has significantly higher mortality. Therefore, in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic, the personal protective equipment of the healthcare personnel need to be escalated.","output":"Lessons from healthcare personnel screening and management during H1N1 pandemic in preparation for the impending COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care hospital in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 has probably been not only one of the largest social experiments ever, but also the trigger that unleashed the full potential of the ongoing digital transformations, overcoming social resistances to the technology that before seemed unsurmountable.

METHODS The study retrospectively reviewed and collected data from the medical records of 169 patients diagnosed with ORN and treated via medical management. Patients that received any additional interventions such as surgery or hyperbaric oxygen were not included. RESULTS Medical management led to healed ORN in 54.4% (n=92/169) of patients after an average of 12.9 months.

In order to study very low levels of impact on the human body from low-dose radiation exposure, a system with high detection sensitivity is needed. Until now, the most well-established biological radiation effect detection system in the field of emergency radiation medicine has been chromosomal analysis. However, chromosomal analysis requires advanced skills, and it is necessary to perform chromosomal analysis of a large number of cells in order to detect slight effects on the human body due to low-dose radiation exposure. Therefore, in order to study the effects of low-dose radiation exposure on the human body, it is necessary to develop high-throughput chromosome analysis technology. We have established the PNA-FISH method, which is a fluorescence in-situ hybridisation method using a PNA probe, as a high-throughput chromosome analysis technique. Using this method, the detection of dicentrics and ring chromosomes has become very efficient. Using this technology, chromosomal analysis was performed on peripheral blood before and after computed tomography (CT) examination of patients at Hiroshima University Hospital, and it was possible to detect chromosomal abnormalities due to low-dose radiation exposure in the CT examination. Furthermore, it was shown that there may be individual differences in the increase in chromosomal abnormalities due to low-dose radiation exposure, suggesting the need to build a next-generation medical radiation exposure management system based on individual differences in radiation sensitivity. If techniques such as chromosomal analysis, which have been used for biological dose evaluation in emergency radiation medicine, can be used for general radiology, such as radiodiagnosis and treatment, that will be a contribution to radiology from an unprecedented angle.

METHODS Electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings, of enrolled patients were extracted and analyzed. Pharyngeal swab, stool and urine specimens were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Viral shedding at multiple time points in specimens was recorded, and analyzed its correlation with clinical manifestations and the severity of illness. RESULTS A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled, 8 (19.05%) of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms. 28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens, which was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness.

RESULTS: We describe a 2255% increase in the use of telehealth at a tertiary hospital within a period of six weeks, and a significant simultaneous reduction in the outpatient clinic failure-to-attend rate. The vast majority of patients and clinicians agreed that the standard of care provided by telehealth was the same as that provided by on-site appointments. DISCUSSION: Telehealth that previously had only limited utilisation has now become a main method for the delivery of outpatient care. Clinicians and patients agreed that consultations provided by telehealth were of the same standard as those provided on site.

However, the mechanisms of complement resistance have never been studied in large numbers of invasive NTHi strains.In this study, we determined the relationship between binding of IgG or IgM and the bacterial survival in normal human serum for 267 invasive H. influenzae strains from Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, of which the majority (200, 75%), were NTHi.NTHi bacteria opsonized with high levels of IgM had the lowest survival in human serum. IgM binding to the bacterial surface, but not IgG binding, was shown to be associated with complement-mediated killing of NTHi strains. We conclude that evasion of IgM binding by NTHi strains increases survival in blood, thereby potentially contributing to their ability to cause severe invasive diseases.","output":"Antibody binding and complement-mediated killing of invasive Haemophilus influenzae isolates from Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the main cause of adult visual impairment worldwide. Severe non-proliferative DR (sNPDR) is an important clinical intervention stage. Currently, panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is the standard treatment for sNPDR. However, PRP alone cannot completely prevent NPDR progression. One explanation might be that PRP does not remove the detrimental vitreous that plays an important role in DR progression. Microinvasive pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was shown to be a safe and effective method to treat late-stage proliferative DR (PDR) by completely removing the pathological vitreous. However, whether PPV is effective in controlling sNPDR remains unknown. In this trial, we aim to compare the effectiveness of microinvasive PPV with that of PRP for sNPDR progression control. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This single centre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of microinvasive PPV in preventing the progression of sNPDR compared with PRP. A total of 272 adults diagnosed with sNPDR will be randomised 1:1 to the microinvasive PPV and PRP groups. The primary outcome is the disease progression rate, calculated as the rate of sNPDR progressed to PDR from baseline to 12 months after treatment. The secondary outcomes include the change in best-corrected visual acuity, re-treatment rate, diabetic macular oedema occurrence, change in central retinal thickness, change in the visual field, cataract occurrence and change in the quality of life.

To date, there has not been an analysis of the distribution of pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists relative to cardiac and noncardiac procedures in the pediatric population. The primary aim is to report the results of a survey and its subsequent analysis to describe the distribution of pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists relative to pediatric cardiac procedures that include surgical interventions, cardiac catheterization procedures, imaging studies (echocardiography, magnetic resonance, computed tomography, positron emission tomography), and noncardiac procedures. METHODS A survey developed in Research Electronic Data Capture (REDcap) was sent to the identifiable division chiefs/cardiac directors of 113 pediatric cardiac anesthesia programs in the United States. Data regarding cardiac surgical patients and procedures were collected from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS-CHD). RESULTS This analysis reveals that only 38% (117 of 307) of pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists caring for patients with CHD pursued additional training in pediatric cardiac anesthesiology, while 44% (136 of 307) have gained experience during their clinical practice. Other providers have pursued different training pathways such as adult cardiac anesthesiology or pediatric critical care. Based on this survey, pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists devote 35% (interquartile range [IQR], 20%-50%) of clinical time to the care of patients in the cardiac operating room, 25% (20%-35%) of time to the care of patients in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, 10% (5%-10%) to patient care in imaging locations, and 15% covering general pediatric, adult, or cardiac patients undergoing noncardiac procedures. Attempts to actively recruit pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists were reported by 49.2% (29 of 59) of the institutions surveyed. Impending retirement of staff was anticipated in 17% (10 of 59) of the institutions, while loss of staff to relocation was anticipated in 3.4% (2 of 59) of institutions. Thirty-seven percent of institutions reported that they anticipated no immediate changes in current staffing levels. CONCLUSIONS The majority of currently practicing pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists have not completed a fellowship training in the subspecialty. There is, and will continue to be, a need for subspecialty training to meet increasing demand for services especially with increase survival of this patient population and to replace retiring members of the workforce.","output":"The Practice of Pediatric Cardiac Anesthesiology in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate neurologic symptoms and findings in patients with COVID-19 infection hospitalized in a ward and intensive care unit (ICU).

A grounds-based approach to abortion provision occurs when law and policy provide that lawful abortion may be provided only where a person who wishes to have an abortion satisfies stipulated 'grounds', sometimes described as 'exceptions' or 'exceptional grounds'. Grounds-based approaches to abortion are, prima facie, restrictive as they limit access to abortion based on factors extraneous to the preferences of the pregnant person. International human rights law specifies that abortion must be available (and not 'merely' lawful) where the life or health of the pregnant woman or girl is at risk, or where carrying a pregnancy to term would cause her substantial pain or suffering, including but not limited to situations where the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or the pregnancy is not viable. However, international human rights law does not specify a grounds-based approach as the way to give effect to this requirement. The aim of this review is to address knowledge gaps related to the health and non-health outcomes plausibly related to the effects of a grounds-based approach to abortion regulation. The evidence from this review shows that grounds have negative implications for access to quality abortion and for the human rights of pregnant people. Further, it shows that grounds-based approaches are insufficient to meet states' human rights obligations. The evidence presented in this review thus suggests that enabling access to abortion on request would be more rights-enhancing than grounds-based approaches to abortion regulation.","output":"The impact of 'grounds' on abortion-related outcomes: a synthesis of legal and health evidence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and to assess the relationships between FMF characteristics and severe COVID-19 outcomes such as hospitalization.

It reports on the digital training currently provided nationally and barriers/facilitators to acquiring these competencies. METHODS: Eighteen of the thirty UK Clinical Psychology Doctoral training programmes completed a 16-item survey. This mapped current digital health teaching and skills acquisition for trainee Clinical Psychologists throughout their 3-year pre-registration training. Furthermore, potential barriers and facilitators to developing these digital skills for both trainee and qualified Clinical Psychologists were investigated. RESULTS: The quantitative analysis highlighted the majority of respondents viewed developing digital mental health competencies with importance, but were not integrating this into teaching or clinical placements activity. The qualitative, inductive content analysis revealed seven key themes influencing the development of digital mental health skills, with the majority of respondents identifying with two themes; the need for practice guidelines (50% of respondents) and opportunities for digital mental health experience.

An important question is how much of that collapse resulted from government-imposed restrictions versus people voluntarily choosing to stay home to avoid infection. This paper examines the drivers of the economic slowdown using cellular phone records data on customer visits to more than 2.25 million individual businesses across 110 different industries. Comparing consumer behavior over the crisis within the same commuting zones but across state and county boundaries with different policy regimes suggests that legal shutdown orders account for only a modest share of the massive changes to consumer behavior (and that tracking county-level policy conditions is significantly more accurate than using state-level policies alone). While overall consumer traffic fell by 60 percentage points, legal restrictions explain only 7 percentage points of this. Individual choices were far more important and seem tied to fears of infection. Traffic started dropping before the legal orders were in place; was highly influenced by the number of COVID deaths reported in the county; and showed a clear shift by consumers away from busier, more crowded stores toward smaller, less busy stores in the same industry. States that repealed their shutdown orders saw symmetric, modest recoveries in consumer visits, further supporting the small estimated effect of policy. Although the shutdown orders had little aggregate impact, they did have a significant effect in reallocating consumer visits away from nonessential to essential businesses and from restaurants and bars toward groceries and other food sellers.","output":"Fear, lockdown, and diversion: Comparing drivers of pandemic economic decline 2020()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To identify the changes in serial 2-hourly forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) measurements required to identify occupational asthma (OA) using the Oasys Area Between Curves (ABC) score. METHODS The ABC score from 2-hourly measurements of FEV1 was compared between workers with confirmed OA and asthmatics without occupational exposure to identify the optimum separation using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Separate analyses were made for plots using clock time and time from waking to allow for use in shift workers. Minimum record criteria were 6 readings per day, >4 day shifts and >4 rest days (or >9 days for controls). RESULTS A retrospective analysis identified 22 workers with OA and 30 control asthmatics whose records reached the quality standards. Median FEV1 diurnal variation was 20.3% (IQR 16.1-32.6) for OA and 19.5% (IQR 14.5-26.1) for asthmatic controls. ROC curve analysis identified that a difference of 0.056 L/hour gave a ROC score of 0.821 for clock time and 0.768 for time from waking with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 93% for the diagnosis of OA. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of OA requires objective confirmation. Unsupervised serial FEV1 measurements are more difficult to obtain reliably than measurements of peak expiratory flow, which are likely to remain the standard for general use. A FEV1 ABC score >0.056 L/hour provides a valid cut-off for those who wish to use FEV1 rather than peak expiratory flow.","output":"Diagnosis of occupational asthma from serial measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) using the Area Between Curves (ABC) score from the Oasys plotter."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Surrogate medical decision making is common in the United States healthcare system. Variables that may influence surrogate decision making have been proposed. Little work has examined relations between these variables and outcomes of surrogate decision making. This study investigated whether surrogates' characteristics, including their knowledge of treatment options, and interpersonal factors predicted surrogates' accuracy and intervention selections. Specifically, predictor variables included: trust in the medical profession, trait-level anxiety, depression, anxiety about COVID-19, religiosity, perceived emotional support, understanding of treatment options, empathy, willingness to accept responsibility for medical decisions, reluctance to burden others, and perceived similarity between oneself and the patient. METHODS: 154 pairs of patients and their surrogates completed an online survey. Patients indicated preferred treatments in hypothetical decision scenarios. Surrogates indicated the treatment that they thought the patient would prefer. RESULTS: When taken all together in a predictive model, the variables significantly predicted surrogates' accuracy, F (6) = 3.03, R2 = .12, p = .008. Variables also predicted selection of intensive interventions, F (4) = 5.95, R2 = .14, p = .00. Surrogates reporting greater anxiety about COVID-19 selected more intensive interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with prior research, this study found that surrogates' characteristics influence the interventions they choose, with anxiety about COVID-19 having considerable bearing on their chosen interventions.

While many studies portray mechanisms in early antiviral immune responses of humans and mice, much remains to be discovered about these mechanisms in the cat. With the objective of shedding light on early hostCvirus interactions in felids, we have developed 12 real-time TaqMan(?) qPCR systems for feline genes relevant to innate responses to viral infection, including those encoding for various IFN and IFN subtypes, IFN, intracellular antiviral factor Mx, NK cell stimulator IL-15 and effectors perforin and granzyme B, as well as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 8. Using these newly developed assays and others previously described, we measured the relative expression of selected markers at early time points after viral infection in vitro and in vivo. Feline embryonic fibroblasts (FEA) inoculated with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) indicated peak levels of IFN, IFN and Mx expression already 6 h after infection. In contrast, Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CrFK) cells inoculated with feline herpes virus (FHV) responded to infection with high levels of IFN and IFN only after 24 h, and no induction of Mx could be detected. In feline PBMCs challenged in vitro with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), maximal expression levels of IFN,  and  subtype genes as well as IL-15 and TLRs 3, 7 and 8 were measured between 12 and 24 h after infection, whereas expression levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene IL-6 were consistently downregulated until 48 h post inoculation. A marginal upregulation of granzyme B was also observed within 3 h after infection. In an in vivo experiment, cats challenged with FIV exhibited a 2.4-fold increase in IFN expression in blood 1 week post infection. We furthermore demonstrate the possibility of stimulating feline immune cells in vitro with various immune response modifiers (IRMs) already known for their immunostimulatory properties in mice and humans, namely Poly IC, Resiquimod (R-848) and dSLIM?, a synthetic oligonucleotide containing several unmethylated CpG motifs. Stimulation of feline PBMCs with dSLIM? and R-848 effectively enhanced expression of IFN within 12 h by factors of 6 and 12, respectively, and Poly IC induced an increase in Mx mRNA expression of 28-fold.

Rates and chi-squared test were used for categorical variables. Median, IQR, and Wilcoxon test were used continuous variables. RESULTS: 35 149 patients met inclusion criteria. Pre-COVID-19, COVID-19 spike, and post-COVID-19 groups showed no significant difference in mean age or the proportion of patients in each DCI variable. Proportionately fewer females and more White non-Hispanic patients were operated on during the COVID-19 spike. Surgeons affiliated with academic hospitals saw proportionality fewer elective cases during the COVID-19 spike. DISCUSSION: This study suggests white males with private hospital affiliation were more likely to have elective hernia surgery during the COVID-19 spike, however these trends were not associated with health care DCI changes during the same period. Further study is necessary to determine the reasons for these differences and will be important to optimize surgical care for patients during a worldwide pandemic.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Sociodemographic Disparities in Rates of Elective Hernia Surgeries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to respond to demands in maternal health around the world. Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) is one of the most severe obstetric conditions and usually requires the use of multiple health resources We describe the clinical results of the management of PAS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze how the pandemic may affect the functioning of a PAS team. METHODOLOGY This was a descriptive, retrospective study including all patients treated for PAS in two low- to middle-income country reference hospitals between January 2020 and March 2021. The clinical results of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during PAS surgery (Group 1) were compared with those of PAS patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (Group 2). RESULTS One hundred forty-five patients undergoing surgery for PAS were included. Group 1 patients (11 cases) showed a longer operative time (250 min, IQR 200-300) and a higher frequency of intra- or postoperative complications (54.5%) than group 2 patients (180 min [IQR 125-240], and 17.9%). CONCLUSION Placenta accreta spectrum patients undergoing surgery during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection have a higher frequency of postoperative complications.

Our purpose was to compare the BHI (and related physiological responses) of a novel milk permeate solution (MPS) to that of water and a traditional carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (CES). Over three visits, 12 young subjects consumed 1 L of water, CES, or MPS. Urine samples were collected immediately post-ingestion and at 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. BHI was calculated by dividing cumulative urine output after water consumption by cumulative urine output for each test beverage at each time point. The BHI for MPS was significantly higher at all time points compared to water (all p < 0.001) and CES (all p  0.01) but did not differ between CES and water at any time point. Drinking 1 L of MPS resulted in decreased cumulative urine output across the subsequent 4 h compared to water and CES, suggesting that a beverage containing milk permeate is superior to water and a traditional CES at sustaining positive fluid balance post-ingestion.","output":"Hydration Efficacy of a Milk Permeate-Based Oral Hydration Solution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A genogroup 2b (G2b) porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Taiwan Pintung 52 (PEDVPT) strain was isolated in 2014.

In this study, we used a highly sensitive and specific nucleocapsid-Ag assay to explore the presence of N-Ag in urine during the course of Covid-19, and explore its relationship with the severity of the disease. Material and MethodsUrine and blood samples were collected from 82 patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection proven by PCR and included in the COVIDotheque. We explored the presence of N-Ag in urine and blood using the AAZ N-Ag test, studied the kinetics of the marker according to the time since the onset of symptoms and evaluated the association between N-Ag levels, clinical severity and inflammation. ResultsIn the first and second weeks of Covid-19, hospitalized patients tested positive for urinary N-Ag (81.25% and 71.79%, respectively) and blood N-Ag (93.75% and 94.87%, respectively). N-Ag levels in urine and blood were moderately correlated with the number of days after the onset of symptoms (r=-0.43, p<0.0001; r=-0.55 p<0.0001, respectively). The follow up of seven SARS-CoV-2 infected patients confirmed the waning of N-Ag in urine and blood over the course of the disease. High urinary N-Ag levels were associated with the absence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-IgG (N-IgG), admission in intensive care units, high C-reactive protein levels, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). ConclusionOur study demonstrate that N-Ag is present in the urine of patients hospitalized in the early phase of Covid-19. As a direct marker of SARS-CoV-2, urinary N-Ag reflects the dissemination of viral compounds in the body.

Measuring the emission ratios (Y/C) of the FRET components enabled Pb detection with a dynamic range of nearly 2 (1.96), a pMet-lead/Pb dissociation constant (K(d)) 45.62 nM, and a limit of detection 24 nM (0.474 g/dL, 4.74 ppb). To mitigate earlier problems with a lack of selectivity for Pb vs. zinc, we preincubated samples with tricine, a low-affinity zinc chelator.

Novel drug development does not always account for orphan diseases, which have low demand and hence low-profit margins for drug developers.

Drug repositioning results in lower overall developmental expenses and risk assessments, as the efficacy and safety of the original drug have already been well accessed and approved by regulatory authorities. The greatest advantage of drug repositioning is that it breathes new life into the novel, rare, orphan, and resistant diseases, such as Cushings syndrome, HIV infection, and pandemic outbreaks such as COVID-19. Repositioning existing drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Ivermectin and Baricitinib shows good potential for COVID-19 treatment.

And whilst social issues have risen to prominence in events research generally, this work is usually considered outwith sustainability debates, and without considering environmental and economic interrelationships. We argue that event scholars should examine how events might contribute to sustainable development, rather than merely exploring how individual events could be made more sustainable. Accordingly, there needs to be further work addressing how events might change attitudes and behaviours by promoting sustainable lifestyles, communities and technologies.

General and Internal Medicine ? Metabolic Disorders and Diabetics ? Physiology ? Pulmonology OBJECTIVE: Unusual or unexpected effect of treatment BACKGROUND: Phosphorous is an essential component of cell structure and physiology, and is required for energy conservation and expenditure. Severe hypophosphatemia can lead to profound dysfunction and injury affecting most organs and can be life-threatening. It can also compromise weaning of mechanically ventilated patients. Long-term assisted ventilatory care in ambulatory or inpatient settings is an expanding medical service for patients with various forms of persistent or progressive incapacitating diseases. Hypophosphatemia, caused by respiratory alkalosis, has been reported in critical-care settings, but its occurrence in medically stable patients requiring long-term respiratory support has not been thoroughly investigated. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a ventilated patient in a chronic vegetative state displaying progressive hypophosphatemia spanning over 3 months, with plasma levels gradually declining to 0.8 mg/dL. Evaluation did not reveal conditions leading to diminished phosphate absorption or enhanced urinary phosphate excretion, but it identified respiratory alkalosis related to a recent increase in target minute-volume ventilation in the adaptive support ventilation (ASV) mode as the cause of hypophosphatemia. Despite the very low plasma phosphate level, the patient was asymptomatic, probably because this type of hypophosphatemia may not represent physiologically significant intracellular phosphate depletion. The respiratory alkalosis resolved upon decreasing the target minute-volume ventilation settings, and serum phosphate was normalized. CONCLUSIONS: Since blood gases are not routinely monitored in respiratory and hemodynamically stable patients on long-term respiratory support, hypophosphatemia may herald the development of significant respiratory alkalosis. Assessment of acid-base balance is thus warranted in patients receiving long-term ventilation, especially in those developing hypophosphatemia.","output":"Severe Protracted Hypophosphatemia in a Patient with Persistent Vegetative State on Long-Term Assisted Respiratory Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Follow-up of intracranial aneurysms treated by flow diverter with MRI is complicated by imaging artifacts produced by these devices. This study compares the diagnostic accuracy of three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography (3D-TOF-MRA) and contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) at 3 T for the evaluation of aneurysm occlusion and parent artery patency after flow diversion treatment, with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the gold standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients treated with flow diverters between January 2009 and January 2013 followed by MRA at 3 T (3D-TOF-MRA and CE-MRA) and DSA within a 48 h period were included in a prospective single-center study. Aneurysm occlusion was assessed with full and simplified Montreal scales and parent artery patency with three-grade and two-grade scales. RESULTS Twenty-two patients harboring 23 treated aneurysms were included. Interobserver agreement using simplified scales for occlusion (Montreal) and parent artery patency were higher for DSA (0.88 and 0.61) and CE-MRA (0.74 and 0.55) than for 3D-TOF-MRA (0.51 and 0.02). Intermodality agreement was higher for CE-MRA (0.88 and 0.32) than for 3D-TOF-MRA (0.59 and 0.11).

ObjectiveTo evaluate the quantitative titers and durability of binding antibodies detected after SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent COVID-19 vaccination. DesignA prospective longitudinal evaluation included nine visits over 150 days; visits included questionnaire administration, blood collection for serology, and paired anterior nasal specimen collection for testing by BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card (BinaxNOW), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and viral culture. SettingA nursing home during and after a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Participants11 consenting SARS-CoV-2-positive nursing home residents. Main Outcomes and MeasuresSARS-CoV-2 testing (BinaxNOW, RT-PCR, viral culture); quantitative titers of binding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies post-infection and post-vaccination (beginning after the first dose of the primary series). ResultsOf 10 participants with post-infection serology results, 9 (90%) had detectable Pan-Ig, IgG, and IgA antibodies and 8 (80%) had detectable IgM antibodies. At first antibody detection post-infection, two-thirds (6/9, 67%) of participants were RT-PCR-positive but none were culture positive. Ten participants received vaccination; all had detectable Pan-Ig, IgG, and IgA antibodies through their final observation []90 days post-first dose. Post-vaccination geometric means of IgG titers were 10-200-fold higher than post-infection.

Furthermore, cultural and creative firms face additional challenges. Many of those firms have survived the effects of the pandemic by proposing redesigned business models that have brought new added value in response to environmental hostility;they have strategically responded to the crises by adapting their business model. According to the extant literature, in VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) environments, dynamic capabilities are developed to detect and seize new opportunities and reconfigure the companys assets.

To inform the design of Internet-based interventions for older adults, the current study of U.S. older adults examines gender and age divides in searching for and sharing COVID-19 information on the Internet. METHODS: A secondary analysis of survey data from the Pew Research Center fielded March 19-24, 2020. Bivariate probit regressions jointly estimated how searching for and sharing information on the Internet about COVID-19 were associated with the age and gender of U.S. older adults (50 or older), adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Consistent with previous research, younger older adults (50-64) were more likely than their older counterparts (65 or older) to search for and share information about COVID-19 and men, regardless of age, were less likely than women to share information. While men are usually more likely than women to search for information, women who are younger older adults were most likely to search for COVID-19 information. DISCUSSION: Internet-based interventions for older adults should consider how gender shapes their exposure to pandemic stressors. Men, who were already at risk of social isolation before the pandemic, may be candidates for interventions encouraging social uses of the Internet. Women between 50 and 64 were most likely among adults to provide care for another adult before the pandemic, which may be shaping their online information needs.","output":"Gender Divides in Engagement with COVID-19 Information on the Internet among U.S. Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented for modern medicine pandemic caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus (\\"coronavirus\\", Covid-19 disease) creates in turn new data on the management and survival of cardiac arrest victims, but mainly on the safety of CardioPulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) providers.

Using critical race theory, an investigation of experiences of health care among undocumented young adults was conducted to highlight their limitations to health care access. Methods: Using a community-based participatory paradigm, a qualitative research approach was used to explore the experiences of 13 participants via a semistructured interview. Upon transcription and broad theme analysis conducted by the primary team members, a gathering of community experts was arranged. This gathering consisted of the primary team members as well as community young adults who identified as undocumented or of mixed-status families, in which all engaged in a collaborative analysis of themes and confirmation of corresponding illustrative data. Furthermore, community experts provided feedback on their insights for the necessary next steps. Results: Through collaborative thematic analysis and confirmation of illustrative data, four themes emerged: (1) emotional and financial stress, (2) fear of exposure, (3) dependence on community health clinics, and (4) hospitals as a last resource. Conclusion: Undocumented young adults and their families make great attempts to access health care, however, because of systemic barriers, they engage in strategies to preserve their safety in such attempts. Due to lack of insurance and financial strain, undocumented families depend on resources they most trust, typically health clinics. However, as many families depend on this resource, they may hinder efficiency in getting the specific help they need, especially if they do not have the capacity to adequately address medical issues that require immediate attention.","output":"Critical Incidences in U.S. Health Care Systems Experienced by Undocumented Young Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Issues related to the covid-19 impact on university students remain a matter of concern.

From 2017C2020, the New England Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) collected data in real-time on the training and technical assistance (TA) requested and attended by the front-line workforce. This article synthesizes practice-based evidence on the types of TA requests, topics of TA, attendance numbers, and socio-demographics of TA attendees over a 3-year period spanning an unprecedented public health syndemic. METHODS: We assessed TA events hosted by the New England ATTC using SAMHSAs Performance Accountability and Reporting System post-event survey data from 2017C2020. Events were coded by common themes to identify the most frequently requested training types/topics and most frequently attended training events. We also evaluated change in training topics and attendee demographics over the three-year timeline. RESULTS: A total of 258 ATTC events reaching 10,143 participants were analyzed. The number of TA events and attendance numbers surged in the 2019C2020 fiscal year as TA events shifted to fully virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic. The absolute number of opioid-related events increased, but the relative proportion remained stable over time. The relative proportions of events and attendance rates focused on evidence-based practice and health equity both increased over the 3-year period, with the largest increase after the onset of the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd.

Passive immune therapy including anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG) was a logical candidate for COVID-19 therapeutic trials, given past success treating emerging pathogens with endogenous neutralizing antibodies. We established a plasma collection protocol for persons recovered from COVID-19. To speed recruitment in the first U.S. hotspot, Seattle, Washington, federal and state public health agencies collaborated with Bloodworks Northwest to collect convalescent plasma (CP) for manufacturing hIVIG. During March-December 2020, we identified and recruited prospective CP donors via letters to persons recovered from COVID-19 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prospective donors were pre-screened and administered a medical history survey. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers were classified as qualifying (1:80) or non-qualifying (<1:80) for enrollment based on a live virus neutralization assay. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify characteristics of donors associated with qualifying versus nonqualifying NAb titers. Overall, 21,359 letters resulted in 3207 inquiries, 2159 prescreenings with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 573 donors (27% of all pre-screenings with confirmed infection) who provided a screening plasma donation. Of 573 donors screened, 254 (44%) provided plasma with qualifying NAb titers, resulting in 1284 units for hIVIG manufacture. In a multivariable model, after adjusting for other factors, time (60 days) from COVID-19 symptom onset to screening was associated with lower odds of qualifying NAb (adjusted odds ratio = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48-0.94). The collaboration facilitated a rapid response to develop and provide hIVIG for clinical trials and CP for transfusion. Only 1 in 12 donor inquiries resulted in a qualifying plasma donation. Challenges included recruitment and the relatively low percentage of persons with high NAb titers and limited screening capacity. This resource-intensive collaboration may not be scalable but informs preparedness and response strategies for plasma collection in future epidemics.

Motivated by the effectiveness in propagating the disease through the virus, a new bio-inspired and population-based optimization algorithm is proposed. This paper presents a novel metaheuristic algorithm named Ebola optimization algorithm (EOSA). To correctly achieve this, this study models the propagation mechanism of the Ebola virus disease, emphasising all consistent states of the propagation. The model was further represented using a mathematical model based on first-order differential equations. After that, the combined propagation and mathematical models were adapted for developing the new metaheuristic algorithm. To evaluate the proposed method's performance and capability compared with other optimization methods, the underlying propagation and mathematical models were first investigated to determine how they successfully simulate the EVD. Furthermore, two sets of benchmark functions consisting of forty-seven (47) classical and over thirty (30) constrained IEEE CEC-2017 benchmark functions are investigated numerically. The results indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is competitive with other state-of-the-art optimization methods based on scalability analysis, convergence analysis, and sensitivity analysis.

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classified health-care professionals and exposure risk to coronavirus (COVID-19), identifying dental professionals in the very high-risk group due to the specificity of dental procedures and instrumentations used. Guidelines from relevant authorities suggested providing only emergency and urgent dental treatment during the pandemic which has led majority of dental practice to stop, thus instilling anxiety in the dental professionals. A study to assess the attitude, practice and experience of dental professionals from Gujarat state during the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire consisting of 32 questions using Google Form was distributed to 315 dental professionals. Data obtained were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 22.0. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to describe variables. Chi-square test was used to find a significant association between parameters, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Overall, 194 dental professionals (104 general dentists and 90 specialists) filled the questionnaire. Nearly half of the participants (49.5%) said that personal protective equipment (PPE) is uncomfortable while performing dental procedures. The majority of them (86.6%) insisted on increasing the cost of dental treatments. Regarding new practices adapted during the pandemic, 53 dental professionals (27.3%) did not find teledentistry effective in resolving the patient's problem. Only 75 dental professionals (38.7%) followed all the screening criteria for patients. Fifty-nine participants (30.4%) got the COVID-19 test for patients requiring the aerosol-generating procedure. While 125 participants (64.4%) performed aerosol-generating procedures either in urgent/emergency cases or elective cases, only 115 (59.3%) used full PPE with an appropriate mask. One hundred and thirty-seven (70.6%) of them reported a decrease in income during the pandemic, while 74 (38.1%) suffered from anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Dental health-care providers are at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19. Thus, they should execute proposed precautionary measures more diligently. Regular training and screening of dental professionals should be undertaken by state regulatory bodies. Adapting and adhering to change in work protocols by dental professionals will ensure not only their safety but also their patients. The emergence of COVID-19 has been great learning for the field of dentistry, and the dental practice is going to change for the better.","output":"Attitude, practices and experience of dental professionals during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey from Gujarat, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To evaluate the efficacy of Angioplasty and Stent Placement for the treatment of Portal Vein Stenosis in Liver Transplant Recipients by performing a systematic review. MATERIALS AND METHODS The PubMed Database was extensively searched for articles describing Portal Vein Stenosis (PVS) as a complication in Liver Transplant (LT) patients. The initial database search yielded 488 unique records published in the PubMed Database, 19 of which were deemed to meet the inclusion criteria. Outcomes were separated into 2 groups (Group A included patients with primary angioplasty, Group B included patients with primary stent placement), and further subdivided into Adult and Pediatric populations. RESULTS Group A included a total of 282 LT patients with portal vein stenosis. The population was predominantly pediatric (n = 243). Group B included a total of 111 LT patients with portal vein stenosis. This population was predominantly adult (n = 66). Technical success was significantly higher in both Group B pediatric (100%) and adults (97%) compared to Group A (69.5%) and (66.7%) respectively. Re-stenosis rates were significantly lower in Group B pediatric group compared to Group A (2.3% vs 29.7%, 2 = 13.9; p < 0.001). Overall major (3.1%) and minor complications rates (1.5%) were low. CONCLUSION Primary stent placement appears to have higher technical success in both populations and lower re-stenosis rates for treatment of PVS in pediatric populations.","output":"Safety and Efficacy of Endovascular Treatment of Portal Vein Stenosis in Liver Transplant Recipients: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social networks are taking over teenagers' lives and altering the way they relate to others. They are creating their own and changing culture. Which is a cause for concern for adults, who do not understand it. Moreover, usage peaks at a pivotal time in life: adolescence. Therefore it seems important to understand these new habits, and the reasons why social networks are such an important part of the life of adolescents. Furthermore, we looked into the question if virtual relationships have an impact on real-life relationships, and vice versa. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This literature review examined studies published between 2008 and September 2019. Twenty-five articles were selected from PubMed, Scopus, PsychINFO and Cochrane databases. RESULTS: Above all, teenagers are motivated to use social networks because they can develop an identity based on an idealized profile. This profile must be at least as good as those of their peers, in order to obtain the latter's approval. This is notably the case in a context where changes to the family structure give a greater weight to the opinion of peers. Young people are driven to seek refuge on the Internet by a lack of family support, and parents who are less emotionally present. This effect could be limited by encouraging communication between teenagers and their parents. Finally, romantic relationships are impacted by the availability of pornography. Viewing pornography is increasingly seen as a normal stage of development and is linked to poorer attachment to peers and family. CONCLUSIONS: The Internet seems to support a gradual detachment from family life and a move towards greater inclusion in the peer group. This is all the more evident in a context where family structures are changing.","output":"Real or Virtual Relationships: Does It Matter to Teens?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in blood, also known as RNAemia, has been reported, but its prognostic implications are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and its association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical severity. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single-center tertiary care institution and included consecutive inpatients and outpatients with confirmed COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables were examined and included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and 30-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Paired nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were included from 85 patients. The median age was 55 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma (63 vs 50 years; P = .04). Comorbidities were frequent including obesity (37.6%), hypertension (30.6%), and diabetes mellitus (22.4%). RNAemia was detected in 28/85 (32.9%) of patients, including 22/28 (78.6%) who required hospitalization. In models adjusted for age, RNAemia was detected more frequently in individuals who developed severe disease including ICU admission (32.1 vs 14.0%; P = .04) and invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 3.5%; P = .02). All 4 deaths occurred in individuals with detectable RNAemia. An additional 121 plasma samples from 28 individuals with RNAemia were assessed longitudinally, and RNA was detected for a maximum duration of 10 days.

Traditional coil embolization as the primary means of carotid sacrifice can be expensive, with high radiation exposure. We investigated the feasibility of a novel hybrid coil, the Penumbra occlusion device (POD), for carotid sacrifice in a swine model. METHODS A total of eight common carotid artery sacrifices were performed in fully heparinized pigs under fluoroscopic guidance. A single POD device was deployed within each vessel, and intermittent follow-up angiography was performed to assess flow. RESULTS Complete carotid occlusion was achieved in all cases with a single POD (time range 2-15 min) without any coil migration or intraprocedural complications. Once the anchor zone was stable, no distal migrations were observed during either proximal soft coil packing or during hand injected angiography. Complete occlusion was verified between 2 and 15 min following POD deployment. CONCLUSIONS Carotid artery sacrifice using a novel POD device is safe and effective, allowing for reduced radiation and material costs compared with any other described endovascular technique.","output":"Carotid sacrifice with a single Penumbra occlusion device: a feasibility study in a swine model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The integration of high technology into health care systems is intended to provide new treatment options and improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care. Robotic-assisted surgery is an example of high technology integration in health care, which has become ubiquitous in many surgical disciplines. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand and measure current robotic-assisted surgery processes in a systematic, quantitative, and replicable manner to identify latent systemic threats and opportunities for improvement based on our observations and to implement and evaluate interventions. This 5-year study will follow a human factors engineering approach to improve the safety and efficiency of robotic-assisted surgery across 4 US hospitals. METHODS: The study uses a stepped wedge crossover design with 3 interventions, introduced in different sequences at each of the hospitals over four 8-month phases. Robotic-assisted surgery procedures will be observed in the following specialties: urogynecology, gynecology, urology, bariatrics, general, and colorectal. We will use the data collected from observations, surveys, and interviews to inform interventions focused on teamwork, task design, and workplace design. We intend to evaluate attitudes toward each intervention, safety culture, subjective workload for each case, effectiveness of each intervention (including through direct observation of a sample of surgeries in each observational phase), operating room duration, length of stay, and patient safety incident reports. Analytic methods will include statistical data analysis, point process analysis, and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The study was funded in September 2018 and approved by the institutional review board of each institution in May and June of 2019 (CSMC and MDRH: Pro00056245; VCMC: STUDY 270; MUSC: Pro00088741). After refining the 3 interventions in phase 1, data collection for phase 2 (baseline data) began in November 2019 and was scheduled to continue through June 2020. However, data collection was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 65 observations across the 4 sites before the pandemic. Data collection for phase 2 was resumed in October 2020 at 2 of the 4 sites. CONCLUSIONS: This will be the largest direct observational study of surgery ever conducted with data collected on 680 robotic surgery procedures at 4 different institutions. The proposed interventions will be evaluated using individual-level (workload and attitude), process-level (perioperative duration and flow disruption), and organizational-level (safety culture and complications) measures. An implementation science framework is also used to investigate the causes of success or failure of each intervention at each site and understand the potential spread of the interventions.

Asthma is a multifaceted syndrome involving atopy, bronchial hyperreactivity, and IgE and non-IgE-mediated acute and chronic immune responses. The asthmatic airway is characterized by an infiltrate of eosinophils and of T-lymphocytes expressing the type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Trigger factors associated with acute exacerbations of asthma include exposure to environmental allergens, especially animals, molds, pollens and mites, cold, exercise, and drugs. The frequency of exacerbations is a major factor in the quality of life of patients with COPD. The typical clinical features of an exacerbation include increased dyspnea, wheezing, cough, sputum production, and worsened gas exchange. Although noninfectious causes of exacerbations such as allergy, air pollution, or inhaled irritants including cigarette smoke may be important, acute airway infections are the major precipitants. The infection and consequent host inflammatory response result in increased airway obstruction. The success of vaccination to prevent respiratory virus infections has been limited by significant variation within the major virus types causing disease. Currently much of the treatment of infective exacerbations of asthma and COPD is symptomatic, consisting of increased bronchodilators, either short-acting  2agonists in inhaled or intravenous form or anticholinergics or theophyllines, or supportive in the form of oxygen and in severe cases noninvasive or invasive ventilatory measures.","output":"Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Events that change the global economy rapidly, without warning, in principle strongly affect mining, which is one of the pillars of global development. After the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, the mining pillar seems to be relatively stable. In this study, thanks to the meeting of an international team, it was possible to collect and compare a set of data on the impact on mining. In contrast to the general assessments of the stability of the mining sector, the authors decided to assess the impact of Covid-19 at individual stages of the mining project life cycle. In this way, it was possible to identify the most impacted fragments of the mining pillar. It was assessed that the highest influence of Covid-19 is observed in projects implementing feasibility studies and in projects for the development of new mines. The same is true of extracting residual resources in mines prior to the closure decision. The medium impact was confirmed at the exploration and discovery stage. The authors conclude that the impact on the current mining production is smaller and the effects in this case are short term, which is mainly due to a continued strong demand for minerals in China, which has balanced the weaker demand in other parts of the world.

Previous genetic studies imply causal effects of childhood BMI on depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but these observations might also reflect effects of demography and the family environment. We used within-family Mendelian randomization, which accounts for familial effects by controlling for parental genotype, to investigate the impact of BMI on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and ADHD symptoms at age 8. Methods: This study is based on the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and uses data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN). Participants were 26,370 8-year-old children (48.7% female) born 1999-2009, together with their parents. We applied multivariable regression, classic Mendelian randomization (classic MR), and within-family Mendelian randomization (within-family MR). We report estimates of the effects of the child's own BMI, mother's BMI, and father's BMI on the child's depressive, anxiety, and ADHD symptoms, reported by mothers when the child was aged 8. Results: In multivariable regression, higher BMI was marginally associated with more depressive and ADHD symptoms, and associated with fewer anxiety symptoms, in 8-year-old children. Classic MR models implied a causal effect of children's higher BMI on higher depressive and ADHD symptoms, and to a lesser degree, lower anxiety symptoms. In within-family MR models, there was less evidence that children's own BMI affected any of these symptoms. For example, a 5kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with 0.04 standard deviations (SD) higher depressive symptoms (95% CI -0.01 to 0.09) in multivariable regression, with corresponding effect estimates of 0.41 SD (95% CI 0.10 to 0.56) in classic MR and 0.08 SD (95% CI -0.25 to 0.42) in within-family MR. Within-family MR suggested that maternal but not paternal BMI was associated with children's depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The influence of childhood BMI on depressive, anxiety and ADHD symptoms may have been overstated by MR approaches that do not account for parental genotype. Factors correlated with maternal BMI may influence offspring symptoms of depression.","output":"The causal effects of body mass index (BMI) on childhood symptoms of depression, anxiety disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a within family Mendelian randomization study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic suprapubic hernia repair (LSHR) is frequently a technically difficult procedure. This is often due to extensive adhesions from multiple previous operations, the necessary wide pelvic dissection, and adequate mesh coverage with transfascial suture fixation. The aim of the current study was to document the complications and morbidity associated with the repair of suprapubic hernias. METHODS A retrospective review of patients with complex suprapubic ventral hernias undergoing laparoscopic repair between 2003 and 2007 at 2 university-based practices by 1 surgeon at each facility was conducted. The operative techniques were similar and included dissection into the space of Retzius to mobilize the dome of the bladder, intraperitoneal onlay of mesh using a barrier mesh, careful tack fixation to the pubic bone and Cooper's ligaments, and extensive transfascial suture fixation of the mesh. RESULTS A total of 47 patients were reviewed, 29 women and 18 men, with a mean age of 54 years. Patients averaged 3.5 previous abdominal surgeries (SD +/-2.3) and had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 35.1 (SD +/-7.5). Previous ventral hernia repairs had been performed in 57% of patients. Average defect size was 139.8 cm(2) (SD +/-126) and average mesh size was 453.8 (SD +/-329.0), with an average hernia-to-mesh ratio of 3.2. Median length of stay was 3 days with a mean follow-up of 2.6 months (SD +/-3.1). There were 18 complications (38%): symptomatic seroma (n = 4), prolonged ileus (n = 2), chronic pain (n = 2), postoperative urinary retention (n = 2), enterotomy (n = 1), intraoperative bladder injury (n = 1), postoperative urinary tract infection (n = 1), mesh infection (n = 1), rapid ventricular rate (n = 1), small bowel obstruction (n = 1), pulmonary embolism (n = 1), and pneumonia (n = 1). One patient required conversion to open ventral hernia repair, no injury was identified. Recurrence occurred in 3 patients (6.3%). The mechanisms of recurrence included reherniation at the level of the pubic tubercle, a lateral mesh recurrence in a patient with a high BMI and small abdominal excursion, and in a pregnant patient who developed a fixation suture hernia.

However, no studies have shown systematic PBPK modeling of renal passive reabsorption or CLr for hydrophobic permeable drugs in CKD. The goal of this study was to expand our previously developed and verified mechanistic kidney model to develop a universal model to predict changes in CLr in CKD for permeable and nonpermeable drugs that accounts for the dramatic nonlinear effect of CKD on renal passive reabsorption of permeable drugs. The developed model incorporates physiologically-based tubular changes of reduced water reabsorption/increased tubular flow rate per remaining functional nephron in CKD. The final adaptive kidney model successfully (absolute fold error (AFE) all < 2) predicted renal passive reabsorption and CLr for 20 permeable and nonpermeable test compounds across the stages of CKD. In contrast, use of proportional glomerular filtration rate reduction approach without addressing tubular adaptation processes in CKD to predict CLr generated unacceptable CLr predictions (AFE = 2.61-7.35) for permeable compounds in severe CKD. Finally, the adaptive kidney model accurately predicted CLr of para-amino-hippuric acid and memantine, two secreted compounds, in CKD, suggesting successful integration of active secretion into the model, along with passive reabsorption. In conclusion, the developed adaptive kidney model enables mechanistic predictions of in vivo CLr through CKD progression without any empirical scaling factors and can be used for CLr predictions prior to assessment of drug disposition in renal impairment.","output":"Novel Mechanistic PBPK Model to Predict Renal Clearance in Varying Stages of CKD by Incorporating Tubular Adaptation and Dynamic Passive Reabsorption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compared PCR results from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients tested in the community in France from 14 June to 30 July 2021.

Among those IAQ conditions, the concentrations of CO, O3, and HCHO exceeded the regulation values of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) mostly in the morning. The concentrations of bacteria and fungi did not exceed the regulation values but still posed potential health and environment problems for workers, patients, and visitors. Therefore, self-made silver-coated zeolite (AgZ) was used as a filter material in air cleaners to remove bio-aerosols in the respiratory care ward (RCW), and the removals were still effective after 120 hr. The cumulative bio-aerosol removals for bacteria and fungi were 900 and 1,088 colony-forming units (CFU) g(-1) after 24 hr and were above 3,100 and 2,700 CFU g(-1) after 120 hr. From the research results, it is suggested that AgZ filtering could be used as a feasible engineering measure for hospitals to control their bacteria and fungi parameters in IAQ management. Hospitals should maintain their environmental management and monitoring programs and use different engineering measures to improve different IAQ parameters. IMPLICATIONS This study investigated the IAQ conditions in the field at a hospital in Chia-Yi County in southern Taiwan. Although concentrations of most parameters were still within the regulation values, the concentrations of CO, O3, and HCHO were partially exceeded. We propose a method using an air cleaner with silver-coated zeolite (AgZ) as a possible engineering measure, and there were effective reductions of bacteria and fungi to lower levels with antibacterial effects after 120 hr. Furthermore, this study implies that hospitals should continuously maintain environmental monitoring programs and adopt optimal engineering measures for different needs.","output":"Improving the indoor air quality of respiratory type of medical facility by zeolite filtering."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered national recommendations encouraging people to work from home (WFH), but the possible impact of WFH on physical behaviors is unknown. This study aimed to determine the extent to which the 24-h allocation of time to different physical behaviors changes between days working at the office (WAO) and days WFH in office workers during the pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected on 27 office workers with full-time employment at a Swedish municipal division during the COVID-19 outbreak in May-July 2020. A thigh-worn accelerometer (Axivity) was used to assess physical behavior (sedentary, stand, move) during seven consecutive days. A diary was used to identify periods of work, leisure and sleep. 24-h compositions of sedentary, standing and moving behaviors during work and non-work time were examined using Compositional data analysis (CoDA), and differences between days WAO and days WFH were determined using repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Days WFH were associated with more time spent sleeping relative to awake, and the effect size was large (F = 7.4; p = 0.01; ?p2 = 0.22). The increase (34 min) in sleep time during WFH occurred at the expense of a reduction in work and leisure time by 26 min and 7 min, respectively. Sedentary, standing and moving behaviors did not change markedly during days WFH compared to days WAO. CONCLUSION: Days working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden were associated with longer duration of sleep than days working at the office.

Parents also reported family socioeconomic characteristics and impacts of the pandemic to their physical wellbeing (e.g., whether a family member or friend had been diagnosed with COVID-19) and social disruption (e.g., whether family experienced a loss of income or employment due to the pandemic). Results: On average, children engaged with screens over 50 minutes more during the pandemic than before. This was largely driven by increases in screen use for entertainment purposes (nearly 40 minutes) and for use of educational apps (over 20 minutes). There was no overall change in screen use for socializing with family and friends. Children from lower socioeconomic status households increased screen use both for entertainment and educational app use more so than did children from higher socioeconomic status households. Conclusions: The global pandemic caused by COVID-19 has increased overall electronic screen-based media use.

However, there has been little attention directed at medical students and house officers (i.e., medical learners). This review provides pertinent evidence regarding burnout as it relates to medical learners including risk factors and potential interventions. We conclude with recommendations on future research directions and potential approaches to address this epidemic of medical learner burnout. RECENT FINDINGS: Burnout is a significant issue among medical learners that is impacted both by interpersonal and environmental factors. There are points of heightened vulnerability for medical learners throughout their training. However, studies are unable to reach consensus regarding effective interventions to mitigate the impact of burnout. Furthermore, some elements of burnout are not readily reversible even after removing risk factors. SUMMARY: Burnout is a significant concern for medical learners with wide-ranging physical, emotional, and psychosocial consequences. However, the current body of literature is sparse and does not provide consistent guidance on how to address burnout in medical learners. It is clear additional attention is needed in understanding burnout among learners and establishing proactive approaches to minimize its negative impact.","output":"The Silent Epidemic: Causes and Consequences of Medical Learner Burnout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE. Confronting the new coronavirus infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is challenging and requires excluding patients with suspected COVID-19 who actually have other diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features and CT manifestations of COVID-19 by comparing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia who presented at a fever observation department in Shanghai, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patients were retrospectively enrolled in the study from January 19 through February 6, 2020. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS. Eleven patients had RT-PCR test results that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas 22 patients had negative results. No statistical difference in clinical features was observed (p > 0.05), with the exception of leukocyte and platelet counts (p < 0.05). The mean ( SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40  2.00 and 5.52  4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5 affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of COVID-19.","output":"Clinical Features and Chest CT Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Single-Center Study in Shanghai, China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease responsible for the devastating pandemic that began at the end of 2019, has been associated with a significantly increased risk of pulmonary thrombosis, even in patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation.

The presence of pulmonary thrombosis may explain why hypoxemia is out of proportion to impairment in lung compliance in some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Because pulmonary embolism and COVID-19 pneumonia share many signs and symptoms, diagnosing pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 can be challenging.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included all consecutive patients who presented to the ER between March 13 and 23 for suspected COVID-19 and underwent CT and RT-PCR within 3 days. Using a structured report, radiologists prospectively classified CTs in highly suggestive, suggestive, and non-suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. Ground-glass, consolidation, and visual extension of parenchymal changes were collected. Three different RT-PCR-based reference standard definitions were used. Oxygen saturation level, CRP, LDH, and blood cell counts were collected and compared between CT/RT-PCR classes. RESULTS: The study included 696 patients (41.4% women; age 59  15.8 years): 423/454 (93%) patients with highly suggestive CT, 97/127 (76%) with suggestive CT, and 31/115 (27%) with non-suggestive CT had positive RT-PCR. CT sensitivity ranged from 73 to 77% and from 90 to 94% for high and low positivity threshold, respectively. Specificity ranged from 79 to 84% for high positivity threshold and was about 58% for low positivity threshold. PPV remained  90% in all cases. Ground-glass was more frequent in patients with positive RT-PCR in all CT classes. Blood tests were significantly associated with RT-PCR and CT classes. Leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets decreased, CRP and LDH increased from non-suggestive to suggestive CT classes. CONCLUSIONS: During the outbreak peak (in a high-prevalence setting), CT presented high PPV and may be considered a good reference to recognize COVID-19 patients while waiting for RT-PCR confirmation.

FI was calculated by populating study results into a two-by-two contingency table and generating a p-value using Fisher's exact test. Next, events were manually added to the group with the fewest events, while removing a non-event from the same group and Fisher's exact test repeated until the p-value was >0.05. FQ was calculated by dividing FI by the total sample size. RESULTS The 130 included articles were published between 1986-2018 in 32 journals. Median citation count was 14(0-252), 30% were RCTs and most papers originated in the United States(28%), Turkey(10%) and Canada(9%). Median FI was 2(1-112], FQ was0.023 (0.0010-0.55) and 60 papers(46%) had a fragility index of 1, indicating extremely fragile results.

During the so-called 'first wave', infection rates among this population group have ranged between 10% and 20%, raising as high as one in every four COVID-19 patients in Spain at the peak of the crisis. Now that many countries are already dealing with new waves of COVID-19 cases, a potential competition between HCW and non-HCW patients for scarce resources can still be a likely clinical scenario. In this paper, we address the question of whether HCW who become ill with COVID-19 should be prioritised in diagnostic, treatment or resource allocation protocols. We will evaluate some of the proposed arguments both in favour and against the prioritisation of HCW and also consider which clinical circumstances might warrant prioritising HCW and why could it be ethically appropriate to do so. We conclude that prioritising HCW's access to protective equipment, diagnostic tests or even prophylactic or therapeutic drug regimes and vaccines might be ethically defensible. However, prioritising HCWs to receive intensive care unit (ICU) beds or ventilators is a much more nuanced decision, in which arguments such as instrumental value or reciprocity might not be enough, and economic and systemic values will need to be considered.","output":"Should healthcare workers be prioritised during the COVID-19 pandemic?

The 3CL protease (3CLpro) is a highly conserved protease which is indispensable for CoVs replication, and is a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. In this study we investigated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of Shuanghuanglian preparation, a Chinese traditional patent medicine with a long history for treating respiratory tract infection in China. We showed that either the oral liquid of Shuanghuanglian, the lyophilized powder of Shuanghuanglian for injection or their bioactive components dose-dependently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro as well as the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. Baicalin and baicalein, two ingredients of Shuanghuanglian, were characterized as the first noncovalent, nonpeptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography was distinctly different from those of known 3CLpro inhibitors. Baicalein was productively ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a shield in front of the catalytic dyad to effectively prevent substrate access to the catalytic dyad within the active site. Overall, this study provides an example for exploring the in vitro potency of Chinese traditional patent medicines and effectively identifying bioactive ingredients toward a specific target, and gains evidence supporting the in vivo studies of Shuanghuanglian oral liquid as well as two natural products for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in vitro of Shuanghuanglian preparations and bioactive ingredients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of COVID-19 disrupted lives across the United States. Evidence shows that such a climate is deleterious to mental health and may increase demand for mental health services in emergency departments. The purpose of this study was to determine the difference in emergency department utilization for mental health diagnoses before and after the COVID-19 surge. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study between JanuaryCAugust 2019 and JanuaryCAugust 2020 with emergency department encounter as the sampling unit. The primary outcome was the proportion of all emergency department encounters attributed to mental health. We performed chi-square analyses to evaluate the differences between 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: We found that overall emergency department volume declined between 2019 and 2020, while the proportion attributable to mental health conditions increased (p < 0.01). Substance abuse, anxiety, and mood disorders accounted for nearly 90% of mental health diagnoses during both periods. When stratified by sex, substance abuse was the leading mental health diagnosis for males and anxiety and substance abuse disorders combined accounted for the largest proportion for females. DISCUSSION: The emergency department is an important community resource for the identification and triage of mental health emergencies. This role is even more important during disasters and extended crises, making it imperative that emergency departments employ experienced mental health staff. This study provides a comparison of emergency department utilization for mental health diagnoses before the pandemic and during the spring 2020 surge and may serve as a useful guide for hospitals, health systems and communities in future planning.","output":"Emergency department utilization for mental health conditions before and after the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Analysis of the results of emergency carotid endarterectomy (CEE) in internal carotid artery (ICA) thrombosis in the acute period of acute cerebrovascular accident (ACVI) in patients with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During the COVID-19 pandemic (April 1, 2020 - May 1, 2021), 43 patients with ICA thrombosis and a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result for SARS-CoV-2 were included in this prospective study. In all cases, CEE was performed in the acutest period of ACVA. These patients were included in group 1. The comparison group was represented by 89 patients who underwent CEE in the acute period of stroke, in the period before the COVID-19 pandemic (April 1, 2019 - March 1.2020). RESULTS: In the hospital postoperative period, the groups were comparable in terms of the incidence of deaths (group 1: 2.3%, n=1; group 2: 1.1%, n=1; p=0.81; OR=2.09; 95% CI=0.12-34.3) myocardial infarction (group 1: 2.3%, n=1; group 2: 0%; p=0.7; OR=6.3; 95% CI=0.25-158.5), CVA (group 1: 2.3%, n=1; group 2: 2.2%, n=2; p=0.55; OR=1.03; 95% CI=0.09-11.,7).

During PP, trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) is not always easy, mainly due to the forced position of the neck of the patient. Moreover, during a pandemic, given the great number of patients needing treatment, TEE probes and monitoring devices are not widely available. Then, trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) plays a crucial role as it is non-invasive, repeatable, and available every time it is needed. Moreover, it can be safely performed also in prone position (TTEp). According to in-hospital protocol, TTEp was performed using the apical-four-chamber (A-4-C) view in 8 patients. We temporarily deflated the lower thoracic section of the air-mattress to place the probe between the mattress surface and the thorax of the patient. We collected both TEE and hemodynamics data. The main result of our retrospective analysis is that TTE can be performed in patients in prone positioning and is reliable and repeatable; the single apical-four-chamber view provides sufficient data to evaluate the cardiac performance in case of scarce availability of hemodynamic monitoring devices, like in a pandemic setting.

However, to date, there is no consensus on the extent to which those factors are correlated with social support among left-behind children. We thus performed a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the previous findings. Methods: Two investigators systematically and independently searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Wan Fang, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and China Science Technology Journal Database (VIP) on January 9, 2022. Pooled Pearson's correlation coefficients between social support and loneliness, self-esteem, and resilience were calculated by Stata 16.0 software using random effects model. Results: Forty-seven studies involving a total of 30 212 left-behind children were identified. A large degree of negative correlation was found between social support and loneliness [summary r: -0.36 (95% CI: -0.42- -0.30), p < 0.001]. Large positive correlations were found between social support and self-esteem, and resilience [self-esteem: summary r: 0.33 (95% CI: 0.24-0.41), p < 0.001; resilience: summary r: 0.45 (95% CI: 0.38-0.50), p < 0.001]. The pooled correlations revealed some discrepancies when stratified by some moderators. Sensitivity analysis also revealed the robustness of the findings. The Egger regression and Duvall and Tweedle trim-and-fill procedure suggest the absence of publication bias. Conclusion: The current meta-analysis provided solid evidence that social support has a high degree of negative correlation with loneliness and a high degree of positive correlation with self-esteem and resilience among left-behind children in mainland China. This indicated that left-behind children with high levels of social support tend to have lower levels of loneliness and higher levels of self-esteem and resilience.

Methods We mailed a web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) mailing list on the 17th April 2020 and we pre-determined to close the survey on the 21st April 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons opinion using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. Results A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least one consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions:1) before any hospital admission for cardiac surgery, nasopharyngeal swab, r-PCR and chest CT should be performed; 2) the use of full PPE should to be adopted in every case by the theatre team regardless patients COVID-19 status; 3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; 4) cardiac procedure should be decided based on a rapidly convened multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient.

Sediments were obtained from a low to moderately polluted estuary, a highly polluted harbour and from the mixture of both field-collected sediments. Biometry data were recorded. Liver, brain, gills, and gonads were dissected out and processed to determine markers of oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and lysosomal biomarkers, and histopathology. Analyses of sediment granulometry and chemical profiles indicated different degrees of toxicity and suggested a distinct release of pollutants from each sediment in relation with their physicochemical properties. Interestingly, biological responses were in agreement with contaminant levels reported in source sediments. The most distinct toxicopathic effects were detected upon exposure to the harbour's sediment and particularly on day 28. Overall, enhanced hepatic glutathione-S-transferase activity and lysosomal enlargement were detected in all experimental groups, demonstrating a toxic effect from all sediments whilst catalase inhibition, lysosomal membrane destabilisation, changes in lysosomal content and liver histopathology were most pronounced in soles exposed to the harbour's sediment.

However, where routine immunisation is weak, an over-reliance on vaccination campaigns may lead to heterogeneous coverage. Here, we assessed the impact of a health system strengthening (HSS) intervention on the relative contribution of routine immunisation and outreach activities to reach immunisation goals in rural Madagascar. METHODS: We obtained data from health centres in Ifanadiana district on the monthly number of recommended vaccines (BCG, measles, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) and polio) delivered to children, during 2014C2018. We also analysed data from a district-representative cohort carried out every 2 years in over 1500 households in 2014C2018. We compared changes inside and outside the HSS catchment in the delivery of recommended vaccines, population-level vaccination coverage, geographical and economic inequalities in coverage, and timeliness of vaccination. The impact of HSS was quantified via mixed-effects logistic regressions. RESULTS: The HSS intervention was associated with a significant increase in immunisation rates (OR between 1.22 for measles and 1.49 for DTP), which diminished over time. Outreach activities were associated with a doubling in immunisation rates, but their effect was smaller in the HSS catchment. Analysis of cohort data revealed that HSS was associated with higher vaccination coverage (OR between 1.18 per year of HSS for measles and 1.43 for BCG), a reduction in economic inequality, and a higher proportion of timely vaccinations. Yet, the lower contribution of outreach activities in the HSS catchment was associated with persistent inequalities in geographical coverage, which prevented achieving international coverage targets.

There is a continuing need for clinicians to adapt practice to facilitate timely provision of medical care, whilst minimising horizontal transmission. Guidance and recommendations are increasingly available, and this rapid review aimed to provide a timely evidence synthesis on the current recommendations surrounding urogynaecological care. METHODS: We performed a literature review using PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane and a manual search of national and international societies for management recommendations for urogynaecological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Nine guidance documents and 17 articles, including 10 reviews, were included. Virtual clinics are recommended for new and follow-up patients, to assess and initiate treatment, as well as triage patients who require face-to-face appointments. Outpatient investigations such as urodynamics and cystoscopy for benign indications can be deferred. Prolapse and continence surgery should be suspended, except in specific circumstances such as procidentia with upper tract complications and failed pessaries. There is no evidence to support a particular route of surgery, but recommendations are made to minimise COVID-19 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Urogynaecological patients face particular challenges owing to inherent vulnerabilities of these populations. Behavioural and medical therapies should be recommended as first line options and initiated via virtual or remote clinics, which are integral to management during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: The clinical characteristics and microbiological results of 181 patients caused by CRO infection treated with polymyxin B in the First Affiliated Hospital from July 2018 to May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The bacterial clearance rate, clinical efficacy, adverse drug reactions and 28 days mortality were evaluated. RESULTS: The overall effective rate of 181 patients was 49.72%, the total bacterial clearance rate was 42.0%, and the 28 day all-cause mortality rate was 59.1%. The effective rate and bacterial clearance rate in the group of less than 24 h from the isolation of CRO to the use of polymyxin B were significantly higher than those in the group of more than 24 h. Logistics multivariate regression analysis showed that the predictive factors for effective treatment of CRO with polymyxin B were APACHEII score, duration of polymyxin B treatment, combination of polymyxin B and other antibiotics, and bacterial clearance. 17 cases (9.36%) of acute kidney injury were considered as polymyxin B nephrotoxicity and 4 cases (23.5%) recovered after polymyxin B withdrawal. After 14 days of polymyxin B use, 3 cases of polymyxin B resistance appeared, and there were 2 cases of polymyxin B resistance in the daily dose 1.5 mg/kg/day group. CONCLUSION: For CRO infection, the treatment of polymyxin B should be early, combined, optimal dose and duration of treatment, which can achieve better clinical efficacy and microbial reactions, and reduce the adverse reactions and drug resistance.","output":"Efficacy and safety of polymyxin B in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative organisms infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aimed to explore the effects of physical activity and training routine on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and the proclaimed emergency state and curfew. To measure the mental health components of psychological distress and subjective well-being, two studies were conducted on different samples: Study 1 during the beginning of curfew in Serbia (N = 678) and Study 2 during the ending phase (N = 398). The results of Study 1 showed that elite athletes as well as those with high level of physical activity experienced the lowest distress. Furthermore, effects of the changes in the training routine on distress among physically active individuals depended on the level of sports participation with elite athletes who reduced trainings showing lower anxiety compared to recreational athletes who reduced trainings as well or kept the same training routine. Thus, we could conclude that in the early stage of the pandemic, elite athletes showed better mental health and adaptability to the crisis situation. Results of Study 2 showed that although all the participants had decreased well-being during the curfew, compared to the period before the pandemic and the curfew, there were no differences in well-being between elite and recreational athletes, who had higher well-being compared to non-athletes. However, this effect held both before and during the curfew showing that physically active individuals did not additionally benefit from this decrease compared to the non-active. Furthermore, athletes who became physically inactive showed lower well-being compared to those who kept the same training routine. Thus, in the later stage of the pandemic, prolonged physical inactivity had negative effects on mental health.","output":"Effects of Physical Activity and Training Routine on Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Curfew"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, an outbreak of novel corona virus pneumonia occurred in Wuhan City, China, and spread throughout the whole of country in a short period.

Data mining of viral-infection-related RNA-sequencing data has resulted in the identification of 28 754, 720 and 3437 circRNAs encoded by MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. MERS-CoV exhibits much more prominent ability to encode circRNAs in all genomic regions than those of SARS-CoV-1/2. Viral circRNAs typically exhibit low expression levels. Moreover, majority of the viral circRNAs exhibit expressions only in the late stage of viral infection. Analysis of the competitive interactions of viral circRNAs, human miRNAs and mRNAs in MERS-CoV infections reveals that viral circRNAs up-regulated genes related to mRNA splicing and processing in the early stage of viral infection, and regulated genes involved in diverse functions including cancer, metabolism, autophagy, viral infection in the late stage of viral infection. Similar analysis in SARS-CoV-2 infections reveals that its viral circRNAs down-regulated genes associated with metabolic processes of cholesterol, alcohol, fatty acid and up-regulated genes associated with cellular responses to oxidative stress in the late stage of viral infection. A few genes regulated by viral circRNAs from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were enriched in several biological processes such as response to reactive oxygen and centrosome localization.

RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are safe in SOT recipients and not related to rejection or other major adverse events. The immune response to two doses of vaccine is suboptimal and correlated to age and magnitude of immunosuppression. Administration of a third vaccine dose brings to significant amplification of immune response.

Decreased glycolytic output in latently infected cells is associated with downregulation of NAD(+)/NADH. Consequently, infected cells rely on the parallel pentose phosphate pathway and its main product, NADPH, fueling antioxidant pathways maintaining HIV\\\\1 latency. Of note, blocking NADPH downstream effectors, thioredoxin and glutathione, favors HIV\\\\1 reactivation from latency in lymphoid and myeloid cellular models.

The M gene encodes the most abundant viral structural protein, and is implicated in multiple viral functions, including initial attachment to the host cell via heparin sulphate proteoglycan, viral protein assembly in conjunction with the N and E genes, and enhanced glucose transport. We have identified a recent spike in the frequency of reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes carrying M gene mutations. This is associated with emergence of a new sub-B.1 clade, B.1.I82T, defined by the previously unreported M:I82T mutation within TM3, the third of three membrane spanning helices implicated in glucose transport. The frequency of this mutation increased in the USA from 0.014% in October 2020 to 1.62% in February 2021, a 116-fold change. While constituting 0.7% of the isolates overall, M:I82T sub-B.1 lineage accounted for 14.4% of B.1 lineage isolates in February 2021, similar to the rapid initial increase previously seen with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.429 lineages, which quickly became the dominant lineages in Europe and California over a period of several months. A similar increase in incidence was also noted in another related mutation, V70L, also within the TM2 transmembrane helix. These M mutations are associated with younger patient age (4.6 to 6.3 years). The rapid emergence of this B.1.I82T clade, recently named Pangolin B.1.575 lineage, suggests that this M gene mutation is more biologically fit, perhaps related to glucose uptake during viral replication, and should be included in ongoing genomic surveillance efforts and warrants further evaluation for potentially increased pathogenic and therapeutic implications.","output":"Emerging variants of concern in SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein: a highly conserved target with potential pathological and therapeutic implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Routine screening CT for the identification of COVID-19 pneumonia is currently not recommended by most radiology societies.

With the transition of all instruction to the online environment, teachers in Serbia have faced a number of challenges and barriers that have affected the quality of their work. In this paper, we wanted to analyse the barriers that teachers faced during the first months of distance learning. The research was conducted combining quantitative and qualitative analysis of data collected on a sample of 122 high school teachers from the Southeast Serbia (Ni?, Leskovac). The results show that teachers recognise evaluation barriers as the predominant ones, followed by organisational-administrative ones, while the least represented were material-technical barriers to distance learning. The findings also confirm that material and technical barriers are most common among teachers with the longest work experience, as well as that organisational-administrative and socio-emotional barriers are the least common among teachers of vocational subjects. Although the focus of the paper was on the barriers in the implementation of distance learning, it can be concluded that teachers recognise certain benefits of this type of instruction and indicate that it can be used as a supplement to regular instruction. The main pedagogical implications of the paper refer to the empowerment of teachers through professional development in the field of distance learning, but also to the need to create new professional development programmes in this field which will enable the development of functional knowledge and relevant competencies for the immediate situational context of modern instruction. ? 2021, Institut za Istrazivanja.

Oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) appear in COVID-19-infected lungs due to oxidative stress, after which they promote the induction of tissue factor (TF) expression and inflammatory programmers in monocytes, as well as activate endothelial cells to recruit and bind to monocytes. Therefore, we aimed to demonstrate the role of OxPLs in inflammatory and procoagulant responses in COVID-19 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test and ten healthy donors were included in the study. Peripheral blood was drawn at inclusion for OxPAPC, IFN-?3, and CCL2 serum level measurements. Clinical data were collected from electronic patient medical files. The serum levels of OxPAPC, IFN?3, and CCL2 were measured by immune assays. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were included in the study. OxPAPC and CCL2 were higher in the patients than in the controls (<0.003 and 0.011, respectively). INF-?3 did not significantly differ between groups. There was no difference between the patients with lung involvement and those without CCL2, INF-?3, and OxPAPC. D-dimer, CRP, and ferritin were higher in the patients with lung involvement. Serum levels of INF-?3 and CCL2 were positively correlated with each other (r:0.757, p<0.0001), but no correlation was detected between OxPAPC and INF-?3 or CCL2. There was no correlation between OxPAPC and hematologic or biochemical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: OxPAPC, which is thought to contribute to hypercoagulability, was found to be high in the patients with Covid-19 infection.

The kindergartens reopened on April 20, and the schools on April 27 and May 11 of 2020. The effect of these measures is largely unknown since the role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still unclear. There are only a few studies of school closures as a separate intervention to other social distancing measures, and little research exists on the effect of school opening during a pandemic. Objective: This study aimed to model the effect of opening kindergartens and the schools in Norway in terms of a change in the reproduction number (R). A secondary objective was to assess if we can use the estimated R after school openings to infer the rates of transmission between children in schools. Methods: We used an individual-based model (IBM) to assess the reopening of kindergartens and schools in two Norwegian cities, Oslo, the Norwegian capital, with a population of approximately 680 000, and Tromsoe, which is the largest city in Northern Norway, with a population of approximately 75 000. The model uses demographic information and detailed data about the schools in both cities. We carried out an ensemble study to obtain robust results in spite of the considerable uncertainty that remains about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Results: We found that reopening of Norwegian kindergartens and schools are associated with a change in R of 0.10 (95%CI 0.04-0.16) and 0.14 (95%CI 0.01-0.25) in the two cities under investigation if the in-school transmission rates for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are equal to what Ferguson et al. have previously estimated for influenza pandemics [1]. Conclusion: We found only a limited effect of reopening schools on the reproduction number, and we expect the same to hold true in other countries where nonpharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the pandemic. Consequently, current R-estimates are insufficiently accurate for determining the transmission rates in schools. For countries that have not opened schools yet, planned interventions, such as the opening of selected schools, can be useful to infer general knowledge about children-to-children transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Modelling Suggests Limited Change in the Reproduction Number from Reopening Norwegian Kindergartens and Schools During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The best way to teach human gross anatomy to medical students has often been debated, although recent studies emphasize on the benefits of dissection-based courses (DOI 10 1002/ase 1859) Prosection and model-based courses, online and virtual reality approaches have been introduced over time, due to reduction in teaching time, and due to economic reasons with decreasing budget In 2020, we were challenged by the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding COVID-19 public health measures We had to change and adapt several times anatomy teaching and learning over the two semesters for the cohort of 112 first/second year undergraduate medical students With the experience of this student cohort with various anatomy learning approaches, we wanted to know what anatomy teaching method was best perceived by the students Methods 112 medical students were asked about their learning experience with various anatomy teaching approaches for 2020, including 1) dissection-based learning, 2) prosections and models-based demonstrations, 3) structured self-directed learning using written instructions and corresponding anatomical material, 4) structured self-directed learning using online instructions via Moodle and an online anatomy program (https://e-learn anatomy uzh ch/Anatomy/Anatomy html;German version) All students agreed to participate in the study The questionnaire was administered by https://www surveymonkey com and done anonymously To date 66/112 (59%) students replied Results The majority of the students (92%) preferred the dissection course as their main anatomy learning method, 80% of students were happy with a demonstration course using prosections and anatomical models Only a minority liked to have structured self-directed learning with either anatomical specimens and models (42%) or with online material (36%) Rather few students preferred learning with an online course (18%) or through unstructured self-directed learning using their own resources (12%) For the dissection course the students appreciated the 3 dimensional aspect (92%), the real size appearance of the structures (90%), the active explorative approach (81%), the topographical relationship of the structures (81%) and anatomical variability (72%) During complete lock-down of the COVID-19 measures when the students had to stay isolated at home for several weeks, the majority of students thought that the offered online structured self-directed course was most adequate under those circumstances (55%), but would otherwise not be the preferred replacement of a dissection course (55%) Conclusion Evaluation of student experience with a variety of anatomy learning methods clearly indicate that a structured dissection-based course with additional anatomical demonstration would be preferred by the majority of our students Online material would be beneficial as additional learning support However, the majority of students agreed that, under strict COVID-19 stay-at-home measures, the structured self-directed online course was the best way to learn anatomy When going back to normal, we will offer the newly developed online material for guided self-directed learning, in addition to the established dissection course","output":"Anatomy Learning under COVID-19 Measures: A Real World Educational Experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Few data in the literature are available about the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare providers in Italy, especially with regards to different regions. In the present work, the VIRARE survey was addressed to all the healthcare providers in the Lazio region and, in particular, to those working in the oncology field. Healthcare providers opinions on the impact and on the management of the pandemic have been analyzed, to provide an exhaustive overview about the level of their experienced psychological distress. ABSTRACT: While the emotional response of healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic has been extensively investigated in countries in the Far-East, little is known about the psychological impact and the associated emotional distress of healthcare providers in Italy, especially with regard to different regions. The aim of the VIRARE survey, which was addressed to all the healthcare providers in the Lazio region (central Italy) and, in particular, to those working in the oncology field, is to analyze their opinion on the impact and management of the pandemic, to better understand the level of their psychological distress. A global good psychological response of healthcare providers to the pandemic has emerged, independently from their different occupations in the oncology field. Healthcare providers show a high degree of resilience, identifying the major causes of distress the difficulty of the management of this situation, the obstacles in their working activity and expressing a high degree of dissatisfaction with how Italian institutions handled this situation. This survey also provides a direct comparison between COVID-19-infected (or directly in contact with COVID-19-infected patients) and uninfected healthcare providers, identifying the sub-category of infected professionals that reported signs of depression as particularly vulnerable.","output":"The Experience of Oncology Healthcare Providers in the Central Italy during the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of COVID-19 posed the issue of urgently identifying treatment strategies. Colchicine was considered for this purpose based on well-recognised anti-inflammatory effects and potential antiviral properties. In the present study, colchicine was proposed to patients with COVID-19, and its effects compared with standard-of-care (SoC). METHODS: In the public hospital of Esine, northern Italy, 140 consecutive inpatients, with virologically and radiographically confirmed COVID-19 admitted in the period 5C19 March 2020, were treated with SoC (hydroxychloroquine and/or intravenous dexamethasone; and/or lopinavir/ritonavir). They were compared with 122 consecutive inpatients, admitted between 19 March and 5 April 2020, treated with colchicine (1 mg/day) and SoC (antiviral drugs were stopped before colchicine, due to potential interaction). RESULTS: Patients treated with colchicine had a better survival rate as compared with SoC at 21 days of follow-up (84.2% (SE=3.3%) vs 63.6% (SE=4.1%), p=0.001). Cox proportional hazards regression survival analysis showed that a lower risk of death was independently associated with colchicine treatment (HR=0.151 (95% CI 0.062 to 0.368), p<0.0001), whereas older age, worse PaO2/FiO2, and higher serum levels of ferritin at entry were associated with a higher risk. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study may support the rationale of use of colchicine for the treatment of COVID-19.

Therefore, this paper was aimed to explore the research of VR in aiding therapy, thus providing a potential guideline for futures application of therapeutic VR in healthcare towards Health 4.0. A mixed research method was adopted for this research, which comprised the use of a bibliometric analysis (a quantitative method) to conduct a macro overview of VR-aided therapy, the identification of significant research structures and topics, and a qualitative review of the literature to reveal deeper insights. Four major research areas of VR-aided therapy were identified and investigated, i.e., post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and fear related disorder (A&F), diseases of the nervous system (DNS), and pain management, including related medical conditions, therapies, methods, and outcomes. This study is the first to use VOSviewer, a commonly used software tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks and developed by Center for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, the Netherlands, to conduct bibliometric analyses on VR-aided therapy from the perspective of Web of Science core collection (WoSc), which objectively and visually shows research structures and topics, therefore offering instructive insights for health care stakeholders (particularly researchers and service providers) such as including integrating more innovative therapies, emphasizing psychological benefits, using game elements, and introducing design research.

We undertook an online survey to measure the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in Indonesia. The WTP was assessed using a simple dichotomous contingent valuation approach and a linear regression model was used to assess its associated determinants. There were 1,359 respondents who completed the survey. In total, 78.3% (1,065) were willing to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine with a mean and median WTP of US$ 57.20 (95%CI: US$ 54.56, US$ 59.85) and US$ 30.94 (95%CI: US$ 30.94, US$ 30.94), respectively. Being a health-care worker, having a high income, and having high perceived risk were associated with higher WTP. These findings suggest that the WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high in Indonesia. This WTP information can be used to construct a payment model for a COVID-19 vaccine in the country. Nevertheless, to attain higher vaccine coverage, it may be necessary to partially subsidize the vaccine for those who are less wealthy and to design health promotion materials to increase the perceived risk for COVID-19 in the country.","output":"Willingness-to-pay for a COVID-19 vaccine and its associated determinants in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Pathogens are often not identified in severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and the few studies using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for virus detection are from temperate countries. OBJECTIVE This study assesses if PCR amplification improves virus and bacteria detection, and if viral infection contributes to mortality in severe CAP in a tropical setting, where respiratory pathogens have less well-defined seasonality. METHODS In this cohort study of patients with severe CAP in an intensive care unit, endotracheal aspirates for intubated patients and nasopharyngeal swabs for non-intubated patients were sent for PCR amplification for respiratory viruses. Blood, endotracheal aspirates for intubated patients, and sputum for non-intubated patients were analysed using a multiplex PCR system for bacteria. RESULTS Out of 100 patients, using predominantly cultures, bacteria were identified in 42 patients; PCR amplification increased this number to 55 patients. PCR amplification identified viruses in 32 patients. In total, only bacteria, only viruses, and both bacteria and viruses were found in 37, 14, and 18 patients, respectively. The commonest viruses were influenza A H1N1/2009 and rhinovirus; the commonest bacterium was Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hospital mortality rates for patients with no pathogens, bacterial infection, viral infection, and bacterial-viral co-infection were 16.1, 24.3, 0, and 5.6%, respectively (p = 0.10). On multivariable analysis, virus detection was associated with lower mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.12, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.99; p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS Viruses and bacteria were detected in 7 of 10 patients with severe CAP with the aid of PCR amplification.

The recognition by and activation of the innate immune response recruits neutrophils, which, through their different mechanisms of action, form extracellular neutrophil traps, playing a role in infection control and trapping viral, bacterial, and fungal etiological agents. However, in patients with COVID-19, activation at the vascular level, combined with other cells and inflammatory mediators, leads to thrombotic events and disseminated intravascular coagulation, thus leading to a series of clinical manifestations in cerebrovascular, cardiac, pulmonary, and kidney disease while promoting severe disease and mortality. Previous studies of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have shown that elevated levels of markers specific for NETs, such as free DNA, MPO, and H3Cit, are strongly associated with the total neutrophil count; with acute phase reactants that include CRP, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and interleukin secretion; and with an increased risk of severe COVID-19.

For some services, there were small declines in utilization among women residing in zip codes that are lower income with higher proportions of non-White and nonCEnglish-speaking residents. Meaning The pandemic has disrupted the utilization of womens preventive health services and may be associated with increased disparities in access to these services. Importance The association of the COVID-19 pandemic with womens preventive health care use is unknown. Objective To describe utilization of womens preventive health services. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional study of women aged 18 to 74 years enrolled in a commercial health maintenance organization in Michigan. Exposures COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2020). Main Outcomes and Measures Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of receiving breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening, long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) insertions, and pharmacy-obtained contraception, adjusted for month, age, county, zip code characteristics (per-capita income, non-White percentage of population, nonCEnglish-proficient percentage of population), and plan designation (primary plan holder vs dependent). Results The study population included 685 373 women aged 18 to 74 years, enrolled for 13 000 715 person-months, of whom 10 061 275 person-months (77.4%) were among women aged 25 to 64 years and 8 020 215 (61.7%) were the primary plan holder, with mean zip code per capita income of $33 708, 20.2% mean zip code non-White population, and 3.4% mean zip code nonCEnglish-speaking population. For services requiring an in-person visit (breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, STI testing, and LARC insertions), utilization declined by 60% to 90% during the spring of 2020, with a nadir in April 2020, after which utilization for all services recovered to close to 2019 levels by July 2020. Claims for pharmacy-obtained hormonal contraceptives in 2020 were consistently 15% to 30% lower than 2019. The AORs of a woman receiving a given preventive service in 2020 compared with 2019 were significantly lower for breast cancer screening (AOR, 0.80;95% CI, 0.79-0.80), cervical cancer screening (AOR, 0.80;95% CI, 0.80-0.81), STI screening (AOR, 0.83;95% CI, 0.82-0.84), LARC insertion (AOR, 0.87;95% CI, 0.84-0.90), and pharmacy-obtained contraception (AOR, 0.73;95% CI, 0.72-0.74) (all P < .001).

OBJECTIVE: To synthesize evidence regarding the ability of postnatal weight gainCbased algorithms to predict type 1 or severe ROP. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify studies published between January 2000 and August 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective and retrospective studies evaluating the ability of these algorithms to predict type 1 or severe ROP were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data. This meta-analysis was performed according to the Cochrane guidelines and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ability of algorithms to predict type 1 or sever ROP was measured using statistical indices (pooled sensitivity, specificity, and summary area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, as well as pooled negative likelihood ratios and positive likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios). RESULTS: A total of 61 studies (>37 000 infants) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.92) and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.51-0.63) for WINROP (Weight, IGF-1 [insulinlike growth factor 1], Neonatal, ROP), 1.00 (95% CI, 0.88-1.00) and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.15-0.93) for G-ROP (Postnatal Growth and ROP), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.71-0.99) and 0.52 (95% CI, 0.36-0.68) for CHOP ROP (Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia ROP), 0.99 (95% CI, 0.73-1.00) and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.03-0.74) for ROPScore, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99) and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.22-0.51) for CO-ROP (Colorado ROP). The original PINT (Premature Infants in Need of Transfusion) ROP study reported a sensitivity of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.91-0.99) and a specificity of 0.36 (95% CI, 0.30-0.42). The pooled negative likelihood ratios were 0.19 (95% CI, 0.13-0.27) for WINROP, 0.0 (95% CI, 0.00-0.32) for G-ROP, 0.10 (95% CI, 0.02-0.53) for CHOP ROP, 0.03 (95% CI, 0.00-0.77) for ROPScore, and 0.07 (95% CI, 0.03-0.16) for CO-ROP. The pooled positive likelihood ratios were 2.1 (95% CI, 1.8-2.4) for WINROP, 2.5 (95% CI, 0.7-9.1) for G-ROP, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.5-2.6) for CHOP ROP, 1.9 (95% CI, 1.1-3.3) for ROPScore, and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.9) for CO-ROP. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that weight gainCbased algorithms have adequate sensitivity and negative likelihood ratios to provide reasonable certainty in ruling out type 1 ROP or severe ROP. Given the implications of missing even a single case of severe ROP, algorithms with very high sensitivity (close to 100%) and low negative likelihood ratios (close to zero) need to be chosen to safely reduce the number of unnecessary examinations in infants at lower risk of severe ROP.","output":"The Use of Postnatal Weight Gain Algorithms to Predict Severe or Type 1 Retinopathy of Prematurity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To detect the presence of infectious bronchitis virus or avian coronavirus, a nested reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) method was developed with the aim of amplifying a fragment of 530 bases, comprising the gene coding S1 protein. In the first step, all samples were submitted to RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and nested PCR. Next, only the positive nested-PCR samples were propagated in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs for virus isolation. Positive samples were then sequenced and analyzed using a molecular phylogeny approach. Tracheal swab samples were collected from 23 different domestic chickens distributed in three regions of Brazil, in the period between 2003 and 2009. Also analyzed were six swab samples (tracheal and cloacal) from asymptomatic pigeons (Columba livia), caught in an urbanized region in southeastern Brazil. The study revealed two major phylogenetic groups: one clustered with the Massachusetts vaccine serotype and another joined with the D207 strain. Interestingly, samples grouped with the Connecticut and Arkansas serotypes were also found. Pigeon isolates clustered with the Massachusetts serotype showed significant similarity (close to 100%) to those obtained from chickens. Only one pigeon isolate was seen to be grouped with the Connecticut serotype, and no correlation was observed between sample grouping and region origin. Understanding the diversity of genotypes and eco-epizootiology of the disease in different environments is expected to be helpful for vaccine production aimed at the main circulating variants. In this respect, one could also expect benefits in the management of other bird species that may act as avian coronavirus reservoirs.","output":"Genetic diversity of avian infectious bronchitis virus isolated from domestic chicken flocks and coronaviruses from feral pigeons in Brazil between 2003 and 2009."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Common themes from the AIDS and COVID\\\\19 pandemics are reviewed from the vantage point of a statistician at the National Institutes of Health.","output":"Comment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human polyomaviruses are widespread in human populations and are able to cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals.

Among the causes recently cited are chronic infections engendered by microorganisms that often go unnoticed. A typical illustration of such a case is infection due to mollicutes bacteria. Generally known by their lurking nature, urogenital mollicutes are the most incriminated in PCa. This study was thus carried out in an attempt to establish the presence of these mollicutes by PCR in biopsies of confirmed PCa patients and to evaluate their prevalence. METHODS: A total of 105 Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded prostate tissues collected from 50 patients suffering from PCa and 55 with benign prostate hyperplasia were subjected to PCR amplification targeting species-specific genes of 5 urogenital mollicutes species, Mycoplasma genitalium, M. hominis, M. fermentans, Ureaplasma parvum, and U. urealyticum. PCR products were then sequenced to confirm species identification. Results significance was statistically assessed using Chi-square and Odds ratio tests. RESULTS: PCR amplification showed no positive results for M. genitalium, M. hominis, and M. fermentans in all tested patients. Strikingly, Ureaplasma spp. were detected among 30% (15/50) of PCa patients. Nucleotide sequencing further confirmed the identified ureaplasma species, which were distributed as follows: 7 individuals with only U. parvum, 5 with only U. urealyticum, and 3 co-infection cases. Association of the two ureaplasma species with PCa cases proved statistically significant (P < 0.05), and found to represent a risk factor. Of note, Ureaplasma spp. were mostly identified in patients aged 60 and above with prostatic specific antigen (PSA) level > 4 ng/ml and an invasive malignant prostate tumor (Gleason score 8C10). CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovered a significant association of Ureaplasma spp. with PCa arguing in favour of their potential involvement in this condition.

Here, we investigated the impact of the furin cleavage site on viral growth and pathogensis using a hamster animal model infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing mutations at the furin cleavage site (S gene mutants). In the airway tissues of hamsters, the S gene mutants exhibited a low growth property. In contrast to parental pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, hamsters infected with the S gene mutants showed no body weight loss and only a mild inflammatory response, indicating the attenuated variant nature of S gene mutants. We reproduced the attenuated growth of S gene mutants in primary differenciated human airway epithelial cells. This transient infection was enough to induce protective neutralizing antibodies crossreacting with different SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Consequently, hamsters inoculated with S gene mutants showed resistance to subsequent infection with both the parental strain and the currently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants belonging to lineages B.1.1.7 and P.1. Together, our findings revealed that the loss of the furin cleavage site causes attenuation in the airway tissues of SARS-CoV-2 and highlights the potential benefits of S gene mutants as potential immunogens.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 bearing a mutation at the S1/S2 cleavage site exhibits attenuated virulence and confers protective immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract As a physiotherapist student, I was asked by the ARS to reinforce the care team of a nursing home welcoming residents affected by Covid-19.

Both groups were administered both instruments before and after mindfulness intervention. The mindfulness program lowered anxiety levels and was effective in changing temperament dimensions: there was an increase in social orientation (SO), positive emotionality (PE), and attention (AT), as well as a decrease in inhibition to novelty (IN) and negative emotionality. Path analysis revealed that AT may promote the improvement of both SO and IN. Similarly, PE may be promoted by the decrease of IN.

METHODS: The activity of a vascular surgery unit was analysed from 8 March to 8 April 2020. Surgical activity was maintained only for acute or elective procedures obeying priority criteria. The preventive screening protocol consisted of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for all patients and physicians with symptoms and for unprotected contact infected cases, and serological physician evaluations every 15 days. Patients treated in the acute setting were considered theoretically infected and the necessary protective devices were used. The number of patients and the possible infection of physicians were evaluated. The number and type of interventions and the need for post-operative IC during this period were compared with those in the same periods in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-one interventions were performed, of which 34 (23%) were acute/emergency. The total number of interventions was similar to those performed in the same periods in 2019 and 2018: 150 (33, of which 22% acute/emergency) and 117 (29, 25% acute/emergency), respectively.

The availability of readily applicable and accessible platforms for anti\\\\retroviral (ARV) delivery is critical for the prevention of HIV acquisition through sexual transmission in both women and men. There is a compelling need for developing new topical delivery systems that have advantages over the pills, gels and rings, which currently fail to guarantee protection against mucosal viral transmission in vulnerable populations due to lack of user compliance. The silk fibroin (SF) platform offers another option that may be better suited to individual circumstances and preferences to increase efficacy through user compliance. The objective of this study was to test safety and efficacy of SF for anti\\\\HIV drug delivery to mucosal sites and for viral prevention. METHODS: We formulated a potent HIV inhibitor Griffithsin (Grft) in a mucoadhesive silk fibroin (SF) drug delivery platform and tested the application in a non\\\\human primate model in vivo and a pre\\\\clinical human cervical and colorectal tissue explant model. Both vaginal and rectal compartments were assessed in rhesus macaques (Mucaca mulatta) that received SF (n = 4), no SF (n = 7) and SF\\\\Grft (n = 11). In this study, we evaluated the composition of local microbiota, inflammatory cytokine production, histopathological changes in the vaginal and rectal compartments and mucosal protection after ex vivo SHIV challenge. RESULTS: Effective Grft release and retention in mucosal tissues from the SF\\\\Grft platform resulted in protection against HIV in human cervical and colorectal tissue as well as against SHIV challenge in both rhesus macaque vaginal and rectal tissues. Mucoadhesion of SF\\\\Grft inserts did not cause any inflammatory responses or changes in local microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that in vivo delivery of SF\\\\Grft in rhesus macaques fully protects against SHIV challenge ex vivo after two hours of application and is safe to use in both the vaginal and rectal compartments.

The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of late thrombotic complications (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, new-onset vascular access thrombosis) in maintenance hemodialysis patients after recovery from COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 200 prevalent hemodialysis patients in our center at the start of the pandemic. We excluded incident patients after the cohort entry date and those who required hemodialysis for acute kidney injury, and excluded patients with less than 1 month follow-up due to kidney transplantation or death from non-thrombotic causes. FINDINGS: One-hundred and eighty five prevalent hemodialysis patients finally met the inclusion criteria; 37 patients (17.6%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection, out of which 10 (27%) died during the acute phase of disease without evidence of thrombotic events. There was an increased risk of thrombotic events in COVID-19 survivors compared to the non-infected cohort (18.5% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.002) after a median follow-up of 7 months.

Parents and caregivers lacked access to well-established tools to identify risk and protective factors while also experiencing decreased access to treatment options to meet their families' behavioral health needs. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of known pediatric behavioral health risk factors and parents' reports of workplace productivity. METHODS A clinical research team at Brightline-a virtual, pediatric behavioral health solution-drew on standardized instruments to create a survey designed to understand pediatric behavioral health conditions, child stress, and family resilience and connection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariable linear regression was used to characterize the relationship between these variables and parents' reports of workplace productivity. RESULTS Participants (n=361) completed the survey between October 2020 and November 2021. In the multivariable model, higher pediatric stress and time spent managing children's behavioral health needs were associated with greater productivity loss among working parents, whereas higher family connection was associated with lower productivity loss. COVID-19 diagnoses among parents and dependents, financial impact of COVID-19 on households, and family resilience were not associated with parents' workplace productivity. CONCLUSIONS This survey captured child stress, family connection, and productivity as reported by parents and caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploratory studies are the first-step in understanding the relationship between these variables. Results from this study can empower parents by providing insights to help manage their child's behavioral health concerns and identify pediatric behavioral health services to aid working parents who are caregivers.

However, some kinds of images that would be relevant in clinical psychology research are not available, especially for small animal phobias. The aim of the present study is to validate a set of animal images that includes images of cockroaches, which are not present in the current sets of images. Two hundred and forty images depicting five types of animals (cockroaches, spiders, snakes, cats, and butterflies) were collected from online public domains. Four hundred and twenty-four participants (72.9% women) took part in the study rating the images in two affective dimensions (i.e., valence and arousal). Cockroach pictures were rated as significantly more unpleasant than pictures of spiders, snakes, butterflies, and cats. Moreover, results revealed that women rated cockroach, spider, and snake pictures as more negative than men did. Also, women in comparison with men rated cockroach images as more arousing. The results highlight the importance of using images of cockroaches, due to their high negative valence, which even exceeds that of snakes and spiders, the unpleasant animals typically used in phobic research.

METHODS: We analysed the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry (from 24 March 2020 to 12 April 2021). We investigated b/tsDMARD use for RA at the clinical onset of COVID-19 (baseline): abatacept (ABA), rituximab (RTX), Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), interleukin 6 inhibitors (IL-6i) or tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi, reference group). The ordinal COVID-19 severity outcome was (1) no hospitalisation, (2) hospitalisation without oxygen, (3) hospitalisation with oxygen/ventilation or (4) death. We used ordinal logistic regression to estimate the OR (odds of being one level higher on the ordinal outcome) for each drug class compared with TNFi, adjusting for potential baseline confounders. RESULTS: Of 2869 people with RA (mean age 56.7 years, 80.8% female) on b/tsDMARD at the onset of COVID-19, there were 237 on ABA, 364 on RTX, 317 on IL-6i, 563 on JAKi and 1388 on TNFi. Overall, 613 (21%) were hospitalised and 157 (5.5%) died. RTX (OR 4.15, 95% CI 3.16 to 5.44) and JAKi (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.65) were each associated with worse COVID-19 severity compared with TNFi. There were no associations between ABA or IL6i and COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: People with RA treated with RTX or JAKi had worse COVID-19 severity than those on TNFi. The strong association of RTX and JAKi use with poor COVID-19 outcomes highlights prioritisation of risk mitigation strategies for these people.","output":"Associations of baseline use of biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs with COVID-19 severity in rheumatoid arthritis: Results from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with established cardiovascular diseases have a poor prognosis when affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Also, the cardiovascular system, especially the heart, is affected by COVID-19. So we aimed to evaluate the angiographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients presented by ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). RESULTS: Our retrospective study showed that STEMI patients with COVID-19 had elevated inflammatory markers with mean of their CRP (89.69  30.42 mg/dl) and increased laboratory parameters of thrombosis with mean D-dimer (660.15  360.11 ng/ml). In 69.2% of patients, STEMI was the first clinical presentation and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 developed during the hospital stay; about one third of patients had a non-obstructive CAD, while patients with total occlusion had a high thrombus burden. CONCLUSION: STEMI may be the initial presentation of COVID-19. A non-obstructive CAD was found in about one third of patients; on the other hand, in patients who had a total occlusion of their culprit artery, the thrombus burden was high. Identification of the underlying mechanism responsible for the high thrombus burden in these patients is important as it may result in changes in their primary management strategy, either primary PCI, fibrinolytic therapy, or a pharmaco-invasive strategy.

Titles and abstracts were screened, and then the full-text of articles that met study criteria were reviewed. We identified 24 studies that studied barriers to CR participation in women and 31 studies that assessed the impact of various interventions to improve CR referral, enrollment, and/or completion of CR in women. Patient-level barriers included lower education level, multiple comorbid conditions, non-English native language, lack of social support, and high burden of family responsibilities. We found support for the use of automatic referral and assisted enrollment to improve CR participation. A small number of studies suggest that incentive-based strategies, as well as home-based programs, may contribute to improving CR attendance and completion rates. A systematic approach to CR referral, including automatic CR referral, may help overcome barriers to CR referral in women and should be implemented in clinical practice.

This elicits questions on the level of preparedness and capacity of health systems to respond to emergencies relative to other parts of the world. METHODS: This cross-sectional study uses publicly available core health data for 53 African countries to determine risk factors for cumulative COVID-19 deaths and cases per million in all countries in the continent. Descriptive statistics were determined for the indicators, and a negative binomial regression was used for modelling the risk factors. RESULTS: In sub-Saharan Africa, an increase in the number of nursing and midwifery personnel decreased the risk of COVID-19 deaths (p=0.0178), while a unit increase in universal healthcare (UHC) index of service coverage and prevalence of insufficient physical activity among adults increased the risk of COVID-19 deaths (p=0.0432 and p=0.0127). An increase in the proportion of infants initiating breast feeding reduced the number of cases per million (p<0.0001), while an increase in higher healthy life expectancy at birth increased the number of cases per million (p=0.0340). CONCLUSION: Despite its limited resources, Africa's preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic can be improved by identifying and addressing specific gaps in the funding of health services delivery. These gaps impact negatively on service delivery in Africa, which requires more nursing personnel and increased UHC coverage to mitigate the effects of COVID-19.","output":"Factors associated with COVID-19 infections and mortality in Africa: a cross-sectional study using publicly available data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How social norms are formed likely has a bearing on the mechanisms underlying their effects on behavioral outcomes.

METHODS: Clinical procedures were simulated in cadaveric heads whose oral and nasal cavities were coated with fluorescent tracer (vitamin B2) and breathing was manually simulated through retrograde intubation. A cascade impactor placed adjacent to the nares collected generated particles with aerodynamic diameters &#8804;14.1 m. The 3D printed models and syringes were used to simulate middle and external ear suctioning as well as open suctioning, respectively. Provider's personal protective equipment (PPE) and procedural field contamination were also recorded for all trials using vitamin B2 fluorescent tracer. RESULTS: The positive controls of nebulized vitamin B2 produced aerosol particles &#8804;3.30 m and endonasal drilling of a 3D model generated particles &#8804;14.1 m. As compared with positive controls, aerosols and small droplets with aerodynamic diameter &#8804;14.1 m were not detected during rigid nasal endoscopy, flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, and rigid nasal suction of cadavers with simulated breathing. There was minimal to no field contamination in all 3 scenarios. Middle and external ear suctioning and open container suctioning did not result in any detectable droplet contamination. The clinic suction unit contained all fluorescent material without surrounding environmental contamination. CONCLUSION: While patients' coughing and sneezing may create a baseline risk for providers, this study demonstrates that nasal endoscopy, flexible laryngoscopy, and suctioning inherently do not pose an additional risk in terms of aerosol and small droplet generation.

Transmission rates following primary maternal infection occur at rates of 30-40%, however reported placental rates upon non-primary maternal infection is reported to be less than <4%. There is significant debate about whether this reduction in transmission rate is due to pre-existing maternal immunity, which could identify possible immunologic targets for vaccines. To address this question, we performed a systemic review of the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We identified cohort studies in high CMV seroprevalent (>80%) areas or in developing regions that examined a cohort of at least 50 infants for congenital CMV acquisition. We identified 19 articles that met criteria and were further categorized based on pre-conception serology, maternal seroprevalence, or previously known seroprevalence. Birth prevalence rates ranged from 0.4% to 6% (median 1.1%), with the studies reporting on clinical outcome (16/19 studies) noting the majority of infected infants as asymptomatic. We also utilized a recent study that differentiated primary maternal infections from chronic infections in a highly seropositive population to calculate a placental transmission rate in women with pre-existing immunity compared to that of no pre-existing immunity. This work confirms a low cCMV birth prevalence in highly seropositive populations, indicates via a calculated placental transmission rate that the CMV placental transmission rate is lower in non-primary infection than that of primary infection, and reveals gaps in data for further research aiming to identify targets for vaccine development.","output":"Impact of Maternal Immunity on Congenital Cytomegalovirus Birth Prevalence and Infant Outcomes: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early reports suggest that tocilizumab, an IL6 receptor-blocking antibody used to manage toxicities associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, may help control cytokine storms in people infected with COVID-19.

METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, people with MS were randomly allocated to participate in a 6-week tailored web-based educational lifestyle program or 6-week generic standard-care educational course, and were blinded to their allocation. Participants were recruited through multiple sclerosis (MS) Societies in four countries: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. The primary outcome was to assess acceptability of the program defined as percentage completion of all modules at 6-weeks post-course commencement. Secondary outcomes included evaluating participant responses to the follow-up survey across three domains: accessibility, learnability, and desirability.

Using the 2014 EU-SILC Module on material deprivation, we identify five areas of child deprivation based on the EU-MODA approach: nutrition, clothing, education, leisure, and social life. In the case of Italy, our main results indicate that, compared to children from two-parent households, children of single mothers with a low level of education have a higher risk of nutrition and clothing deprivation. In Spain, living in a single-parent household is associated with a higher risk of deprivation in terms of social life for those children whose mothers do not have a high level of education.

METHODS: Madin Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells, Bovine Turbinate (BT) cells, and Human Rectal Tumor-18 (HRT-18) cells were used as in vitro culture systems for BVDV, BRSV and BCV, respectively. Cytotoxicity was established using serial dilutions of oleandrin or PBI-05204. Noncytotoxic concentrations of each drug were used either prior to or at 12 h and 24 h following virus exposure to corresponding viruses. Infectious virus titers were determined following each treatment. RESULTS: Both oleandrin as well as PBI-05204 demonstrated strong antiviral activity against BVDV, BRSV, and BCV, in a dose-dependent manner, when added prior to or following infection of host cells. Determination of viral loads by PCR demonstrated a concentration dependent decline in virus replication. Importantly, the relative ability of virus produced from treated cultures to infect new host cells was reduced by as much as 10,000-fold at noncytotoxic concentrations of oleandrin or PBI-05204.

We first use representative German business survey data to analyze the impact of the reform on German firms. Many firms with substantial US revenues or capacities in the USA intend to expand US investment in response to the reform, in particular large firms and manufacturing companies. The effects on investment in Germany are ambiguous: While some firms substitute between investment locations, others expand in both countries. We subsequently extend our analysis to a global level using worldwide survey data.

These disparities persisted during the B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant surges during late 2021 and early 2022 (1,2). Rural populations tend to be older (aged 65 years) and uninsured and are more likely to have underlying medical conditions and live farther from facilities that provide tertiary medical care, placing them at higher risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes (2). To better understand COVID-19 vaccination disparities between urban and rural populations, CDC analyzed county-level vaccine administration data among persons aged 5 years who received their first dose of either the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine or a single dose of the Ad.26.COV2.S (Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) COVID-19 vaccine during December 14, 2020-January 31, 2022, in 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC). COVID-19 vaccination coverage with 1 doses in rural areas (58.5%) was lower than that in urban counties (75.4%) overall, with similar patterns across age groups and sex. Coverage with 1 doses varied among states: 46 states had higher coverage in urban than in rural counties, one had higher coverage in rural than in urban counties. Three states and DC had no rural counties; thus, urban-rural differences could not be assessed. COVID-19 vaccine primary series completion was higher in urban than in rural counties. However, receipt of booster or additional doses among primary series recipients was similarly low between urban and rural counties. Compared with estimates from a previous study of vaccine coverage among adults aged 18 years during December 14, 2020-April 10, 2021, these urban-rural disparities among those now eligible for vaccination (aged 5 years) have increased more than twofold through January 2022, despite increased availability and access to COVID-19 vaccines.

The authors reported a series of patients with AVMs in SMG IV and V who underwent a surgical paradigm of endovascular embolization and simultaneous microsurgical resection based on the one-staged hybrid operation. Methods: Participants in the multicenter prospective clinical trial (NCT03774017) between January 2016 and December 2019 were enrolled. Patients who received endovascular embolization plus microsurgical resection (EE+MRS) and those who received intraoperative digital subtraction angiography plus microsurgical resection (iDSA+MRS) were divided into two groups. Information on clinical features, operative details, and clinical outcomes were extracted from the database. Deterioration of neurological deficits (DNDs) was defined as the primary outcome, which represented neurological outcomes. The time of microsurgical operation and blood loss were defined as the secondary outcomes representing microsurgical risks and difficulties. Outcomes and technical details were compared between groups. Results: Thirty-eight cases (male: female = 23:15) were enrolled, with 24 cases in the EE+MRS group and 14 in the iDSA+MRS group. Five cases (13.2%) were in SMG V and 33 cases (86.8%) were in SMG IV. Fourteen cases (36.8%) underwent the paradigm of microsurgical resection plus intraoperative DSA. Twenty-four cases (63.2%, n = 24) underwent the paradigm of endovascular embolization plus simultaneous microsurgical resection. Degradations of SMG were achieved in 15 cases. Of the cases, two cases got the residual nidus detected via intraoperative DSA and resected. Deterioration of neurological deficits occurred in 23.7% of cases (n = 9) when discharged, and in 13.5, 13.5, 8.1% of cases at the follow-ups of 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, without significant difference between groups (P > 0.05). Intracranial hemorrhagic complications were reported in three cases (7.9%) of the EE+MRS group only. The embolization did not significantly affect the surgical time and intraoperative blood loss. The subtotal embolization or the degradation of size by 2 points resulted in no DNDs. Conclusions: The paradigms based on the one-staged hybrid operation were practical and effective in treating high-grade AVMs. Appropriate intraoperative embolization could help decrease operative risks and difficulties and improve neurological outcomes.","output":"Comparison of Endovascular Embolization Plus Simultaneous Microsurgical Resection vs. Primary Microsurgical Resection for High-Grade Brain Arteriovenous Malformations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with altered sensory processing and perception. Scalp recordings of electrical brain activity time-locked to sensory events (event-related potentials; ERPs) provide precise information on the time-course of related altered neural activity, and can be used to model the cortical loci of the underlying neural networks. Establishing the test-retest reliability of these sensory brain responses in ASD is critical to their use as biomarkers of neural dysfunction in this population. METHODS: EEG and behavioral data were acquired from 33 children diagnosed with ASD aged 6C9.4 years old, while they performed a child-friendly task at two different time-points, separated by an average of 5.2 months. In two blocked conditions, participants responded to the occurrence of an auditory target that was either preceded or not by repeating visual stimuli. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess test-retest reliability of measures of sensory (auditory and visual) ERPs and performance, for the two experimental conditions. To assess the degree of reliability of the variability of responses within individuals, this analysis was performed on the variance of the measurements, in addition to their means. This yielded a total of 24 measures for which ICCs were calculated. RESULTS: The data yielded significant good ICC values for 10 of the 24 measurements. These spanned across behavioral and ERPs data, experimental conditions, and mean as well as variance measures. Measures of the visual evoked responses accounted for a disproportionately large number of the significant ICCs; follow-up analyses suggested that the contribution of a greater number of trials to the visual compared to the auditory ERP partially accounted for this. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis reveals that sensory ERPs and related behavior can be highly reliable across multiple measurement time-points in ASD. The data further suggest that the inter-trial and inter-participant variability reported in the ASD literature likely represents replicable individual participant neural processing differences. The stability of these neuronal readouts supports their use as biomarkers in clinical and translational studies on ASD. Given the minimum interval between test/retest sessions across our cohort, we also conclude that for the tested age-range of ~ 6 to 9.4 years, these reliability measures are valid for at least a 3-month interval. Limitations related to EEG task demands and study length in the context of a clinical trial are considered.

In this paper, we derive necessary conditions on the coherence between the treatment variable of interest and the unmeasured confounder that ensure the causal effect of the treatment is estimable. We specify our model and assumptions in the spectral domain to allow for different degrees of confounding at different spatial resolutions. The key assumption that ensures identifiability is that confounding present at global scales dissipates at local scales. We show that this assumption in the spectral domain is equivalent to adjusting for global-scale confounding in the spatial domain by adding a spatially smoothed version of the treatment variable to the mean of the response variable. Within this general framework, we propose a sequence of confounder adjustment methods that range from parametric adjustments based on the Matern coherence function to more robust semi-parametric methods that use smoothing splines.

Oxygen concentrators (OCs) can increase access to oxygen, compared to conventional oxygen cylinders. We investigated the costs and critical success factors of OCs in three hospitals in Fiji, and extrapolated these to estimate the oxygen delivery cost to all Sub-Divisional hospitals (SDH) nationwide. METHODS: Data sources included key personnel interviews, and data from SDH records, Ministry of Health and Medical Services, and a non-governmental organisation. We used Investment Logic Mapping (ILM) to define key issues. An economic case was developed to identify the investment option that optimised value while incorporating critical success factors identified through ILM. A fit-for-purpose analysis was conducted using cost analysis of four short-listed options. Sensitivity analyses were performed by altering variables to show the best or worst case scenario. All costs are presented in Fijian dollars. RESULTS: Critical success factors identifed included oxygen availability, safety, ease of use, feasibility, and affordability. Compared to the status quo of having only oxygen cylinders, an option of having a minimum number of concentrators with cylinder backup would cost $434,032 (range: $327,940 to $506,920) over 5 years which would be 55% (range: 41 to 64%) of the status quo cost.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted routine healthcare screenings and interventions. We sought to determine whether delayed screening and diagnostic workup of PCa was associated with increased rates of incident PCa, high-grade Gleason, and metastatic disease at diagnosis. Methods: We used the Corporate Data Warehouse of the Veterans Health Administration to collect PSA, prostate biopsy, PCa diagnosis, Gleason score, and metastasis information of White and Black Veterans aged 40 years or older newly diagnosed with PCa from January 2019 through June 2021. For each month, we calculated rates of PSA, prostate biopsy, and incident PCa per 100,000 men and plotted monthly rates by race. We performed descriptive analyses to compare age at first PSA, age at diagnosis, baseline PSA, Gleason scores, and metastasis pre- and post-January 2020, the month in which the U.S. declared COVID-19 a public health emergency. Results: The decrease in the rate of PSA screening immediately after January 2020 was similar in both White and Black Veterans (7% vs. 6%). However, the magnitude of reduction in the rate of prostate biopsy and the rate diagnosis of incident PCa were five times larger among Black Veterans compared to White Veterans (11% vs. 2% for both biopsy and diagnosis rates).

The nonstructural protein nsp5, also called 3C-like protease, is responsible for processing viral polyprotein precursors in coronavirus (CoV) replication. Previous studies have shown that PDCoV nsp5 cleaves the NF-&#954;B essential modulator and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 to disrupt interferon (IFN) production and signaling, respectively. Whether PDCoV nsp5 also cleaves IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), IFN-induced antiviral effector molecules, remains unclear. In this study, we screened 14 classical ISGs and found that PDCoV nsp5 cleaved the porcine mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (pDCP1A) through its protease activity. Similar cleavage of endogenous pDCP1A was also observed in PDCoV-infected cells. PDCoV nsp5 cleaved pDCP1A at glutamine 343 (Q343), and the cleaved pDCP1A fragments, pDCP1A1-343 and pDCP1A344-580, were unable to inhibit PDCoV infection. Mutant pDCP1A-Q343A, which resists nsp5-mediated cleavage, exhibited a stronger ability to inhibit PDCoV infection than wild-type pDCP1A. Interestingly, the Q343 cleavage site is highly conserved in DCP1A homologs from other mammalian species. Further analyses demonstrated that nsp5 encoded by seven tested CoVs that can infect human or pig also cleaved pDCP1A and human DCP1A, suggesting that DCP1A may be the common target for cleavage by nsp5 of mammalian CoVs.IMPORTANCE Interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) induction through IFN signaling is important to create an antiviral state and usually directly inhibits virus infection. The present study first demonstrated that PDCoV nsp5 can cleave mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (DCP1A) to attenuate its antiviral activity. Furthermore, cleaving DCP1A is a common characteristic of nsp5 proteins from different coronaviruses (CoVs), which represents a common immune evasion mechanism of CoVs. Previous evidence showed that CoV nsp5 cleaves the NF-&#954;B essential modulator and signal transducer and activator of transcription 2.

Since then most other European countries, the USA, Canada and Australia, have implemented similar restrictions, ranging from school closures, banning of recreational activities and large events, to complete lockdown.

These enzymes have a remarkable ability to cleave carotenoids at specific alkene bonds while leaving chemically similar sites within the polyene intact. Although several bacterial and eukaryotic CCDs have been characterized, the long-standing goal of experimentally visualizing a CCD-carotenoid complex at high resolution to explain this exquisite regioselectivity remains unfulfilled. CCD genes are also present in some archaeal genomes, but the encoded enzymes remain uninvestigated. Here, we address this knowledge gap through analysis of a metazoan-like archaeal CCD from Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra (NdCCD). NdCCD was active toward -apocarotenoids but did not cleave bicyclic carotenoids. It exhibited an unusual regiospecificity, cleaving apocarotenoids solely at the C14'-C13' alkene bond to produce -apo-14'-carotenals. The structure of NdCCD revealed a tapered active site cavity markedly different from the broad active site observed for the retinal-forming Synechocystis apocarotenoid oxygenase (SynACO) but similar to the vertebrate retinoid isomerase RPE65. The structure of NdCCD in complex with its apocarotenoid product demonstrated that the site of cleavage is defined by interactions along the substrate binding cleft as well as selective stabilization of reaction intermediates at the scissile alkene.

However, current evidences on ncovid-19 demonstrate that these viruses effectively spread via infected droplets, aerosols, contacts, hands and surfaces. It is transmitted between individuals. Previously, two coronaviruses infecting animals have evolved and caused outbreaks in humans i.e. SARS-cov (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS-cov (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). Coronavirus is responsible for a substantial proportion of upper respiratory tract infections. These viruses traditionally associated with dry cough, cold, shortness of breath, sore throat and fever. So, optimal treatment involves prompt diagnosis and it is slightly manageable with current technologies. Indeed, whether the clinical manifestations of coronavirus are related directly to viral pathogenicity or secondary to the host immune response is the subject of ongoing research. There are currently no approved antiviral therapies and treatment remains primarily supportive. Pharmacists are a trusted and accessible resource for the public during this public health emergency. Role of pharmacists is to ensure the availability and timely provision of the safest and most effective therapy in pandemic disease.","output":"Modest review on Human Novel Coronavirus infection (nCOVID 19) and role of clinical pharmacist in pandemic outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We tested animals from wildlife trade sites in Laos for the presence of zoonotic pathogens.
